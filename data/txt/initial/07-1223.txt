 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. BRESS:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                 The problem at the heart of this case is

11   construing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254

12   together in a way that makes sense.                      The last time that

13   this Court construed those two provisions together was

14   in Michael Williams.       Michael Williams presented a

15   different issue.

16                 But we believe that looking at how Michael

17   Williams would play out with a small change in the facts

18   will help frame the issue that's before the court today.

19                 Now, as the Court recalls, in Michael

20   Williams the Virginia Supreme Court denied Williams the

21   investigative assistance he needed in order to help

22   develop a claim based on his suspicions of jury

23   misconduct.    He, therefore, didn't make the claim in

24   State court.

25                 On -- in Federal court he got investigative


                                         3

 1   assistance; and, in speaking with the investigator, two

 2   of the jurors referred to the foreperson, Bonnie

 3   Stinette, as Bonnie Minehart.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:         Mr. Bress, before we get

 5   into that, could I just ask you a threshold question?

 6   We took this case to decide a question, and one of the

 7   factual predicates of the question is that the State

 8   court refused to consider certain evidence.                 And I'm

 9   puzzled about that.

10                What was the evidence that the State court

11   -- do you say that the State court refused to consider

12   evidence that was proffered to it?

13                MR. BRESS:      No, Your Honor.            The State court

14   did not refuse to consider evidence proffered to it.

15   The State court refused to permit the full development

16   of the evidence.   And it -- I mean it misled the court

17   --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I didn't hear the -- the

19   last part.

20                MR. BRESS:      The State court refused to

21   permit the evidence to be fully developed, Your Honor.

22   They didn't refuse to consider evidence.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:            What do you mean by that?

24   What specifically did they --

25                MR. BRESS:      Specifically, Your Honor, the


                                        4

 1   State provided 120 days to develop the State habeas

 2   petition.     The Petitioners during that time developed 14

 3   different claims, including the claim that's at issue

 4   here today.

 5                 In the course of that they interviewed, I

 6   think, 11 different witnesses.                For the ineffective-

 7   assistance-of-counsel claim they got affidavits.               They

 8   also interviewed all 12 jurors for five different claims

 9   of juror misconduct.        They interviewed five different

10   witnesses for Brady claims, et cetera.

11                 They ran out of time, Your Honor, and they

12   asked the court for more time on repeated occasions.

13   They asked the court to investigate --

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:          But that really does not

15   present the question that you asked the Court to decide.

16                 MR. BRESS:       Well, Your Honor, if you read it

17   that way, it would not, but I don't read the question

18   presented that way.       I read the question presented to

19   present the question of when the district court properly

20   hears evidence after a finding of diligence by the

21   prisoner and holds that the State court didn't provide a

22   full and fair opportunity to that prisoner to develop

23   the facts in State court, that where the evidence is

24   important the -- the district court may consider that

25   evidence, rather than giving deference to the State

 1   court.

 2                 And giving deference to the State court is

 3   not even on the table any longer in this case.                   It was

 4   -- what the Fourth Circuit did, the Fourth Circuit took

 5   the new evidence into account and deferred to the State

 6   court nonetheless.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why wouldn't he have

 8   brought that new evidence to the attention of the State

 9   court first?    Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the

10   attention of the State court?

11                 MR. BRESS:       He didn't have the new evidence,

12   Your Honor.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, he could have a

14   post-conviction proceeding in the State court.

15                 MR. BRESS:       Actually, no, he couldn't, Your

16   Honor.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             A State habeas.

18                 MR. BRESS:       I'm sorry.            The -- as the

19   Virginia Commonwealth attorneys point out in their

20   amicus brief, there is a rule in the Virginia State

21   court that any facts not set out in the habeas petition

22   at the State level can't be brought in later.                   He wasn't

23   able to bring the facts in afterwards.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, weren't the

25   facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was


                                          6

 1   before the State court?

 2                 MR. BRESS:      No, they weren't, Your Honor.

 3   There were three categories of new facts or new evidence

 4   that came in on Federal habeas.

 5                 And if I may, the first -- the first of them

 6   had to do with facts that undermined the State's claim

 7   of aggravation.    The State relied on only one

 8   aggravating factor.      That was future dangerousness.              And

 9   in the course of that, in developing it, their number

10   one emphasis was on one adjudicated -- unadjudicated bad

11   act, and this was a story told by Billy Jo Swartz about

12   an alleged horrific assault on her and of Tracy

13   Nicholson, who was a girlfriend of the Petitioner.

14                 What the jury didn't know at the time was

15   that both Tracy and her mother, who were there, said

16   that the incident did not occur, that there was no

17   assault there, and Billy Jo Swartz was a liar.

18                 Now, on State habeas, Joanne did submit an

19   affidavit and, in that affidavit, said that Billy Jo

20   Swartz had lied.    That created a dispute of fact at the

21   State level, but unfortunately rather than hear the

22   witnesses to determine the credibility and -- the

23   Virginia Supreme Court instead decided against

24   Petitioner.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I think that


                                         7

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was

 2   cumulative.    There was a dispute on that issue.             There

 3   was evidence on both sides.               And now you say, hey, we've

 4   got more evidence.

 5                 MR. BRESS:       Well, it's not more evidence,

 6   Your Honor; it's just that a dispute over the facts

 7   where credibility is at issue shouldn't be decided on

 8   the papers.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the Virginia Supreme

10   Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true

11   all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them.               They said

12   specifically "all facts alleged in the petition will be

13   taken as true."

14                 MR. BRESS:       And if they had done that, Your

15   Honor, I think that we'd be in a different position.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They said they did.

17                 MR. BRESS:       They said, on the one hand, they

18   did, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking,

19   for example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said

20   she could have been effectively impeached by other

21   statements that she had made, that in their household,

22   she had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her

23   daughter.   Now, Joanne Nicholson and Tracy Nicholson

24   have said throughout that he was never physically

25   abusive to Tracy.     The supposed impeachment would have


                                          8

 1   come from police court records that have never been

 2   introduced in this case.         So the Virginia Supreme Court,

 3   without a hearing, just said, on the one hand, we accept

 4   these facts as true and, on the other hand, even though

 5   Joanne Nicholson would testify that this event never

 6   occurred that way, she would have been impeached so the

 7   jury wouldn't have believed it.

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, your argument is

 9   dependent on the proposition that the claim that was

10   advanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different

11   claim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in

12   the State court?

13              MR. BRESS:        That's right, Your Honor.

14              JUSTICE ALITO:           And if that's the case, I

15   don't understand why your adversary is not correct that

16   it will always be possible in capital cases for an

17   ineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been

18   adjudicated on the merits in the State court to be

19   advanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where

20   every aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially

21   favorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation.

22   You know, when your firm with all of its expertise and

23   resources comes into the case at the Federal habeas

24   level, will it not always be the case that you will be

25   able to find some additional mitigation evidence and


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it

 2   well get de novo review?

 3              MR. BRESS:       I'd like to answer that

 4   question, Justice Alito, in two ways:                  One very

 5   practical, which is that the Ninth and Tenth Circuits

 6   have adopted the rule that we advocated for years.                    The

 7   Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have adopted that

 8   rule for Brady claims, and we haven't seen the flood

 9   that supposedly is going to come through the gates.

10              Secondly, on a more theoretical level, for

11   someone to be able to introduce this new evidence on

12   Federal habeas, they have to first be able to

13   demonstrate that they were diligent in attempting

14   formulate it in the State court.              Second, they've got to

15   be able to demonstrate that it's important and

16   importantly changes the overall factual mix.                 Now --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I don't get the diligence

18   part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel

19   is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's

20   counsel that's been ineffective.

21              MR. BRESS:       Your Honor, I'm referring to

22   Michael Williams, which talks about diligence by the

23   State habeas counsel.

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So, it doesn't translate

25   into ineffective assistance of counsel because the


                                      10
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not

 2   been diligent, but there is nothing that the client

 3   could do.     I just don't see how --

 4                 MR. BRESS:       Well --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- how you could talk

 6   about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up

 7   the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.

 8                 MR. BRESS:       Your Honor, we understand and

 9   appreciate the diligence of habeas counsel is not any

10   kind of excuse and can't be -- statutorily it can't be,

11   actually under 2554, but what we are talking about is

12   whether the prisoner and his counsel were diligent in

13   seeking to develop the facts for their claim when they

14   were on State habeas.        That's what Michael Williams had

15   to do with it.    Michael Williams equated diligence with

16   reasonable efforts and said that the contrary would be

17   negligence.

18                 In this case we've got a finding by the

19   district court that Bell and his lawyers were diligent

20   in seeking to develop their ineffective assistance of

21   counsel claim at State habeas.                And that's what allows

22   them under (e), that's what says that they didn't fail

23   to develop the evidence under (e)(2) and allows them to

24   go through the gate of (e).

25                 Now, in order to get here, you have to


                                         11
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   demonstrate that diligence.           You also have to

 2   demonstrate that you're able to develop new facts that

 3   matter, that are important, that are significant.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you use the -- to say

 5   that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be,

 6   right, but it's such an extraordinary use of "claim."                      I

 7   mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a

 8   tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional

 9   evidence in support of the basic claim.                    The basic claim

10   is ineffective assistance of counsel.

11              MR. BRESS:       Your Honor, I appreciate that

12   it's not "claim" as it's used ordinarily in the Rules of

13   Civil Procedure or when you're talking about making

14   claims in that sort of a complaint.                    However, this

15   Court, including an opinion -- Banks v. Dretke, for

16   example, talked about the two different Brady claims in

17   that case as separate claims, even though they were

18   withholdings by the same prosecutor.                    More closely even,

19   in Michael Williams, there were two separate

20   withholdings of evidence to impeach the same witness.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.           So I'm trying

22   to figure out how the statute works.

23              MR. BRESS:       Yes.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:            And it seems to me that the

25   way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way,

 1   the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen?

 2   No?   Okay.   Forget that.         I was going to shorthand that

 3   because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking

 4   of.

 5                 What happens is that the -- the State court

 6   now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and

 7   you don't prevail.      All right.            Now, he goes into

 8   Federal court and he has some new facts.                  Now, either

 9   they are such that they transform the claim and it's a

10   new claim.    I mean, in that case there is an argument

11   for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't.                  Now, if

12   they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge,

13   is go look and decide on the basis of what they

14   presented to the State.          That's the end of it.

15                 Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust.

16   You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other

17   new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see

18   if there was cause and prejudice.                  And that's how it's

19   supposed to work.     And if there was cause and prejudice,

20   then you have the hearing.            Okay?        That's how it's

21   supposed to work factually.

22                 I have no idea if that's what went on here,

23   but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some

24   confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in

25   the State.    Then there is some other thing that this

 1   might be the same claim.          I mean, I don't see how we get

 2   to the question we took this case to decide, frankly,

 3   without knowing what the basis was and whether it was

 4   correct for the district court to give him any hearing

 5   at all.

 6                MR. BRESS:       Okay, Your Honor.          I'd like to

 7   address that.    I think that that's essentially how this

 8   works in this case.      What the district -- what the

 9   district court did here is it first made a finding of

10   was there diligence?       Because it has to do that under

11   Michael Williams to even take the next step.               Did the

12   Petitioner --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the first step.       The

14   first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go

15   ahead.

16                MR. BRESS:       Right.         But it had to take that

17   step.    And it had to take that step, by the way, of

18   course, with (d) in mind as well, because this Court in

19   Schriro said there is no reason to have hearing if it is

20   separately precluded by another predicate.               In Schriro,

21   obviously, it was the refusal to -- to allow mitigating

22   evidence.    So it does that.           Then it determines

23   separately under Townsend, was there a problem in State

24   court that -- did you have a full and fair hearing, and

25   if you can prove the facts that you state, would you


                                        14

 1   win, and so those allowed the court the discretion to

 2   hold a hearing.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why wouldn't you say

 4   right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State

 5   court, and exhausts it?

 6              MR. BRESS:       Well this couldn't have been

 7   presented in the State court.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:            Why not?

 9              MR. BRESS:       Well as the State argued below,

10   it would have been procedurally deficient.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, no.      Suppose we

12   have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want

13   the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered

14   this, because the first time that the district attorney

15   opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after.

16   So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have

17   gotten; no one disputes it.           Where, that kind of

18   thing -- I think he would have to present it to the

19   State court, wouldn't he?

20              MR. BRESS:       Well, Your Honor, according to

21   the warden at least, in this case if you took let's say

22   the facts of Banks v Dretke, which this Court decided,

23   where when you were in front of the State court, what

24   you knew was that the girlfriend of the prisoner had

25   said that one of the witnesses was particularly close to


                                      15

 1   law enforcement, and on that basis they made a claim, a

 2   Brady claim in State court.            It was denied because it

 3   wasn't factually developed enough, all right?

 4               So they went to Federal court and in Federal

 5   court they got a lot more evidence that supported that

 6   claim.   They actually found out that in fact this person

 7   was a Government informant, and on that basis this Court

 8   found cause and prejudice and addressed that that

 9   claim --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, you must have been

11   assuming then that the State would not give that person

12   a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.

13               MR. BRESS:       Well, that's absolutely true --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose it were really new.

15               MR. BRESS:       The State statute is

16   unequivocal.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, but so is it in

18   Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where

19   you could bring the thing up because you couldn't

20   possibly have gotten over it.

21               MR. BRESS:       Your Honor, there is no

22   exception here in Virginia.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            So in Virginia a person

24   discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at

25   the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the


                                       16

 1   whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something

 2   unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under

 3   Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?

 4               MR. BRESS:       Not in this sort of a claim.

 5   No, Your Honor, there isn't.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Bress, your --

 7   you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes

 8   that it is a new claim rather than the same claim,

 9   right?   Because if it were just the same claim then the

10   question would be it is simply cumulative rather than

11   new?

12               MR. BRESS:       If it's the same claim for

13   2254(d) purposes, yes, Your Honor.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.   And I guess

15   it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question.                  We usually

16   don't consider claims different if there is just new

17   evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily

18   determine that this was the same claim in deciding to

19   defer to the State court findings?

20               MR. BRESS:       Yes, it did, Your Honor.             The

21   Fourth Circuit viewed this as the same claim and that's

22   the root of some of our disagreement with them.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And if fact you got

24   more than you were entitled to, because it did look at

25   the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference,


                                       17

 1   but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.

 2                 MR. BRESS:      Your Honor.                We would agree that

 3   that -- that interim solution is not a plausible

 4   solution, so we would agree with that, on the new

 5   evidence --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if we think that

 7   they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting

 8   away from the question presented -- if we agree that

 9   they are right, that this is the same claim and it's

10   just additional evidence, then you lose.

11                 MR. BRESS:      No, not necessarily, Your Honor.

12   We also argued on separate grounds where the State's

13   procedure is inadequate, then the -- the State's

14   application of -- of Federal law would have been

15   unreasonable.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Mr. Bress, may I ask you a

17   question --

18                 MR. BRESS:      And if that's true --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           May I ask you a question

20   which sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue

21   here, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question.

22   But --

23                 MR. BRESS:      Sure.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- my understanding is that

25   in the United States District Court on the Federal habe


                                        18
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based

 2   on the evidence before it, no deference to the State

 3   court, that in fact your client did not demonstrate

 4   prejudice.     And my understanding is that that --

 5   although the Fourth Circuit did not rely upon that, my

 6   understanding is that that -- that finding remains

 7   undisturbed.    Is that correct?

 8                MR. BRESS:        Your Honor, what the district

 9   court found, as the Fourth Circuit saw it and as we see

10   it, was that the State court's finding of prejudice was

11   not unreasonable.     Now, I acknowledge that when you read

12   the district court's oral ruling you won't see a

13   reference to 2254(d).

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:             No.

15                MR. BRESS:        However, when you look at what

16   the State court wrote in its written ruling, what it

17   says is there is a colorable claim that the State court

18   was unreasonable, on -- in application of law to the

19   facts and development of the facts, and then it said

20   that they will -- that the court would not decide this

21   issue yet, until it has a hearing; and so the Fourth

22   Circuit looked at what the district court wrote and

23   presumed that consistent with what it had written, it

24   then confronted this issue, the issue of reasonability,

25   orally; and it didn't require that when a judge is


                                         19
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   saying something orally, as opposed to putting it in a

 2   written opinion, that it dot every i and cross every t.

 3   It assumed that it meant what it had said earlier.              If

 4   this Court has any doubt about that, however, it could

 5   certainly remand with instructions.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I that what it was saying

 7   is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question.

 8   Strickland has two parts.           Part A is were counsel

 9   inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference?

10   It seemed to me the district court was just making a

11   straight out Strickland determination and not deferring

12   to anything else.     It was just saying no, I've looked at

13   all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they

14   were not effective.      On the other hand, there is no

15   prejudice because using the strict Strickland test,

16   there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would

17   have come out differently.

18              MR. BRESS:         Your Honor, consistent with the

19   Fourth Circuit, we don't read him to say that.             But even

20   if he meant that, the Fourth Circuit certainly on --

21   looked at this from a reasonableness standpoint, and not

22   from a de novo standpoint.           So even had the district

23   court meant a de novo review and engaged in it, we still

24   didn't get the correct standard or review on appeal.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Oh, that may be.   I didn't

 1   mean to imply you didn't have a Fourth Circuit question.

 2   I -- I guess I was raising a question to whether it is

 3   wise to make this the case to decide the Fourth Circuit

 4   issue.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Bress, this case

 6   involves Section 2254(d), right?               Does that appear

 7   somewhere in the briefs?         It would be nice to have it in

 8   front of me.

 9               MR. BRESS:       Yes, Your Honor.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, it's a central

11   thing the case is about.         I cannot find it in any of the

12   briefs.   Appendix to the petition for cert; I got -- I

13   got to go back to that.        Don't you think it's important

14   enough to be in your brief?

15               MR. BRESS:       If I may return to the Chief

16   Judge's -- Chief Justice's question from earlier, there

17   are other new claims, new facts here that are equally

18   important in deciding whether this is a new claim.                  For

19   example, physical child abuse first came into this case,

20   and really was first discovered --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I know, but they're

22   -- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of

23   new evidence, that somehow changes the claim.                 And

24   again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble

25   getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's


                                       21
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   problematic in this area where there is always new

 2   evidence.

 3                You're looking at someone's childhood.                   You

 4   can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going

 5   either way, that you know, this was unusual because he

 6   was a good child, or this is excused because he had such

 7   a bad upbringing.

 8                MR. BRESS:       Mr. Chief Justice, two responses

 9   to this.    Number one -- and you know, as I've said

10   before, this Court has used claim I think in similar

11   ways.   It may have been colloquial but it at least

12   demonstrates that it can use it.

13                I'm not saying it's the most normal, or the

14   ordinary course definition, but I am saying that it's

15   the definition that's necessary to read (d) and (e)

16   together in a way that makes sense; and if I can just

17   explain why I think that's true.

18                If you look at (e), (e) says that you can

19   get a hearing even if you weren't diligent in State

20   court, if the facts that you need to develop were not

21   reasonably available in State court and if they would

22   prove by clear and convincing evidence that you are

23   innocent.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 All right, well

25   just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one.                    The


                                        22

 1   fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present

 2   the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you

 3   get the evidence you have a new claim.                 It just means

 4   that they are going to let you raise a claim you could

 5   have raised before.

 6               MR. BRESS:       Well, if what they are talking

 7   about is -- if that includes the ability when you are in

 8   State court -- assume, for instance, House versus Bell,

 9   just if can take that as an example.

10               I'm sorry, Your Honor.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I've gotten over it.

12               MR. BRESS:       I don't know, but if we can --

13   if we can just look at the facts of that case briefly:

14   Assume that in State court, despite diligent a effort,

15   they were able to come up with some of the evidence but

16   not all of the evidence that they later came up with in

17   terms of the blood spattering, the DNA, and such.

18               Their claim is denied on the -- on the

19   merits because they weren't able to get much of the

20   evidence in and denied in State courts.                 They couldn't

21   go to Federal courts where they were able to bring in

22   all of that evidence, and let's say even more, enough to

23   prove by clear and convincing evidence that they were

24   innocent.

25               Under the warden's view, you'd still go back


                                      23

 1   to the State court opinion and decide whether it was

 2   intrinsically reasonable.             And so long as it is, you

 3   wouldn't -- the State court gets affirmed, and none of

 4   that new evidence of innocence comes in.

 5                 Now, I guess it's a possible solution, but

 6   the question is:      Is that what Congress really intended

 7   here?

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:             I might say the new claim

 9   -- okay, so it's a new claim.                I don't know if yours is,

10   by the way, but suppose it's a new claim.                   Then what you

11   ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust.

12   So now what you show is that that's futile.

13                 Now we get to your question before us.

14   Okay.     So it's an imaginary case.                It's less imaginary

15   in December than here.          But, anyway, the -- the -- you

16   get back to the State court.               Now, what is supposed to

17   happen?

18                 At that point I guess the statute leaves the

19   judge free to develop the facts.                  It doesn't say you

20   can't.     Okay.   So then you do it.

21                 Now we have the question, which when we took

22   this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we

23   can -- now we have the question:                  When the judge makes

25   never developed any of this in State court, fine.                   Then

 1   have -- then just do it.         If it is a regular case, don't

 2   defer it.

 3               But suppose some of the things have been in

 4   State court related to this but not others.              Now what do

 5   we do?

 6               MR. BRESS:       Well, Your Honor --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean that's not an

 8   obvious answer to that one.

 9               MR. BRESS:       I -- I think that in -- in that

10   case, by the way, you still have to defer to the State

11   factfinding.   I think you always have to when the State

12   determines particular facts.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            What it's going to do is

14   it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain

15   evidence.   And what you will have gotten your new claim

16   granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence

17   that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have

18   found it before.

19               Now what do we do?              Do we defer in part; do

20   we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?

21               MR. BRESS:       Well, I think that, again, you

22   have to defer under (e)(1) presumably to particular fact

23   findings and find that by clear and convincing evidence

24   you've disproved those facts.             But, otherwise, I don't

25   think you could find the application of law to fact.                I

 1   don't think you can under Holland, et cetera.

 2              Now, you know, just to make this a little

 3   bit clearer, hopefully, in -- in Keeney, upon which this

 4   Court drew in Michael Williams, the Court looked -- the

 5   Court did -- looked at a potential distinction between

 6   the failure properly to make a claim in State court and

 7   the failure properly to develop the facts for that

 8   claim.

 9              Now, the Court looked at that distinction in

10   the context of seeing whether cause and prejudice, which

11   applied to certainly the major claim in the State court,

12   should apply to the failure to fully develop it.           And

13   what it said is that distinguishing between those two

14   circumstances is irrational.

15              Now, I would submit that it's similarly

16   irrational to attribute to Congress the intent to

17   distinguish between the circumstances, or because of

18   these limitations you have in State court, despite your

19   effort, you weren't able to fully develop the record.

20              And the State decided the case on an

21   inadequate record.      It comes to Federal court.        Do you

22   simply defer?   I mean do you simply stop when you say

23   the State court reasonably decided this case based on an

24   inadequate State court record, or do you allow that

25   record to be fully developed and decide it on its

 1   merits?

 2                That's, I think, the issue that we are

 3   presenting today.    I'd like to reserve --

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I just ask one quick

 5   question?    The -- the answer, I take it, on -- based on

 6   what you just said, the answer to the -- the need-

 7   to-exhaust point is you don't have to exhaust because

 8   you already tried to exhaust in the State court, and

 9   they didn't give you enough time to get your evidence

10   in.   That is --

11                MR. BRESS:       That's precisely it, Your Honor.

12   Thank you.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

14   Mr. Bress.

16                ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE BURNETT

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18                MS. BURNETT:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20                The claim in Bell's case is the textbook

21   example of a claim that the effective death penalty

22   intended for 2254(d) to apply to.                 In the Virginia

23   Supreme Court, Bell presented his claim with his

24   allegations of what he says counsel didn't present and

25   didn't find at trial.       And the Virginia Supreme Court


                                        27
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   assumed the truth of all of those allegations and did

 2   not contest any of them.           There were never any facts in

 3   dispute.     The State never contested any facts.

 4                 The State court assumed them all true, and

 5   then applied -- faithfully applied this Court's

 6   established precedent under Strickland and Wiggins, in

 7   particular, and weighed that evidence that he had

 8   claimed had not been found by his counsel against the

 9   aggravating evidence in this case of a drug dealer who

10   killed premeditatedly a police officer in a small town

11   and upon weighing that found as a -- as a matter -- as a

12   de novo matter on the merits that he could not show

13   prejudice.     Because there was no reasonable probability

14   that a jury would have found a life sentence giving --

15   assuming the truth of everything he alleged.

16                 Now, when he went to Federal court, the

17   Fourth Circuit faithfully applied 2254(d) to that after

18   addressing all of the same evidence and also agreeing

19   that there was no prejudice, and then said that the

20   State court decision was not unreasonable under 2254(d).

21                 Now, Bell comes to this Court and says for

22   the first time that I have a new claim, and that was not

23   made below, and this is not a new claim.                  Everything

24   that he presented in Federal court was presented to the

25   State court.    There is absolutely no difference.                In

 1   fact, to the effect that there was some difference in

 2   the district court and the State alleged -- we pleaded

 3   default because he presented a few new affidavits.

 4              The district court resolved that and said:

 5   I'm not even going to look at those because they aren't

 6   critical to my decision.          I am only going to look at --

 7   and he described in particular the exact same record

 8   that the Virginia Supreme Court had found.               And then the

 9   district court --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, what about the

11   point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time

12   in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop

13   everything that was later put before the district court;

14   that there was a very short time to get the petition in,

15   and there were many issues other than ineffective

16   assistance of counsel?

17              MS. BURNETT:           Well, Justice Ginsburg, there

18   were approximately 12 issues in this case that the

19   district court disposed of in a very lengthy opinion.

20   It was only this one issue that the district court found

21   -- believed that he needed to have a hearing on, we

22   believe erroneously.       But, nevertheless, he had the

23   hearing and -- and listened to all the same evidence.

24              Nothing, Justice Ginsburg -- in our opinion

25   nothing prevented Bell from presenting the allegations


                                        29
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that were presented to the Federal court and all the

 2   allegations that he presented to the State court.            There

 3   was no State court procedure or denial of anything.

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Did he make any request

 5   from the State court for more time?

 6                MS. BURNETT:        Your Honor, I don't -- I don't

 7   --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Your brother is nodding

 9   yes.

10                MS. BURNETT:        He may very well have, but the

11   point is that there was nothing that he presented to the

12   Federal court that he didn't also present to the State

13   court.   So he was not prevented from -- that -- that's a

14   red herring in this case.

15                Now, he had some very strong arguments that

16   he made in both the State court and in the district

17   court on other claims; not on this claim but on other

18   claims, that he believed that he should have been able

19   to develop certain evidence.            And the district court

20   actually on those other claims -- some of them, it found

21   faulted and some not.      But not on this claim.        On this

22   claim --

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:           If we had -- if we had --

24   and I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is

25   your case.   But if we had a case in which with respect

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to the disputed issue he had asked for more time -- I'll

 2   make it easy.   He had asked for more time and -- and had

 3   -- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be

 4   followed that couldn't be followed unless he got more

 5   time and so on, and the State court refused.                     Could he

 6   then come into the Federal court and say:                     My claim here

 7   is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective

 8   assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State

 9   courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my

10   -- my ineffective assistance claim?                     And if he made a

11   colorable showing on those two issues, would he then

12   have an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and

13   would the findings that eventuated from that be subject

14   to -- in effect, to -- to being short- circuited by

15   deference to the State court findings?

16              MS. BURNETT:          I think my answer to that has

17   to be that it depends because the statute before the

18   effective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what

19   we would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which

20   would you look at the adequacy of a State court process.

21   Those were removed after 1996, so the statute does not

22   provide authority for a Federal court to go in and

23   determine was the process adequate if the decision,

24   itself, was reasonable.        Now if we are talking -- this

25   is why this case --


                                       31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But if you don't -- I guess

 2   what I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance

 3   recognize that there is a legitimately different claim

 4   which is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress,

 5   not subject to further exhaustion requirements because

 6   they tried and the State court wouldn't let them do

 7   it -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a

 8   claim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which

 9   will not be subject to deference to State court

10   findings, then there is a very clear hole in the law,

11   and I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it.            I

12   understand you're saying that is not this case.            But

13   isn't that a legitimate problem to-- to face at some

14   point.

15                MS. BURNETT:        Justice Souter, we don't

16   believe so and here's why:          Because it is true, Congress

17   did not change the procedural default doctrine.            In the

18   Effective Death Penalty Act Congress left that alone.

19   In fact, this Court recognized that in House v. Bell.

20   So when we are talking about new facts or new claims,

21   either one, you're talking about unexhausted or

22   defaulted matters, which the district courts are very

23   familiar how to handle that.            Has he shown cause and

24   prejudice?   Has he shown diligence?

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I think you're right in the


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   main.    I think that's generally correct.               The case that

 2   I'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady

 3   claim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I

 4   understand the cause and prejudice can only be

 5   established in the case we are talking about if there

 6   can be shown a probability of a different verdict.

 7                The Brady standard, however, does not

 8   require the probability of a different verdict.                    Brady

 9   uses the term "reasonable probability that there would

10   have been a different result," but that has been clearly

11   defined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility.                   So

12   that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e)

13   is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a

14   higher requirement than would have been applied before

15   Brady.    And that is the case, it seems to me, that we --

16   it may not be this case, but that's the case that we've

17   got to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine

18   here.    Isn't that a legitimate concern?

19                MS. BURNETT:         Justice Souter -- and I agree

20   that's not this case.       But this Court's already crossed

21   that bridge.    That was Michael Williams.               Michael

22   Williams was where the individual comes to Federal court

23   with brand new evidence and he has no remedy left in

24   State court.    It is defaulted, and what do we do with

25   that?    And this Court very clearly -- now, as the issue


                                        33
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was presented to this Court in that case it was whether

 2   he gets a hearing or not, so that's what was addressed.

 3   But this Court also addressed the fact that it most

 4   likely was and was a defaulted claim and that it --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But I don't, I don't think

 6   this Court understood the implication of it when you get

 7   into the Brady issue.       And my only concern is we've got

 8   to leave that door open because I don't think Williams

 9   confronted that.

10              MS. BURNETT:           And I -- I agree with Your

11   Honor that it's not this case.               I think Michael Williams

12   addresses it and I think that the current existing in

13   place cause and prejudice and actual innocence

14   exceptions to default answer all of that.                And I believe

15   that --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:              I understand your position.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:              I'm still trying to

18   understand the statute.         I think their point is we get

19   around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district

20   court here, the Federal district court, found that it

21   was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not

22   unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because

23   of the procedure.    In other words, the State that barred

24   this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and

25   therefore the determination of the facts is


                                        34
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   unreasonable.   So you're saying that isn't what those

 2   words "unreasonable determination of the facts" mean.

 3              MS. BURNETT:          Well, what I'm saying --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:             You mean you're saying that

 5   (d)(2), "unreasonable determination of the facts," means

 6   the factual outcome.      In other words, if the factual

 7   outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the

 8   procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.

 9              MS. BURNETT:          Well, no.              I believe that --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             No?     I thought you just

11   said that in answer to Justice Souter.

12              MS. BURNETT:          I believe that (d)(2) very

13   clearly -- yes, I think I'm agreeing with you that

14   (d)(2) addresses the actual facts which underlay the

15   State court decision.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:             And not whether their

17   procedures are correct?

18              MS. BURNETT:          Correct.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.

20              MS. BURNETT:          Correct.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.       So that's the first

22   thing we have to decide to get to the question.                    If your

23   wrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it --

24   if you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d).                    So

25   they say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within


                                       35
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   (a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay.

 2   They say we are rid of (e) because of that.                   Now, how

 3   they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't

 4   in the case.

 5                 MS. BURNETT:         Justice Breyer, I'm not sure

 6   they they've argued those exceptions (a)(2) at (i) and

 7   (ii).     I believe they're simply arguing --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            They're arguing due

 9   diligence.

10                 MS. BURNETT:         My reading of their brief is

11   they are saying:    We are Michael Williams and all

12   Michael Williams dealt with was the opening sentence of

13   (e)(2).

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            (I).      You mean of (e)(2) --

15                 MS. BURNETT:         Of (e)(2).

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            (E)(2).

17                 MS. BURNETT:         "If the applicant has failed

18   to develop," and Michael Williams interpreted that as

19   someone who has not been diligent in developing the

20   record.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So we also get --

22   they get around that because they say the due diligence.

23   You also have an argument about how (2) applies.                  And if

24   you're wrong about both of those then we get to the

25   question, which would be:            If the -- if the hearing's

 1   properly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also

 2   saying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to

 3   be exhausted.   So under Virginia law, under Virginia

 4   law, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case,

 5   but suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA

 6   says, makes some remark.         He couldn't have known about

 7   it.   He goes to a special file.             He couldn't have found

 8   out about.   And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you

 9   can imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones

10   but this is even worse.        Now under Virginia law are

11   you -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say

12   you're out of luck, good-bye?

13                MS. BURNETT:        Yes, Your Honor, and this

14   Court has recognized that --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:           No matter what, it's

16   goodbye?

17                MS. BURNETT:        Yes, and here's why:          Because

18   Virginia has twin statutes that would bar any further

19   applications to State court.            One is the statute of

20   limitations that is strictly applied and the other is a

21   statute which says in essence --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           No excuse?       Even if --

23                MS. BURNETT:        That's correct.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.

25                MS. BURNETT:        And this Court has --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So they are right about,

 2   they are right about the exhaustion being futile.

 3                 MS. BURNETT:        It is defaulted, yes, Your

 4   Honor.   In Virginia those are defaulted claims, and now

 5   we are in Federal court with those claims.                 The Federal

 6   court judges are very familiar with how to do with them.

 7   Has he shown cause and prejudice?

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           The first time he discovers

 9   DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't

10   have done it, there is no way to get relief under

11   Virginia law?

12                 MS. BURNETT:        Not in State court.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Not in State court.

14                 MS. BURNETT:        No, Your Honor.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay, then they're right

16   about that.

17                 MS. BURNETT:        That's correct.         So now he is

18   in Federal court and he has -- he has the thresholds of

19   cause and prejudice or actual innocence.                 And that's a

20   very familiar thing, is what I'm saying, is that the

21   district courts are familiar with.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay, then let me ask you

23   on the merits.    If he's right there and it's exhaustion

24   and it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a

25   decision that does not defer to the State court, because

 1   after all the State court never heard this issue?

 2                 MS. BURNETT:        That's not this case.          But in

 3   a hypothetical case where there are new facts,

 4   unexhausted defaulted claims or facts that are presented

 5   to a Federal court --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       There is no real

 7   argument between the two of you as to the -- as to the

 8   issue that we thought was presented.

 9                 MS. BURNETT:        Well, I think not.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But there's certainly an

11   argument --

12                 MS. BURNETT:        The argument is --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           If it's really a new claim,

14   you're going to say they applied --

15                 MS. BURNETT:        Well, our argument is that,

16   Court, don't use this case to say that, because if the

17   Court uses this case to say that it will be putting its

18   imprimatur on what the district court did in holding a

19   hearing when we don't think it was appropriate.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The Fourth Circuit

21   -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the Fourth Circuit

22   didn't decide that question either.

23                 MS. BURNETT:        They did not.          It was not

24   presented to them, Your Honor.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             How do you want us to

 2   dispose of the case that doesn't, that doesn't do that?

 3   What do you want us to do?

 4                MS. BURNETT:          I think the Court could

 5   dismiss this as improvidently granted.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's it?

 7                MS. BURNETT:          I think the Court could do

 8   that.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask you, so I

10   understand your position on the underlying question if

11   we don't dismiss.     Am I correct that the granting of an

12   evidentiary hearing was based on a showing by the

13   Petitioner that he failed to develop facts which might

14   change the result?

15                MS. BURNETT:          Justice Stevens, there was

16   never any showing, there was never any showing of

17   diligence.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Why did the -- why did the

19   Federal court grant a hearing?

20                MS. BURNETT:          The Federal court simply

21   announced that he was going to hold a hearing on this

22   claim and decide later --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Wasn't he only entitled to

24   do that on the basis of a showing that there was more

25   evidence that the State court did not consider?

 1                 MS. BURNETT:         Yes, Your Honor.             I believe

 2   first he had --

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            So maybe the district

 4   court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made

 5   when we took the case was that there was a body of

 6   evidence that had not been available in the State

 7   proceeding that might be available in the Federal

 8   proceeding.

 9                 MS. BURNETT:         I think that was the

10   misunderstanding.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And if that were true -- I

12   know you disagree with that and I understand your

13   argument.     Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case.                      But

14   if that were true and the Federal court then had to

15   decide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the

16   statute to say at that time he may only rely on the

17   evidence presented to the State court?

18                 MS. BURNETT:         The way I read the statute is

19   that that is the first thing that the judge was required

20   to do.   He had to first determine whether the State

21   court's decision was reasonable.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            All right.          Suppose he

23   looked at the State court evidence and he says, that was

24   not enough.     The State court's decision on the merits

25   was reasonable based on that record.                      I have a different

 1   record before me.     May he look at the different record?

 2               MS. BURNETT:           He can -- I think -- I think

 3   then we are talking about what I was just saying, new

 4   facts, new claims.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:              That's what we're talking

 6   about.   May he look at it?

 7               MS. BURNETT:           And then the judge has to go

 8   through the determination, before he can decide whether

 9   he can look at it, of whether these new facts or new

10   claims meet cause and prejudice or actual innocence.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:              All right.        Forget the

12   cause and prejudice for just a moment.                    But if he looks

13   at that new evidence and he decides that any neutral

14   judge would have reached a different result from the

15   State judge on that evidence, may he reach that result?

16               MS. BURNETT:           I don't think just -- I do not

17   believe the judge can do that --

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Then what's the point --

19               MS. BURNETT:           -- just simply to say I'm

20   going to look at just the correctness of the decision

21   first, and then decide whether it's correct.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:              What you're saying is the

23   correctness of decision based on the State court record.

24   And if he decides there was a sound decision on that

25   record, that's the end of the ball game; is that your

 1   position?

 2               MS. BURNETT:         Well, I think it is, unless --

 3   unless there are actually new matters that are presented

 4   to the Federal court that the Federal court now is going

 5   to --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's the same claim.    It's

 7   the same claim.

 8               MS. BURNETT:         Yes.       Even on the same claim.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Then it seems to me the

10   statute has constructed a pointless procedure.

11               MS. BURNETT:         Your Honor, I -- I don't see

12   that at all.   It seems to me it's a very orderly

13   progression, that the -- that the -- the Effective Death

14   Penalty Act is now telling district court judges, and

15   has made clear that it's doing this for judicial -- for

16   purposes of judicial economy, for finality, for --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why shouldn't the district

18   judge in light of the new evidence decide whether the

19   judgment of the State court was -- would have been

20   reasonable if it came out the same way, including this

21   new evidence in the -- in the consideration?              Why

22   shouldn't he do it that way.

23               MS. BURNETT:         It could do that, Justice

24   Scalia.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I know it could.    But I'm

 1   asking whether it should.

 2              MS. BURNETT:          I think -- I think that

 3   doesn't really fit with the statute -- with the

 4   statutory language.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, it seems to me the

 6   statute certainly contemplates that the States have the

 7   first --

 8              MS. BURNETT:          Yes.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- the first cut at this

10   thing, right?   How else do you give them the first cut?

11              MS. BURNETT:          Yes.       Absolutely.      And that's

12   what I'm saying, and I think that -- to -- if the claim

13   is going to in any way differ, it's going to change from

14   what was presented to the State court.                  On one level,

15   that is all new matters that are defaulted, and in a

16   very literal sense how can -- and I don't believe

17   Congress intended for Federal courts to look at new

18   matters, however they got to them, that were not

19   presented to the State court, and on that basis

20   determine whether the State court's decision was

21   reached.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So the Federal court is

23   supposed to do what?

24              MS. BURNETT:          The Federal court is supposed

25   to first look at the claim that was presented to the


                                       44

 1   State court, under 2254(d), and the claimants before it.

 2   If it's the same claim, if it's the same matters that

 3   were adjudicated on the merits in the State court, it

 4   has to make the decision up front, was it reasonable or

 5   not?

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Okay.

 7              MS. BURNETT:          Okay.       Now it makes that

 8   decision, and then after that, if the Petitioner says

 9   well, I have new matters, that I never presented to the

10   State court, the Federal court has a -- a road map.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Now -- but the road map

12   that you are now saying could be followed is the same

13   road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice

14   Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a

15   defaulted claim.

16              MS. BURNETT:          Yes.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But we are concerned -- I

18   think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in

19   which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at

20   fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal

21   court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now

22   into the State court then.          So that it is not a

23   defaulted claim in the classic sense.                   It is not a claim

24   in which he is at fault by having failed to present it

25   in the State court.

 1               And in that case, if it cannot go back, if

 2   the State court will not take it back, don't we have to

 3   find at least implicit in the totality of subsections

 4   (d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the

 5   fully developed claim in the Federal court without a

 6   need to defer to the State court findings?

 7               MS. BURNETT:         If implicit in your question

 8   is -- yes, implicit in your question is that the

 9   Petitioner has demonstrated cause; and he may or may not

10   have depending on the facts.

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, he -- I agree with

12   you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this

13   point.   He has got to demonstrate cause and prejudice or

14   at least he has got to develop cause.                    Let me put it --

15   ask you this question.       If he simply says look, I tried

16   to get this in to the State court, and he shows that,

17   but the State court for whatever reason just would not

18   take the evidence that he wanted to put in, is that

19   enough for him to have --

20               MS. BURNETT:         It may be.             It may be.   And

21   once again, that's certainly not this case.

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm -- I'm not asking to

23   you stipulate --

24               MS. BURNETT:         Right.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- that it's this case.

 1   But it's the case we are worried about around the

 2   corner.

 3               MS. BURNETT:         It may be.

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:            If that is -- this Court --

 5   that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to

 6   what cause is, and external impediments.                I mean, this

 7   Court has many cases that describe that.                The lower

 8   courts are very familiar with determining that, and so

 9   they can -- they are capable to making that

10   determination as to whether the Federal court can now

11   look at a new matter whether it's a new claim or --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But all we are -- I think

13   all we are really getting at is that there are different

14   kinds of new matters.      There are some new matters of

15   which he absolutely knew nothing at the State court

16   stage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me:

17   i.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice.               This

18   is new matter that he did or potentially know about and

19   tried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State

20   court says no, I'm not going to hear it, or I won't give

21   you the time, whatever the case may be.

22               In that case, isn't it -- don't we have to

23   say under the statute all he has got to show is cause in

24   the sense that he tried and the State court wouldn't let

25   him?   In order to --

 1                 MS. BURNETT:        And that may -- and that may

 2   very well constitute an external impediment --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

 4                 MS. BURNETT:        -- to him being able to

 5   present it.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Having established cause,

 7   he would then in your view not have the Federal court

 8   decide the matter de novo.           But the only question before

 9   the Federal court was whether there was in addition

10   prejudice.

11                 MS. BURNETT:        Correct.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That is to say, whether --

13   but for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find

14   by clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent --

15                 MS. BURNETT:        Correct.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- right?

17                 MS. BURNETT:        Correct.          And --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In that instance is there

19   room for the district court to hold an evidentiary

20   hearing?

21                 MS. BURNETT:        Well, I think then you get --

22   that's -- I think it's actually a separate matter.             We

23   first have to get to whether the Federal court can look

24   at a new matter de novo.          If it can look at it de novo

25   then I think we go to the pre-Effective Death Penalty

 1   Act law about when you have a hearing.                    Are there

 2   disputed facts?     Are they --           that make a difference?

 3   Is it something that actually, you know, needs to have

 4   resolution in a hearing?

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you envisage

 6   circumstances in which an ineffective counsel

 7   assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim

 8   was presented in the State court and then there is a

 9   second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a

10   further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel

11   claim based on new evidence that the district court

12   might hear?     Does that ever happen?

13                 MS. BURNETT:         I think it can happen,

14   certainly.     I don't think it's restricted just to Brady.

15   I mean, I think that it -- it is -- it is the same

16   analysis, no matter what the claim is, it's the same

17   analysis that the Federal court needs to go through to

18   look -- to see whether it can consider new matter.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you think there could

20   be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be

21   two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second

22   of which could be heard in the district court with

23   evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?

24                 MS. BURNETT:         I think it's certainly

25   possible.     I think that the statutory setup and this

 1   Court's established habeas procedures that it had in

 2   place for decades permits that.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I guess the State court can

 4   say, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is

 5   doomsday.    No more new evidence.              We are not going to

 6   consider anything new after that, even if you find Brady

 7   stuff or anything else.         Suppose that's

 8   unconstitutional -- but it isn't.                 I mean, is that

 9   unconstitutional?

10                MS. BURNETT:         Well, no, Your Honor, I don't

11   believe it is.   In fact, the State court -- we don't

12   have to provide for direct appeals.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.           So if it's not

14   unconstitutional, then you just provide what you say,

15   that the district court sees whether by clear and

16   convincing evidence the case would have come out the

17   other way.

18                If it were unconstitutional, and I guess

19   this is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw,

20   anyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me

21   there ought to be a way to make the State take the first

22   cut at it.   Make the State say oh, yes, even with this

23   new evidence we would still find this person guilty; and

24   then in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the

25   deference that 2254(d) requires.                You'd ask whether that

 1   was a reasonable determination.

 2              MS. BURNETT:            Right.        And all I can say to

 3   that, Justice Scalia, is this Court has never held that

 4   the Constitution applies anywhere after the direct

 5   appeal, and that's only the right to cancel.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:               That's the fallacy in my --

 7   in my reasoning.     Or you're saying I shouldn't be

 8   troubled by what has been troubling me, namely that he

 9   had no way to get this before the State court.                   They are

10   entitled to close -- close the gates?

11              MS. BURNETT:            Yes, Your Honor.          And as a

12   collateral review; that's where they are closing the

13   gate, not on direct review.

14              If there are no further questions, I simply

15   ask to affirm.

 1   General left off.    In McNeal and Claudy, this Court did

 2   hold that, in certain instances, a State habeas court

 3   must hold a hearing if there are facts in dispute and

 4   they are not willing to assume them.                      I agree that a

 5   State doesn't have to have a proceeding at all, but if

 6   it has one, it has to be fair.

 7               I know that my time is short.                      I'd like to

 8   go through some of the questions you've asked.

 9               The State did deny us additional time,

10   expert assistance discovery, and a hearing in this case.

11   The Federal court specifically found that we were

12   diligent.   That's at 84a.          And in Michael Williams, this

13   court said that the finding of diligence also

14   constituted a finding of cause for purposes of cause and

15   prejudice, which makes sense because you've got a

16   prisoner who has done the most they can and yet hasn't

17   been able to fully develop the record.                      There was no

18   external impediment.       As you'll recall, in Michael

19   Williams, the information was there; it was just very

20   hard to find.

21               Finally, we presented very substantial new

22   evidence on the Federal level here.                      It's simply not

23   true that there is no new evidence.                      The new evidence

24   included evidence undermining the sole aggravating

25   factor, both the live testimony of Joanne Nicholson,


                                        52

 1   which allowed the court actually to determine whether

 2   she would have been a credible person to undermine the

 3   testimony.     The State had held on the papers she wasn't

 4   credible, which the State can't do on the papers.

 5                Secondly, the evidence said he was

 6   physically abused as a child.               He was beaten with

 7   electrical cords, with planks, with a belt, leaving the

 8   scars on his body that he bears today.                    He saw his

 9   father knock his mother's teeth out for trying to

10   protect him.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:           What is the test for

12   determining whether the addition of new evidence is

13   sufficient to make it a new claim?

14                MR. BRESS:        Your Honor, I think the test

15   really ought to be whether an objectively reasonable

16   jurist could find it important in the overall mix of

17   information.    And it just strikes me that, if you're the

18   judge in that kind of a case, what you're going to go

19   through is -- if I accept that the State court was right

20   with the evidence that it had and I sort of put myself

21   in that frame, would I, nonetheless, if I were that

22   State court, have found this evidence important when I'm

23   making this decision?

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:             It's a materiality

25   standard, really.

 1               MR. BRESS:        Exactly, Your Honor.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So, it's a new claim

 3   if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's

 4   the same claim if the result would be the same.

 5               MR. BRESS:        I don't -- I don't think it

 6   necessarily has to be that way, Your Honor.                  I think you

 7   can have a case where the evidence that was before them

 8   was absolutely nil; now they're offering a good bit of

 9   evidence that you would at least want to weigh as an

10   objective jurist, even though you decide against them.

11   I think that's possible.

12               I think the reason you've got to adopt this

13   position, however, is that there is no DNA -- I mean, no

14   innocence exception that the General has put forward.

15   If the General is right, it isn't a new claim just

16   because you now have DNA evidence that proves you're

17   innocent.   You made that claim of innocence earlier in

18   the proceeding, in your earlier ineffective assistance

19   of counsel claim.    What you have new now is you've got

20   the DNA evidence.    In her view, it's the same claim.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you know, it does

22   read -- 2254(e) -- it does read, "a factual predicate

23   that could not have been previously discovered through

24   the exercise of due diligence."               That sounds like

25   exactly what you're describing, the discovery of DNA

 1   evidence you didn't know about.

 2               MR. BRESS:        And I agree completely, Your

 3   Honor, that (e) says you can hear it, but the Attorney

 4   General says you can't because under (d), she'd say,

 5   you'd already be foreclose because the State court has

 6   already adjudicated your claim on the merits --

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I think she said --

 8               MR. BRESS:        -- and these new facts don't

 9   count.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- she answered -- the

11   answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could

12   have on the Brady claim you could also have for

13   ineffective assistance of counsel.                  It's a wholly new

14   matter.   I thought that's what she said.

15               MR. BRESS:        Your Honor, I think she said

16   that what you would have to look for, I think, is

17   whether "wholly new matter" means "new evidence."                  If

18   she says it's new evidence, such as new DNA evidence, we

19   agree completely.    That's not what she said previously

20   in this case.   Previously, she had said that new

21   evidence in that sense, like DNA evidence, can't make

22   that claim a new claim and, therefore, you're foreclosed

23   under 2254(d), so long as the State court's opinion is

24   intrinsically reasonable based on its inadequate record.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Bress, I want to
