 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 4   argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon.

 5              Ms. Rainville.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MS. RAINVILLE:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              There are many reasons to reverse the

11   Vermont Supreme Court in this case.                     I am going to begin

12   by addressing four reasons as a matter of law that do

13   not require the Court to -- to review the record.                     The

14   first is, even if we assume that the public defender is

15   an assigned counsel -- and for the purposes of argument,

16   I am just going to use the term "public defender."                     If

17   we assume that public defenders do little or nothing in

18   a case, one cannot have a rule that that time is

19   chargeable under the speedy trial right to the State

20   because to do so creates chaos of constitutional

21   proportions in the criminal justice system.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:              May I ask you a question

23   that goes at least to one possible application of -- of

24   your argument?   Your argument for the State, the

25   position that you just took, would -- would apply to the


                                        3

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   period of time, as I understand it, in which the

 2   individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been

 3   appointed to -- to represent the defendant.

 4              And as I understand it, when this case was

 5   argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State

 6   conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be

 7   attributed and it should be held against the State that

 8   Sleigh in effect did nothing.              They said, well, don't

 9   hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in

10   any case, that can be held against us.

11              Here you don't take that position, and I --

12   I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me

13   that it's not open to you -- to take a different

14   position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney

15   General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme

16   Court of Vermont.    And I -- I have to assume that you

17   just see it differently from the way the Attorney

18   General did.   But would -- would you comment on -- on

19   the position that the State took and tell me why you can

20   take a different position here?

21              MS. RAINVILLE:            Yes.       Yes, Your Honor.   The

22   State did take the position that the eight-month period,

23   which included the four months where Attorney Sleigh was

24   involved, was a neutral factor.               And under the dicta in

25   Barker, that would allow the Court to apply it against


                                         4

 1   the State, although not to weigh it heavily as a -- as a

 2   neutral factor.

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

 4                 MS. RAINVILLE:         That was dicta in Barker,

 5   but controlling to the Vermont Supreme Court.              Before

 6   this Court, however, on these facts --

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But it was conceded, wasn't

 8   it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?

 9                 MS. RAINVILLE:         It was conceded that it was

10   a neutral time period.

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

12                 MS. RAINVILLE:         And -- and --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, then, why isn't that

14   concession binding here?

15                 MS. RAINVILLE:         I think it -- it may be

16   binding if the Court determines it's binding.              But I

17   don't think it should be binding because this Court is

18   considering policy that's going to affect all States and

19   all courts.    And the issue that was raised by the

20   National Governors Association, for example, as to

21   whether public defenders can be State actors -- and the

22   law is clear that they cannot -- that's an important

23   issue.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it is, but that is

25   not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by


                                         5

 1   the concession that the Attorney General made in the

 2   Vermont Supreme Court.

 3                 MS. RAINVILLE:          Yes.       Yes, but also if you

 4   look at the record, the three years of delay, the time

 5   period involving Mr. Sleigh is approximately four

 6   months.     If you take all four months where he was

 7   appointed by the docket or two months if you take the

 8   time where he thought and understood that he was on the

 9   case, and in light of the three-year delay, that amount

10   of time is really inconsequential.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It may have been a

12   good concession below.         I mean, it would -- as I

13   understand it, the problem arose because of change in

14   the contract, right?

15                 MS. RAINVILLE:          That's correct.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I mean, that may

17   well have been attributable to the State.

18                 MS. RAINVILLE:          It -- it may well have been

19   attributable to the defender general.                     And that's one of

20   the problems in this case is that we don't have a record

21   of why different attorneys -- Attorney No. 4, Donaldson,

22   and Attorney No. 5, Sleigh, were never asked what they

23   did or --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I suppose you are

25   willing to concede that there are situations where the


                                          6

 1   delay would be attributable to the State because of

 2   systemic problems?

 3                MS. RAINVILLE:           Yes.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  The State has so

 5   many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer.

 6   That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.

 7                MS. RAINVILLE:           Absolutely.         But that's not

 8   the case here.   That might be the situation if, for

 9   example, the defender general said to every defendant:

10   If you want a trial with a lawyer, you have to wait a

11   year.   That's not what happened here.

12                What happened here is the defender general

13   was incredibly diligent.           He appointed new counsel five

14   times the same day.       The day of the arraignment Mr.

15   Ammons was appointed.        The day Mr. Ammons withdrew,

16   replacement counsel, Mr. Harnett, was appointed.                   The

17   day Mr. Harnett withdrew, replacement counsel was

18   appointed.   The day Mr. Donaldson withdrew, the docket

19   shows that Sleigh was appointed.                 Five times the same

20   day the defender general appointed counsel.

21                The sixth time, given that we are in

22   Vermont, a very small State with few lawyers, he had

23   difficulty finding a sixth lawyer.                   But the defender

24   general took extraordinary measures and went to the

25   Vermont Legislature and obtained funding, and the

 1   legislature came up to the plate very quickly, in a

 2   matter of weeks.

 3              The last withdrawal of Lawyer No. 5 happens

 4   on April 10th.     It's June 20th that there is the letter

 5   in the appendix from the defender general saying that

 6   the legislature has approved new funding.                 It's -- it's

 7   literally a matter of weeks before the legislature comes

 8   to the plate and provides additional funding.

 9              So to the extent that -- that that is State

10   action, the defender general has been incredibly

11   expeditious, incredibly diligent, and went to the

12   extraordinary length of getting additional funding for

13   the sixth lawyer.     We -- we would concede --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:                I guess when -- when the

15   last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had

16   expired, I suppose the court could have refused to

17   permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?

18              MS. RAINVILLE:             It could have.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:                Couldn't it say you -- you

20   have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation,

21   and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you --

22   you stay in the case?

23              MS. RAINVILLE:             The -- the court could have,

24   and certainly --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:                Does it make it not the

 1   State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what?

 2   Is -- is the court's misfeasance the State's

 3   misfeasance?    Do you attribute that to the State?

 4                MS. RAINVILLE:          The court's misfeasance

 5   would -- would certainly be attributable to the State,

 6   but we would argue that it would be a neutral factor.

 7   But here, Your Honor, Brillon would -- in terms of the

 8   fourth lawyer, Mr. Donaldson, he sought to have him

 9   fired.    And, in fact, it was his letter to the court and

10   then a subsequent motion to the court to have that

11   lawyer dismissed.    And in that colloquy when the -- when

12   the -- the trial judge asked Brillon, do you want to

13   have -- do you still want to have him fired despite all

14   this delay and everything, and Brillon says yes, clearly

15   the court with regard to Donaldson could have said to

16   Donaldson, you stay on this case and get this case to

17   trial.    But Brillon waived that.              Brillon said that he

18   wanted a new lawyer.

19                With regard to Sleigh --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:             -- with that particular

21   period.    The trouble that I have with that particular

22   period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that

23   right?    That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?

24                MS. RAINVILLE:          That's Moore.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.      Donaldson was

 1   the first one?

 2              MS. RAINVILLE:            Donaldson was actually

 3   Lawyer No. 4.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:              Go ahead.

 5              (Laughter.)

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Before you start, let me

 7   just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it.

 8   The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what

 9   you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around.

10   But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that

11   the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make

12   some kind of effective trial and representation

13   arrangement.    It -- it -- it has that duty through

14   providing the public defender, it has that duty simply

15   through providing a court that will keep things moving,

16   and I think that's common ground.

17              If that, as it seems to be, is common

18   ground, then do we have anything before us in this case,

19   except sort of going through the list of counsel, the

20   list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the

21   Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it

22   assumed in applying the rule?              In other words, it seems

23   to me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing

24   the parties here, it's a series of issues of details.

25   Is that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got


                                        10

 1   it?

 2              MS. RAINVILLE:           You can certainly look at it

 3   in terms of details, and I think that the Vermont

 4   Supreme Court's findings are unsupported by the record.

 5   But as a matter of law, you have delays by State actors,

 6   and even if you take the two or the four months for

 7   Sleigh aside, the rest of the delay, three years of

 8   delay minus -- there's four months, of course, which he

 9   had no counsel -- but three years minus that time, is

10   all caused by non-State actors.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yeah, but if you take

12   Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was

13   no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no

14   counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just

15   about a year.   And a year is -- is enough to trigger

16   Neil v. Biggers.   And so, it seems to me that what --

17   what the fight, what the serious fight is about is,

18   well, within the further total of two-year period, who

19   is to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and

20   I'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go

21   through and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on

22   those details, because you've got enough in Neil v.

23   Biggers before you even get to those details.

24              MS. RAINVILLE:           Well, also in terms of just

25   based on Brillon's admission, there's enough for this

 1   Court to decide the case.            He admits that he fired three

 2   different lawyers.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Right.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:            Isn't there -- isn't there

 5   that very important principle involved here that doesn't

 6   simply involve calculating particular periods of delay?

 7   When you have a defendant who starts out by firing a

 8   lawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer

 9   by threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go

10   through all of the subsequent periods and attribute the

11   delay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a

12   neutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't

13   occurred?

14               We don't know how quickly this case would

15   have gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired

16   or if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been

17   threatened and forced to withdraw.

18               MS. RAINVILLE:            I believe you're absolutely

19   right, Justice Alito.        In this case his conduct was so

20   unconscionable in threatening both his lawyer, and the

21   facts there --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:              I really wanted to ask you

23   pretty much exactly the same question.                    If we assume

24   exactly the terrible way he fired the first two -- the

 1   true that no matter how long the delay occurred after

 2   that, he could never get Sixth Amendment relief?

 3              MS. RAINVILLE:           I would -- I wouldn't go

 4   that far, Justice Stevens.

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Why not?

 6              MS. RAINVILLE:           Because what if the State

 7   kept him for ten years without a trial?                 I don't think

 8   that would ever happen.        Certainly on these facts

 9   there's no basis, given his conduct, to balance anything

10   in his favor.   Vermont's --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, there -- as I

12   understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme

13   Court agrees with you.

14              MS. RAINVILLE:           That's right.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:             They said, we're not

16   counting any of that against you.

17              Now we go into the second year, and the

18   second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it.

19   And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left

20   the office within a few days of his having been

21   appointed to do this and then he never did anything.                So

22   the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr.

23   Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the

24   State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not

25   giving him anybody.     The guy they gave him wasn't even a


                                       13

 1   public defender, he never did a thing.                      All right.

 2                 Now we go to the third group.                    The third

 3   group, the State agreed they should be charged.                      That's

 4   Mr. Sleigh.    The third one they agreed with it.                    They

 5   said lightly, but they agreed with it.

 6                 And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well,

 7   it looks like from the record as if the reason that was

 8   held against the State had nothing to do with her

 9   performance.    It had to do with the fact that the State

10   didn't give certain records to her, which everybody

11   would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the

12   prosecution, which is the State.

13                 So we have four periods.                    In one of them you

14   won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all,

15   according to the court; in the third one you agree it

16   should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it

17   has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense

18   errors.

19                 Now, what are we supposed to decide?                    Are we

20   supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a

21   correct statement?      If so, why isn't it?                  I guess we

22   have to read the record.           But what else is there to

23   decide?

24                 MS. RAINVILLE:          I think you can decide it

25   without reviewing the record, based on the fact that you

 1   have a defendant who fired his first lawyer six months

 2   into the case, one day before trial.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:             And you won that.

 4                MS. RAINVILLE:           And then filed -- fired a

 5   second lawyer when the lawyer initially argued and said,

 6   no, no, it's not true, I've been working; he then

 7   threatened to kill the lawyer.                Then he at that time was

 8   told:    If you want a new lawyer, there's going to be

 9   inevitable delays.      He said:          That's okay, I still want

10   to fire this lawyer.        Then he went on and fired yet

11   another lawyer.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I suppose -- I'm not

13   sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular

14   details of a very complicated record, but there are

15   several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion

16   where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do

17   anything to move the case forward is attributable to the

18   State.   And I thought the fundamental principle we were

19   debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to

20   move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the

21   defendant or whether it is attributable to the State

22   because they happen to work for the State.

23                And I would assume one way to dispose of the

24   case would be to decide that general question and send

25   it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance


                                         15

 1   that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign

 2   delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort

 3   through the record themselves.

 4                 MS. RAINVILLE:          And I think that's a very

 5   important point, Mr. Chief Justice.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is that point in the case?

 7   Where -- where is that in this case?                      I don't know who

 8   -- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court

 9   said anything, said that, except in the instance where

10   you agreed with them.

11                 Where is it in their -- where is it -- who

12   are they are referring to when they said that?                     Is that

13   Donaldson?     Because I thought the claim with Donaldson

14   was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was

15   attributed.     Rather, it was the State's failure to

16   appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to

17   appoint no one since he had left the office and since he

18   did nothing.

19                 Now, is that what we're supposed to decide:

20   When a State appoints a person who has already left the

21   office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it

22   correct to attribute to the State their failure to

23   appoint anybody?

24                 MS. RAINVILLE:          Well, first let me address

25   this point of two lawyers who did little or nothing.                     In

 1   Strickland v. Washington, this Court said how extremely

 2   important it is when determining ineffective assistance

 3   to have a strong presumption that counsel's conduct

 4   falls within the wide range of reasonable professional

 5   assistance, and that there should be a hearing to ask

 6   counsel what they did.

 7              Here the Vermont Supreme Court makes this

 8   ruling without anyone at any point ever asking Mr.

 9   Donaldson or Mr. Sleigh what they did.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Ms. Rainville, underneath

11   or between the lines there seems to be great discontent

12   on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way

13   the public defender system is operating.               And if we hold

14   for you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right,

15   the Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just

16   the same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't

17   it?

18              MS. RAINVILLE:          It could except for that we

19   believe that this decision creates an unconstitutional

20   situation in creating two different classes of

21   defendant, indigent and non-indigent, in their speedy

22   trial rights, such that henceforth the prosecution and

23   the courts must treat every indigent defendant

24   differently merely because they're indigent when they

25   ask for a continuance or when they ask for change of


                                      17

 1   counsel.     We have to oppose those.                So that we make the

 2   unpleasant choice of the constitutional due process

 3   violation, that we would rather push a defendant who's

 4   indigent to trial before his counsel's ready, because

 5   the constitutional violation there is only one of due

 6   process and he'll get a new trial, versus agreeing to

 7   allow their counsel to have time to prepare, in which

 8   case we risk a speedy trial violation, where he will be

 9   able to walk free despite his guilt.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Ms. Rainville, you -- you

11   began your presentation with a statement that gave me so

12   much hope.    You said you were going to give us three

13   reasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts

14   of the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law.

15   Okay?   You only mentioned the first.                     What are the other

16   two?

17                 MS. RAINVILLE:          The second is --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Remind us of the first.

19                 MS. RAINVILLE:          The first is that this

20   creates an unconstitutional situation where there are

21   two classes of defendants treated differently by the

22   State and by the courts.

23                 The second is that the delays in this case

24   were caused by non-State actors and as a matter of law

25   under Polk County cannot be a constitutional violation.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, that sort of gets us

 2   into the facts at some point.              I mean, that does get us

 3   into the facts.

 4              What's the third?

 5              MS. RAINVILLE:            The third is that, based on

 6   his concessions, his admissions in the brief, he's

 7   waived it; and that's under Barker v. Wingo where the

 8   Court talks about standard waiver doctrine applies in

 9   speedy trial.

10              And the fourth is that under the balancing

11   test based solely on his admissions, his conduct ought

12   to weigh like a ton of bricks against whatever happened

13   with the State.

14              and I'll reserve the rest of my time if I

15   might for rebuttal.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

25   please the Court:

 1              If you look on pages 27 through 28 of the

 2   Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the

 3   Vermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of

 4   a single principle that it applied to the entirety of

 5   the final two years of the pretrial delay in this case,

 6   and that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the

 7   failure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to

 8   move his case to trial should be attributable to the

 9   State.

10              As the question comes before the Court

11   today, I think the primary point of dispute is whether

12   there should be an exception to the general rule that a

13   defendant is responsible for his own lawyer's delays in

14   situations in which the lawyer purportedly does little

15   or nothing to move the case to trial; and for four

16   reasons we think that the Court should decline to create

17   a kind of attorney inaction exception to the general

18   rule.

19              First of all, we think that such a rule

20   would be inconsistent with the role of a lawyer in an

21   adversarial system and would undermine a lawyer's

22   authority to make day-to-day decisions about the

23   scheduling of pretrial proceedings.

24              Second, we think that such a rule would be

25   enormously difficult for courts to administer in


                                      20
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   practice, because attorney inaction is generally

 2   difficult to discern in the midst of pretrial

 3   proceedings and the risk of error would be to deprive

 4   the defendant of the time that his lawyer may genuinely

 5   need in order to prepare an effective defense.

 6                 The third reason is that it would create

 7   opportunities for gamesmanship; it would create

 8   incentives for defendants to use the services of their

 9   lawyer so long as it suits them, but then to complain

10   later that the lawyer was inactive and therefore they

11   should not be held responsible for the lawyer's delay.

12   And as to the lawyers themselves, it would create an

13   incentive to unreasonably delay, with the comfort of

14   knowing that the worst that would happen is the best

15   possible outcome for their client, which is the

16   dismissal of charges with prejudice.

17                 And finally, we think that such a rule would

18   create an unjustifiable distinction between the

19   treatments of appointed counsel and retained counsel in

20   our system.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           With respect to that last

22   point, let me ask you this question.                     Let's assume we --

23   we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result

24   of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a

25   result of requests for continuance after continuance


                                        21
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a

 2   simple case and it's not tried for three years.

 3              Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on

 4   constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an

 5   affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to

 6   bring cases to trial in a reasonable time?              And whether

 7   the reason for the failure in this three-year case is

 8   because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off,

 9   or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for

10   trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has

11   been violated.   Is -- is that a -- a possible

12   constitutionally based position?

13              MS. KRUGER:         I think that Barker makes clear

14   that defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial

15   and that indeed defendants will often desire to put off

16   trial as long as possible.          I think that in giving

17   proper consideration to the Barker Court's explanation

18   of the nature and purposes of the right, and in

19   particular focusing on the fact that the only possible

20   remedy for the speedy trial violation is a remedy that

21   uniquely advantages defendants and poses substantial

22   burdens on society, we think ultimately a defendant

23   can't escape responsibility for continuances that he has

24   requested through or without the assistance of counsel,

25   simply by blaming the prosecution for failing to object


                                       22
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   or by blaming the courts for failing to go along.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, what if the -- what

 3   if we change the facts slightly.                 What if the defendant

 4   himself never says anything on the record?                       The only

 5   thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by

 6   paid counsel for continuances, and then after three

 7   years the defendant fires paid counsel and says:                          I've

 8   been sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and

 9   I shouldn't have to wait that long.                       The State has

10   failed in its non-delegable duty.                  Would your answer

11   still be the same?

12              MS. KRUGER:           It would still be the same.                 We

13   think that fundamentally the principal safeguard against

14   that kind of unreasonable attorney-caused delay is the

15   attorney's ethical obligation, which creates a duty in

16   the attorney to represent his clients with reasonable

17   diligence and promptness.            We think that a rule that

18   would require --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Lots -- lots of very

20   effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first

21   tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

22              MS. KRUGER:           And I think it's precisely for

23   that reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the

24   client's interest, that this Court should decline to

25   fashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy,


                                         23
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   which is again an extreme remedy that advantages the

 2   defendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the

 3   defendant.

 4                We think for that reason the defendant

 5   necessarily has to be responsible for any delays that

 6   are caused either by him or by the person who is

 7   appointed to represent him.            Again, the ethical duty of

 8   the lawyer is to zealously advocate on behalf of the

 9   defendant's interests, and if the defendant desires to

10   go to trial as quickly as possible, it's still the

11   lawyer's duty under the ethical rules to try to

12   accommodate that request, while at the same time doing

13   everything he can to prepare an effective defense.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me ask you this

15   question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28.              If you

16   describe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I

17   understand your comment as being right on the nose.             But

18   I understood part of that to be talking about the

19   situation in which the defender general's office has not

20   performed its duty with sufficient promptness.

21                And would you not agree if there were a

22   period, say, of seven or eight months in which they just

23   didn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that

24   should be charged against the State?

25                MS. KRUGER:       We would agree, Justice


                                       24

 1   Stevens.   In this case there were a period of a total of

 2   about six months during which the Respondent was not

 3   represented at all, and we think in view of the State's

 4   ultimate responsibility for providing counsel to

 5   indigent defendants, when the State doesn't comply in a

 6   timely fashion with that duty, that delay is properly

 7   attributable to the State.

 8               Although in this case, because the delay was

 9   not the product of a deliberate effort to hamper the

10   defense, we think that that period should weigh only

11   lightly against the State; and ultimately, given the

12   other factors at issue in this case, the absence of any

13   actual trial prejudice in particular, we think that

14   ultimately those six months are insufficient to

15   establish a speedy trial violation.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't the prejudice factor

17   pretty much established as long as the guy has to stay

18   in jail during this entire period?

19               MS. KRUGER:        I think that that's certainly

20   one form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in

21   Barker itself, for example, the defendant was

22   incarcerated for ten months during the pretrial

23   proceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there

24   was no speedy trial violation.              We think a similar

25   principle applies in this case.              Although incarceration


                                       25

 1   is obviously prejudicial to defendants, in this case

 2   there was no prejudice above and beyond that.            The

 3   Vermont Supreme Court was clear in finding the absence

 4   of --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did he get to offset it

 6   against the time for the pretrial incarceration?

 7              MS. KRUGER:         I am not aware that he did, but

 8   this Court made clear in Strunk that getting credit for

 9   time served is not an appropriate remedy for a speedy

10   trial violation, that the only possible remedy is again

11   what the Vermont Supreme Court did, erroneously in our

12   view, which is to dismiss the charges without

13   possibility of reindictment.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What would you think of a

15   rule that said where most of the delay is attributable

16   to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk?            That

17   seems like a reasonable rule.            Whatever the delay is, if

18   most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it

19   is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?

20              MS. KRUGER:         We think that a defendant -- we

21   think that that rule would make a great deal of sense.

22   When a defendant --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That would make it easy to

24   decide this case because the -- the supreme court's

25   opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the

 1   delay was caused by the defendant.

 2                MS. KRUGER:       Well, the Vermont Supreme Court

 3   thought that some of the delay was caused by the

 4   defendant and didn't charge most of that period to the

 5   State to support its finding of the speedy trial

 6   violation.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would you really get by

 8   that rule if there were, say, four years of delay and

 9   two years and one month was attributable to the

10   defendant and two years to the State?

11                MS. KRUGER:       We would think that a court

12   evaluating a speedy trial claim in that case would

13   properly exclude any period that was attributable to the

14   defendant and focus specifically on that period that was

15   attributable to the State in determining whether or not

16   the right was violated.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, I'm sure

18   you have gone through the record and, agreeing with

19   Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a

20   contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count

21   against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont

22   Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to

23   move the case forward that is attributable to the State

24   and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?

25                MS. KRUGER:       The difference in time is -- I

 1   think that the -- as the case comes to the court, the

 2   final 11 months of the pretrial delay is not seriously

 3   in dispute.    I think that Respondent has raised a number

 4   of arguments about concurrent causes of delay unrelated

 5   to the performance of his counsel.                  I think that those

 6   arguments are not properly before the Court because they

 7   fall well outside the scope of the question as to which

 8   this Court granted review and because they were neither

 9   pressed nor passed on below.

10                 I think that leaves the middle 14 months of

11   the pretrial delay.      And I think, given the Vermont

12   concession, the Vermont Supreme Court focus naturally

13   rests on the 5.5-month period during which Paul

14   Donaldson represented Respondent.                 And we think, with

15   respect --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes?

17                 MS. KRUGER:       We think with respect to that

18   period, we think that there is no basis for shifting the

19   responsibility for that delay that Paul Donaldson sought

20   before going to trial from defendant to the State

21   because, as Justice Scalia has rightly pointed out, any

22   contract expiration didn't in and of itself end the

23   attorney-client relationship, and Paul Donaldson

24   remained the agent and advocate of his client during

25   that period.

 3              ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. NELSON

 4                  ON BEHALF OF the RESPONDENT

 5              MR. NELSON:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7              I apologize for jumping the gun.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Sorry to delay you.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:              But it's not going to get

10   you off.

11              (Laughter.)

12              MR. NELSON:          I would like to respond to --

13   to Vermont's argument about there being no detailed

14   record about why these attorneys left when they left.

15   And I -- I think if they're right, then that augurs a

16   remand, that suggests a remand.               But the reason there

17   was no record of those departures is because the courts

18   who presided over those departures never requested an

19   explanation.

20              With Paul Donaldson, the matter was a

21   foregone conclusion.       He had no contract.            He was going

22   into another line of work.           So be it, he's out of there.

23   No questioning concerning Mr. Brillon's complaints about

24   his inaction, his failure to investigate, and so forth;

25   nothing about are you ready to go to trial, what have

 1   you done, what have you accomplished, what are you

 2   passing on, if anything, to the next lawyer in line,

 3   none of that.

 4                 And with Sleigh, the judicial disinterest,

 5   if that's what it was, the judicial silence is even more

 6   resounding.     Sleigh did not request permission to

 7   withdraw.     He put the court on notice that he was

 8   withdrawing, and this came out of the blue.                   I don't

 9   think there was any heads-up for the court that this was

10   going to happen, although Sleigh had expressed some

11   serious reluctance to take the case and hadn't done

12   anything.   He didn't -- he had a filing deadline of

13   April 11th, and he was supposed to file motions on that

14   date, and instead of filing motions he filed this notice

15   of withdrawal with no response from the court.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What is the -- what

17   is the distinction in your theory of the case between

18   delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did

19   -- what did the Vermont case say:                  Failure to do

20   anything to move the case forward?

21                 When do we know that that's attributable to

22   the defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?

23                 MR. NELSON:        I think it -- I think it

24   depends on the facts, and I think in each of the -- in

25   the case of each of these two attorneys, the facts are


                                         30

 1   different.   With Donaldson, I think the State's

 2   responsibility -- the State's involvement in a

 3   do-nothing attorney, an attorney who was really a

 4   nominal attorney, started from the beginning.                   It

 5   started from the appointment of -- of counsel who had

 6   been on contract with the State to perform defense

 7   services and was appointed.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Of course, if the

 9   lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an

10   ineffective-assistance claim?

11                MR. NELSON:         Well, it might mature into an

12   ineffective-assistance claim, but there couldn't be an

13   ineffective assistance claim on the record here because,

14   well, ineffective assistance is -- is something that

15   occurs at a trial.      And it can't be --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It's an anomaly, though,

17   isn't it, that easily might have matured into

18   ineffective assistance?          It wasn't yet, but if Attorneys

19   4 and 5, Donaldson and Sleigh -- if the case were for

20   ineffective assistance of counsel, then the defendant

21   would get a new trial, but here the result is he walks.

22                MR. NELSON:         That's -- that's a consequence

23   of the speedy-trial clause in Barker and Strunk.                     A

24   speedy-trial violation happens, by definition, before

25   trial.   Ineffective assistance happens, by definition

 1   and by this Court's decisions, at trial and can't be

 2   determined until after trial.             Unless there is -- is a

 3   speedy trial right and unless it's going to be enforced,

 4   this is the consequence.         And that's --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                In the abstract, you

 6   have a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a

 7   public defender, and he keeps asking for continuances --

 8   continuance, continuance.          How do we tell that that's

 9   the State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is

10   doing through his lawyer?

11                MR. NELSON:       I think at first you would have

12   to assume that the continuances were sought in good

13   faith and -- and for purposes of defense preparation.

14   If the defendant had demanded a speedy trial, as this

15   defendant had an early date, I think the court, looking

16   at -- at a continuance motion, would have to look at it

17   in that light.

18                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, what is the trial

19   judge supposed to do?      The defense attorney keeps asking

20   for continuances for purposes of investigation.                I need

21   more time to investigate.          If -- and -- and -- can the

22   court say:   You need to tell me exactly what you are

23   doing?

24                MR. NELSON:       I think, Justice Alito, that a

25   court -- when a defendant has demanded a speedy trial,


                                       32

 1   that a court does have some obligation to -- to

 2   supervise, to monitor, to -- and -- and it happens all

 3   the time in criminal courts.              What have you done?           Have

 4   you seen your client?        What -- how much time do you need

 5   for these motions?      When are you going to be ready for

 6   trial?   That happens all the time.

 7                And as the -- as time goes by, as the months

 8   pass and -- and become years, I think a court's granting

 9   of continuances has to be more grudging.                       The courts are

10   under a duty because they have a duty to assure the

11   speedy-trial right.       Because they are the -- they are

12   the primary actors in that, the court has a duty to be

13   --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:           Aren't you giving the

15   attorney a very perverse incentive there?                       I mean the

16   delay may help the ultimate outcome of the case, and if

17   the -- if the defense attorney can engineer enough

18   delay, he or she may also produce a speedy-trial

19   violation.

20                MR. NELSON:         Well, I -- yes, of course,

21   that's a -- that's a problem, and it's a problem that

22   was recognized by Barker, and -- and it's a problem that

23   -- that courts are well equipped to handle.                       They --

24   courts are able to and commonly do.                       In fact, it's their

25   pretrial business -- main pretrial business to -- to set


                                         33

 1   that line to make sure lawyers adhere to them and make

 2   sure that the case goes to trial.                  They -- courts are

 3   well equipped to deal with that.

 4                But I -- I would like to point out that your

 5   hypothetical is not this case.                That we are not dealing

 6   here with delays that were caused by continuance

 7   motions.    In fact, if you look closely at the record,

 8   trial dates were not pushed back by continuance motions

 9   in this case.    Trial dates were pushed back by attorney

10   inaction and withdrawals.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:           And by your client firing

12   the first attorney, correct?

13                MR. NELSON:         My client -- that's correct.

14   My client fired -- fired the first attorney, which --

15   which the State says was the bad act.                     But look at the

16   record of that firing.         It wasn't really a firing, of

17   course.    He had no right to fire assigned counsel.                   But

18   he had just heard his lawyer telling the judge, I'm

19   handling 150 odd cases, I cannot be ready for trial,

20   give me more time.      I -- I -- I could be ready maybe in

21   March or April, but I can't be ready now.                     And that was

22   like three or four days before trial.

23                And I would submit that any client, hearing

24   his lawyer making those representations to a judge,

25   would have been very upset and would, in fact, have

 1   wanted another lawyer.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But knowing that the new

 3   lawyer would have to start from scratch, from the

 4   beginning, so it was going to take more time.                 If he got

 5   a new lawyer, it was going to take more time than if he

 6   stayed with the lawyer who was already acquainted with

 7   the case but just needed a few more weeks.

 8               MR. NELSON:        Well, yes, but the lawyer who

 9   had been appointed wasn't going to get those few more

10   weeks, and as Mr. Brillon said to the court, I would

11   rather do it right the first time.                 Being charged with a

12   life imprisonment offense, one can hardly blame him.

13   Yes, he had to make a tradeoff, but he had to do it

14   because his lawyer was not ready.

15               Now, we argued in the Vermont Supreme Court

16   that that time could not --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me, is that the

18   proper remedy?   I mean, it seems to me he should appeal

19   to the judge and say, look, this lawyer -- is -- is that

20   the way you solve the problem of -- of an attorney who

21   is not ready, like fire him so you can get another

22   attorney?   That seems to me very strange.

23               MR. NELSON:        Counsel.          Counsel moved for --

24   moved for a continuance on February 22nd.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

 1                MR. NELSON:        And --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And from what you told me

 3   it should have been given, right?

 4                MR. NELSON:        Pardon me?

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            From what you tell me, it

 6   should have been given if indeed he was unable to

 7   prepare adequately for the trial?

 8                MR. NELSON:        I believe so.            The judge took a

 9   different view.    It was fully argued.                  The judge was the

10   only one who had -- the judge was the decider on that

11   one, and she said no.       You don't get it.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, wasn't there a

13   concern about this defendant trying avoid a particular

14   judge?    That's why he wanted the continuance?

15                MR. NELSON:        The -- the State made that

16   allegation, and it made that claim here.                   No court has

17   found it.    The Vermont Supreme Court found the opposite.

18   The Vermont Supreme Court held that Brillon fired or

19   asked for the dismissal of his first lawyer because he

20   was not prepared to go to trial, which seems like an

21   ample, sufficient and supported reason for the action he

22   took.    That explains the case.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Not only did the Vermont

24   Supreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the

25   witnesses, it -- it has a record before it.                   I can

 1   understand if you're talking about a finding made by the

 2   court of first instance, but the Vermont Supreme Court

 3   is reviewing a record, it's not making findings.

 4               MR. NELSON:        That's -- that's true, Justice

 5   Ginsburg.   The trial court, however, also didn't make

 6   that finding, although it was asked to.                 And, in fact, I

 7   think any such finding would be entirely speculative.

 8               It would require the court, the fact finder,

 9   to interpolate various happenings that are not of

10   record, and that we say never happened.                 It would

11   require us to assume that Brillon told Ammons, I want

12   you to move for a continuance on whatever grounds you

13   can think of, but the real reason is to get rid of the

14   judge.   And that Ammons would do that for his client,

15   and, you know, for the ostensible reason that he

16   presented to the court, namely, he was overloaded and

17   not prepared to go to trial, his secret reason was to

18   get rid of the judge.      And I think the record doesn't

19   warrant that kind of inference, especially since it's

20   been presented to and not accepted by the State courts.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 This is not an

22   unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the

23   private sector to ask for a continuance.                 It's quite

24   common for the lawyers to go before the judge and say,

25   look, I've got this other case going to trial next week,

 1   I've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges

 2   give them the first two but not the third.                And why in a

 3   case simply where you're dealing with a public defender

 4   do you presume the opposite and blame the State for

 5   what's a quite common practice in the private part?

 6              MR. NELSON:        Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I'm

 7   only saying that this -- on this record, the conclusion

 8   that that was what was happening, which would be

 9   significant if the court were then to say, and

10   therefore, it was done by the defendant who wanted delay

11   despite what he said, and therefore, this is time

12   considered waived under Barker.             There is no basis for

13   that finding.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 My point is, I

15   guess, how do we tell?      I mean, if this is normal -- I

16   think it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a

17   defense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first

18   time the trial date is set.           If it is normal, how do we

19   tell?

20              MR. NELSON:        Well, actually, this wasn't the

21   first -- the first request for a continuance, Chief.

22   Ammons had moved for a continuance before, and it had

23   been denied.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yeah, but -- again,

25   I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the


                                      38

 1   private bar where that's true as well.

 2              MR. NELSON:         How does one know?           I think

 3   one -- I think what makes a major difference here is

 4   that Brillon had demanded a speedy trial.                 He had done

 5   so long before Ammons' motion for a continuance.                   He had

 6   done -- he did so almost every chance he got at almost

 7   every court hearing.

 8              You could, and I think the State does,

 9   assume that this was all tomfoolery and an attempt to

10   manipulate the court, but there is nothing in the record

11   to suggest that.   That was the debate between the

12   majority and the dissent at the State court.                 The

13   majority won.   As in Doggett, the -- the State is now

14   coming back and trying to refight here an essentially

15   factual issue which it lost in -- in the courts below.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:             What about Donaldson and

17   Moore, those two periods?          Those two periods, the

18   Donaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I

19   can tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods

20   when the State -- when the court below was saying that

21   all that happened here was that the lawyers who were

22   appointed, did a very bad job.

23              You can't say they weren't appointed.                   It

24   isn't that he didn't have counsel.                 He had counsel, and

25   they just didn't do very much.

 1                 Now, why should that be accounted against

 2   the stayer?     Is Moore special?             Was there really a

 3   problem of prosecutorial behavior?                   Is Donaldson the

 4   same as Sleigh?     I don't know.

 5                 MR. NELSON:        Let me start --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is Donaldson a case where

 7   they -- is equivalent to having no lawyer?                   I don't know

 8   how to deal with it.

 9                 MR. NELSON:        Let me start with Donaldson,

10   and I think in answer to your question, I don't think

11   Donaldson is substantially different from Sleigh.                  I

12   won't go over the circumstances of Donaldson's

13   appointment, but once he was appointed, he began

14   conversations with the defender general about getting

15   off the case.    And I think the sense -- and -- and a

16   significant fact about those conversations is that the

17   defender general told Donaldson he was going to be

18   replaced.

19                 We don't know exactly when that happened,

20   but he told him he was going to be replaced with someone

21   who was more competent, more qualified to deal with a

22   life imprisonment case.          So this is not information

23   which will light a fire under a lawyer to prepare a

24   case, that he knows he's not going to try.

25                 Donaldson then asks for time.                It's the only


                                         40

 1   request he ever made of the court.                 The court gave him

 2   time and set filing deadlines, and he missed them.

 3   Missing those deadlines should have been a red flag to

 4   the court in a case that was already over a year old.

 5   The court let those deadlines pass without a word.

 6                The court also said, we're going to try this

 7   case in October.   Get ready for trial in October.

 8   Everything should be filed by September 23rd.                   And for a

 9   reason, which the record has no explanation for, the

10   October trial never happened.             Donaldson was still on

11   the case, his name was still on the case, and the

12   October trial date passed without a murmur.                   It was not

13   until late November that Donaldson came to the court and

14   explained the situation.

15                Now the court -- I think the defender

16   general failed in his responsibility with regard to

17   Donaldson.   That's State involvement.                  The court failed

18   in not noticing the -- the missed deadlines and in

19   allowing the trial date to pass without a trial; and I

20   think the Court also failed in its duty in allowing

21   Donaldson off the case, which rendered any catch-up time

22   that he had to do pointless, without any inquiry at all.

23   The court, it's clear from the record, deferred entirely

24   to the defender general, and so I think the Vermont

25   court on that record thought that there was enough State

 1   involvement here to charge -- to find the State

 2   responsible and to weigh some of that responsibility

 3   against the State.      The court --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What does your --

 5   your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite

 6   vital principle in Polk County that public defenders

 7   work for their clients; they don't work for the State?

 8               MR. NELSON:          It does nothing to Polk County,

 9   and we acknowledge that -- that Paul Donaldson's

10   inaction by itself, if it had nothing to do with the

11   State, if the State did not involve itself or condone --

12   if the State had no responsibility with regard to that

13   time, the State would have no responsibility under

14   Barker.   That's perfectly clear, and I don't think the

15   Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, fairly read, fairly

16   read says anything other than that.                       The Vermont --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, I guess fairly

18   read, it does say the failure of several assigned

19   counsel to do anything to move the case forward is

20   attributable to the State, because they didn't do

21   anything, I guess is the touchstone.

22               MR. NELSON:          Well, I think I have two

23   responses to that.      One is that in the context of the

24   rest of the opinion, what the court was talking about

25   was a breakdown of the system, and the focus was on two

 1   actors, both State actors, the assigning agency, the

 2   defender general, and the court and I don't think

 3   there's any dispute that both of those are indeed State

 4   actions, and that delays which can be traced to them,

 5   which they have a hand in, can be weighed against panned

 6   the State under Barker.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But it doesn't say that; it

 8   really does say most of the delay was caused by the

 9   inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of

10   the -- of the institution that appoints them,

11   unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move

12   the case forward.     That looks to me like --

13                 MR. NELSON:        I think -- elsewhere in the

14   opinion, Justice Scalia, I think the court is clear that

15   -- that they were faulting the defender general, and to

16   a lesser extent the court.            I think we are putting more

17   stress on the court's nonfeasance than the Vermont

18   Supreme Court did, but in fact, the time adds up to the

19   same.     The time, we're talking 14 months from

20   Donaldson's assignment until Moore's assignment in

21   August.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you agree -- just

23   following up --

24                 MR. NELSON:        Okay.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry.   Just

 1   following up on your latest answer, do you agree that it

 2   has to be a systemic problem?             I mean, you gave us that

 3   -- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150

 4   cases, I need a -- need a continuance.

 5              What if there's none of that?                  They've got,

 6   you know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy

 7   still delays.   He's responsible for not doing anything

 8   to move the case forward.

 9              MR. NELSON:         Well --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is it still

11   attributable to the State?

12              MR. NELSON:         I don't think -- I don't think

13   the result depends on there being a systemic problem.                I

14   think in this case there was a systemic problem, and the

15   Court knows about that from the findings of the indigent

16   defense task force, which --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the Chief Justice's

18   question, I'm interested in it as well, are there

19   instances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay

20   and have that not attributed to the State?                 Is it always

21   attributed to the State --

22              MR. NELSON:         No.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Just because he's State --

24              MR. NELSON:         Absolutely there can be

25   situations like that, where there is no --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            There is a delay, but it's

 2   not attributable to the State.

 3                MR. NELSON:        It's not attributable to the

 4   State, it's attributable to counsel.                     And just the same

 5   as -- just the same as for private counsel.                     We're not

 6   proposing a two-tiered system there.                     We're --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, when is that?

 8   The -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel

 9   appointed by the State does nothing to move the case

10   forward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme

11   Court touchstone.    When is that attributable to the

12   State and when is it not?

13                MR. NELSON:        It would not be attributable to

14   the State if the assigning agency was -- had no fault,

15   had no supervising duty that it failed to perform, that

16   the lawyer was essentially on his own or her own; and it

17   would also assume, I think, if the delay went on long

18   enough, that there was no fault in the court in failing

19   to --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I --

21                MR. NELSON:        -- to notice that nothing was

22   happening.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It does sound to me,

24   then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic

25   problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont

 1   Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned

 2   counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that

 3   that's attributable to the State, you would disagree

 4   with?   You would say no, there has to be a systemic

 5   problem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but

 6   they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not

 7   supervising them, whatever.

 8               MR. NELSON:        Maybe I'm not using the word

 9   systemic in the same sense you are.                     All I would say is

10   say is it doesn't have to happen to a lot of people, it

11   could happen to just one person, but it would only

12   happen to that one person if a public, State agency was

13   responsible for the delay.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          What if you have a situation

15   in which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant

16   threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws.                    A

17   second attorney is appointed, the client threatens that

18   attorney, the attorney withdraws, and then thereafter a

19   new attorney is pointed, and there is great delay.

20   Maybe more -- two or three attorneys are appointed.

21   There's great delay.      Is -- does the -- does the chain

22   of events that started all this get taken into account

23   or do you just start counting the time from the

24   appointment of the last attorney who wasn't threatened?

25               MR. NELSON:        I think you can't ignore what

 1   happened before, but you can -- but -- but if what

 2   you're saying or suggesting is that earlier bad actions

 3   result in a forfeiture of speedy trial rights, I would

 4   disagree.     The way you -- the way it matters is that by

 5   firing, threatening, unjustifiably getting rid of a --

 6   of a lawyer, you require the next lawyer to spend some

 7   time getting up to speed on the case.                     And that time --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What if a small -- I don't

 9   know how many lawyers are available for appointment in

10   Bennington.    What if it's a small jurisdiction where

11   there aren't that many who are available to be

12   appointed?    And so you fire the public defender, you

13   threaten the first appointed counsel, and pretty soon

14   you don't have very many left, or the ones that you have

15   left are busy with other cases and delay results.

16                 MR. NELSON:        But that's not the case here,

17   and I think my answer to your question is that what

18   makes this a State response -- failure of responsibility

19   is that the State had the ability to do something about

20   it.   If the State's hands are tied, if they run out of

21   legal talent, if there's no other way to get counsel on

22   the case than by a broken-down contract system, which

23   was not the case --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the point that

25   Ms. Rainville made?       And she talked about this balancing


                                         47
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that comes out of Barker, and she said you have to weigh

 2   against the defendant very heavily, the episodes with

 3   lawyer number one and number three, because that was

 4   really bad stuff.    The State is perhaps responsible for

 5   some of the other delays, but she called those "neutral"

 6   in the weighing process.          Don't those two episodes,

 7   counsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who

 8   says his life was threatened by the defendant, don't

 9   those have to count very heavily against the defendant?

10                 MR. NELSON:       Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

11   that Barker works that way.             I think what Barker says is

12   that time which is attributable to the defendant gets

13   subtracted from the total delay; that that's not

14   considered.    That the rest of the time is a period which

15   the State has to account for; and there are -- there

16   will be segments of that time, segments of that delay

17   which are nobody's fault, and those delays would in fact

18   be truly neutral in the sense of they would have no

19   weight against the State; and there are others that

20   would count more or less heavily against the State.

21                 So I think the effect of what went on with

22   Jerry Altieri, which I think was not much more than two

23   months of the total time that he was on board, I think

24   the effect of that is to subtract that period, and then

25   any catch-up period that his firing or his dismissal

 1   required, subtract that period as well from the total,

 2   and weigh the rest more or less heavily or perhaps not

 3   at all against the State.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, the rest, I

 5   couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I

 6   didn't see anything in her representation that would

 7   suggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason

 8   to count that in the speedy trial calculus.                  That runs

 9   from August 2003 to June 2004.

10              MR. NELSON:         To June 2004.            That's correct.

11   I -- I think that the opinion is not clear as to how

12   much responsibility the Vermont court attributed to the

13   State for that period.       Vermont says they charged every

14   second of the -- of that time to the State, and it's

15   quite clear from the opinion that they didn't.                  They

16   said that most of the remaining two years, as of

17   Donaldson's appointment in June of '02, was attributable

18   to the State.   It's not clear how much of that time or

19   if they actually counted it.            I think that any precise

20   calculation of that time period is impossible.

21              We argue, and the record supports, that much

22   of that time had to do with Ms. Moore getting files

23   together, not only from predecessor counsel but from the

24   State, and that the State delayed for many months in

25   providing an updated witness list with current

 1   addresses.     She needed that to interview the witnesses.

 2   The case was old, and she needed the State's help there,

 3   with other discovery material which the record shows --

 4   it's not in the joint appendix, but it is in the printed

 5   case, which was essentially Vermont Supreme Court's

 6   equivalent of an appendix.            These materials were at

 7   issue for Moore.     She needed them.                The prosecutor was

 8   dilatory in providing them.              And I think that that's a

 9   kind of vanilla reason to attribute some of that time to

10   the State.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Nelson --

12                 MR. NELSON:        The court was also --

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- what is your judgment

14   on how much time all together was attributable to the

15   State?

16                 MR. NELSON:        I think 14 -- I think the

17   Vermont court was clear about the 14 months from

18   Donaldson through Moore, including the six months of no

19   counsel.     It adds up to 14 months.                And then the rest of

20   the time I don't think you can put a number on.

21                 Maybe it's not time that we're trying to add

22   up, but responsibility.          And what the -- what the State

23   court was saying was when a case is as old as this one

24   was when Moore took it over, the court should be very

25   vigilant and grudging in its grants of continuances, and

 1   the case could have been tried sooner than in eight

 2   months.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So your 14 months,

 4   just so I understand, that includes the August 2003

 5   through June 2004, when Moore was representing him?

 6                 MR. NELSON:       No.      The 14 months goes from

 7   Donaldson on June 11th, 2002, through Moore's

 8   appointment in August 2003.

 9                 Thank you, Your Honor.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr.

11   Nelson.

12                Ms. Rainville, you have a minute remaining.

13             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE

14                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15                MS. RAINVILLE:          Very quickly then, Justice

16   Ginsburg, the answer to your question, he did receive

17   credit for his time served.

18                The important distinction that the questions

19   raised show, what's so fundamentally wrong about this

20   case, is the distinction between Strickland.                  There you

21   ask the lawyers what they did.               They're given deference.

22   They're given the right to defend themselves.                  And if

23   you prove that it would have had an effect on the

24   outcome of the case, the defendant gets a new trial.

25   Here the lawyers are never asked, no presumption is


                                        51

 1   given, and the defendant is allowed to walk free for the

 2   rest of his life.    It's fundamentally wrong.

 3              Letting a defendant walk free from a crime

 4   is an extraordinary remedy that should only be given in

 5   an extraordinary case, and that case is not this one.

 6              Thank you.

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 8              The case is submitted.

 9              (Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the

10   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
