 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in case 06-694, United States v.

 5   Williams.

 6                General Clement.

 7                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 8   it please the Court:

 9                This Court has made clear that speech

10   proposing an unlawful transaction is not protected by

11   the First Amendment.

12                And speech that falsely proposes an unlawful

13   transaction is likewise unprotected.

14                The statute at issue here properly construed

15   does no more than prohibit efforts to offer or solicit

16   materials that are contraband and then prevents somebody

17   from turning around after soliciting or offering

18   contraband and suggesting that the materials either did

19   not exist or were not contraband after all.                The statute

20   does not prohibit truthful speech about lawful

21   materials.

22                Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in

23   striking the statute down on its face.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But if I could start

25   with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the

 1   other side.    Let's say I'm a movie reviewer.                  I write a

 2   review saying this is an awful movie.                    It portrays child

 3   pornography.    Aren't I presenting information in a way

 4   that would cause others to believe that the movie

 5   contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered

 6   by the statute?

 7                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Mr. Chief Justice, we do

 8   not think that would be covered by the statute.                    We

 9   don't think that that would involve -- in the first

10   point, we don't think it would involve presentation or

11   promotion of the movie in the meaning of this statute.

12                 We think those terms are really limited to

13   efforts to make the product available to the market.

14                 And I think if you read those terms in

15   conjunction with each other, they are all directed at

16   efforts to make the product available to the market.

17                 Now, so if the person whose actually

18   distributing the film wants to try to market it as

19   actual child pornography, then I suppose that would come

20   within the ambit of the statute.                But a movie reviewer

21   does not have anything to worry about in the first

22   instance because I don't think that would come within

23   the term --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose the distributor

25   attaches the movie review.           It's in amazon.com, and then


                                         4

 1   it has the movie review.

 2                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Again, Justice Kennedy, it

 3   might be conceptually possible for somebody to market,

 4   let's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a --

 5   either their own statement or an attached review, that

 6   misrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim

 7   for the movie, that it's actual child pornography.                  I

 8   suppose in that unusual circumstance, it would be

 9   covered.   But I guess it would be equally possible for

10   somebody to take one of the countless mainstream movies

11   that portrays a murder on screen, and say this is

12   actually a snuff film.        There's actually -- this was a

13   snuff film.    This was an actual murder.                Now, somebody

14   who did that would be clearly misrepresenting the film.

15   I don't think they would turn around if somebody tried

16   to do something about that false or misleading speech

17   and be able to defend on that speech because it would be

18   clearly false and misleading speech.

19                 And I think what is important here is if the

20   underlying movie is not child pornography, then truthful

21   efforts to promote that movie won't be captured.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Supposing the underlying

23   movie is a depiction of atrocities being committed in

24   some foreign country, in a war zone or something, by

25   soldiers who rape young kids.              And so it comes within

 1   the literal terms of the statute.               And if one said I'd

 2   like to take a look at this movie, wouldn't that be

 3   covered by the statute?

 4              GENERAL CLEMENT:            If the movie itself comes

 5   within the --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:            The movie itself would be

 7   pictures of soldiers raping young kids.

 8              GENERAL CLEMENT:            And if it were done in a

 9   sufficiently graphic way, that it was captured --

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:            If the news -- I'm

11   thinking of the news reel -- somebody makes as exhibit

12   at a war crimes trial, or something like that -- sees

13   this actually happening.        Now, as I understand the

14   language of the statute, if the person who had that film

15   described it to someone he wanted to send it to, he

16   would violate the statute.

17              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Stevens,

18   there's -- I guess there's an anterior problem, which is

19   if the depiction were sufficiently graphic --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:            They are.

21              GENERAL CLEMENT:            The person that would have

22   that film would be in possession of child pornography,

23   which itself would be a problem under the statute.              He's

24   in the possession of it.

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Depiction of a war crime

 1   taking place?    He saw that on camera -- that would be a

 2   crime?

 3                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           And that might be an

 4   example where, starting with the basic prohibition on

 5   the possession of child pornography, that might be a

 6   situation where there was a valid as-applied challenge.

 7   And that also might be a situation where there would be

 8   a valid as-applied challenge to the pandering and

 9   solicitation provision.         But I think the proper way to

10   analyze that is to ask first whether or not something is

11   covered by the basic prohibition.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You do agree I guess that

13   there are some -- there would be some valid as-applied

14   challenges to this statute.

15                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           I agree, and I think in

16   theory, at least, there may be valid as-applied

17   challenges to the underlying prohibition.                And this

18   Court of course in Ferber recognized that possibility in

19   upholding the basic prohibition on the promotion of

20   child pornography in that context.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But Ferber confined the

22   meaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater

23   extent than this statute does.               It talks about artistic

24   value, but this -- there were several examples given in

25   the briefs.    One was this film depicts 12 year old child


                                         7

 1   having sexual relations with an old man.                  Now that

 2   statement could be perceived as this film shows child

 3   pornography.

 4               Just that statement.               But it's a truthful

 5   statement about Lolita, is it not?

 6               GENERAL CLEMENT:            It is, Justice Ginsburg

 7   but I think in context that would not be something that

 8   comes within the ambit of the statute.                  And again, if

 9   you start with the proposition that --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why not?      If you say --

11   if you say, 12 year old child -- this film shows a 12

12   year old child, and it doesn't tell you that the person

13   who's playing a 12 year old is a young adult?

14               GENERAL CLEMENT:            I understand that, Justice

15   Ginsburg.   What I would say is this statute in order to

16   apply, at least the way we interpret it, requires both

17   an objective and a subjective component.                 And so you

18   would have to have a situation where that promotion of

19   the movie objectively would lead somebody to believe

20   that you're marketing in a manner that portrays it as

21   actual child pornography.          Now I think what you've just

22   said right there would probably fail at the objective

23   test because I think particularly when you start talking

24   about it being a motion picture and the like, the

25   natural assumption -- let's say it's a mainstream motion


                                        8

 1   picture, is going to be oh, that's just actors, it's

 2   probably adult actors, or a body double or something.                     I

 3   don't think that comes within the statute.

 4              The other thing that's required, of course,

 5   is a subjective component -- specific intent is the way

 6   that we would read the statute.             And clearly the person

 7   who's marketing Lolita itself and wants people to go see

 8   it in a mainstream box office does not have the intent

 9   to convey to people that this is actual, forbidden child

10   pornography.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well what if an individual

12   received actual child pornography in the mail that had

13   not been solicited.     And he calls the chief of police in

14   town and says I just opened my mail, and this envelope

15   is full of child porn.       And he's right.             I mean, there

16   are no body doubles.      This is the real thing in here.

17              He has presented child pornography to that

18   chief of police and he's violated the statute, hasn't

19   he?

20              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Justice Souter, I would

21   say that the better answer is no, that he has not.                  Now

22   --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:             You say no, but you say no

24   because we won't enforce it that way.                  But the -- but

25   the objective component and the subjective component in


                                       9

 1   my example are both satisfied.

 2               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Justice Souter, I would

 3   say no for a more fundamental reason, which is I think

 4   you have to read two provisions of the statute here in

 5   pari materia.   And the other provision I think that is

 6   relevant is the affirmative defense that's in subsection

 7   (d) of the statute, which is at 6a of the appendix to

 8   our opening gray brief.        And that provides an

 9   affirmative defense in the situation where somebody is

10   in possession of child pornography.

11               Now, the first problem the person who gets

12   child pornography in the mail has is that the statute --

13   the bans of possession would apply.                     Now, there's an

14   affirmative defense.      The affirmative defense is

15   specific to possession, but one of the things that's a

16   prerequisite to qualify for the affirmative defense,

17   which is in (d)(2)(B) is that you have to afford that

18   material -- you have to afford the agency, the law

19   enforcement agency, access to the material.                     Now --

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's -- that's fine, but

21   before you get to that point, you have -- there's still

22   an indictable offense.       You don't prevent -- you don't

23   present affirmative defenses until you're already

24   indicted.

25               GENERAL CLEMENT:            You're right, Justice


                                       10

 1   Souter, but that is a problem both for the prohibition

 2   on possession and it is not a unique problem for the

 3   pandering solicitation provision.                And I don't think the

 4   fact that you might have to if -- in that situation, you

 5   might have to actually present your affirmative defense

 6   in some case is a reason to strike a ban on possession

 7   as overbroad.   But the --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But the ban on possession

 9   is not the real problem because, under a normal

10   possession statute, you would indeed have a problem not

11   merely in terms of -- that could be raised not merely by

12   affirmative defense but as an element of the statute.

13   If the possession is merely a matter of happenstance,

14   there's an intent problem and presumably there's no --

15   there's no offense.     There's no knowing offense in

16   acquiring material for the possession.

17              But in the pandering statute, what we've got

18   here is there is -- as you put it earlier, there is an

19   understanding which happens to be correct, objectively

20   correct, that there is child porn, and there is a very

21   clear intent to convey that message by way of presenting

22   this material to a third party, in this case the police.

23   So I think this is not merely comparable to the problem

24   of haphazard possession.

25              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Justice Souter, let

 1   me try two responses.      One is I do think you have a

 2   problem even in possession because once you get it in

 3   the mail, your possession of it is knowing.                 And that is

 4   precisely why Congress included this affirmative defense

 5   in the statute.   The second thing I would say though is

 6   again, we have to read these statutes in pari materia,

 7   and if one of the ways you qualify for the affirmative

 8   defense is you afford access to law enforcement agency

 9   of the material, I don't think that which is a

10   prerequisite for qualifying for the affirmative defense

11   can be independently prohibited --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:             What if --

13              GENERAL CLEMENT:             -- by the statute.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             What if you call up your

15   neighbor and say God, I got this disgusting child porn

16   in the mail?

17              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well -- and, again, I

18   think if you did no more than that, I don't know that

19   you would necessarily be covered by the statute, but if

20   you said I got this disgusting child pornography in the

21   mail, it's clearly unlawful, here take a look, I mean I

22   suppose that is covered by the statute.                 But that

23   doesn't seem like a natural reaction.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:             Indeed, it is covered by

25   the statute because I read your brief as saying that the


                                       12
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   statute applies only in instances where either you're

 2   trying to sell it or trade it.              That is what you're

 3   trying -- now it seems to me a different matter if it's

 4   covering only -- covering as well instances where

 5   somebody's simply showing it to someone else to show him

 6   what he got in the mail.         Well, I'd appreciate clarity

 7   on that.

 8              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Justice Breyer, I think

 9   that we would take the position that even if you are

10   presenting the material, making it available, but you're

11   not charging for it, you're not exchanging it, you're

12   just offering it for free, here's a quick free look,

13   it's still covered by the statute.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:             If that's covered by the

15   statute, what you're going to do then is suddenly

16   criminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that

17   goes on in schools all over the place and somebody

18   has -- they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny,

19   but they think it is and it's kind of school-boy

20   behavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not

21   totally certain what it is.            Suddenly that can become a

22   Federal crime.   Seems like quite an extension.            And I

23   thought you'd written your way out of that problem, and

24   now I think you haven't.

25              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Justice Breyer, I

 1   mean, you know, I think you could certainly interpret

 2   the statute to write around that problem if you wanted

 3   to, but I do think the most natural reading of the terms

 4   "promotes, distributes, presents, and advertises" is to

 5   capture not just somebody who is making that available

 6   to the market for sale or for barter, but also somebody

 7   who says look, I have child pornography, I want to get

 8   you interested in this, this is the real stuff, here

 9   take a look.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, that's a very

11   different thing.   I read your brief the same way Justice

12   Breyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply

13   brief, which I understood to be giving "presents," for

14   example in this statute, a promotional meaning in light

15   of the other words around it, "advertises, promotes" and

16   simply telling your -- you know, your neighbor, I got

17   this, what should I do about it, isn't promotional.                 It

18   may be in a technical term "presents," but it's not

19   promotional.

20              And, again, I understood your brief to

21   suggest that you have to interpret all of those words in

22   an advertising, soliciting sense.

23              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

24   here -- I mean I think my first cut at drawing the line

25   would to be say it's not a problem to say, can you


                                       14

 1   believe what I got in the mail, and talk to your

 2   neighbor about it, describe it.

 3                 On the other hand, I do think you're

 4   presenting the materials if you say, I got this in the

 5   mail, look at this, isn't this disgusting, this is

 6   clearly child pornography.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Then take it as

 8   that.

 9                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            If you think though --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Take it as that.      I would

11   say looking and presenting to schoolmates dirty pictures

12   is a fairly common adolescent and post-adolescent

13   activity.     And I would suspect a very high-level

14   percentage of that class of people don't examine too

15   carefully what the age of the individuals depicted is,

16   and many might misrepresent what that age is.                  So this

17   sounds like a statute that has enormous reach, whereas

18   previously I thought it hadn't.

19                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Breyer, if

20   you think that's the difference between expanding this

21   statute in some enormous way and not, then I would

22   invite you to have a more restrictive view of

23   "presents."     And we certainly want you to interpret the

24   statute in a way that renders it not overbroad.                  And, of

25   course, this Court has made clear on a number of


                                         15

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   occasions that, before you get to the overbreadth

 2   analysis, you are applying the early constructions to

 3   make sure that the statute if possible --

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But --

 5              GENERAL CLEMENT:             -- is construed to be

 6   constitutional.   But if I could just -- I'm sorry.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I just wanted to clarify

 8   the footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote

 9   4 in your reply brief.       It says, to the contrary, the

10   government's brief expressly acknowledges that the

11   statute's proscription encompasses noncommercial speech.

12              So I think Justice Breyer's suggestion that

13   you said in your brief, that the statute is limited to

14   commercial speech, is something that you -- say, no,

15   that's not so; we say it encompasses noncommercial

16   speech.

17              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

18   think there may be a distinction to be drawn.            We

19   certainly don't think that it's limited to commercial

20   speech if by "commercial speech" you mean only efforts

21   to buy or sell or even only efforts to barter.            Because

22   we think that somebody who sort of systematically is

23   operating a web site where they are giving away child

24   pornography and advertising it as such would be clearly

25   covered by the statute.


                                       16
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              So, to the extent that the distinction

 2   between commercial and noncommercial is at the line

 3   where you would say you're giving it away gratis, we

 4   think that's still covered.           Now, I gather that maybe

 5   Justice Breyer had a different conception in mind, that

 6   you really have the --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 My understanding was

 8   not that it was limited to commercial speech.                     That was

 9   clear from the footnote that I cited.                  But that

10   "presents" was limited to promotional activity.                    It's

11   one thing to present and say either whether to law

12   enforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to

13   promote the child pornography.             And I thought your brief

14   was adopting a limited construction of words like

15   "presents" that would cover only promotional activity.

16              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, in fairness,

17   Mr. Chief Justice, I think we had a slightly broader

18   conception of "presents."         What we were thinking that

19   "presents" means is really when you are not just sort

20   of -- you know -- in some abstract way talking about

21   presenting the material, but you're actually furnishing

22   the material to somebody else.

23              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, General Clement, is

24   there --

25              GENERAL CLEMENT:            And --

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          Is there anything to suggest

 2   that some of these hypotheticals, where people get child

 3   pornography unsolicited in the mail or that kids at

 4   school are showing each other not just dirty pictures

 5   but actual child pornography, are situations that occur

 6   with any frequency in the real world?

 7               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Not at all, Justice Alito,

 8   and I think that's an important point with respect to

 9   Justice Breyer's hypothetical.              I mean you have to

10   remember that the materials that we're talking about

11   here are in the main materials that are unlawful even to

12   possess.   And it is also true that the -- in the wake of

13   Ferber, a pretty good job was done of getting these

14   materials out of the real world.               So the kind of

15   pictures that are --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry.   I

17   lost -- in your answer, I lost a negative or something.

18   Are you saying that this type of activity frequently

19   occurs or infrequently occurs?

20               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Infrequently occurs --

21   especially in the real world, which is to say when

22   pictures or magazines are being handed around from

23   adolescent to adolescent, there is really no reason in

24   the world to suspect that what's being handed from

25   adolescent to adolescent is child pornography as opposed

 1   to adult pornography -- Playboy and that sort of thing.

 2              Because the truth of the matter is in the

 3   wake of Ferber, a pretty good job has been done in

 4   stamping out child pornography in the real world.                  It

 5   has moved, unfortunately, on to the Internet.                  And, in

 6   that context, when people are promoting it as actual

 7   child pornography or soliciting it as actual child

 8   pornography --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:              The universe of child

10   pornography includes activities of 17-year olds.

11              GENERAL CLEMENT:              It does, Justice Stevens,

12   but so, too, for the basic prohibition.                  And I think

13   what's important here is there may be some definitional,

14   you know, questions.       Or you may have a view that there

15   are applications of the statute that would be

16   unconstitutional.

17              But what's important, I think, is that this

18   pandering and solicitation provision doesn't add some

19   new definition, some more aggressive definition.                  It

20   simply picks up the notion of the basic definition of

21   child pornography, and it says that if you're taking

22   materials and you are offering them to the market as

23   actual child pornography, if you are soliciting actual

24   child pornography, then the government can go after the

25   direct acts of solicitation and offering and -- and --


                                        19

 1   prosecute those acts without --

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Even though -- even

 3   though what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does

 4   not fit the definition?        Even if what you're showing --

 5   you say, have I got some hot child porn and here it is,

 6   and the "it" is -- is -- an adult pretending to be a

 7   child, or a virtual image.

 8               So the -- the problem is not an accurate

 9   representation that this is hardcore porn, and it is,

10   but saying, have I got the real stuff, but what you

11   present is not at all the real stuff.

12               GENERAL CLEMENT:            That's right, Justice

13   Ginsburg.   If the scienter requirements are satisfied

14   and I'm consciously trying to get you to believe that

15   even though I have something that for some technical

16   reason is not the real thing, what I'm offering you is

17   the real thing, the statute does target that.            But that

18   seems to me to not be a First Amendment problem.

19               It seems to be a natural consequence of

20   Congress taking the Court's advice in Free Speech

21   Coalition and moving from a prohibition on materials

22   that had been pandered to the actual acts of pandering

23   and solicitation themselves.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And is that your answer to

25   the -- all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in

 1   the Coalition for Free Speech, the Catholic Bishops, the

 2   advertisement in amazon.com or Netflix, then?

 3                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Kennedy, we

 4   think that all those hypotheticals are taken out with

 5   more than one reason.      I mean, I think from the Catholic

 6   Bishops --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let's -- pardon me.

 8                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Sure.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let's assume for the

10   moment that there are minors, so that the content aspect

11   of it is film.

12                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Oh --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That there are real minors

14   in some of these things.

15                GENERAL CLEMENT:           But are there real minors

16   engaging in forbidden activity?

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

18                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Actual child pornography?

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

20                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, if the underlying

21   material is actually child pornography, then you may be

22   in a different situation.          All of the hypotheticals in

23   that brief were with materials -- the underlying

24   materials were not child pornography.

25                And I think that's an important distinction,


                                       21
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   because if you're taking a movie like "Traffic" or

 2   "American Beauty," which is not child pornography --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Right.

 4              GENERAL CLEMENT:               -- and you're simply

 5   truthfully promoting it, you have nothing to worry about

 6   with this statute.

 7              Now, if you took something -- I also think

 8   that the Catholic Bishop situation isn't covered,

 9   because that is not promoting, presenting and

10   distributing --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               If one had a hand held

12   video at a school or something like that?

13              GENERAL CLEMENT:               Well, I mean, again -- I

14   mean, if you had a hand held video and the video itself

15   was child pornography, and then you got that on the

16   Internet or otherwise and decided you wanted to promote

17   that, I mean would be covered by the statute.                  But --

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               There are two things that

19   you -- that all of us have to work with here.                  One is

20   the scienter component here.              Is that overly broad,

21   vague, and so forth?        The other is the content.

22              And my concern is the same as that indicated

23   by Justice Stevens at the outset.                  There are some

24   terrible practices in the child-trafficking area where

25   children are held in brothels for the most debased of


                                         22

 1   acts.   There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools.

 2               If there are videotapes showing those

 3   things, it seems to me that the statute is -- that

 4   they're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a

 5   killing of a little girl in public might be sadistic.

 6   Assume that that's covered by the statute.

 7               Is there anything in the "presents" and the

 8   "promotes" language in the scienter component of the

 9   statute that gives some protection to these materials?

10   Is it just as-applied?       Is that what we have to do?

11               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Here is how I would try to

12   analyze it, Justice Kennedy, which is I would say that

13   there would be an as- applied challenge there because

14   the basic prohibition on child pornography that would

15   apply to the underlying materials, there would be an

16   as-applied exception to that.             And therefore, the

17   pandering and the solicitation of that would be equally

18   outside the constitutional --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So we want the public to

20   see this to show them how bad it is, and that is

21   permitted under the statute, because it is not

22   "presenting"?

23               GENERAL CLEMENT:            I mean there would be

24   another way to try to get at that.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I agree with you that we


                                       23

 1   have different motives.

 2              GENERAL CLEMENT:              Right.

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But I'm not sure that the

 4   statute covers that.

 5              GENERAL CLEMENT:              Well, there might be a way

 6   in which the statute could cover it, and it would be, as

 7   follows, which basically is if I'm going to portray that

 8   as material that is -- and I'm going to portray it only

 9   in a way that makes it clear that I have a valid

10   as-applied challenge, then I'm not sure I would be

11   satisfying the objective and the subjective scienter

12   requirements for that statute.               Because it would be

13   clear that, although I was presenting it as visual

14   depictions of children who had that happen to them, I

15   was presenting it exclusively for its scientific,

16   artistic, literary value.           And, therefore, in a sense, I

17   was building my as-applied challenge into the way I was

18   marketing it.    I think you could --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Of course, you have a

20   problem not just with the presenting, not just with the

21   pandering of it.    You have a problem with the mere

22   possession of it.    You have to find some exception for

23   that anyway.    You have to find some as- applied

24   challenge exception for the mere possession of it, even

25   if you don't pander it.

 1                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Scalia,

 2   that's exactly right.      And that's why I would think the

 3   logical way to proceed would be you would find an

 4   as-applied exception to the basic prohibition.                     And

 5   then, naturally, that would apply to the pandering

 6   provision.

 7                I was only sort of suggesting, if pressed,

 8   that in some ways it might actually be easier to find a

 9   way to get that outside the statute with respect to the

10   pandering and solicitation provision than for the

11   possession for this.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But how would you do it in

13   the case -- you mentioned that if there is not actual

14   child porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest

15   statement about it, that there is nothing to worry

16   about.

17                But what about the movie reviewer who is

18   reviewing the latest re-release or something of the

19   "Lolita" film and says this depicts sexual activity with

20   a minor?

21                That statement is true.                    It would be taken

22   by some naive people as saying boy, this is what it

23   shows, the real thing.       That is a truthful statement.

24   And yet, it would still fall within the prohibition of

25   the statute.

 1                As I understand your position, the only way

 2   that statement would be truthful in a way that would

 3   excuse would be if the reviewer said this depicts sexual

 4   activity with a minor, but of course the actor wasn't

 5   really a minor.     Isn't that correct?

 6                GENERAL CLEMENT:             No, that is not correct,

 7   Justice Souter.     And I would say that that hypothetical

 8   is outside the ambit of the statute for two reasons.

 9                First of all, I don't think that the movie

10   reviewer is promoting or presenting the underlying

11   materials.   They would be out for that reason.

12                I also think they would be out because, when

13   you started applying the objective and the subjective

14   requirements of the statute, you would not find either

15   of them satisfied with respect to that.

16                If I know you're talking about a mainstream

17   movie, and you say it depicts sex with a minor, I'm not

18   going to naturally think that comes within the ambit of

19   the statute, that it is actual child pornography within

20   the meaning of the statute.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:             What if you are 17 years

22   old and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't

23   read these cases?     You may very well assume that.

24                GENERAL CLEMENT:             With respect, Justice

25   Souter, that's why I think it is important to have both

 1   an objective and a subjective requirement.                And I think

 2   the objective requirement alone would take that out.

 3              If I could reserve the remainder of --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Do we use a seven year old

 5   for the objective requirement?

 6              GENERAL CLEMENT:               No, I wouldn't think so.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:               We would use a --

 8              GENERAL CLEMENT:               I think we would use a

 9   reasonable person.      That's why --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:               -- reasonable adult, I had

11   thought.

12              GENERAL CLEMENT:               Exactly, and that's why I

13   --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Wouldn't we use -- wouldn't

15   we use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to

16   movies?

17              GENERAL CLEMENT:               That would be fine,

18   Justice Souter, and if --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               I would suppose my 17 year

20   old, non- law-school graduate would be within the ambit

21   of the reasonable class.

22              GENERAL CLEMENT:               And I would submit that

23   even a 17 year old, non-law student would know that

24   movies depict things that don't actually happen.                When

25   they see a murder on screen, that's not actually a

 1   murder.     And so I think they would understand that

 2   that's a movie.     It's not child pornography.

 3                 If I may reserve the remainder of my time.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You could -- just one

 5   question.     You mentioned a film, "Traffic," which I did

 6   not see, but one of the briefs said there was an actual

 7   17 year old playing that part.

 8                 But you said that wouldn't be -- that

 9   wouldn't fit.

10                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            "Traffic" is not child

11   pornography.    I understand that the actress was 17 at

12   the time of the film, but we don't think that comes

13   within the ambit of the basic prohibition on child

14   pornography, because we think that simulated sexual

15   activity has to be interpreted with enough subtlety that

16   it doesn't capture that.           And that's the position --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the statute says

18   simulated.

19                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            It does.        But so does the

20   statute in Ferber.      And we don't think that introduced

21   any overbreadth or vagueness that was fatal.                      This

22   statute here just picks up on that definition.                      It

23   doesn't add to it.

24                 If I may reserve --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 1   Mr. Clement.

 2                Mr. Diaz.

 3                ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. DIAZ

 4                    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 5                MR. DIAZ:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7                The pandering provision of the PROTECT Act

 8   carries a 5-year mandatory minimum prison term and a

 9   possible 20-year prison term, has no affirmative defense

10   provision.   It is unconstitutionally vague and

11   overbroad, because on its face it captures protected

12   speech about materials.         And it captures speech about

13   materials that may not even in fact exist.

14                The language "in a manner that reflects the

15   belief, or that is intended to cause another to

16   believe," does not sufficiently define prohibited

17   conduct giving law enforcement unfettered discretion to

18   subjectively enforce the statute.

19                In essence, as the Eleventh Circuit held,

20   the determination does not rest on what materials

21   contain, but rather on how someone conveys his or her

22   impression about what the materials convey.                  In other

23   words, this statute, in short, punishes thought,

24   beliefs, expressions, and opinions.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, there's a

 1   difference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts

 2   about -- what, the legality of a particular type of

 3   pornography or something like that, and a factual

 4   matter?    I thought this was child pornography?                  Saying

 5   this regulates thoughts and beliefs, those are two quite

 6   different questions, aren't they?

 7                MR. DIAZ:      Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

 8   And one of the problems with the statute, and just

 9   another example of what we've been talking about here --

10   amazon.com and Netflix -- there's also, for example, a

11   series of photography that we've seen nationwide by

12   famous photographers of minors or children,

13   photographers of child modeling agencies --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            But none of those -- I

15   mean, we've gone through this with the Solicitor

16   General.   He went through every example in his brief

17   that you've been able to produce, and he said they

18   aren't caught by the statute.              What's wrong with what he

19   said?   Why isn't that so?

20                MR. DIAZ:      If --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            Photographers, for example.

22   That's not child pornography.              And if it was, they would

23   have to act -- if it is child pornography under Ferber,

24   it isn't protected.      If it isn't child pornography under

25   Ferber, well, then there's no problem.                   Okay.   That's

 1   their view of the photographers.                 And the same with

 2   Amazon, the same with Netflix.

 3                 MR. DIAZ:      Correct.          The problem is if I

 4   were to take anything such as the CNN video of an actual

 5   sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, or if I

 6   were to take any of these films, if I were to start an

 7   Internet blog and say, look, this film contains sexual

 8   conduct of a minor, and I think we should do something

 9   about this, I think we should form a coalition or I

10   think we should boycott it.              And I am conveying the

11   belief.     I am intending to make you believe that what

12   those materials contain, albeit what they really have or

13   what they really are, is illegal.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Problem with Ferber, you

15   said.     Same problem.

16                 MR. DIAZ:      Yes, sir.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So what's your response to

18   what he said?     It is the -- with possession.                 You

19   possess these materials.           What you are trying to do is

20   take them to the police and stop them.                    Under Ferber, is

21   that protected or not?         If it is protected, as I think

22   it would be, so is it here.

23                 MR. DIAZ:      I do not think it would be

24   protected.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Then under Ferber he's

 1   going to go right to jail because he has them.             I would

 2   think it would be protected.             I can't imagine somebody

 3   who collects, on these sites where they are molesting

 4   children, material to prevent children being molested

 5   and presents it to the proper authority is going to be

 6   prosecuted under the New York statute in Ferber.

 7                 MR. DIAZ:     If the material substantively

 8   violates the statute, then the mere possession of them

 9   is illegal.    And there is a defense under the possession

10   part of the statute for presenting them to the police

11   within a certain amount of time and within a certain

12   manner of your conduct.

13                 What we're talking about here is not the

14   possession of the materials.             We're talking about the

15   expression about what the materials contain.             Even if

16   you're wrong about it, even if you're mistaken, even if

17   you're lying about it, even if you're bragging about it,

18   the traditional prankster, as Senator Leahy said in the

19   congressional report, one of the things we're concerned

20   about with the statute is that it could capture people

21   who are expressing salacious thoughts.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Or just good honest liars,

23   right?   I had thought that the purpose of the First

24   Amendment was to protect speech that had some value, and

25   that the reason obscenity is excluded entirely from


                                        32

 1   First Amendment protection is that it has no redeeming

 2   social value.

 3              What social value do you find in being able

 4   to lie about the content of what you're offering to

 5   somebody else?   You say somehow if you're lying about

 6   it, oh, well, then the First Amendment protects that.               I

 7   would think if you're lying about it, it is clearer than

 8   ever the First Amendment doesn't protect it.             There is

 9   no social value in protecting lies.

10              MR. DIAZ:       One of the problems with the

11   issue of social value and lying is that we don't put

12   people in jail for 5 mandatory minimum years or 20 years

13   in prison for simply lying.            We simply don't do that.     I

14   agree with Your Honor --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But it depends on what

16   they're lying about.      If they're lying about the value

17   of what they're selling, you know, it's fraud.

18              MR. DIAZ:       And I agree with Your Honor --

19   Justice Scalia, that we have a slew of State statutes

20   particularly in the area of consumer fraud.             If I

21   pretend to have something that's illegal and offer it to

22   you or promote it to you or advertise it to you, and I

23   have nothing, then that person can and should be

24   punished, but not for -- not under this statute.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Tell me what social value

 1   are we protecting here, by protecting the lie about

 2   whether this thing that really isn't child pornography

 3   is?   What -- why would we want to protect that?

 4                MR. DIAZ:      We necessarily do not want to

 5   protect that.    But we don't punish it with a 5 to

 6   20-year prison sentence.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are you complaining about

 8   the degree of the penalty?

 9                MR. DIAZ:      It is not just the degree of the

10   penalty.    The statute doesn't just cover liars, Justice

11   Scalia.    It also covers people who are mistaken.                  It

12   covers exaggeration.       It covers puffing.

13                For example, if I have a legitimate clean

14   videotape that I want to duplicate, I may be violating

15   trademark or other patent laws or whatnot, but I want to

16   take this and I want to sell it in the marketplace over

17   the Internet.    And I exaggerate by the words that I

18   choose to use in promoting that tape for commercial

19   purpose, for example, and I'm exaggerating.

20                That person if they market the materials in

21   a way that causes the potential buyers to believe that

22   what it has is illegal, even if I'm just puffing or

23   bragging, the car salesman in a car sales situation, we

24   don't like it --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But that's an

 1   entirely different thing to say that this car is a great

 2   car and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say

 3   what you have is either -- is not -- is child

 4   pornography when, in fact, it's not.                      Those are two

 5   different things.

 6              MR. DIAZ:         I think it could be very -- in

 7   the real world I think it is very easy for a person to

 8   puff about what materials contain that are lawful to

 9   possess, such as Titanic, Lolita or American Beauty.

10   And all you would have to say is, put a trailer on it

11   and say that this is hot graphic teen sex, and you're

12   puffing about what it really is.                 We know -- you know it

13   really isn't.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    The statute has an

15   objective component.        To the objective observer, it must

16   reasonably cause them to believe that it's actually

17   child pornography.      So that -- that would be -- that

18   would prevent sort of the vague puffery that you're

19   talking about from being covered while still covering

20   something that satisfies both the subjective and

21   objective test.

22              MR. DIAZ:         Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

23   if a person listens to or hears somebody describe

24   Titanic, Lolita, American Beauty or any of the films of

25   the like as hot graphic teen sex, I think a reasonable

 1   ordinary person could believe that what is being

 2   portrayed is proscribed material, even if it doesn't

 3   exist, or even if it exists and is protected under

 4   Ferber.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You seem to think we are

 6   punishing the lying.      I don't read the statute as

 7   punishing the lying.

 8              MR. DIAZ:       No, Justice Scalia.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You'd be punished even if

10   it were true.   What is being punished is the pandering.

11   You are the one that's bringing in the lying example.

12   You say, my goodness, even if the pandering is a lie,

13   pandering is pandering.        And I don't see why there is

14   some special protection against pandering when in

15   addition to pandering, you're lying.

16              Maybe you ought to get extra penalty.

17              (Laughter.)

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But, in fact, the statute

19   does not provide extra penalty.              It just provides a

20   penalty for pandering.       And I don't know why it's a good

21   defense to that to say, oh, I was actually lying.                 I

22   mean --

23              MR. DIAZ:       I don't think -- I think the

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What about "present"?

 2   The word "pandering" itself is not used in the statute.

 3   It uses a lot of words, "promote" and "advertise" --

 4   well, maybe that's just redundant.                   I guess that would

 5   be the government's position -- but "present,"

 6   "distribute" -- what else?

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:             All of those verbs only

 8   become pandering when they are attached to explicit

 9   sexual material.     When you promote explicit sex, you are

10   pandering.   I mean, the word pandering does have a

11   sexual connotation.       I -- I think -- I had thought it

12   was accepted that we have here a statute that's directed

13   against pandering.

14                MR. DIAZ:       But the problem with the statute,

15   while it does capture pandering and illegal conduct, it

16   goes beyond that and captures a slew of innocent conduct

17   which we discussed this morning in the examples --

18                JUSTICE ALITO:           What would you say is the

19   best realistic example that you can provide to show that

20   this is overbroad?

21                MR. DIAZ:       The best and realistic example

22   would be any person, not necessarily amazon.com or

23   Netflix, it could be a private citizen.                   It could be a

24   religious leader of a religious group, regardless of

25   what type of religion we're talking about.

 1                 It could be any of those people --

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Doing -- doing what?

 3                 MR. DIAZ:     Who look at the -- the Nan Goldin

 4   pictures, who look at Lolita, Traffic and all of these

 5   other movies and harbor a belief that it is obscene,

 6   which is one of the two types of materials that's

 7   proscribed.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Suppose we did this?     What

 9   would you think about an opinion, and why, which says

10   the following?    We take every one of those examples and

11   all the ones listed here and put them in appendix A, and

12   the opinion says this is the Solicitor General's

13   interpretation of the statute, as amended, say with the

14   word presentment, which comes out of promotion infer,

15   and we think under that interpretation of the statute,

16   none of these things, nor anything like them, could be

17   prosecuted.

18                 And if so understood, we can find no

19   example, at least none not present in Ferber itself,

20   where this would be overbroad.               Therefore, it is

21   constitutional.    I'm not saying that is my view.              I am

22   saying simply I want to know your opinion about what

23   would be wrong with such an opinion.

24                 MR. DIAZ:     My opinion, Justice Breyer, is

25   that could be done.       We could put a dozen or two dozen


                                        38

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   or three dozen, an exponential number of examples, that

 2   would be excluded.      Essentially we would be writing an

 3   affirmative defense into the statute or an absolute

 4   defense that would prohibit even the prosecution.                  The

 5   concern that that raises for me, in answer to Your

 6   Honor's question, is you're still going to have a

 7   chilling on free speech.           There are still going to be

 8   people out there who are not covered by one of these

 9   examples who we haven't thought of, and that person is

10   going to be afraid to express opinions.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, I suppose if we were

12   going to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent

13   for us to reexamine our overbreadth rule.                 Your client

14   here falls within none of these examples.                 He was

15   convicted of having what everyone recognizes as not only

16   child pornography but involving a very small child.                 And

17   he knew what it was.        And he -- and he conveyed that

18   belief.

19              Given the fact that it would appear that

20   child pornography is a growing problem, a serious

21   problem on the Internet, maybe we should examine the

22   overbreadth rule and just say that your client cannot

23   make this challenge.

24              MR. DIAZ:         The Court can certainly do that,

25   Justice Kennedy.   Essentially, though, I think what the


                                         39
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Court would be doing would be taking the four areas of

 2   speech that have been taken out of the First Amendment

 3   protection, which is defamation, the fighting words

 4   under Brandenburg, Miller, which is obscenity, and the

 5   additional extension of Ferber.                Now what we would be

 6   doing is carving yet another area of speech out of the

 7   First Amendment, and we're just going to continue

 8   chipping it away and chipping it away.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No.   I don't think

10   that is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point.                   You

11   wouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment.                     You

12   would be saying we're going to treat this area like

13   other areas, which would say that whoever is challenging

14   it has to show that they're a problematic case.

15                In other words, your client is relying -- he

16   didn't produce Lolita.         You're relying on the effect on

17   other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine

18   allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's

19   protected.   And what I understood the question to

20   suggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied

21   challenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would

22   hear from them, but not in your case.

23                MR. DIAZ:       That certainly could be done,

24   Mr. Chief Justice.      Again, and as I suggested earlier,

25   the problem with that is that we're not talking about

 1   anything less than a criminal statute, a criminal

 2   statute that implicates the First Amendment, freedom and

 3   thought which this Court since its very existence has

 4   said we have to honor and respect, even if people are

 5   thinking about nasty or dirty things.

 6               That's what this country is based upon, and

 7   the grave concern if we're going to do it on an

 8   as-applied challenge, is people who might be afraid to

 9   express their views about whether this is or is not

10   obscene.   It's is the parent of a neighborhood group who

11   see a movie and wants to tell everybody about it and

12   say, look --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:           Here we have -- we have one

14   statute that covers advertising, promoting, presenting,

15   distributing, and soliciting.              Suppose that all of those

16   activities were not lumped together in one statute, and

17   there was a separate provision for each, and suppose

18   that the Court were to conclude that there is a problem

19   with one of them.    Let's say promotes or presents.

20               Would all of the others fall as well, under

21   the overbreadth doctrine, if they were set out in

22   separate statutory provisions?

23               MR. DIAZ:       I believe that that would more

24   narrowly tailor the statute, but I don't believe,

25   Justice Alito, that it would solve the problem of

 1   chilling speech.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but isn't the problem

 3   the problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's

 4   hypothetical.    He said, you know, what if we have this

 5   appendix and we list -- I forget what he said, three

 6   dozen examples that the Solicitor General says wouldn't

 7   be covered and that sounds fine to us.                   Your answer was

 8   well, there would still be some examples not covered.

 9               But isn't -- isn't the answer to that that

10   there would be some conceivable overbreadth, I suppose,

11   no matter what the appendix said?                 Somewhere out there

12   there would be an example not covered that would be the

13   basis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be

14   substantial overbreadth.          And isn't that the case?          That

15   if Justice Breyer's hypo were in fact the decision of

16   this case, there wouldn't be a fair argument that there

17   is any substantial overbreadth left to the statute,

18   isn't that so?

19               MR. DIAZ:       That -- it could be, and that

20   would depend.    I agree with Your Honor, Justice Souter,

21   that we have this world or this universe of overbroad

22   speech, and the appendix would shrink it and make it

23   narrower.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And rewrite -- and

25   essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question


                                        42

 1   about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed.

 2   This Court is not generally in the business of writing

 3   appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in

 4   this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we

 5   put those contours around it.             Certainly the Court could

 6   write an opinion that would inform Congress why this

 7   particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain

 8   what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad.

 9               But for the Court itself, I think that

10   that -- I don't know any instance in which we have

11   provided that kind of appendix that said things that are

12   like Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like

13   something else are not okay.            I don't know.

14               MR. DIAZ:      With respect, my initial response

15   to Justice Breyer's suggestion, if you will, was the

16   same as Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg.                    I don't know that

17   creating an appendix of examples is going to cure the

18   problem.   I do concede that it would lessen the problem.

19   We would -- we would --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why would it lessen?           I

21   assume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these

22   other situations that are not before us are not covered.

23   Isn't that the most blatant dictum?                     But -- but -- and,

24   of course, we're not bound in later cases by our dicta.

25   But come to think of it, I guess the whole doctrine of


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   overbreadth rests upon dictum, doesn't it?                      It -- it

 2   rests upon our determination in this case, which

 3   involves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child

 4   porn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in

 5   this case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases,

 6   where we would not hold the person guilty.                      That is all

 7   dictum, too, isn't it?

 8                 So I guess the whole doctrine is -- is based

 9   on dictum.    So we may as well put it in all an appendix.

10   Let's put our dictum in an appendix.                      I agree.

11                 MR. DIAZ:      In answer to Your Honor's

12   question or comment --

13                 (Laughter.)

14                 MR. DIAZ:      -- the -- I agree that the issue

15   of overbreadth is something where we're looking at

16   boundaries.    And that's really what I think the Court

17   does in a situation of overbreadth analysis.                         You look

18   at the boundaries.      How much -- how far we've gone

19   outside of the boundaries of what is protected.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but it's the

21   boundary between what is -- what should be protected in

22   relation to what's unprotected.

23                 So what's the ratio between legitimate films

24   like Lolita and illegitimate child pornography?                        In

25   other words, is, in fact, the protected material

 1   substantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?

 2               MR. DIAZ:      The problem is we don't have an

 3   empirical answer, a mathematic answer to that question.

 4   What we do know is that films like Lolita, American

 5   Beauty, and whatnot, which if presented in a certain way

 6   can bring people under the coverage of the statute, have

 7   received acclaim around the world, I mean all sorts of

 8   academy awards.   They're seen time and time again.

 9   They're seen on Netflix.         They're seen on cable TV.     To

10   this day, some of these movies have been around for 30

11   years.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            Of course, the point of the

13   -- the point of the appendix, which unfortunately has

14   the failing of many charming metaphors, is that it has

15   acquired a life of its own.

16               (Laughter.)

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            It distracts from the

18   question.   But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's

19   interpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking

20   the word "presentment" from its context in Ferber, where

21   it was part of the definition of promotion, I thought

22   that was the appendix.       At least, that's my hypothetical

23   question.   And so whether you like appendices or don't

24   like appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the

25   appendix I'm talking about?


                                       45

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              He's filled it with qualifications using the

 2   words "knowingly, reasonable," and a context that if it

 3   is not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least

 4   commercial plus a few things such as bartering.

 5              That was really my question, and you've come

 6   back to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one

 7   thing I think his definition keeps out of this

 8   discussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I

 9   don't see under his interpretation how anyone could

10   conceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a

11   group who have never seen a movie.                  That isn't a

12   reasonable group of people.             So what is your response to

13   what he said?

14              MR. DIAZ:        My response, Justice Breyer, is

15   that if you take the word "present" and you give it the

16   meaning that it was given in Ferber, you make the

17   statute narrower.    You make it -- bring it into more of

18   a constitutionally acceptable realm, but I respectfully

19   do not believe that it cures the entire problem, and my

20   basis for saying that the question of Justice Souter of

21   the Solicitor General.        You know -- the concern is, when

22   you don't have lawyers who understand these

23   hypertechnical meanings that the Court is going to give

24   and the interpretations we're going to put on them --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But isn't the answer to


                                        46

 1   that you may still have some overbreadth left, but it's

 2   not substantial?   Most 17 year olds are, in fact, going

 3   to realize that the real thing is not going on in, you

 4   know, the Lolita movie.        And if we accept that as a

 5   factual proposition, which was the Solicitor General's

 6   answer, and if we also accept, not by way of appendix

 7   but way of rationale in the opinion, that these various

 8   activities have got to be given an essentially

 9   commercial or quasi-commercial character, so that they

10   don't pick up the conversations with the neighbor, then

11   that's simply a matter of statutory interpretation that

12   could be part of our rationale.              If we accept the

13   factual proposition about what reasonable viewers are

14   likely to know, and we engage in that kind of

15   interpretation following the Solicitor General's view of

16   how this serial list of activities should be construed,

17   don't we eliminate the possibility -- wouldn't we

18   eliminate the possibility of substantial overbreadth?

19   Some things may get by.        There may still be legitimate

20   applied challenges, but substantial overbreadth, would

21   that be left?

22              MR. DIAZ:       I think it would, but concededly

23   to a lesser degree, because once you make it clear as to

24   what matters are not covered by the statute, it makes it

25   easier for people to conform their conduct and their


                                       47

 1   words accordingly.      The concern that I have is that it

 2   still chills a -- it still chills free speech.                  If a

 3   person looks at an appendix or looks at the rationale in

 4   the Court's opinion in this case --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:               It can, but can you give me

 6   an example of a class of activities that would not be,

 7   in effect, insulated from indictment by these two steps

 8   in the opinion, that would be of substantial character?

 9              MR. DIAZ:         Certainly, and I go back to the

10   question of Justice Breyer which is adolescents, 17 year

11   olds, 18 year olds, who like to look at these types of

12   materials and one of them could simply say to another

13   over the Internet, you know, do you think we can get

14   some hardcore child porn?            He's soliciting child porn

15   from another person, and that individual, that 17 year

16   old kid, who's fantasizing or experimenting with his own

17   sexuality, can go to jail for 5 to 20 years.                  And we see

18   that in everyday America, in high schools around the

19   country.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Do we see them getting

21   prosecuted in any state?

22              MR. DIAZ:         If he's soliciting materials

23   under sub (i) or sub (ii) of the statute, of the

24   pandering provision of the statute, yes.                  That person

 1   prosecuted.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I asked you have there

 3   been such cases?    A lot of states have pandering laws

 4   now, and is the case that you posit a case that has

 5   occurred in any of those states?

 6                 MR. DIAZ:     Your Honor, I cannot cite a

 7   specific example, but I can certainly tell Your Honor

 8   this -- prosecutions from 1997 to 2004 have increased

 9   over 452 percent.    The conviction rate --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Maybe that's because the

11   quantity of material has increased.

12                 MR. DIAZ:     Exactly.          And the conviction rate

13   is 99.6 percent.    And --

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         And if one person says to

15   another, can we get some child pornography, how is that

16   solicitation?

17                 MR. DIAZ:     "Can you get me."

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Oh, "can you get me."

19                 MR. DIAZ:     "Can you get me."

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         And you think that's

21   protected by the First Amendment?                 Asking someone for

22   child pornography is protected?

23                 MR. DIAZ:     First of all, it may not be

24   protected by the First Amendment, but it shouldn't be

25   captured by this statute, which puts that 17 year old in

 1   jail for 5 to 20 years.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The only thing that

 3   limits the statute is the First Amendment.                 What else --

 4   you say it may not be covered by the First Amendment.

 5   What else gives you a right to challenge the statute?

 6                 MR. DIAZ:     I don't think that it is

 7   necessarily not covered by the First Amendment.                 I think

 8   certainly the First Amendment -- and this Court has

 9   held, that we protect salacious thoughts, salacious

10   ideas.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But it's not thought at that

12   point.   It's a request to obtain contraband, which fuels

13   the production of the contraband.                 Is it protected by

14   the First Amendment or not, soliciting child

15   pornography?

16                 MR. DIAZ:     I think the First Amendment is

17   implied, but I don't think it becomes criminal conduct

18   until you get to either an attempt, solicitation, or a

19   conspiracy.    You have to do more than just say I would

20   like to get it or can you get it for me, to be guilty of

21   the statute.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:         To fall -- to fall under the

23   statute or to be protected by the First Amendment or not

24   protected by the First Amendment?

25                 MR. DIAZ:     Right.

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Which is it?

 2                 MR. DIAZ:      To fall within the protection of

 3   the First Amendment.        And another example that comes to

 4   mind is a person has material which they believe is

 5   child pornography.      They give it to somebody else, such

 6   as Lolita, for an opinion and they present to it that

 7   person.   One of the biggest problems or one of the

 8   biggest -- the verb that's most objectionable in the

 9   statute is "present," because it does not have to have

10   any commercial requirement.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:          I mean the model penal code

12   has a general prohibition of soliciting illegal

13   activities.    Are you saying that that's -- that

14   provision violates the First Amendment?                   Because it's

15   just words?

16                 MR. DIAZ:      Solicitation is a crime in and of

17   itself, and talking about or expressing a desire to

18   obtain is not -- doesn't quite go to the level of

19   solicitation or intent, where there has to be a

20   proximity in time, in immediacy, and a certain

21   geographical proximity between the words and the comment

22   that you intend.

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:          But I thought the word in

24   the statute is "solicit."

25                 MR. DIAZ:      Well, there's "solicit" and

 1   there's also "present."        It works in both directions.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:         If you're asking somebody

 3   for child pornography, you're not presenting child

 4   pornography.

 5                MR. DIAZ:     Correct.          I agree.

 6                Thank you, Your Honor.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Mr. Diaz.

10                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

11                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Thank you, Mr. Chief

13   Justice.

14                Overbreadth, as this court has reminded us

15   any number of times, is strong medicine, and that is

16   why, even in the First Amendment context, as-applied

17   challenges remain the basic building blocks of

18   adjudication.   Rejection of this overbreadth challenge

19   here does not mean that the courts will not be open to

20   here as-applied challenges going forward.                Of course,

21   the Respondent here has no claim that the statute is

22   unconstitutional as applied to him.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can we reject the

24   overbreadth challenge here and still leave an

25   overbreadth doctrine for some other cases?                I'm not sure


                                       52

 1   how we could do that.

 2               GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, I think you could,

 3   Justice Kennedy.    You could -- I mean the burden here is

 4   on the challenger who doesn't say that the statute's

 5   unconstitutional as-applied to them to show substantial

 6   overbreadth in absolute terms and relative to the

 7   statute's legitimate sweep.             And it's interesting that

 8   neither Respondent nor the court of appeals ever engaged

 9   in that latter inquiry.         And that's a critical inquiry.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How is it different it

11   would be strange to trust out the document -- the

12   doctrine as I -- as I understand it is what we relied on

13   when we had the predecessor to this statute before.

14               GENERAL CLEMENT:             Justice Ginsburg I'm not

15   urging that you get rid of overbreadth doctrine once and

16   for all -- probably be in the government's interest.                I

17   am simply saying that if you apply overbreadth analyses,

18   the way it supposed to be applied it's not satisfied

19   here.   It's not just enough for you to envision a couple

20   of hypotheticals.    It has to be the overbreadth has to

21   be substantial relative to the legitimate sweep of the

22   statute.   This Court in Virginia against Hicks said

23   faulted the lower court opinion because it had no

24   analyses whatsoever of valid versus invalid

25   applications.   The proportionality aspect of this courts


                                        53

 1   overbreadth jurisprudence was ignored entirely.                  That

 2   could be verbatim the holding of this case.                  The 11

 3   circuit did engage in that relative analysis.                  When my

 4   brother was asked for empirical evidence about the

 5   comparison he said he didn't have any.                  With all due

 6   respect, I think that's fatal to his case.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How did that occur in --

 8   free speech coalition.

 9               GENERAL CLEMENT:            I think, in the way I

10   would explain that is I didn't think you get -- you

11   found there was such absolute overbreadth that you

12   didn't even reach the proportionality inquiry.                 In any

13   invent Hicks was decided afterwards, and I think Hicks

14   makes very clear that you have to have both absolute and

15   relative.   I would say one last thing, though.                This is

16   first and foremost you start with the facts of this case

17   and the facts of this case I think caution against

18   reading the word presents out of the statute or reading

19   it unduly narrowly.

20               The gravamen of the pandering here was not

21   just the offer of pictures of this individual and his

22   daughter, but was his claim that I can post these actual

23   images of child pornography on this group site because

24   I'm for real and I'm not an undercover agent.                 Now that

25   seems to be within the epicenter of the statute but it's

 1   not for profit.      It was doing it to establish his bona
