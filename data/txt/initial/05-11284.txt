 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN

 8                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 9              MR. OWEN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              When this Court granted review in mid

12   October in these consolidated cases, the cases

13   exemplified the Fifth Circuit's settled approach to

14   reviewing claims of error under this Court's 1989

15   decision in Penry v. Lynaugh.              In both cases the court

16   below failed to take seriously the requirement that

17   capital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect

18   to the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's

19   evidence, and in both cases the court below found as a

20   factual matter, both against common sense and this

21   Court's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard

22   evidence that a defendant had experienced significant

23   mistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental

24   impairments as an adult as reasons to find him less

25   dangerous rather than more dangerous.

 1                But those opinions, however incorrect, no

 2   longer represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry.                In

 3   mid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc

 4   decision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn

 5   away from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to

 6   follow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and

 7   Smith.    Under such circumstances, where the assumption

 8   that we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant

 9   review in this case has been so profoundly changed by an

10   intervening decision of the court below, we respectfully

11   suggested by motion that the Court return these cases,

12   vacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit

13   for further consideration in light of the new opinion in

14   Nelson.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why, when we are told

16   that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in

17   this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so

18   all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting

19   the Nelson case for this one?

20                MR. OWEN:      I don't believe, Your Honor,

21   that, that all that would be accomplished by that would

22   be certainly not just delay.             I think that if the Court

23   chooses to wait for the State's cert petition in Nelson,

24   the Court could certainly put our cases aside and hold

25   them awaiting Nelson -- Nelson's cert petition should be


                                         5

 1   filed by mid March -- and then could make its judgment

 2   about whether to grant cert in Nelson or not.

 3               If it granted cert in Nelson it could decide

 4   the three cases together; if it found Nelson raised no

 5   questions that were worthy of review, it could either

 6   proceed to decide these cases or send them back to the

 7   Fifth Circuit.    I think that the State's decision,

 8   though, Your Honor, is based on a, a misreading of

 9   Nelson.   I think that the State has suggested to the

10   Court that Nelson is in the State's phrase a narrow

11   fact-based decision and I think that's not, I think

12   that's not a fair characterization of the Nelson --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, why can't we just

14   read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not

15   it's correct?

16               MR. OWEN:       I think the main reason, Your

17   Honor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that

18   Nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the

19   Court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle,

20   rather than trying to use in effect these cases to

21   decide issues that are presented by a different set of

22   facts.

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:             If these cases aren't

24   Nelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases;

25   it seems to me.

 1                MR. OWEN:      Well, Your Honor, I am, I am

 2   confident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the

 3   merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits,

 4   until it finds --

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, why don't you try to

 6   convince us of that?

 7                MR. OWEN:      Then let me turn, let me turn to

 8   our, our merits, Your Honor.

 9                The issue before the Court in this case as

10   we said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors

11   a meaningful basis for considering the relevant

12   mitigating qualities of these two Defendants' mitigating

13   evidence.    In Mr. Brewer's case that included the fact

14   that he was hospitalized for treatment for a major

15   episode of depression about three months before the

16   murder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had

17   suffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional

18   abuse from his father as a teenager.                     In Mr. Cole's case

19   the evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and

20   deprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself

21   emotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic

22   depression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of

23   emotional turmoil and problems that continued into

24   adulthood.

25                And in addition to that, the expert who


                                         7

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   testified at Mr. Cole's trial indicated that he had been

 2   given a set of generally accepted neuropsychological

 3   tests and that on those tests he had scored below normal

 4   and on some of them very far below normal, under the

 5   fifth percentile.    And as a result that he probably

 6   suffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction

 7   which limits his impulse control.                 We respectfully

 8   suggest that under this Court's decision in Penry, those

 9   are all the kinds of facts about these two Defendants

10   that could reasonably support a juror in concluding that

11   a life sentence rather than the death penalty was an

12   appropriate sentence.

13                 But because the jurors were never asked

14   whether the mitigating evidence reduced the Defendant's

15   culpability in such a way as to call for a life

16   sentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable.

17   The jurors are asked only two questions as the Court

18   well knows.    But just to review, under the pre-1991

19   Texas statute jurors were only asked two questions:                 Was

20   the crime committed deliberately and is the Defendant

21   likely to pose a continuing threat to society?                And

22   those instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier

23   this morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the

24   verdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so

25   this Court has held repeatedly that whether that two


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question format satisfies the Eighth Amendment's

 2   individualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the

 3   evidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's

 4   argued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about

 5   the meaning of their instruction.

 6              And we believe that in this case, throughout

 7   the trial -- in both of these cases, excuse me --

 8   throughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told

 9   that they were not entitled in deciding the future

10   dangers test question to engage in any sort of broad

11   inquiry into these Defendants' moral culpability.

12   Instead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear

13   to the jurors during jury selection that in answering

14   the future dangerousness question you must put to one

15   side your opinion about whether the Defendant's

16   background, for example, calls for a particular sentence

17   and answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put

18   it, the basis of the facts.            And we feel that the

19   evidence in this case very strongly would have supported

20   the inference that these, both of these Defendants were

21   likely to be dangerous --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How would you

23   compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?

24              MR. OWEN:      I think, Your Honor --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 These are closer


                                       9

 1   cases than Penry, I think.            You'd have to concede that,

 2   wouldn't you?

 3                 MR. OWEN:      I think they are different cases,

 4   Your Honor, I'm not willing to concede that they are

 5   closer cases.     I think that in, in the juror's mind, the

 6   only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in

 7   these cases is that the Defendants are likely to be

 8   dangerous in the future.           That is exactly the same

 9   conclusion that would have been compelled by the

10   evidence in Penry.      I think that --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How does that, if the

12   evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's

13   still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of

14   some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.

15                 MR. OWEN:      Absolutely.             Absolutely, Your

16   Honor,.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So you -- if your case is

18   less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other

19   way.     But it doesn't mean that those factors are not

20   mitigating factors.

21                 MR. OWEN:      I couldn't agree more, Your

22   Honor.     I think it's very clearly settled by Tennard and

23   other cases going back to 1976 that facts like a

24   deprived or abused background or mental impairment are

25   certainly mitigating.        And with further response to your

 1   --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Tennard, Tennard was

 3   decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?

 4               MR. OWEN:      This Court's decision in Tennard

 5   postdates the State court decisions in both of these

 6   cases.   Yes, Your Honor.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And where is -- this is an

 8   AEDPA case, isn't it?

 9               MR. OWEN:      Yes, Your Honor.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So we're, we're asking

11   whether this State court made an unreasonable decision

12   at the time, and at the time regardless of what the

13   Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson,

14   and -- and there is another earlier case, we said that

15   you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long

16   as there was some manner in which mitigating effect

17   could be given that was enough.

18               MR. OWEN:      The Court has been consistent --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So I think Tennard is

20   utterly irrelevant even if it is right.

21               MR. OWEN:      I, I -- I don't agree.        And

22   here's why, Your Honor.        Tennard was itself both a

23   habeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism

24   act, like these two cases.          And so in Tennard the Court

25   was called on to decide not squarely the question of


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether the State court decision in that case had been

 2   objectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable

 3   jurist could have found it to be objectively

 4   unreasonable such that a certificate of appealability

 5   was warranted.

 6               Mr. Tennard's case was decided by the State

 7   court in 1997, so I think it is immanent in this Court's

 8   ruling in Tennard that at least as of 1997, it was

 9   apparent that a, a low IQ score alone implicated the

10   concerns of Penry.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Did Tennard purport to

12   overrule Smith, even when it came down?                       It simply, it

13   simply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's

14   concurrence in an earlier case.                It certainly didn't

15   purport to overrule Smith?

16               MR. OWEN:        I, I see where Your Honor is --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I'm sorry, Johnson, not

18   Smith.

19               MR. OWEN:        Yes.        And I, and I --           no, it

20   didn't purport to overrule Johnson.                       And the reason why

21   is this:   I think the concept that ties this Court's

22   cases together on Penry is this concept of meaningful

23   consideration.     Because Your Honor focused on one bit of

24   language from Johnson:         the jury has to be able to give

25   some effect.     Elsewhere in the Johnson opinion the Court


                                         12
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   said there has to be a meaningful basis for giving

 2   effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the

 3   evidence.   And I think neither of those two phrases can

 4   be read out of the context of the other.

 5               In other words, it can't just be some

 6   imaginable, conceivable, strained effect.                 It has to be

 7   some effect which speaks sensibly to the way that a

 8   juror would -- would understand the evidence to relate

 9   to future dangerousness.         In the Johnson case, the

10   defendant's evidence was his chronological youth, and I

11   believe that it was, it is sensible for the Court to

12   find that a reasonable juror could conclude that, that

13   its relevance to culpability and its relevance to future

14   dangerousness are essentially coextensive.                 This case is

15   not like that.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In Brewer --

17               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, in Johnson wasn't

18   there also --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Go ahead.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          Wasn't there also mitigating

21   evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth,

22   which is analogous to what was involved at least -- well

23   in both of these cases?

24               MR. OWEN:      Very little such evidence, Your

25   Honor, in Mr. Johnson's case.             And in that case moreover


                                       13

 1   this Court's question presented, the question on which

 2   it granted review, was limited to the question of age,

 3   so this Court didn't reach or decide in Johnson the

 4   question of whether the other facts about Johnson's

 5   background that found their way before the jury might

 6   have been within the jurors' effective reach.

 7              And I do think that the specific evidence in

 8   Johnson again was argued as a basis for a finding of

 9   nondangerousness, of rehabilitatability.                  That's utterly

10   untrue of evidence in Mr. Brewer's case and Mr. Cole's

11   case, where I think it's very clear that the evidence is

12   being offered to provide some kind of explanation for

13   the jurors about what caused these men to commit these

14   terrible crimes, not that --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But in, in Brewer's

16   case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one

17   hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic

18   major depression.    So it was certainly opened for a jury

19   to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in

20   assessing the likelihood that there was going to be

21   further violent behavior.

22              MR. OWEN:        I don't think, Your Honor --

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Quite a bit

24   different than Penry.

25              MR. OWEN:        I don't think that you can

 1   separate the diagnosis of depression, that, even that

 2   one single episode of hospitalization for depression,

 3   from what the jury knew about Mr. Brewer's upbringing,

 4   from the fact that they knew he had been hit by his

 5   father in the terms of, his mother said, numerous times.

 6   He was struck with the butt of a pistol, he was hit with

 7   a flashlight, he was hit with a stick of firewood.                   His

 8   father told him if you ever raise your hand to me you

 9   better kill me, because I'll kill you.                 He saw his

10   father bloody his mother, and bruise her eyes, throw

11   chairs at her.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And your submission

13   -- your submission is that every juror is, or a

14   reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only

15   conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is

16   more likely to be violent in the future?                As opposed to

17   the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because

18   of this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him

19   in light of all of this?        And I just don't see how you

20   can speculate which way the jury is going to go.

21              MR. OWEN:      I think that it's not simply

22   speculation, Your Honor, I think this Court recognized

23   in Tennard as it did in Penry, that when there is

24   evidence of mental impairment before the jury, there is

25   at least the probable inference of dangerousness.                   The

 1   amici before the court, both the American Academy of

 2   Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, on the one hand, the

 3   Child Welfare League of America, on the other, their

 4   amicus briefs I think really -- really detailed the fact

 5   that this is a commonplace understanding in our society.

 6               And the reason that we know that, Your

 7   Honor, is what the prosecutor said in his closing

 8   argument, where he said to the jury if you take a puppy

 9   and you beat that puppy, then he is going to bite and he

10   is going to bite as long as he lives.                   There is nothing

11   you can do to change that.          I think that where you

12   have --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So that was in, in

14   Brewer.   Now --

15               MR. OWEN:      Yes.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- there was no

17   reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in

18   Abdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.

19               MR. OWEN:      There was no similar --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So do we have

21   different results in these two consolidated cases?

22               MR. OWEN:      No, Your Honor.              I think that

23   this Court's case in -- decision in Tennard, when it's

24   talking about the inference of probable future

25   dangerousness, this Court says:              The jurors might well


                                       16

 1   have believed that Mr. Tennard would be dangerous in the

 2   future, both as an inference to be drawn from the

 3   evidence and because the prosecutor expressly told them

 4   that's how they ought to regard the evidence.

 5               And in this case we have the prosecutor, in

 6   Mr. Brewer's case we have the prosecutor expressly

 7   telling the jury, just as the prosecutor did in Mr.

 8   Tennard's case, what is mitigating about the guy's

 9   background --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the, so the --

11   but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial

12   statement in the Cole case cuts against you.

13               MR. OWEN:      It simply doesn't cut as far in

14   favor of us, Your Honor.         The fact that in Tennard this

15   Court said that from mental impairment, a probable

16   inference of dangerousness may be drawn, cuts squarely

17   in our favor.   And you don't even have to go to the

18   level of inference.     In Mr. Cole's case his expert

19   witnesses said that the background experiences that this

20   young man had make him dangerous.                And they, they could

21   not forecast exactly how long it might be before he

22   would conceivably age out of that.                 But they said is it

23   10 years?   It could be 15 years, it could be 20 years.

24               I mean, there is just -- that doesn't give a

25   reasonable juror, as -- if all you ask the juror is,

 1   after they have heard that evidence is, is there a

 2   probability that this guy is going to be dangerous in

 3   the future?     I think they would be compelled to say yes,

 4   even though they might say, if they were broadly

 5   instructed --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Where is evidence of

 7   abatement in that case that was before the jury?                   So

 8   that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some

 9   moral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show

10   mercy?     And if you ask them whether he is going to grow

11   out of it, they may well say, it was not his fault

12   because of this brain disorder and he is going to grow

13   out of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not

14   going to sentence him to death.

15                 MR. OWEN:      I think that it's not

16   unconceivable that a juror could have reasoned in that

17   fashion.     But I think it's not reasonably possible.                  I

18   think that this Court's decisions in Penry and Tennard

19   suggest that a juror's commonsensical response to

20   evidence that a defendant has, presently poses a grave

21   danger as a result of his life experiences and the

22   enduring impacts that they have left upon him, the

23   reasonable response of a juror shown such evidence is to

24   find future dangerousness, and that that is precisely

25   the problem with the pre-1991 Texas sentencing statute.

 1              If we had a broad mitigating evidence

 2   issue like the one that's presently given to Texas

 3   juries then we could all be confident that the jury had

 4   engaged in precisely the reasoning that the Court --

 5   that the Court is hypothesizing.               That they looked at

 6   the evidence and said yes, he's dangerous, but he's also

 7   deserving of something less than death so we will

 8   accomplish that by answering this issue in a certain

 9   way.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But in Penry we

11   didn't establish a per se rule.              We said it depends upon

12   the evidence.   It depends upon the instructions.                 It

13   depends upon what the prosecutors say.                  It seems to me

14   that you're arguing for an absolute rule.

15              MR. OWEN:       I don't -- no, Your Honor, and

16   don't let me, please don't let me be misunderstood.                    I

17   do not believe that this is a per se rule.                  I think

18   Johnson stands with our case.             I think that Graham

19   stands with our case.      I think there's no -- there's no

20   need for the Court to -- to change anything other than

21   to -- and it doesn't have to change anything about its

22   existing approach to Penry for our clients to prevail.

23   Because I think that if the Court looks at this evidence

24   and concludes that a reasonable juror approaching this,

25   there's no reasonable probability that they would have


                                       19

 1   felt constrained to find him to be a future danger, then

 2   we lose.   But I don't think you can look at this record

 3   and see that.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But it's not no

 5   reasonable probability, that's not the standard.                    The

 6   standard under Smith is whether the juries can consider

 7   this mitigating evidence in some manner.

 8               MR. OWEN:        I think, Your Honor, that again,

 9   removing that language from Smith, from the language in

10   -- if you're talking about Johnson, I know you're

11   referring to Johnson, that the language in Johnson about

12   some effect can't be separated from the language about

13   meaningful effect.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's absolutely one step

15   removed from that.

16               MR. OWEN:        I'm sorry, Your Honor?

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I say the actual question

18   is even one step removed.            It's whether it is

19   unreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you

20   conclude, which is wrong.

21               MR. OWEN:        That's correct.              And I think --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But unreasonable.

23               MR. OWEN:        That's correct, and I think that

24   it is unreasonable.       I think the State court in this

25   case had essentially two lines of authority, that it was

 1   trying to decide which one controlled this case.                  It had

 2   Penry which involved evidence of mental impairment and

 3   child abuse, and it had Johnson and Graham which

 4   involved evidence of youth and other background.                  And I

 5   think that the facts of these cases, given the facts of

 6   these two cases, it is objectively unreasonable to say

 7   they fit over here with Johnson and Graham rather than

 8   they fit over here with Penry.               And that's why I think

 9   the decisions by the State courts are not just wrong,

10   but objectively unreasonable.

11              If the court has no further questions, I

12   will reserve the remainder of my time.

17              MR. MARSHALL:            Mr. Chief Justice and may it

18   please the Court:

19              When the State court considered these Penry

20   claims in 1994, 1999 and January 2001, this Court's

21   decisions in Graham and Johnson made it clear that the

22   Eighth Amendment requires only that a jury be only able

23   to consider mitigating evidence in some manner, not in

24   every conceivable manner.           This is because virtually any

25   mitigating evidence may be viewed as relevant to moral

 1   culpability apart from its relevance to these Texas

 2   special issues.

 3               Cole and Brewer with sizzling bright IQ

 4   scores of 121 and 115, dysfunctional childhoods and

 5   depression, are much more like the troubled childhood

 6   and youth evidence in Graham and Johnson than the mental

 7   retardation, brain damage and severe child abuse

 8   evidence in Penry.      Equating these facts to Penry --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It's the same kind of

10   evidence.   It may be weaker.             In other words, it's not

11   evidence of good deeds in the community.                  It's two

12   specific kinds of evidence, the very kinds of evidence

13   that were involved in Penry.              You can argue about

14   whether this was weaker, but it's certainly different

15   from youth and reputation for good character.

16               MR. MARSHALL:            Well, I disagree, Your Honor.

17   In Graham in particular, the Court was not just

18   considering youth, the Court was considering a troubled

19   childhood, a difficult childhood in which Graham's

20   mother had been hospitalized with a mental illness, his

21   custody shifted from relative to relative.                  That's

22   exactly the same kind of evidence we have in Cole.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But the evidence was that

24   he didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds.                   On

25   the contrary, he was gentle, kind, God fearing, and

 1   that's why the jury should regard the murder as

 2   aberrational.   That was the Graham picture, whereas here

 3   we're dealing with people who are dangerous.

 4                MR. MARSHALL:         Well, Your Honor, that's not

 5   the way counsel argued it to the jury in either case.

 6   In both of these cases defense counsel presented his

 7   case to the jury during -- through his evidence and his

 8   argument, that this was youthful indiscretion or it was

 9   an aberration, and it wouldn't happen again, which is

10   exactly what Graham --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What other choice does

12   defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to

13   get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the

14   future?   What else could counsel argue?

15                MR. MARSHALL:         Well, Justice Ginsburg,

16   that's not the question before the Court.                     The question

17   before the Court is whether the Eighth Amendment was

18   violated and whether the jury had a reasonable

19   opportunity, and in --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.          Well, maybe sending

21   counsel into those two questions, what violates the

22   Eighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does

23   and say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge.

24   We're not going to bottle it up inside of two special

25   questions.

 1                MR. MARSHALL:          Respectfully, Justice

 2   Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court,

 3   though.    We're trying to determine in this case whether

 4   the State courts unreasonably determined that these

 5   juries had a fair opportunity to consider that evidence.

 6   And I think looking at argument, when we're determining

 7   the reasonableness of that decision, looking at

 8   counsel's argument is all we have to go on in

 9   determining whether the jury had a fair shot.                      Now I

10   think if you look back at the '90s --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But realistically, a

12   defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have

13   those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the

14   jury into those questions.

15                MR. MARSHALL:          Your Honor, that was a

16   strategic choice, though.           This is not a Sixth Amendment

17   claim.    We're looking at the Eighth Amendment now.                    And

18   so what counsel chose to do is not the question.                      We're

19   looking at what he did, and we've got this record to

20   work with.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You're looking at what

22   Texas law forced him to do.

23                MR. MARSHALL:          I don't think that's the

24   issue before the Court, Your Honor.                      I think what we're

25   looking at is whether he -- the jury had a fair


                                        24

 1   opportunity here, regardless of what counsel chose not

 2   to do or what the statute forced him to do.                 The fact is

 3   when the State courts looked at these claims in 1994 and

 4   1999, this evidence was much more like Graham than it

 5   was like Penry, and it was reasonable for them to decide

 6   that there was no Penry error in these cases because of

 7   that fact.   And I think it's worth mentioning that if

 8   that's not the case, then I think we've arrived at the

 9   point where Penry has swallowed the rule announced in

10   Jurek 31 years ago and it -- to which it was only

11   supposed to be an exception.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Jurek was a facial

13   challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see

14   that there are things that would fit into it.                 Good

15   character would fit into it.            But Jurek said as applied,

16   we're not certainly not ruling on that.                 All we're

17   saying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases

18   come up the law is filled out.              But Jurek doesn't say --

19   Jurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that

20   there are these two special factors, that everything can

21   be squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way

22   or another can be squeezed into them.

23                MR. MARSHALL:         That is correct, Your Honor.

24   Jurek was a facial challenge.             But in Johnson and Graham

25   the Court made it pretty clear, I think, that as long as


                                       25

 1   the evidence is relevant in some way within those

 2   special issues, some mitigating way --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought in Johnson the

 4   only question presented was age.

 5              MR. MARSHALL:          In Johnson, Your Honor?

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.

 7              MR. MARSHALL:          Youth was the central point

 8   of Johnson, but Graham involved youth and a distinctly

 9   troubled childhood, much like we have in these cases.

10   And so if that evidence was relevant within future

11   dangerousness and did not amount to Eighth Amendment

12   error, then this evidence has to be just as relevant.

13   And in fact we have another layer of analysis on top of

14   this because we are looking at the State court's

15   decision under AEDPA.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I don't see how this fits

17   in the Graham package.      The Graham is, this child came

18   from a deprived background but managed to survive it,

19   and he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous.

20   Look at all the bad things that were done to him.                  He

21   turns out not to be dangerous.             Apart from this one

22   murder, he's been a good boy.            That's not the picture in

23   either of these cases.

24              MR. MARSHALL:          That's essentially the

25   picture, Justice Ginsburg, in Brewer.                  That's exactly


                                      26
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the way counsel presented it to the jury.                     But not only

 2   did counsel argue that he wasn't going to be dangerous

 3   despite his childhood shortcomings, there was a

 4   deliberateness definition submitted in the Brewer case,

 5   which is what this Court suggested in Penry in 1989

 6   might remedy this problem.           And so the court submitted a

 7   definition of deliberateness and counsel argued it to

 8   the jury, that -- the definition was read to the jury,

 9   counsel argued --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Where is that charge?

11               MR. MARSHALL:           It appears at page 90 of the

12   joint appendix, Your Honor, and that's the Brewer joint

13   appendix.   Now counsel read that definition to the jury,

14   and the definition reads as follows:                     "A manner of doing

15   an act characterized by or resulting from careful and

16   thorough consideration characterized by awareness of the

17   consequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as

18   though allowing time for a decision."                    Now counsel read

19   that definition to the jury during his closing argument.

20   He argued that Brewer's crime reflected poor planning

21   and execution, that he was led into it by other actors,

22   by his girlfriend Christy Nystrom, and that his

23   commitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness,

24   depression in this case, were argued specifically as

25   cause for those faults.         And so counsel related the


                                        27
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   evidence within that deliberateness instruction to the

 2   jury, and that provided them with a significant vehicle

 3   to give effect to this evidence.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is that what the Penry

 5   Court was talking about, something like what you just

 6   read?

 7              MR. MARSHALL:          I think so, Your Honor, and

 8   the Penry Court was not specific about what that

 9   definition should say, but this is certainly helpful to

10   the jury in this case and in taking account some of this

11   evidence that was before it.

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you see, in Johnson

13   the Court was confronted with the special issues and it

14   makes the assumption based on the State's representation

15   there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a

16   jury to fully consider this.           What has happened in these

17   cases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep

18   reminding the jury you just must answer special issues

19   one and two as given.     And in the Cole case they say,

20   even though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a

21   kid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your

22   mind, and just go by the special issues.               And that's the

23   concern in these cases.

24              MR. MARSHALL:          That may be a concern,

25   Justice Kennedy, but the Cole case provides a particular


                                      28
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   example of how defense counsel countered that argument.

 2   75 percent of his argument, which is between pages 141

 3   and 144 of the Cole joint appendix, 75 percent of that

 4   argument is that Cole will burn out as he grows older,

 5   and that's based on the testimony of his experts.            And

 6   he says that burnout, that likeliness that he will not

 7   be dangerous is a reasonable one.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's because the

 9   issues confined him to that.

10              MR. MARSHALL:          That's correct, Your Honor,

11   but that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here,

12   and I think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind

13   anyway to determine that the State court in reading

14   Graham and Johnson could unreasonably determine that

15   that wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said,

16   you have a reasonable doubt about this man's

17   dangerousness because of the testimony that we presented

18   to you from his experts that said he wouldn't be

19   dangerous in the future.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             He's 30 years old, and

21   the testimony is 40, 50.        It says, jury, for 10 years

22   this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and

23   he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years.            And

24   that's an effective --

25              MR. MARSHALL:          Justice Ginsburg, that's


                                      29
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   easily as effective as the -- as youth was in Graham and

 2   Johnson.   Youth is evidence that -- I mean, we don't

 3   know how long it takes people to grow out of youth, but

 4   certainly 10 years wouldn't be unreasonable under the

 5   circumstances in that case.            And so I don't see any

 6   difference between youth and burnout in this context.

 7   We are talking about a finite amount of time, we don't

 8   know exactly what that amount of time is, but it's

 9   certainly reasonable for a jury to give mitigating

10   effect to it under that question.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Marshall, I heard

12   what you read from this charge, and I don't have the

13   exact words of what the Court was talking about in

14   Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would

15   enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime

16   deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not

17   slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that

18   his background and diminished mental capacity diminished

19   his moral culpability, making the imposition of the

20   death sentence unwarranted.

21               So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's

22   deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them

23   even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse,

24   because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable

25   to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   impairments.   That's the instruction that Penry said

 2   could be given and that would be okay under the

 3   deliberateness.   Quite different from the instruction

 4   you read.

 5               MR. MARSHALL:          It's different, Your Honor,

 6   but I don't think it's that much different, and the

 7   reason is that this makes the crime a function of

 8   awareness of the consequences of slow unhurried

 9   consideration of those consequences.                    And then counsel

10   argues to the jury that Brewer is uncapable of engaging

11   in that sort of premeditation because of his mental

12   problems, and so that's what reduces his culpability

13   under the circumstances.         And I think if you combine the

14   argument and the definition, which we were bound to do

15   under Boyde versus California, we're supposed to look at

16   the entire context of the trial here, that that meets

17   that suggestion in Penry for it.               It's not exactly what

18   the Court suggested.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Wasn't there something

20   about moral culpability in what you read?

21               MR. MARSHALL:          No, Your Honor.           It's not

22   mentioned in this definition.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's what Penry makes

24   clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors

25   that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't


                                       31

 1   act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide

 2   that they reduce his moral culpability.                  And that's not

 3   what this charge was?

 4                 MR. MARSHALL:         This charge is different and

 5   you're correct in that, Justice Ginsburg.                 However,

 6   future dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this

 7   case, just the same as it did in Graham, and so -- and

 8   in Johnson.    The Court said that this kind of evidence,

 9   the evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect

10   within future dangerousness in some manner.                 And granted

11   we can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to

12   culpability, but the Court explained -- and this was

13   what the State court was working with at the time it

14   considered this claim -- this Court explained that just

15   because we can imagine other ways in which it might be

16   relevant doesn't mean that we have got Eighth Amendment

17   error.   It's just important that the jury had some way

18   of getting to it.    And I don't see how this is markedly

19   different than the evidence that the Court said fit

20   within future dangerousness in Graham.

21                 Now, in -- I think another thing that I need

22   to mention about Cole is, is that my colleague noted the

23   expert testimony that Cole lacked impulse control.                   Now,

24   I think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in

25   this case becomes especially apparent when you realize


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that, that Cole planned this crime 2 days in advance.

 2   He planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days

 3   before he did it.     And so I don't think that an impulse

 4   control problem mitigates his culpability for this crime

 5   in any way and I don't think any reasonable juror would

 6   ever see that.   So I think that the mitigating

 7   significance of that evidence in this case is severely

 8   diminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury

 9   heard in Penry, for example, which is that he'll never

10   learn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a

11   rape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a

12   murder and a rape.      And so the mitigating relevance of

13   that evidence was only aggravating within future

14   dangerousness.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    How do we, how does

16   that factor in on the issues that are before us, the

17   weakness of the mitigating evidence?                      In what way are we

18   supposed to assess it?         We don't have a harmless error

19   question in these cases.

20              MR. MARSHALL:             There is no harmless error

21   question, correct, Mr. Chief Justice.                     However, I think

22   when we're looking at the Boyde standard, which is --

23   and in Johnson -- a reasonable likelihood that the jury

24   was precluded from giving effect to the evidence, the

25   reasonableness of that likelihood, the reasonableness of


                                         33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that possibility, depends upon the way the juror, the

 2   jury, heard the evidence and the relative strength of

 3   that evidence.

 4               And so evidence of intoxication, for

 5   example, while it does mitigate culpability in some

 6   manner, would not create the reasonable possibility of

 7   Eighth Amendment error in that sense.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your argument is

 9   that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by,

10   reasonable consideration was not precluded by the

11   instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there

12   wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?

13               MR. MARSHALL:          That's correct, Your Honor.

14   But in addition to all of that, the State court was

15   looking at Penry and Graham when they decided this case

16   and there was no Penry II yet.              There was no Tennard or

17   Smith.   And so it was reasonable for them to compare the

18   evidence, the weight of that evidence, the strength of

19   that evidence, to those cases and decide that it fell on

20   the Graham and Johnson side of the line rather than the

21   Penry side of the line.        That's the only thing they

22   could do at the time.

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, do you think the

24   case should have been decided differently should it have

25   been decided after those decisions?


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. MARSHALL:          Well, Justice Stevens, if we

 2   take into account the full effect language that gets

 3   quoted in Penry II, we might well have a different

 4   result.   But that wasn't the standard at the time and

 5   under AEDPA --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But those decisions didn't

 7   purport to change the law.

 8               MR. MARSHALL:          Well, under Teague they did

 9   not purport to change the law.              But I think AEDPA is a

10   different inquiry here.        We're looking at what clearly

11   established law was at the time the State courts made

12   their decisions and not necessarily what, you know, what

13   the Teague inquiry would be.            And so at that point I

14   think it's pretty clear under Graham and Johnson we're

15   looking at some effect.        Whatever "full effect" means

16   now, it doesn't apply to these cases.

17               And I think that gets to the main point

18   here.   We're looking at an exceedingly ordinary fact

19   pattern in a capital murder case in both of these cases:

20   Dysfunctional childhoods, a small amount of abuse in

21   Brewer, undescribed --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Am I correct, your

23   position essentially is that, while it may well be true

24   that these instructions did not permit the jury to give

25   full effect to this mitigating evidence, that was not


                                       35
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   clearly established law at the time of these decisions?

 2                 MR. MARSHALL:          That's correct, Justice

 3   Stevens.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's your view.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Were these decisions

 6   post-Johnson.

 7                 MR. MARSHALL:          Yes, Your Honor.         In fact,

 8   the Brewer case was decided the year after Johnson and

 9   the, the Cole case was decided in 1999.                   So the Court

10   had not held forth on what Penry meant in a long time at

11   that point.    Graham and Johnson were the last clear

12   statements the Court had made.

13                 Now, I want to correct one misstatement by

14   my opposing counsel in Brewer.                Brewer was -- there are

15   three distinct episodes of abuse that appear in the

16   record in that case:        That he was struck with a pistol

17   by his father, he was struck with his fist, and struck

18   with a flashlight.      He was never struck with a stick of

19   firewood, and that's on page 65 of the joint appendix.

20   That's pretty clear.        This isolated abuse that occurred

21   late in life -- we don't know the exact time frame, but

22   it could be as late as age 18 or 19 -- surely has

23   different characteristics in a jury's eyes than the

24   evidence in Penry which, in which the defendant was beat

25   and beat severely from a very young age, from his

 1   infancy, and that beating, that abuse, caused brain

 2   damage or mental retardation.             The ordinary nature of

 3   this evidence in comparison to the exceptional --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Are you suggesting that

 5   some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse

 6   as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young

 7   child?

 8               MR. MARSHALL:          I'm not suggesting that, Your

 9   Honor.   I'm just suggesting that this is a smaller

10   amount of abuse than what was in Penry.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I guess striking a big

12   person is not quite as bad as striking a little person.

13               MR. MARSHALL:          That may be true, Your Honor.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            If the question is one of

15   the evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error

16   question rather than a question of whether the jury can

17   give it effect?

18               MR. MARSHALL:          Well, there is, there is that

19   reasonable likelihood standard built in under Boyde.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            The likelihood of?

21               MR. MARSHALL:          Of constitutional error.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, constitutional error

23   is --

24               MR. MARSHALL:          Is the reasonable likelihood

25   --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

 2               MR. MARSHALL:          Reasonable likelihood that

 3   the juror was precluded from considering the relevant

 4   mitigating evidence.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.        So if the

 6   evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent

 7   you from considering it, then it's precluded.                  But if

 8   the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.

 9               MR. MARSHALL:          Well, I think it's a

10   reasonable reading of Graham and Johnson, though, Your

11   Honor, that weak evidence does fit within these special

12   issues.   That's what those cases held.                 They said the

13   jury could consider the evidence in some manner and

14   therefore there was no reasonable likelihood that they

15   were precluded from doing so.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            So imagine you're a juror

17   and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about

18   the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his

19   dangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think

20   he did it deliberately.        And then you think to yourself,

21   well, could I consider it because it shows a bad

22   childhood and that is deserving of a life term?                  I'm not

23   sure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that

24   purpose at all?   What's my answer under Texas law?

25               MR. MARSHALL:          Well, Your Honor, the State

 1   court considering this case was looking at Graham, in

 2   which the Court Stated that that evidence fit within

 3   future dangerousness.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no.          I have gotten --

 5   I've finished considering it for future dangerousness.

 6   No, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous.                     Now I say to

 7   myself, can I consider it for the purpose of showing a

 8   bad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like?                     Can I

 9   consider it for that purpose?              What's the answer under

10   State law?

11                MR. MARSHALL:          Yes.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:            The answer is no.

13                MR. MARSHALL:          Yes, Justice Breyer, the

14   answer is yes.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            The answer is yes?

16                MR. MARSHALL:          The answer is yes because

17   this Court said it was yes.             This Court said that in

18   Graham the jury was free to accept counsel's suggestion

19   that Graham's conduct was merely an aberration and that,

20   and that he wouldn't do it again.                 That's exactly the

21   way the case was argued to the jury by these two defense

22   lawyers.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm not talking about

24   future dangerousness.       I'm talking about -- I would be

25   repeating myself.    You've taken that, I'm not talking

 1   about future dangerousness.              The jury's decided that

 2   matter in your favor.        I'm saying does Texas law allow

 3   -- you understood what I said, didn't you?

 4                 MR. MARSHALL:          Yes, yes.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right, and the answer

 6   is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?

 7                 MR. MARSHALL:          Yes, Your Honor.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And what's the Texas case

 9   that says that?

10                 MR. MARSHALL:          Your Honor, it's not a Texas

11   case.     It's this court in Graham and Johnson.           This

12   Court said that evidence of a troubled childhood, of the

13   particular dysfunction that comes with youth, can be

14   taken as an aberration, that the person will not repeat

15   --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, did we say that in

17   the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of

18   childhood abuse and so forth?

19                 MR. MARSHALL:          The question is --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Or was it really applied

21   just in the context of the Graham evidence?

22                 MR. MARSHALL:          Well, Your Honor, in these

23   cases it's relevant for the same reasons it was in

24   Graham.     This evidence is not enough like Penry to

25   warrant relief.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Right.          But the answer to

 2   Justice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can

 3   only consider it in the, in the context of

 4   deliberateness or future dangerousness.

 5                 MR. MARSHALL:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And that depends on

 7   the nature of the evidence, I take it?                    I mean, if the

 8   evidence we were talking about was biological

 9   predisposition to violence, that's only going to point

10   in one direction, right?          I mean, if the evidence is

11   isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is

12   that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well,

13   that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated

14   it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be

15   regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.

16                 MR. MARSHALL:         That's correct, Mr. Chief

17   Justice.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And so when you get

19   into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we

20   supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that

21   anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to

22   do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going

23   to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to

24   outgrow it?    Do we make that determination in every case

25   based on the particular evidence and the particular

 1   arguments that counsel made?

 2              MR. MARSHALL:           I don't think there's any

 3   other way to do it, Mr. Chief Justice.                  This Court has

 4   continually engaged in a case-specific analysis on a

 5   case-by-case basis in these types, when granting these

 6   types of claims.

 7              If the Court has no further questions --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Unless you take the view

 9   that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury

10   distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct

11   on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that

12   don't tie in at all to dangerousness.

13              MR. MARSHALL:           That's because, Justice

14   Ginsburg, the Penry's evidence was relevant only in an

15   aggravating way to those issues.               It suggested nothing

16   other than the fact that he would be a future danger,

17   and when the evidence is not so aggravating, when the

18   evidence suggests, suggests that there is a mitigating

19   answer to the future dangerousness question, that the

20   person won't be a future danger because they're going to

21   burn out or because this is an isolated incident, we

22   have a different situation.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can you tell me, if you

24   know, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases,

25   are pending that were decided before the legislature

 1   amended the instruction?

 2                MR. MARSHALL:          Justice Kennedy, there are 47

 3   inmates on Texas death row that were sentenced under

 4   this statute that remain there.               There are nine cases

 5   which have litigated Penry claims all the way to

 6   conclusion in Federal court.             There are 25 more that are

 7   somewhere in the pipeline either in State court or

 8   Federal court.    I've actually looked at the cases and 17

 9   of those cases, 17 of the 34 that are still in the

10   system, have evidence that's almost identical to these

11   cases.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that wasn't the

13   question.    Your question was how many were before or

14   after the --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But I take it your answer

16   was that all these were tried before Texas amended the

17   statute.    Was it 1991 when it amended the statute?

18                MR. MARSHALL:          Yes, Your Honor.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And all the cases you

20   mentioned were tried before 1991.

21                MR. MARSHALL:          Yes.      47.        47 cases were

22   sentenced under this pre-1991 statute.

23                If the Court has no further questions, I'd

24   ask that they affirm the judgment of the court below.

 1   Mr. Marshall.

 2               You Mr. Owen, have you 12 minutes remaining.

 3              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN

 4                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 5               MR. OWEN:      I'd like to make two points about

 6   Graham since it's been a subject of some discussion.

 7   First is to remind the Court that Graham was a Teague

 8   case.   Graham was a case about whether the law in 1984,

 9   prior to Penry -- Mr. Graham's case became final on

10   direct appeal -- dictated the result that he was asking

11   for, which I think doesn't mean it has no persuasive

12   impact on these cases, but I certainly think it limits

13   its precedential value outside the scope of the question

14   of youth that Johnson later settled squarely.

15               The second thing I want to say about Graham

16   is this is the State's brief in Graham, 91-7580, and I

17   want to just note that at page 26, squarely.            This is

18   the State's brief in Graham 917580 and I want to note at

19   page 26, footnote 8 the State says the insubstantiality

20   of Graham's evidence of a troubled childhood is readily

21   apparent, which certainly suggests that there is a fair

22   reading of the evidence in Graham of this background

23   evidence as not being substantial, not being evidence

24   about abuse or mistreatment.            The fact that he was moved

25   from one relative to another because of the


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   circumstances in his family, in that case was not shown

 2   to have any negative impact on him.                     Whereas I think in

 3   Mr. Cole's case certainly there is expert testimony that

 4   it had a very devastating negative impact on him.                     So

 5   Graham really does not even give the Court much guidance

 6   on the question of troubled background because there is

 7   no indication that Graham actually had a, a background

 8   of mistreatment.

 9                By the same token with respect to the

10   State's comment or my brother's comment that the, the

11   record doesn't bear out that Mr. Brewer was struck by

12   his father with a stick of firewood, that is correct.

13   What the record actually says is, if I may quote from

14   the Brewer JA at page 90 -- 95 -- 65, excuse me:                    "He

15   tried to hit him with a stick of firewood.                    When he went

16   outside to grab the firewood I --" -- that's

17   Mr. Brewer's mother -- "slammed the front door and

18   locked it, and he smashed the glass out of the front

19   door with the firewood.        That was the night I had him

20   arrested."

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How old was Brewer

22   at that time?

23                MR. OWEN:     I believe he was 15, Your Honor.

24   But I also want to, I also want to emphasize that I

25   think there, the fact is, the testimony is that


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Mr. Brewer was hit numerous times.                  That's his mom's

 2   word.    Hit with objects only twice, but hit numerous

 3   times.   And I don't think the Court should also

 4   underestimate the significance of the evidence that

 5   Mr. Brewer saw his father brutalize his mother on many

 6   occasions, because that evidence too contributes.                  It's

 7   not just the difference between being hit and watching

 8   someone else being hit.         I think everyone understands

 9   that there are enduring feelings of shame and guilt, and

10   that the teenage son feels --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But the argument is

12   that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the

13   instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows

14   that he will be violent again.               They will not feel that

15   they can take it into account in any way to determine

16   that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy,

17   or that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer

18   records confused here, but that this, the cause for the

19   violence will abate with, with age.

20                MR. OWEN:      I think, Your Honor --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or that in, I guess

22   in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence

23   was caused by a particular bout of depression, that

24   would not necessarily recur.

25                MR. OWEN:      I, I don't think that's -- that's


                                        46

 1   not our argument, first, Your Honor, for this reason.

 2              The court's question was, as I understand

 3   it, don't we have to show there is no way the jury could

 4   have understood this evidence except as aggravating?                   I

 5   don't think that's, I don't think that's the test.                In

 6   Tennard this Court said if the jury might well have

 7   considered the evidence as aggravating, then --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  -- that was after --

 9   I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or

10   not it could be considered in some manner.

11              MR. OWEN:       In some manner that is reasonable

12   and that gives effect to the relevant mitigating

13   qualities of the evidence.         Yes, Your Honor.         And I do

14   think that the, that the fact of Mr. Brewer's -- the

15   fact that the jury knew that he had endured this

16   mistreatment as a teenager could only have been given

17   aggravating effect.     I don't think there is any way to

18   reason from the premise that he was mistreated

19   physically and emotionally by his father when he was a

20   teenager, to the conclusion that therefore he will be

21   less dangerous in the future.            That doesn't seem to me

22   to be a reasonable connection.

23              And I think that what the Court was calling

24   for in Johnson was that there be some sensible link

25   between the proffered mitigating evidence and these


                                      47
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   narrow questions, which as has been pointed out already

 2   were the only options for the jury in this case.                    There

 3   was no, there was no mercy option.                   There was no

 4   mitigation instruction.          The jury was told solely these

 5   two -- these two special issues.

 6               With respect to the Brewer argument that

 7   there was a deliberateness instruction, I think Justice

 8   Ginsburg has it exactly right in observing that in

 9   Penry, what the Court said was that to satisfy the, you

10   know, to fix the deficit in the former Texas special

11   issues, a definition of deliberateness would have to

12   direct the jury's attention to the defendant's personal

13   culpability.   And I don't think this instruction does

14   that.   This instruction directs them to the sort of

15   quantity of forethought, how much did he think about it,

16   how long did he think about it, did he mull it over?

17   But I don't think that that captures the moral

18   culpability aspect that Penry says is required under the

19   Eighth Amendment.

20               If the Court has further questions I'm happy

21   to entertain them.      Otherwise we would ask that the

22   Court grant our motions.           In the alternative we would
