 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. FURLOW

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. FURLOW:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              As this Court has confined consideration of

12   the matters before the Court to certiorari issue number

13   5 concerning qualified domestic relations orders, or

14   QDROs as they are called, I will confine my argument to

15   arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the

16   only way a divorcing spouse can waive the right to

17   pension benefits is by executing a QDRO.                 I have four

18   basic arguments to present today.                 I'll give them in

19   thumbnail sketch form first.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               You did in your reply

21   brief address the plan question?

22              MR. FURLOW:          Yes, Your Honor.          I did so

23   after stating that we believe that the matter was

24   properly confined to the certiorari issue number three,

25   but out of an abundance of caution and subject to


                                         3

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   objection I did respond to the argument leveled against

 2   us by I think it is five amici and by DuPont itself.                 We

 3   nevertheless, I prepared my original briefing on the

 4   merits to address the QDRO issue and that's where you

 5   see it focused.   We have four basic issues.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                The problem is that is

 7   that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you

 8   could still lose on the plan documents rule, right.

 9              MR. FURLOW:           Well, Your Honor, I think that

10   instead this Court might choose well to follow what the

11   concurrence said in the recent LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg

12   case, emphasizing that where the court of appeals below

13   has not passed on the central issue of a case and where

14   most of the fire that the one party is responding to

15   comes from amici, that it is appropriate to remand the

16   case to that court so that that court may pass on the

17   central issue, especially in the situation where, as

18   here, the Fifth Circuit did not even mention the plan

19   document's role, but based its decision solely on a

20   misinterpretation of the QDRO language.

21              Of course, here, in the interest of candor,

22   Dupont did in fact address in brief format -- a page or

23   to, several pages -- in its motion for summary judgment

24   the plan document's role and raised that matter again in

25   the Fifth Circuit.      It's just the Fifth Circuit did not


                                          4

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   consider or pass on that because it relied solely on

 2   Dupont's argument that the Fifth Circuit should adhere

 3   to what it believed to be the Department of Treasury's

 4   interpretation of the anti-alienation statute.                     The

 5   Department of the Treasury and the Department of Labor,

 6   now in a harmonized stance, have come forth and in their

 7   amicus for the government supports our position that the

 8   Fifth Circuit erred in its interpretation of the QDRO

 9   statute, and that's the position we take.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            At the end of your

11   argument, could you just spend a minute because my state

12   of mind is I'm sorry we limited it.                     You've sort of

13   briefed this question pretty fully.

14                MR. FURLOW:       Yes, Your Honor.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            And I'm tempted to try to

16   decide it.   I know you want to make your four points.

17   Go right ahead.   But at the end, could you possibly say,

18   why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance,

19   not as a technical matter.          Are we really going to get

20   something out of remanding it that we don't already

21   know?   But don't do that now, but whenever you want.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            We know what's going to

23   happen on remand, though, don't we?                     Doesn't the Fifth

24   Circuit already have case law on -- on that question?

25                MR. FURLOW:       The Fifth Circuit already has


                                        5

 1   case law.   They have stated that, but they consider some

 2   of the other cases and they might consider this Court's

 3   ruling addressing the interpretation of the QDRO

 4   provision; that might provide them additional

 5   enlightenment as to how they should address the

 6   other issue.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But again as a preliminary

 8   matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg?                   Or

 9   would it be a different question?                I'm curious to know

10   why the beneficiary designation and change provisions at

11   page 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been

12   invoked here.   Is that the same question Justice

13   Ginsburg was asking?

14               MR. FURLOW:        I do not believe so, Justice

15   Kennedy.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Because the plan does

17   contain a procedure for designating some other

18   beneficiary, including the spouse.                 I just don't

19   understand why anybody doesn't talk about that.

20               MR. FURLOW:        Well, Your Honor, there was

21   that provision for invoking another beneficiary and we

22   only pointed out that indeed three days after the

23   divorce, and consistent with his ex-wife's waiver of any

24   right, title, claim and interest in this 401(k) plan in

25   specific, and that was the very first item of the things


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that he retained as the plan participant in that divorce

 2   decree, he did in fact designate his sole daughter Kari

 3   Kennedy as his sole beneficiary in a change of form plan

 4   for one part of this very complex series of multiple

 5   plans -- of plan retirement benefits where he said that

 6   he would give -- that she would be his sole beneficiary;

 7   and the form there that DuPont drafted for him said that

 8   it invoked and superseded any and all prior

 9   designations, and was not limited to that one particular

10   part 6 pension and retirements plan.                    And so we submit

11   it is a reasonable explanation, if he did not believe

12   that his wife had waived any right, title and interest

13   to invoke that beneficiary clause, pursuant to the Fifth

14   Circuit's decision just six weeks beforehand in the

15   Brandon v Travelers International case that said that a

16   waiver of ERISA benefits, welfare benefits mainly -- but

17   ERISA waiver of benefits, a voluntary waiver was

18   enforceable, was valid and could be enforced at summary

19   judgment.

20               We believe his counsel, you know, were aware

21   of that in formulating, you know, this waiver of

22   benefits.   Even if that didn't take care of Liv

23   Kennedy's knowing, voluntary, attorney-negotiated,

24   court-approved, signed-by-her waiver of any right,

25   title, claim and interest in his pension benefits, then


                                        7

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   we believe he may have believed as a layman that by

 2   signing that beneficiary designation form prepared by

 3   DuPont, that he had indeed superseded and revoked all

 4   prior designations.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Or he might have -- he

 6   might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that

 7   one.   We -- we just have no way of knowing.                  It's odd

 8   that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan,

 9   as I understand.

10                 MR. FURLOW:       Your Honor, I might -- I might,

11   if I would, just offer an explanation.                   He almost

12   certainly saw no reason to revoke that which his wife

13   had just four days before voluntarily waived any right,

14   title, claim and interest to in terms of the divorce.

15   He certainly would have expected that her word would be

16   her bond and that it wouldn't turn out to be a junk bond

17   as it turned out to be when years later she repudiated

18   her own voluntary waiver; and that's just one of the

19   issues that we address.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, because he could --

21   he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named

22   her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have

23   controlled.

24                 MR. FURLOW:       Well, Your Honor, the way I see

25   it is that his attorneys who were advising him and


                                         8

 1   guiding him through this process, they were acting, we

 2   must assume, in complete awareness of Texas and Fifth

 3   Circuit law; and the Fifth Circuit had just ruled some

 4   six weeks before in a case involving voluntary divorce

 5   decree waivers that such a waiver was enforceable.                 Now

 6   you don't have to --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I'm sorry; six weeks

 8   before what?

 9              MR. FURLOW:         Before the divorce decree in

10   the Brandon v. Travelers International case.                 We believe

11   that there was no sense there in bombing the rubble.                    If

12   it was already taken care of, it didn't have to be taken

13   care of the second time.         Now, I and you might want a

14   belt-and-suspenders approach to be absolutely, doubly,

15   positively sure.   But the fundamental thing is if under

16   Federal common law, as a majority of courts and almost

17   all of the State courts have ruled, a voluntary waiver

18   is enforceable, then that was already taken care of.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, but how does

20   the plan know that?

21              MR. FURLOW:         The plan knows that, as here,

22   when the court-appointed fiduciary, the executrix Kari

23   Kennedy makes the plan aware of that on April 26, 2001,

24   via fax and delivery, which is acknowledged by their

25   plan administrator, Mary Deneen that's coming in, and

 1   there you have a copy of the divorce decree served on

 2   DuPont months before they make a payout.

 3              And it is critical here, Your Honor, that

 4   when they chose to make this -- you know, when they

 5   chose to pay the beneficiary, they were working on a

 6   test case right there from the very beginning.                 And if

 7   you look at their paralegal's letter, who actually

 8   notifies the estate that they are going to disregard the

 9   voluntary test case, they refer to DuPont's success in

10   raising this issue before.          And then the paralegal

11   actually quotes a Fifth Circuit case that holds for

12   voluntary waivers, obviously not understanding the, you

13   know, crucial import here; and we note --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But the plan terms

15   say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's

16   how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are

17   going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.

18              MR. FURLOW:         Well, Your Honor, I would also

19   say that the plan forms here at page 48 of your joint

20   appendix, and 49 -- I ask this Court to scrutinize these

21   two provisions because they are critical to the outcome

22   of the case.   At page 48 you hear the following

23   mandatory language in DuPont's own SIP.                 And it says:

24   "If no surviving spouse exists and no beneficiary

25   designation is in effect, distribution shall" --


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mandatory term -- "shall be made to or in accordance

 2   with the directions of the executor or administrator of

 3   the decedent's estate."       And so we say that --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would have thought

 5   your friend on the other side would be quoting that

 6   language.

 7               MR. FURLOW:       Well, Your Honor, I like to

 8   bring a fresh insight to the -- to the -- to the

 9   Petitioner's argument here because I see that language

10   and we say it is not in effect.             This Court has ruled in

11   several cases what the term "in effect" means, and in

12   ERISA cases saying this version of ERISA was in effect,

13   meaning valid and operational.             Well, the voluntary

14   waiver was in effect and that made the beneficiary

15   designation some 10 years before during the course of

16   the marriage ineffectual, invalid.                And so --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But that's -- that's

18   a bit of a stretch, isn't it?            It says no beneficiary

19   designation is in effect.         If you look at the plan, he's

20   got a beneficiary designation.

21               MR. FURLOW:       But it's not in effect at the

22   time that it comes to be decided because their plan

23   administrator Mary Deneen has a copy of the divorce

24   decree with the knowing voluntary waiver.                And although,

25   Your Honor, although they take the position that plan


                                      11
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   administrators can't understand knowing and voluntary

 2   waivers, that that's a law sort of thing, they have got

 3   one in-house counsel there who was never called upon to

 4   actually pass on this matter and it wouldn't have cost

 5   them a dime to go outside of that in-house counsel.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, of course, that was

 7   the point of my earlier point.                I focused on -- on this

 8   whole paragraph.

 9              MR. FURLOW:           Yes.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               That just indicates that

11   this would have been a different case if the provision

12   of the plan that said there shall be no assignment,

13   which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only

14   provision in the plan; but when you look through this in

15   retrospect, there are means for participants and

16   beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't

17   followed here.

18              MR. FURLOW:           Well --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               And I understand that you

20   say in effect they were.           I understand that argument but

21   it's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate

22   vehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the

23   terms of the plan.

24              MR. FURLOW:           Your Honor, we submit that

25   people all the time in situations like this may believe

 3   and the State courts is good enough.                    In some other

 4   instances, they forget.        They forget to do this or to

 5   make those changes, or believe that one of a series of

 6   multiple and overlapping beneficiary designations has --

 7   as the June 7th one did, we submit -- revoked and

 8   superseded any and all prior designations, and they are

 9   lay people not lawyers.

10              Now, I would submit that the critical thing

11   is also on page 49 the very portion of the joint

12   appendix that you're looking at, because that language

13   says, in the DuPont SIP plan, quote, "if in the opinion

14   of the company there is a question as to the legal right

15   of any beneficiary to receive a distribution under the

16   plan, the amount in question may be paid to the

17   decedent's estate in which event the trustee and the

18   company shall have no further liability to anyone in

19   respect to such amounts."          Consider that when you've

20   heard all of the fear mongering that's come in, in the

21   amici briefs with respect to -- to interpleader actions.

22   And we submit that interpleader actions are a perfectly

23   good means of disposing of this, but if you --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's in the opinion

25   of the company.   That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as

 1   we've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce

 2   these according to the terms of the plan because the

 3   companies don't have to set these up at all.              So it

 4   makes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we

 5   think this, then we can do this.              So, in other words,

 6   there's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody

 7   who might not end up being the person, but if we don't

 8   think there's a doubt, that's it.

 9              MR. FURLOW:        And that's the first step in

10   the analysis, Your Honor, because the second step is all

11   of this Supreme Court case and all of the substantial

12   expenses that this estate out of Jasper, Texas, has had

13   to pay from the very beginning could have been avoided

14   had they paid over to Kari Kennedy, a court-appointed

15   executrix who would have taken that money in and would

16   have been bound by the rules of the probate court to

17   handle it as a fiduciary to consider Liv's claim that

18   her voluntary waiver was not voluntary, to pay the

19   creditors first, rather than get stuck with the past

20   liabilities, which happened here.

21              The important thing is DuPont could have

22   avoided all of this litigation, would not have had to

23   file an interpleader, would not have had to incur a

24   dime's worth of attorney's fees, would not have had to

25   put its own interest ahead of that of the participants

 1   and beneficiaries, had they simply invoked this clause

 2   as they had the power to do.            They chose this case.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:           We can't decide this case

 4   based on sympathy to DuPont.            I would understand the

 5   point of your argument.        But if -- in theory the problem

 6   would be exactly the same, whether DuPont had expressed

 7   a doubt and paid it into the estate or hadn't.

 8                MR. FURLOW:       The problem --

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:           We have the same question

10   before us.

11                MR. FURLOW:       The QDRO question, Your Honor?

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Yes.

13                MR. FURLOW:       Yes, and that's why we say that

14   if you look carefully at -- excuse me, but it's 29

15   U.S.C. section 1056(b) through (k) -- you look at the

16   specific language, and I am asking this Court to adhere

17   to the specific written terms of the ERISA statute

18   because those require a transfer to an alternate payee.

19   That is our fundamental argument:                A transfer to an

20   alternate payee which is defined in 1056(d)(3)(K) as

21   being someone --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Sorry.           Does this appear

23   somewhere in the materials?            It's always helpful.

24                MR. FURLOW:       Respondents' brief, Your Honor,

25   and you will find it specifically on pages 14A and 15A,

 1   in the appendix in the back.              And if you actually go to

 2   the language, we stand on a plain-meaning interpretation

 3   of the ERISA statute, this reticulated and complicated

 4   statute.     We say every word has its meaning.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What do you want me to

 6   read here?

 7                 MR. FURLOW:        Specifically, Your Honors,

 8   pages 14A and 15A of the Respondents' appendix, where he

 9   has actually given us all of the QDRO statute at 1056.

10                 And we say that has meaning, and that means

11   we prevail because, if you look at that language, every

12   subpart is talking about payments to alternate payees.

13   "Alternate payees" are defined at 1056(d)(3)(K), and you

14   will find that, Your Honors, specifically at page, at

15   page 22A to 23A in the appendix.

16                 The alternate payees there that we are

17   talking about are spouse, ex-spouse, child, or other

18   dependent.    It does not refer to the plan participant

19   Mr. Kennedy; and, therefore, there was no -- his mere

20   retention of his pension benefits and his wife's waiver

21   of her contingent beneficiary payments, which would only

22   come to her upon the death of William Kennedy, meant

23   there was no transfer, not a dime's worth of money, not

24   a bit of pension benefits transferred on the date that

25   she signed that waiver.          There was thus no --

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:         I'm not sure I'm getting

 2   this argument.   There's not -- the argument isn't that

 3   there was a QDRO; the argument was that he could have

 4   disposed of this through a QDRO.               And he could have done

 5   that, and he could have named an alternate payee in the

 6   QDRO.   He could have named his daughter, for example.

 7                MR. FURLOW:       Your Honor, the way pension

 8   planners understand it is that you use a QDRO for a

 9   transfer of benefits, not for a bare waiver.               And that's

10   where the U.S. Solicitor General supports our position

11   and reads this and says that's consistent with

12   Treasury's own, now harmonized with Labor's,

13   interpretation of the anti-alienation clause.              It does

14   not apply to bare waivers of benefits, and, therefore,

15   the Fifth Circuit erred in putting within a QDRO context

16   his wife's --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:         All you're saying is that

18   you couldn't effect a bare waiver through a QDRO, but

19   why does that prove your case?              I don't understand that.

20                MR. FURLOW:       We think that --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:         A QDRO could have been used

22   to direct the payment to someone else other than the

23   ex-spouse.

24                MR. FURLOW:       With respect to her waiver that

25   would have required him in advance to decide who he


                                       17
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would have transferred what alternate payee he would

 2   transfer way back at the time of his divorce in 1994.

 3   He cannot.   He did not transfer anything to his wife.

 4   She didn't receive anything at that time.                 She simply

 5   waived her contingent right to receive something upon

 6   her death, something that would occur in the future.

 7   She thoroughly waived that.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's not your point.          It

 9   would seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an

10   exception to the assignment or alienation.

11                MR. FURLOW:       I believe --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And your point is this has

13   been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO

14   exception.   There is nothing in here that violates

15   anything in the statute.

16                MR. FURLOW:       I completely agree with that

17   analysis.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So whether he could have

19   done a QDRO is in your view irrelevant.                 Your basic case

20   is the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on

21   assignment or alienation, that provision has no

22   application here, there has been no assignment or

23   alienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.

24                MR. FURLOW:       That's exactly our position

25   Your Honor, yes.   So we find support in that and we find

 1   support in not only Treasury's interpretation of its own

 2   regulation, which deserves great deference under this

 3   Court's opinion, especially when DuPont in the Fifth

 4   Circuit asserted that it was Department of Treasury that

 5   had all of the expertise pursuant to congressional

 6   mandate in determining how QDROs should apply and told

 7   the Fifth Circuit to follow their outdated

 8   interpretation of the QDRO statute.                    They certainly are

 9   not in a position to say that the expertise that they

10   touted in the Fifth Circuit should be disregarded now,

11   and we submit that the Attorney General and the

12   Solicitor General are correct in saying that the

13   regulation does not mean what DuPont says it does, but

14   means what Kennedy says it does.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, of course you

16   only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a

17   certain extent.

18              MR. FURLOW:        To a certain extent.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Then you throw them

20   under the train because you don't -- you certainly don't

21   think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you

22   can do this is by modifying the plan.                   I still don't

23   know how the plan administrator is supposed to know that

24   the person whose name appears on the plan documents,

25   which the plan participant can change at any time, isn't

 1   the person that they are supposed to send the benefits

 2   to.   Now, you tell me here they knew about the divorce

 3   and all that stuff.     Maybe, maybe not.               But we are

 4   trying to develop a rule for all cases and it seems to

 5   me the easiest, most administrable rule is to say

 6   whoever's name appears there gets the money, and if they

 7   are not supposed to because of some collateral dispute,

 8   well, they can sort that out in litigation.                  Maybe Kari

 9   has a suit against Mrs. Kennedy or her estate, but

10   that's not a matter for the plan to worry about.

11                MR. FURLOW:       Well, Your Honor, let me

12   address that.   First, we don't throw the Solicitor

13   General under the tracks.          We simply point out the fact

14   that they have gone off track in terms of their plan

15   documents.   And specifically, Your Honor, I would say I

16   agree with the Manning versus, the Manning decision of

17   the Texas, of the Fifth Circuit, which we cited.                 In

18   there that says that sections 1102 and 1104 of ERISA are

19   a very thin reed indeed to on which to cobble together a

20   plan document's rule.      And specifically DuPont then goes

21   one bridge too far going way beyond that to say that

22   these ever meetable ever changeable beneficiary changes

23   thousands of them constitute documents where the Ninth

24   Circuit conity substitutes of what constitutes plan

25   documents in the salaried employees of Hughes versus

 1   Hughes administrator case and said that a list of the

 2   participants and their addresses could not be considered

 3   a plan document because it did not correspond with that

 4   detailed listing of the plan document under Section 1024

 5   and 102 a.   Indeed under Section 1025, Your Honors, if

 6   these are plan documents then the administrator has a

 7   duty to disclose them to any person participant or

 8   beneficiary who asked and as the Ninth Circuit pointed

 9   out there is substantial dangers there of going way

10   beyond what Congress, a very liberal Watergate Congress

11   in 1974, intended ERISA to be, which is a protection for

12   participants and beneficiaries, not for plan

13   administrators.   And it exposes those participants and

14   beneficiaries to loss of privacy, telemarketing, and

15   other things because one person could get such a list

16   and sell it to others.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I must have missed

18   -- where did Watergate come from.

19                (Laughter.)

20                MR. FURLOW:       Just putting in context the

21   intentions of the 1974 Congress, which was concerned

22   about participants and beneficiaries.                   Those were the

23   sole purposes for which section 1102 was designed to

24   protect, not the convenience of plan administrators as

25   DuPont would lead this Court to believe.

 5              ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 6                    ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE

 7              MS. KRUGER:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9              The Fifth Circuit decided this case on the

10   grounds that ERISA's anti-alienation provision forbids a

11   divorcing spouse from relinquishing an interest in his

12   or her ex-spouse's pension plan benefits unless the

13   waiver takes the form of a qualified domestic relations

14   order.

15              We agree with Petitioner that the Fifth

16   Circuit misinterpreted both the anti-alienation

17   provision and the QDRO exception to that provision.                  But

18   we disagree with Petitioner's further submission that

19   merely because ERISA does not forbid waivers in the

20   divorce context or otherwise, that a plan administrator

21   may be required as a matter of Federal common law to

22   recognize such waivers even when those waivers conflict

23   with the beneficiary designation the plan administrator

24   has on file.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, are the provisions

 1   of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?

 2                 MS. KRUGER:       Indeed, Your Honor, we think

 3   that they are.    The statute directs plan administrators

 4   to administer the plan in accordance with the plan

 5   documents and further requires administrators to pay

 6   benefits to persons who are either participants under

 7   the plan or who are beneficiaries within the meaning of

 8   the statute.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Did the Court of Appeals

10   give short shrift or overlook that point?

11                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, the Court of Appeals

12   determined that it need not reach this point because it

13   decided the case on different grounds; namely, the

14   anti-alienation grounds.          But, again, we think that if

15   the Fifth Circuit was incorrect in its reasoning but

16   reached the correct overall conclusion, then its

17   judgment should be affirmed.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, we -- I mean, we

19   could have -- you know, we should have thought of that

20   when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the --

21   to the one question on which you agree with the

22   Petitioner.    But we did do that, didn't we, even though

23   the other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose,

24   and we said we -- we are not going to get into that?             We

25   just want to decide this question, which is an important

 1   question all by itself.

 2                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, for several reasons, Your

 3   Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to

 4   answer both the plan documents question as well as the

 5   anti-alienation question.

 6                 One is that it is an alternative ground for

 7   affirmance.

 8                 The other is that it was properly raised in

 9   the Court of Appeals.       It was raised in the cert

10   petition as well as in the brief in opposition.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do you know any other case

12   in which we have explicitly declined to accept a

13   question and then have used one of these other back

14   doorways of -- of answering it anyway?

15                 MS. KRUGER:       I --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't know of any.      I

17   mean maybe -- maybe we have but --

18                 MS. KRUGER:       I'm -- I'm not sure that I know

19   of any either, Your Honor.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, could we do this?        I

21   mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a

22   very strong argument following the plan documents.                 They

23   have had some chance to reply to it, but not a full

24   chance.   It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit

25   had -- would probably know what they say.                Okay.   Can

 5   another trip.    So what's your suggestion as to how we

 6   proceed?

 7                MS. KRUGER:        Well, Your Honor, I think it

 8   would be possible to -- to either order for the briefing

 9   on the issue or to grant the question now at this

10   juncture.   I think it would also be conceivable to read

11   the question that the Court did grant on as encompassing

12   the Federal common law --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            You see, I want to be fair

14   to them.    I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the

15   other side to be sure they have a chance to say

16   everything they have to say.             That's what's worrying me.

17                MS. KRUGER:        Well, Your Honor, that is an

18   important consideration.          I do think that in the opening

19   brief the Petitioners did brief the question of what

20   effect is to be given to a waiver if indeed a waiver is

21   not prohibited by the anti-alienation clause.             And that

22   Federal common law rule that Petitioners suggest is one

23   that does, I think, naturally invite some consideration

24   of the conflicting statutory directive in the form of

25   the plan documents principle that this Court has


                                        25
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   recognized in its earlier cases.                And certainly in its

 2   reply brief Petitioners did address this issue in full.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did -- did we recognize in

 4   earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan

 5   documents?

 6                MS. KRUGER:        Well, Your Honor, I think the

 7   question of whether beneficiary designation forms,

 8   counsel plan documents, is a little bit beside the

 9   point.   The -- the plan documents in this case do

10   specify a procedure for determining who is to receive

11   benefits.    It says that benefits will be paid to the

12   designated beneficiary, the person who is designated by

13   the participant.    And it says that changes to those

14   beneficiary designations shall be made in the manner

15   that's prescribed by the plan.

16                And so, because the plan sets out a

17   procedure for changing beneficiary designations, we

18   think that it would be inappropriate to look beyond that

19   to require plan administrators to look to extrinsic

20   documents in order to determine whether one of them

21   overrides that designation.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Again, assuming there has

23   been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of

24   course, the argument you're confronted with is:               I

25   haven't changed anything.           The prior beneficiary simply


                                        26
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- simply refused to accept it, waived it.                  I haven't

 2   changed the designation at all.

 3                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, in this case there is a

 4   conflict then between the wishes of the participant, who

 5   by all accounts would have chosen not to change the

 6   beneficiary designation, and that of the beneficiary.

 7                 And in that case in order to effectuate the

 8   -- the interests of all parties involved in order to

 9   provide certainty to all parties in ascertaining what

10   their rights are with respect to the plan, then it is

11   incumbent on the plan administrator to abide by the

12   designated beneficiary.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I think it's a harder

14   question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone

15   into it as deeply as I would like to, principally

16   because we rejected that -- that question.

17                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, again, Your Honor, we

18   think it would be appropriate for the Court to go on to

19   address that question because the issues have been fully

20   aired both in the Fifth Circuit and in the briefing in

21   this Court.    But if the Court were inclined to -- to

22   reserve that question for a later time, I think that

23   would be fine as well.        And --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Am I right in

25   understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split


                                        27
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   on that question, even that majority of the circuits are

 2   contrary to the Government's position?

 3              MS. KRUGER:        That is correct.           There is a

 4   circuit split on the question as was raised in the

 5   petition for certiorari, and the Second and Sixth

 6   Circuits are the circuits that have to date agreed with

 7   the position that we are espousing here:                That the plan

 8   documents control and preclude formulation of a Federal

 9   common law rule of the sort that Petitioner proposes.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And which circuits

11   are on the other side?

12              MS. KRUGER:        There are a number of them

13   including the Fifth, the Seventh, the Third.

14              The reason why the plan documents rule is so

15   important in this case is because it serves important

16   statutory interests in certainty, certainty of the

17   parties as well as certainty of the administrators.

18              And it is clear; it is easy to apply; it

19   makes it possible for administrators to do their jobs

20   without fear of further litigation in case they happen

21   to make what a court may later in the proceedings

22   determine is the wrong choice.

23              For that reason, we think that ERISA is

24   clear, and that it doesn't permit the kind of Federal

25   common law rule that Petitioner proposes, which is one


                                      28
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that would essentially revise the statute to override

 2   the plan documents rule and would require substantial

 3   burdens on the plan and would yield uncertainty for the

 4   parties.

 5               For that reason we would ask the Court to

 6   affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on

 7   alternative grounds or, alternatively, it should remand

 8   for further proceedings.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

10               Mr. Levy.

11               ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK I. LEVY

12               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13               MR. LEVY:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14   please the Court:

15               In light of the Court's questions, I want to

16   begin with the plan documents argument and first the

17   procedural question of whether it's properly before the

18   Court.   We think that it is.

19               It's well within the settled doctrine of an

20   alternative ground for affirmance.                  It was raised below,

21   and the Fifth Circuit has decided the issue in other

22   cases.   We don't dispute that.              So we know what the

23   Fifth Circuit thinks about this issue, and, therefore,

24   there is no point in a remand.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you know of any case in


                                        29

 1   which we've done this --

 2               MR. LEVY:      I do.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- rejected the question

 4   and then decided it?

 5               MR. LEVY:      I apologize if it's not in the

 6   brief, but a case I could find was called Piper Aircraft

 7   versus Rayno 454 U.S. 235.          And in that case the court

 8   limited its grant of certiorari, but then went ahead and

 9   decided a question that wasn't subsumed within that

10   question because they found it appropriate to the proper

11   disposition of the case.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, no.   But is that

13   a case in which the question the court decided was

14   presented in the petition, the court said we are not

15   going to take that question then they decided it on that

16   ground anyway.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's what I'm asking.

18   Yes.

19               MR. LEVY:      I'm not sure of the answer to

20   that.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You are sure of the answer.

22   You don't know of any case.

23               MR. LEVY:      I think Piper is at least a first

24   cousin if not a direct sibling of the issue that we've

25   got here.   I don't disagree that it is in the Court's


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   discretion.    The Court has discretion, I think, one --

 2   either way whether it wants to decide this or wants

 3   remand, but we think it would be appropriate --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I guess you agree

 5   that it's a question of which the circuits have split,

 6   so presumably there are good arguments on both sides,

 7   and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full

 8   opportunity to brief here.           So we'd have to be pretty

 9   confident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide

10   it.

11                 MR. LEVY:     Well, actually I think the Court

12   will be confident if it looks into it.                      But beyond that

13   this is the classic case of an alternative ground for

14   affirmance of the judgment.             When that arises, the

15   topside party always has to deal with that issue in its

16   reply brief and only in its reply brief.                      So there is

17   nothing unfair about the --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It would be the classic

19   case but for the fact that we had rejected that

20   question.   Had we not been asked to decide it and said

21   no, it would be the classic case, I agree.

22                 MR. LEVY:     And I agree.                 That makes it

23   within the Court's discretion.               It doesn't have to

24   decide it, but we think there are good reasons here.

25   It's been fully briefed, including by the Petitioner for


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the reason I just said.        Four amici have addressed it;

 2   we have addressed it.      So it's properly before the

 3   Court, and there is nothing unfair about deciding it.

 4   In addition --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can we expect that to

 6   happen in future cases when we turn down a question and

 7   amici and people come in and brief the question anyway

 8   and then ask us to decide it?

 9               MR. LEVY:      I wouldn't think so.                 The fact

10   that we can't find another case, either, I think makes

11   this one unique.   And I think there are good reasons --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I think there is a

13   question of the way it was phrased.                     And perhaps the

14   court just didn't get it, what that question on which we

15   didn't grant cert was driving at.

16               MR. LEVY:      I would be loathe to make that

17   suggestion, Justice Ginsburg.

18               (Laughter.)

19               MR. LEVY:      But it may well -- it's possible

20   that that could be the explanation or the Court with

21   fuller consideration -- I mean, the issue has been fully

22   briefed.   The Court knows more about the issues than it

23   did at the time it granted cert, and we think it is for

24   a -- to decide this.

25               And I do want to point out that there is a


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   relationship between the questions.                      Both the question

 2   granted and the question that wasn't granted -- wasn't

 3   denied, but it wasn't granted -- raise similar

 4   considerations.    They both get into the same statutory

 5   scheme.   They both get into the same considerations of

 6   plan administrability.        We think it would be most

 7   efficient for the Court to resolve the conflict now and

 8   not leave the uncertainty to continue any further.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Undoubtedly we should have

10   granted it.

11                 MR. LEVY:     Well, in the fullness of time,

12   the Court can now revisit that.               But again, I think it

13   has been fully briefed and there is nothing unfair to

14   the Petitioners.    The Court in its discretion --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Would you like to argue

16   the question that is here?

17                 MR. LEVY:     Yes --

18                 (Laughter.)

19                 MR. LEVY:     -- I would.             I take it the Court

20   doesn't need argument on the merits of the plan

21   documents issues, since that's already been discussed,

22   so let me turn to the QDRO question.                     That is the

23   question that was -- that was granted and was discussed

24   fully in the briefs.

25                 Now, as to the QDRO part of the case, the


                                        33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   rule of law that governs this case is that pension plan

 2   administrators must pay benefits in accordance with a

 3   qualified domestic relations order, and they may not pay

 4   benefits in accordance with a nonqualified order.

 5               That rule follows from two separate and

 6   different analyses.     One is the anti-alienation

 7   provision, and the other is the QDRO provision in

 8   subparagraph (H) of section 1056.                They are both

 9   discussed in our brief.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where would I find the

11   latter?   If I wanted to read it?              Which I do.

12               (Laughter.)

13               MR. LEVY:      I don't find this all that

14   pleasant reading, but it's on page 21A of the statutory

15   appendix to the red brief.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            21A?

17               MR. LEVY:      21A.        And it's (H)(ii) and (iii).

18   And I want to start with this because it is really is

19   the more straightforward analysis and avoids a lot of

20   questions under the anti-alienation provision.               This

21   argument would prevail whether or not the purported

22   waiver is deemed to be an assignment or alienation under

23   1056(d)(1) and (d)(3).

24               Now, we think it is and I'll come back to

25   that under the IRS regulation, but let me start with


                                       34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this alternative argument that's also made in the brief.

 2                 Under ERISA, a domestic relations order is

 3   either a qualified order or a nonqualified order.                         And

 4   ERISA expressly provides that if it's a nonqualified

 5   order, as it is here, the plan administrator may not pay

 6   benefits pursuant to that order.

 7                 Justice Scalia, since you're on page 21A,

 8   let's look at subparagraph (H)(iii).                       This is 21A of the

 9   red brief.     It provides that:            If an order is not

10   qualified, the plan administrator shall pay the benefits

11   to the person or persons who would be entitled to such

12   benefits if there had been no order.                       If there had been

13   no order.     In other words, the administrator disregards

14   it and pays it to the person -- this is in (iii),

15   Justice Scalia.

16                 Contrast that with subparagraph (H)(ii)

17   right above it, where the order is qualified:                       The

18   administrator shall pay the benefits to the person

19   entitled thereto under the order.

20                 So, it gives you two choices.                     If it's a

21   qualified order, the plan must pay.                       If it's not a

22   qualified order, the plan --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that doesn't make too

24   much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just

25   waived.     The wife waived the amount because when she


                                         35
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody.                       She

 2   just doesn't take it.        So it goes to the beneficiary --

 3   it goes to the person who made up the plan.                     It's a

 4   little hard to pay to him, because he is dead.

 5              So I mean if you read it literally, it

 6   doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case

 7   before us, which is a case of waiver.                     And of course the

 8   argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law,

 9   waiver is treated differently.                And if it weren't, you'd

10   have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a

11   benefit that's given to you by someone else.

12              And so let's interpret this and make sense

13   of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest

14   of the law to say a waiver is waivered.                    It's not giving

15   something to somebody else.

16              MR. LEVY:         You've covered a lot of ground,

17   Justice Breyer.   I want to give you several responses --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:               The argument is against you

19   and I would like to hear what you have to say.

20              MR. LEVY:         And I appreciate that.

21              First of all, on this part of the argument

22   under the QDRO provision under subparagraph (H), it

23   doesn't matter whether this is a waiver or not.                    That

24   goes to the alienation question, and I will get to that

25   in a little while.      This applies --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:               No, it also goes to the

 2   question of who is the person or persons who would have

 3   been entitled to such amounts if there had been no

 4   order.

 5              MR. LEVY:         If there were no --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:               If there was a waiver and

 7   there had been no order, your friend's contention is by

 8   traditional common law, the person who would have been

 9   entitled to it would have been his client.

10              MR. LEVY:         On the contrary, Justice --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I mean, I don't see how

12   this language helps you.           It sort of restates the

13   question, but --

14              MR. LEVY:         I don't believe so.                I think it

15   is not only helpful but dispositive.                      The order that is

16   referred to is the divorce decree, the qualified

17   domestic -- I'm sorry -- the domestic relations order.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Right.

19              MR. LEVY:         If there had been no order --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:               If there had been no

21   order --

22              MR. LEVY:         -- then there wouldn't have been

23   any waiver by Liv.      I mean, excuse me -- yes, by Liv.

24   There wouldn't have been any waiver if there weren't any

25   divorce decree because the waiver is contained --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Oh, I see.       I see.

 2                MR. LEVY:       -- in the decree.             So, if there

 3   were no --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I see your point.         Does he

 5   agree with that, that apart from the divorce decree,

 6   there is no waiver?

 7                MR. LEVY:       I'd hesitate to speak for him,

 8   but I think the language is --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I got you.

10                MR. LEVY:       -- quite clear, and that's why

11   this is a more straightforward analysis than the waiver

12   under anti-alienation.         I do hope to get to that.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I see.

14                MR. LEVY:       But this is really very

15   straightforward and dispositive.

16                And the legislative history confirms this.

17   The plain text is clear, but the legislative history

18   confirms it.     Congress took a specific look at this

19   specific issue in a specific context of marital

20   dissolution, and it enacted this QDRO provision.                    And

21   the provision is comprehensive and complete.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd

23   have to admit.     I think -- and you perhaps can explain

24   it to me -- but, I thought the things that you are

25   quoting are QDRO is about an effort to alienate some

 1   property that would otherwise go to the person who was

 2   setting up a QDRO, in other words, the wife here, in

 3   other words Liv here; is that right?

 4                MR. LEVY:       No.      It has to go to an alternate

 5   payee.    It doesn't have to be the wife.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.       The one person who

 7   couldn't be an alternate payee is the payor.                   And so, in

 8   fact, when you waive something, it isn't that it

 9   necessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it

10   didn't here.     It simply went back to the payor.                And so

11   the language of this prevision you're quoting just

12   doesn't deal with this case.

13                MR. LEVY:       Well, I think it does, Justice

14   Breyer.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:             I know you do, and that's

16   what I need to ask.

17                MR. LEVY:       It doesn't say anything about

18   where it goes.     It just says if it's a QDRO, you pay it,

19   and if it's not a QDRO, you don't pay it.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm sorry.       It says, if

21   it's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the

22   plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to

23   the person or persons who would have been entitled to

24   such amounts if there had been no order.

25                MR. LEVY:       Yes.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, you think that

 2   includes the giver, the payor?

 3                MR. LEVY:     No.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, that's where this

 5   goes if you waive it.

 6                MR. LEVY:     I don't believe so, because the

 7   "if there had no order" clause refers to the domestic

 8   relations order, a divorce decree.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You say the waiver is in

10   the order?

11                MR. LEVY:     Yes.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And without the order,

13   there has been no waiver.

14                MR. LEVY:     That's correct.              And the statute

15   says --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           We'll have to see whether

17   your friend agrees with that.             I'll bet he doesn't.

18                (Laughter.)

19                MR. LEVY:     That's what made horse races.

20   Let me just say a further word about the legislative

21   history of this and then come back to the

22   anti-alienation provision, Justice Breyer, if I -- if I

23   might.

24                Congress made it clear that benefits are to

25   be paid pursuant to an order "if and only if" -- and


                                       40

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that's a quote from the legislative history -- the order

 2   is a QDRO; in other words, the order be a QDRO in order

 3   to be paid.    Congress was mindful of the burdens that

 4   nonqualified orders put on plan administrators and it

 5   purposely sought to avoid that by requiring that an

 6   order be a QDRO, a qualified order, in order for there

 7   -- for there to be payment.             The QDRO provision is an

 8   objective checklist that is easy for -- for plan

 9   administrators to follow.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What if they had agreed to

11   the waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the

12   domestic relations order?           Just apart from that, they

13   have a separate signed waiver.               We'd be in the same suit

14   that you're -- that you say we have to avoid, wouldn't

15   we?

16                 MR. LEVY:     I don't think so.              I mean I think

17   that would be an alienation.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, if it's an

19   alienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an

20   alienation.

21                 MR. LEVY:     Right.         And I will come to that,

22   but the point here is that this arises and can only

23   arise in a domestic relations context.                   That's where

24   QDRO applies, and the Fifth Circuit's holding was that

25   that was the sole mechanism for the --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:              What about some other

 2   waiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with

 3   a domestic relations thing?             You know -- "I've made my

 4   -- my eldest son a beneficiary."                It turns out, you

 5   know, he is fat and happy; he doesn't need the money and

 6   he agrees to waive it, so -- so I can give it to an

 7   impecunious daughter.       Okay?        What -- what happens with

 8   that?

 9              MR. LEVY:        Well, first of all, that would

10   run squarely into the plan document's argument.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Ah. Oh, oh, oh. You're

12   jumping over to the other argument.                      Let's leave that

13   argument out.

14              MR. LEVY:        If it's not a marital dissolution

15   context, then QDRO wouldn't apply one way or the other.

16   Now, in that context, I think what you're suggesting,

17   Justice Scalia --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes, but you would still --

19   the plan would still have to make some inquires,

20   wouldn't it?

21              MR. LEVY:        Not -- well, just on -- not

22   getting to the plan documents.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes.      Not getting in the

24   plan documents.

25              MR. LEVY:        It would be a different case.                   I

 1   mean, this case involves what Congress specifically

 2   looked at and specifically did in the context of marital

 3   dissolution, and the reason for that is a marital

 4   dissolution comes up all the time.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Sure.

 6              MR. LEVY:       It's a commonplace in these

 7   benefits issues, and these are high-volumes operations.

 8   The plan administrators aren't lawyers.                    Congress wanted

 9   bright-line rules that could be easily applied here, not

10   general principles to be applied for the facts and

11   circumstances of each particular case, highly

12   fact-intensive, highly subjective inquiries.                    Congress

13   didn't want any of that.         It didn't want the plan

14   administrator to have to look behind the face of the

15   order to the circumstances of the --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm five minutes behind.            I

17   just got your point on the (iii)(1).                    I see it.

18              MR. LEVY:       Okay.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay?       I get it.

20              MR. LEVY:       It didn't want the plan

21   administrators to have to try and divine the intention

22   of the parties, didn't want the plan administrators to

23   have to hold a factfinding hearing before it could pay

24   plan benefits.   That is completely foreign to the

25   efficient and simple operation that Congress had in

 1   mind.

 2              Now let me turn to the anti-alienation issue

 3   about which there have been several questions.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Before you do, leaving

 5   the plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that

 6   the plan administrator is not required to give effect to

 7   a waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary

 8   designation.    Is it just not required?                 Does the

 9   administrator have discretion to give effect to the

10   waiver, or it -- must it disregard the waiver and

11   strictly follow the beneficiary designation?

12              MR. LEVY:        I believe it must follow the

13   beneficiary designation.          Indeed, my understanding is it

14   has a fiduciary duty and a legal requirement to follow

15   the plan designation.       Now, the plan might specify

16   alternatives.   Here, for example, the plan said, here's

17   a form that you fill out.           And William Kennedy filled it

18   out with respect to a different plan, the pension and

19   retirement plan.   But where the plan says, "we will pay

20   the designated beneficiary" -- and that's what this plan

21   says -- then the plan administrator is required, as I

22   understand it, to pay that designated beneficiary.

23              Now let me say a word since this came up,

24   although it's not really central to the change of

25   beneficiary designation that William filed for this


                                        44
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   other plan that's not now before the Court, the pension

 2   and retirement plan.       And I would say only two things

 3   about that:    One is at JA 62, and if you look at it, it

 4   says in the title and it says in the body of the

 5   document that this applies to the pension and retirement

 6   plan.    We don't think anyone could have thought that it

 7   applied to other plans and that William therefore was

 8   changing the beneficiary as to those other plans.                     In

 9   fact, at JA 28 in paragraph 10, there was a stipulation

10   of fact in the district court that William never changed

11   the designation as to the savings and investment plan,

12   the SIP that is before the Court today.                     So it was not

13   only not raised below, it was stipulated away and I

14   think that was --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Let me go back for a second

16   because, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it

17   right, I still don't see why Congress would have done it

18   literally.

19                 I think what you're saying is:                   "Read the

20   full four pages.    What those four pages say are, Judge,

21   you have an order, a divorce decree.                     It's defined as an

22   order.   Look at it.     It's qualified or it isn't.                 If

23   it's qualified, pay the money to the person it names.

24   If it's not qualified, pay the money to the person,

25   namely Liv, who would have been entitled to the amount


                                        45

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   if there had been no order."

 2              Okay.    You read that literally as you want

 3   and what it says is:      "Liv, you're being divorced.             You

 4   want a divorce; your husband wants a divorce; you're

 5   going to be divorced.      You cannot waive the benefit

 6   under the plan."   Now, why would Congress not want her

 7   to be able to waive it?        Why?

 8              MR. LEVY:       I don't think the issue -- I

 9   mean, a lot depends on the wording.

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             I can understand an anti-

11   alienation provision.      That's some guy who is going to

12   come along and grab this money when you want to take

13   care of a widow, and you want to take care -- but -- but

14   this isn't that.   It's just -- she just wants to waive

15   it; she doesn't want it.         That's the widow herself.

16   Okay, so why would Congress --

17              MR. LEVY:       Two things:             One, we think that

18   purpose does apply here.         I mean, the point of

19   anti-alienation provision is to guard against the

20   temptation to trade off future pension benefits in

21   exchange for immediate economic gain or advantage.

22   That's exactly what Liv did in the divorce.                 She got the

23   Mercedes, she got other things.              She traded off her

24   pension benefits, and we think that falls squarely

25   within the purpose of the anti-alienation provision.

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:               I see.

 2              MR. LEVY:         That's the first and, I think,

 3   most important answer.

 4              The other thing is that we are not saying --

 5   our position today does not mean that divorcing parties

 6   can -- can be foreclosed from eliminating the death

 7   benefits -- the death benefits for the designated

 8   beneficiary; but they have to follow procedures that

 9   comply with ERISA.      The most -- the most direct and

10   simplest one is the change of beneficiary form.                   William

11   didn't do that here.        That's undisputed.             They could

12   have entered into a QDRO, and that would have gone --

13   the money would have gone to Liv as an alternate payee.

14   That would have taken the benefits, consistent with

15   ERISA, away from Liv and given them to Kari.                   They could

16   have done that.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, why -- why do

18   they have to worry about that?                The simplest thing is

19   for the participant to change the designation, and if

20   there's a divorce, the divorcee is no longer a spouse

21   under the terms of the plan, so he is free to do that.

22   It seems odd to me that they have this elaborate QDRO

23   provision when it shouldn't be necessary.

24              MR. LEVY:         It's not necessary.             It's simply

25   another alternative, but I agree with you, Mr. Chief

 1   Justice, that the most direct and straightforward --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But another

 3   alternative is that all you can -- you can cross out

 4   this name and put in another, or you can go to court,

 5   get this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan.

 6   I mean, why would anybody do that?

 7              MR. LEVY:       They wouldn't have to.

 8              Now, let me turn to this issue about what is

 9   an assignment or alienation when we disagree with our

10   friends from the Solicitor General's Office.                      We think

11   Liv's purported waiver here was an assignment or

12   alienation within the IRS definition.                   The IRS

13   regulation is reprinted at page 15 of the body of the

14   red brief, and it provides that assignment or alienation

15   is defined to include any direct or indirect arrangement

16   whereby a party acquires an interest from the

17   beneficiary.   And I've left out the not -- the

18   not-critical language for present purposes.                   So it talks

19   about an indirect arrangement whereby a party acquires

20   an interest from the beneficiary.

21              Now, the government argues that that

22   definition requires that the beneficiary, first, must

23   direct the transfer and, second, it must direct it to a

24   third party.   The government's argument rests not on the

25   language of the regulation that I just read but on a

 1   legal argument that this is what terms meant at common

 2   law.   But that position simply can't be squared with the

 3   language of the regulation.              As I just said, the

 4   regulation includes an indirect arrangement within the

 5   definition of "assignment or alienation."

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But isn't -- isn't the

 7   problem that it must be an indirect arrangement, and

 8   what you are arguing for here is an indirect effect.

 9   And it has that indirect effect on your reasoning

10   because of the -- of the waiver and because of probate

11   law.   And it seems to me, as I read the -- the IRS reg,

12   the "arrangement" that it's referring to is an

13   arrangement which in and of itself would -- would effect

14   the transfer.     And that is not the case here.

15                MR. LEVY:       Well, we think it is.        The

16   arrangement here effected transfer to the estate under

17   the plan default rule.         The estate was next in line.       So

18   if this is a relinquishment -- I don't want to use the

19   word "waiver."    But if this is a relinquishment of her

20   interest, then it went to the estate.

21                That's what the plan provides, but it's not

22   just the phrase "indirect arrangement" that we rely on,

23   Justice Souter.     It's also the phrase "a party

24   acquirer."   It doesn't say a party acquirer at or by the

25   direction of the beneficiary. -

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's -- that's the

 2   point that troubles me.          It's -- it's the "acquirer's"

 3   language.

 4                 Does -- does the person who -- who receives

 5   the -- the refused benefit acquire it from the other

 6   person?     He certainly doesn't do so for Federal tax

 7   purposes.

 8                 MR. LEVY:      Well, that's back to the

 9   disclaimer, Justice Scalia.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            The only person who

11   acquires it -- the only entity that acquires it is the

12   estate.

13                 MR. LEVY:      Yes, that's right under the

14   default rule.    And if the default rule had a -- if the

15   plan had a different default rule, under the default

16   rule maybe it goes to the children.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Does he acquire it from a

18   participant or beneficiary?

19                 MR. LEVY:      He acquires it from the

20   beneficiary list.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought the -- the notion

22   is it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to

23   the person refusing it had never occurred.                I mean,

24   there is -- there is no gift tax payable or anything

25   else.

 1              MR. LEVY:       Well, there is no gift tax

 2   payable if it's a qualified disclaimer, and it won't be

 3   in a divorce case because there will be consideration

 4   and that prevents a qualified disclaimer.               So that's a

 5   different situation, but the word "acquired" doesn't

 6   mean --

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You made the contention

 8   now -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if

 9   you get something in return for a disclaimer, then the

10   disclaimer is not effected.            That it's effected only if

11   you receive nothing in return.              And what -- what is the

12   source of that contention that you can't disclaim if you

13   get something in return?

14              MR. LEVY:       The -- it's -- under the Gift Tax

15   Code Justice Ginsburg, section 2518 defines a qualified

16   disclaimer, which means you don't pay gift tax on it.

17   It's as if the interest had never been transferred.              And

18   one of the conditions of that qualified disclaimer is

19   that the disclaimant not accept any interest or any of

20   its benefits.   So if there is consideration, if the

21   person is in a better position than they would have been

22   because they received consideration, then it won't be a

23   qualified disclaimer for gift tax purposes.

24              But there won't ever be a disqualified

25   disclaimer for that reason in a -- in the divorce

 1   context.     It simply --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is the -- is the wife --

 3   I'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too.                      If

 4   your -- the woman is Wife X, and her ex has a pension.

 5   Doesn't something vest there?               She is in California.

 6   Doesn't she have some vested right to some of that

 7   pension?

 8                 MR. LEVY:      In her own pension?

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose she's married for

10   40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and

11   then he wants a divorce.           Doesn't she have some right to

12   some of that money.

13                 MR. LEVY:      Well, I think under section 1055

14   there's a right to different annuities.                   That that was a

15   new provision in the Retirement Equity Act in 1984.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Does she get some of the

17   money he saved?

18                 MR. LEVY:      Yes, she's entitled to it.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So it's not exactly that

20   you could have just changed the beneficiary.                   If you

21   just changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her

22   something else.

23                 MR. LEVY:      After the divorce she is not

24   entitled.    It's only a spouse who is entitled to the

25   benefits .

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            But in the divorce

 2   proceeding she's going to get some of the money, which

 3   is now just the inverse point, to which she is entitled.

 4   So obviously she will get something, but she's entitled

 5   to it.

 6                MR. LEVY:      Right, I think that's right.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Not, not obviously.

 8   I mean it depends what the divorce is.                   She got the

 9   Mercedes, right?    I mean, she can get -- it depends on

10   the divorce arrangement, not anything under ERISA, once

11   she is a nonspouse.

12                MR. LEVY:      Once she is a nonspouse she is no

13   longer entitled to those benefits under ERISA section

14   1055.

18                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID A. FURLOW

20                MR. FURLOW:        Thank you, Your Honor.           Chief

21   Justice Roberts, you were asking about the evidence

22   earlier with respect to the possession in DuPont office

23   own files of the divorce decree and of the notice that

24   was given saying:     Please don't pay leave; she's already

25   waived all of her benefits.             You will find that on page

 1   76 of the joint appendix in the sworn amended affidavit

 2   of Mary Dineen, the plan's administrator, specifically

 3   at paragraph 20, page 76, where she says in bold:                   "Upon

 4   its receipt" -- meaning the April 26, 2001, letter from

 5   Kari Kennedy Duckworth -- "Exhibit No. 1 was maintained

 6   as a record of DuPont with regard to the SIP account of

 7   William Patrick Kennedy."            That's joint appendix 76,

 8   paragraph 20.     It was within the regular course of

 9   business of DuPont to maintain a copy of this letter

10   with other DuPont letters relating to Mr. Kennedy's SIP

11   account at the time the letter was received from its

12   sender.   The letter is then attached as the next exhibit

13   that follows on.    That would be about pages 78 to 79.

14   And there it says the divorce decree was attached.

15               Make no mistake:              DuPont had that divorce

16   decree and could see the knowing, voluntary waiver and

17   had it well in advance of making its decision to pay

18   money to a woman who went off to Norway and paid her

19   when she was over there, where there was no prospect of

20   grabbing it back and turning it over to the executor.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   They look at it and

22   say, is this a QDRO?        And if no, then they go back to

23   the other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red

24   brief, and say:    If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.

25               MR. FURLOW:          Well, Your Honor, it's more

 1   interesting than that, actually, in that if you look to

 2   page 68 of the joint appendix you'll see Mary Dineen,

 3   the administrator, was saying, quote:                      "Had Liv Kennedy

 4   disclaimed her designation of the beneficiary of

 5   Mr. Kennedy's SIP, that declination or disclaimer or a

 6   copy would have been included in the beneficiary

 7   designation file."      So they're taking disclaimers or

 8   waivers.   They're taking declinations, which is a fancy

 9   Latin way of saying waiver.              They've got them in their

10   files.   They're acting on it.              But here they decided to

11   pay the money to the person who has voluntarily waived,

12   knowing the issue, not asking their in-house counsel at

13   no cost to make an examination here.                      And why?   So that

14   they can later take this plan documents rule and take it

15   all the way to this court.            But --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Was this waiver only part

17   of the divorce degree?         Do you agree with your friend on

18   that point?

19                 MR. FURLOW:        Well, this waiver was the part

20   in which Liv Kennedy waived all right so that he

21   retained all of his --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not separate and

23   apart from the divorce decree.

24                 MR. FURLOW:        It was not separate and apart.

25   In fact, when they were transferring benefits they knew

 1   what to do and they used the waiver to transfer part of

 2   the benefits.

 3                 It is interesting, Your Honors, that they

 4   talked about the plan documents rule, but their own

 5   documentation says, their own plan says, that the only

 6   plan documents -- and I quoted it here on page 25 of our

 7   reply brief -- "The official plan documents are the E.I.

 8   DuPont de Nemours & Company savings and investment plan

 9   and the trust agreement," not beneficiary designations.

10   So they give no notice.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you have anything

12   more to say on the plan document, the plan document

13   issue than what you've said here.

14                 MR. FURLOW:        Oh, I could come up with lots

15   of things.     That's a bad idea.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay.   Thank you,

17   counsel.     The case is submitted.

18                 (Whereupon, at 1:56 p.m., the case in the
