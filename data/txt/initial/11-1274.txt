 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and

 5   Alpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 7                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  MR. LIMAN:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                  This case concerns the statute dealing

12   exclusively with penalty claims brought by government

13   agencies to punish conduct made unlawful by statute.

14   Congress provided a clear and easily administered

15   statutory time limitation on the government's power to

16   punish:     5 years, except as otherwise provided by

17   Congress.

18                  The case does not concern -- the statute

19   does not concern the government's power to seek remedial

20   remedies such as disgorgement and injunction.

21   Consistent with -- Congress's normal approach in penal

22   situations, Congress fixed a statute of limitations for

23   penalties.     The court below, for the first time over the

24   century the statute has been in existence, sweepingly

25   concluded that unless Congress clearly directed

                                         3

 1   otherwise, the statute and the 5 years did not begin to

 2   run from the time the defendant violated the law, the

 3   ordinary rule for statutes providing for accrual, but

 4   instead -

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 Mr. Liman.     Mr. Liman,

 6   you -- you are typing this a penalty case.                    The

 7   government says the accrual is the ordinary rule, but

 8   discovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is

 9   alleged here.     So how does the Court decide whether to

10   type this case a penalty case, as you allege, or a fraud

11   case, as the government urged -- urges, when both

12   captions fit?

13               MR. LIMAN:          Your Honor, I think there are

14   two answers to that.        First is that the Court doesn't

15   need to decide, Congress has decided.                    Congress made it

16   quite clear that the rule of accrual applied to all

17   penalty claims.     And as this Court held in

18   Clark v. Martinez, the same word in a statute cannot be

19   given different interpretations depending on the

20   underlying statute to which it is applied.

21               The second reason, though, Justice Ginsburg,

22   is that it is not correct to say, and this Court has

23   never said, that either the Bailey rule or the injury

24   accrual rule applies to a statutory fraud claim where

25   the government is seeking to punish.                     That would -

                                         4

 1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Excuse me.

 2   Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about

 3   the statute, but the statute uses the term "accrual."

 4   Is it correct to say that the term "accrual" is not used

 5   in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for

 6   crimes?

 7                  MR. LIMAN:       For -- for crimes, the general

 8   word that is used is time period from the violation.

 9                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Right.       And this -- and

10   this talks about accrual.             So that is indicative -- is

11   indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil

12   analogue in the drafting of this statute.

13                  MR. LIMAN:       Your Honor, it indicates that

14   Congress is using accrual as it is understood at common

15   law.   Common law, it means when the claim becomes ripe

16   and the plaintiff has the ability to sue.                     What that

17   means is, as the D.C. Circuit said in 3M -- and we think

18   the D.C. Circuit got it right on this -- that you look

19   to the underlying statute pursuant to which the

20   government is seeking a penalty to see when the claim

21   became ripe.

22                  In a penalty situation, and under the IAA,

23   which is what this concerns -- it doesn't concern a

24   common law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where

25   there's even any element of deception that's required.

                                         5

 1   It's a breach of fiduciary duty.                 What the IAA says is

 2   that the government can sue when the violation occurs.

 3               Now -

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Liman, I understand

 5   your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty,

 6   okay?

 7               Bailey and Exploration Company, with

 8   statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the

 9   discovery rule into a fraud claim, both were a civil

10   litigant and for the government.                 The only way that I

11   can tease out a potential difference between Exploration

12   and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case

13   is not for injury, but for punishment, as you called it.

14   Government as enforcer, rather than government as

15   victim.

16               Some of us would say that the common wheel

17   is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that

18   distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense.

19               How do you answer that point?

20               MR. LIMAN:       Justice Sotomayor, let me give

21   you the precise answer to that, which is that in this

22   case where the government is seeking a penalty, it is

23   not acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the

24   recovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or

25   disgorgement.

                                      6

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               It's acting as a

 2   sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered

 3   society.    And if you break that order, you are injuring

 4   the society.     That -- that's the best -

 5                  MR. LIMAN:       Your Honor, I think that is the

 6   articulation that the government would have to make.                    I

 7   don't think it holds up, for several reasons.                   First of

 8   all, it would represent an extreme departure from

 9   anything this Court has ever held or, to our knowledge,

10   any court has ever held with respect to the application

11   of the discovery rule.

12                  Second, when you're talking about penalty,

13   you're not talking about recovery to -- to victims.

14   Third, when we're talking about implying a rule, which

15   is what the government's argument is here -- it's not an

16   argument to follow the plain language, it's an argument

17   to depart from the plain language -- you should look at,

18   and the cases direct you to look at, the policy

19   concerns.    And when you're talking about discover -- a

20   discovery rule with respect to the government as

21   enforcer, the rules don't work.                   They don't work for

22   several reasons.

23                  First of all, when you've got an injury, a

24   party who is injured, the statute of limitations has a

25   natural start date that is not in control of the

                                         7

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   plaintiff.   There is a relationship to the underlying

 2   violation.   And that can be readily measured.                    None of

 3   that is true when you're talking about the government in

 4   a law enforcement capacity.

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Liman, what you

 6   suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is

 7   that it has a basis in the notion that a defendant with

 8   unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct

 9   preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or

10   it has a cause of action -- you know, shouldn't be

11   entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations.

12                And if that's the understanding that lies

13   behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you

14   is, why doesn't it apply in this case, as well as, in

15   the case where the person bringing the action has

16   himself suffered a harm?

17                MR. LIMAN:       Justice Kagan, I've got two

18   answers to that question as well.                      The first is that -

19   that I don't think is the basis for the -- for the

20   discovery rule at bottom.           The basis for the discovery

21   rule -- if you look at this Court's opinion in -- in

22   Rotella, if you look at the Seventh Circuit in Cada, the

23   D.C. Circuit in Connor -- is the notion that when the

24   plaintiff cannot discover the injury, doesn't know that

25   it's been injured, and cannot reasonably know that the

                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   plaintiff's been injured, the plaintiff cannot take the

 2   steps that other plaintiffs would take to investigate

 3   and determine whether they've got a cause of action.

 4                  That's not applicable in a government

 5   enforcement context because you're not talking about

 6   there the government as a victim.                        The government may

 7   not know of the underlying transaction, will not know of

 8   the underlying transaction, unless the government asks.

 9                  The second reason is that there is a strain

10   that -- in the Bailey line of cases -- that really

11   speaks in terms of equitable tolling and fraudulent

12   concealment, that sort of a notion of unclean -- unclean

13   hands.   That's not in this case because the government

14   affirmatively took it out.               But we would submit -

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How did the government

16   take it out?     I mean, the point here is that there was a

17   concealment.     There was a hiding of what was -- the

18   impermissible action.

19                  MR. LIMAN:       That's -- that's not correct,

20   Justice Ginsburg.     If you'd look at the -- at the

21   opinion below and you look at the complaint, the essence

22   of the allegation, which we have not yet had a chance to

23   disprove before you on a motion to dismiss, is that

24   there were misrepresentations and omissions made to the

25   board of the mutual fund.             There was no

                                         9

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   misrepresentations made to the investing public.                      That

 2   allegation is not in the complaint.                      It would not be

 3   accurate.   And there is no allegation whatsoever that

 4   anything was hidden from the government or was in any

 5   way concealed from the government.                      The records here

 6   would have been available -- were available for the

 7   government to look at, at any time.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Liman, finishing up

 9   a point you were just on previously, what's your

10   position with respect to fraudulent concealment?

11   Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of

12   that to tolling of the statute?

13                MR. LIMAN:        Your Honor, I think you could

14   and should conclude -- that if you reach that issue.                         I

15   don't think you need to reach that issue.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But tell me about -

17                MR. LIMAN:        Our theory doesn't require you

18   to come to that conclusion.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                This is -- it's nice for

20   you to say that.   But tell me, having announced your

21   theory, how the next step is avoidable?                      Under what

22   theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but

23   you can have a fraudulent concealment rule?

24                MR. LIMAN:        Your Honor, in the -- using the

25   same type of theory and the same methodology that the

                                       10

 1   Court employed in the RICO context, in the Claire case,

 2   and in the Rotella case, one can read the statute, I

 3   think you have to read the statute, here to say that

 4   "accrue" means accrue.        It's the time that the

 5   government can first sue.

 6                That does not necessarily resolve the

 7   question of whether there are equitable exceptions that

 8   the government or any party could affirmatively assert

 9   to toll the statute of limitations, not to delay the

10   accrual of the statute of limitations.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you

12   acknowledge that a civil action could be brought

13   beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff

14   discovers the fraud, right?

15                MR. LIMAN:       That's -

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you're really not

17   arguing for what you might call a total statute of

18   repose.   It seems to me odd that the defendant would be

19   relieved from prosecution by the government, but not

20   relieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial

21   damages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have

22   to sue until he's discovered the fraud.

23                MR. LIMAN:       Your Honor, respectfully, we

24   don't think that's not odd at all.                     If you look in the

25   securities context, there is a 5-year statute of repose.

                                      11

 1   And it would be odd to think that the same Congress that

 2   passed that 5-year statute of repose limiting even the

 3   ability of an injured plaintiff without the tools of the

 4   government to bring a private suit for damages, that's

 5   the -

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Sure.          But that 5 years

 7   doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff

 8   discovers the fraud, right?

 9                 MR. LIMAN:       That's -- that's not correct,

10   Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No?

12                 MR. LIMAN:       Under Title 28 1658(b) the 5

13   years runs from the time of the violation.                      It's exactly

14   coextensive 2462, and it's not an accident that it's

15   exactly coextensive.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Liman, how does it

17   work with a disgorgement remedy?                   I take it that that's

18   still -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement?

19                 MR. LIMAN:       We are not challenging the

20   disgorgement in front of this Court, and if this Court

21   reverses the Second Circuit that -- that issue will

22   remain in the case and the SEC's claim for disgorgement

23   will remain, and that's really been the way -

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But you don't apply -

25   you don't say it's too late for them to sue for

                                       12

 2                  MR. LIMAN:       2462 applies exclusively with

 3   respect to penalties, fines and forfeitures.                   It does

 4   not apply with respect to equitable remedies.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So is there any statute

 6   of limitations on disgorgement?

 7                  MR. LIMAN:       There is none.           There is none.

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Does it apply to Social

 9   Security?     Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?

10                  MR. LIMAN:       The -- there is a Social

11   Security statute that -

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Does this statute apply to

13   Social Security?

14                  MR. LIMAN:       Yes.

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Does it apply to Veterans

16   Affairs?     Yes or no or you don't know?

17                  MR. LIMAN:       I don't know about Veterans

18   Affairs.

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:            What about Social Security?

20                  MR. LIMAN:       Social Security, there is an

21   underlying statute -

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Then, I'm asking about this

23   statute.     Does it apply?

24                  MR. LIMAN:       The answer is yes.           The answer

25   is yes.     It applies to a broad range of statutes, unless

                                        13

 1   Congress otherwise provided.             In fact, there are very

 2   few penalty statutes to which it does not apply.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            Defense Department?

 4               MR. LIMAN:       It does apply to a number of

 5   Defense Department statutes.             I'm hesitating -

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            Antitrust?

 7               MR. LIMAN:       I'm not sure on antitrust.                   But

 8   I believe that it applies to -- it does apply to a

 9   number of unfair trade practices.                     Antitrust, there may

10   be a separate statute.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            FTC, you don't know?

12               MR. LIMAN:       FTC, yes.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            It does apply to FTC, okay.

14   So Social Security, FTC.         Veterans Affairs we don't

15   know, antitrust we don't know.               Okay.

16               MR. LIMAN:       One of the notable features,

17   Justice Breyer, is that if you look across the U.S.

18   Code, the government makes a point of saying:                     Well,

19   Congress uses penalty -- acknowledges that Congress has

20   used penalty when -- the word "penalty" when the

21   Congress has -- I'm sorry, it has used the word

22   "discovery" when Congress has wanted the statute to -

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Liman, I'm a little

24   confused in your answer to Justice Scalia.                     You said

25   that the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose

                                     14

 1   for a civil claim.      It Bailey applies, however, those

 2   claimants who have -- under your theory, who have been

 3   directly injured.     The presumption would apply of

 4   discovery, if they were claiming a fraud.

 5               MR. LIMAN:          No -- no, Your Honor.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  So are you just arguing

 7   that under this statutory scheme there is no application

 8   of the discovery?

 9               MR. LIMAN:          This -- this Court has held in

10   the Lampf case that Bailey and Holmberg do not apply to

11   securities fraud case.

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Because of the

13   alternative language of 5 years.

14               MR. LIMAN:          Well, in Lampf it was 1-year and

15   3-year.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Right.

17               MR. LIMAN:          And in the Merck case, the Court

18   made clear that the 5 years was the statute of -- the

19   statute of repose.

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  That's what I thought

21   those involved.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:               Medicare, Medicaid?

23               MR. LIMAN:          Yes.

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:               It is true, though, isn't

25   it, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could

                                        15

 1   easily exist in other contexts because this isn't only a

 2   statute about securities violations.                   So that you might

 3   have in other contexts in which this statute applies a

 4   world in which a private individual could sue, but the

 5   government -- could sue after the -- the period of

 6   time -

 7                MR. LIMAN:       Yes.

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- the 5 years, but the

 9   government could not.

10                MR. LIMAN:       Yes, Justice Kagan.             And we

11   don't think that's an anomaly.                We don't think it's an

12   anomaly for two reasons.          First of all, in the private

13   context, as again I mentioned, the statute, the start

14   date for the statute of limitations is not in the

15   control of the plaintiff.           That's a critical point.

16   It's critical in this Court's jurisprudence from Hubrick

17   forward.   It -- there is a natural start date from when

18   the injury would be known to a reasonable plaintiff.

19   Not true with respect to the government, who may not

20   even know of the transaction.               And -- but what it -- so

21   it's -- I don't think there's an anomaly because there

22   are different statutes of limitation.

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:            And I take it that your view

24   would be that a case like Exploration, it's different

25   than this case because it does have a natural start

                                      16

 1   date; is that the idea?

 2                MR. LIMAN:       Number one, it does.     And number

 3   two, the relief being sought in Exploration was the

 4   cancellation of a patent, so it was the government as a

 5   party to a transaction.         And what the Court really said

 6   in Exploration, what the Court, in fact, said in

 7   Exploration, is that there is no reason why the same

 8   rule applied the same way couldn't benefit the

 9   government, as well as the private plaintiff.

10                What the government is seeking here is not

11   the same rule and would not be applied in the same way

12   because you are talking about a transaction that is a,

13   frankly, a private transaction that there is no reason

14   that the government would know anything about.           The

15   claim ultimately here is a claim about what was said in

16   a private conversation between the advisor to a mutual

17   fund and the mutual fund -- fund board.

18                So Exploration, what's notable is that the

19   government doesn't cite a single case where the

20   discovery rule has been applied to a party who is not a

21   victim or that it's been applied -- where it's been

22   applied and a penalty hasn't been -- a penalty has been

23   at issue.   I mean, neither of those circumstances.            We

24   are talking about a statute ultimately where the plain

25   language is clear and the government is invoking a

                                      17

 1   statutory canon not to try to interpret language of the

 2   statute, not even to fill a gap in a statute, but to

 3   override it.     The canon that they say overrides the

 4   plain language doesn't exist.

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             In a civil -- in a civil

 6   action brought by an injured investor or private party,

 7   can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private

 8   party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an

 9   earlier government determination that there had been a

10   violation and so that that's presumptive showing of

11   liability?

12                  MR. LIMAN:       Your Honor -

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             In other words, the SEC

14   makes an investigation, find a violation; can a private

15   investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of

16   liability?

17                  MR. LIMAN:       Yeah.         I think the lower courts

18   are mixed on the extent to which you can rely upon the

19   actual allegations in a complaint.

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, not the allegation.

21   It's an ultimate finding.

22                  MR. LIMAN:       Absolutely.

23                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But then under your rule.

24   The plaintiff would be deprived of that.

25                  MR. LIMAN:       No, that's not correct,

                                        18

 1   Your Honor.    Under our rule the plaintiff has exactly

 2   the same rights, regardless of how this case is

 3   determined.    The plaintiff's cause of action will turn

 4   upon the underlying -

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But if the government's

 6   statute of limitations runs out and the private investor

 7   is on his own, then the private investor doesn't have

 8   the advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on

 9   a -- SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability.

10                 MR. LIMAN:       Your Honor, that -- that -- our

11   argument only applies with respect to penalty.                The

12   government has huge powers with respect to disgorgement

13   and injunctive relief.         So, if the government believes

14   that there is a wrongdoing, the government still has the

15   ability to bring a claim and the private investors still

16   have the ability to rely upon the government's

17   enforcement action and whatever findings come out of

18   that.   So there is nothing in our argument that

19   diminished, to any degree, the recovery abilities of a

20   private plaintiff.

21                 In fact, as we've highlighted, that 5-year

22   period for the -- in the securities laws puts a premium

23   on the SEC acting promptly.              And I would note that

24   that's something that is not accidental.                If you go back

25   in the legislative history and look to the SEC's

                                       19

 1   reaction to the Lampf decision, the SEC urged a 5-year

 2   statute of repose, saying that that struck in the

 3   private context the right balance between repose when

 4   you're dealing with complex commercial transactions and

 5   enforcement and -- and recovery.

 6                There's -- the position that the SEC is

 7   taking now is a novel position that to -- to our

 8   knowledge has not been taken by other regulators and

 9   hasn't been taken by the SEC until -- until quite

10   recently.   This statute's been on the books for quite a

11   long time, and it's notable that agencies have not urged

12   that -- that interpretation.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Are there no statutes,

14   Mr. Liman, that say the claim accrues when the injury is

15   discovered, that use both -- both terms?

16                MR. LIMAN:       I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.           I

17   missed the question.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Are there no statutes

19   that use both terms, "accrues" and "discovery"?               A

20   statute, for example, that says, this claim accrues when

21   the injury is discovered?

22                MR. LIMAN:       There are statutes that use that

23   kind of language, and that's precisely our point because

24   it reflects that Congress recognizes the difference and

25   could, if Congress wanted, provide that a claim for the

                                      20

 4   like to reserve the remainder of my time.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 9               MR. WALL:         Mr. Chief Justice and may it

10   please the Court:

11               I think Justice Kennedy started us off in

12   the right place by focusing on the statute and its use

13   of the term "accrual."          And when counsel concedes that

14   that term had an established meaning at common law and

15   this statute picks it up, I think he gave away his case

16   because there were a cluster of concepts.                       One was the

17   general rule governing accrual:                   It accrues when the

18   plaintiff can -- has a right to sue.

19               But there was a specific principle for cases

20   of fraud and concealment.             And I don't think there is

21   any basis in law or logic for Petitioner saying that

22   this statute meant to pick up one of those concepts and

23   not the other concept.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:               I don't think the common

25   law held that it didn't accrue.                   I think it was an

                                        21

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   exception to the accrual rule, that, even though it

 2   accrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit

 3   where -- where discovery is made later.                    I -- is that

 4   the way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue

 5   until discovery?

 6                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, I don't want to

 7   fight about it too much because from the government's

 8   perspective, it doesn't matter -

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, you are making the

10   argument, so you ought to fight about it.

11                  MR. WALL:      It doesn't matter how it's

12   labeled.   It doesn't matter whether we label it as an

13   interpretation of the statute or an exception for cases

14   of fraud or concealment.            The result is the same.

15                  But I will say you are right, in some cases

16   it was described as an exception, but as long ago as

17   Kirby in 1887 and as recently as Merck -

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And never in a criminal

19   case, right?     Do you have a single case in which the

20   discovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case

21   with respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction?

22                  MR. WALL:      No, not in -

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not a single one.

24                  MR. WALL:      Well, no.             The criminal context

25   is fundamentally different.               This Court has said that

                                        22

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   those statutes are construed liberally in favor of

 2   repose and are presumptively not subject to -

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, that's the question

 4   because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this

 5   is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute;

 6   it is a statute that applies to all government actions,

 7   which is a huge category across the board and it's about

 8   200 years old.

 9               And until 2004 I haven't found a single case

10   in which the government ever tried to assert the

11   discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil

12   penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they

13   are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard

14   in the 19th century where they did make that assertion.

15   They were struck down by the district court, and the

16   attorney general in his opinion said, the district

17   court's absolutely right; of course, the government

18   cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations

19   where what they're trying to do is to gather something

20   that's so close to a criminal case.

21               So my question is:               Is there any case at all

22   until the year 2004, approximately, in which the

23   government has either tried or certainly succeeded in

24   taking this general statute and applying the discovery

25   rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to

                                     23

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   enforce the law for the civil penalty?

 2                 The reason I brought up Social Security,

 3   Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have

 4   enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try

 5   to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the

 6   statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases.

 7   And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark

 8   a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming

 9   from, which isn't so different from the -- from the

10   questions that have been put to you.

11                 MR. WALL:      Justice Breyer, most or many of

12   the penalty claims that are being brought under Section

13   2462 and other penalty statutes don't deal with fraud or

14   concealment, and I grant you that it is a problem -

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All I'm asking you for is

16   one case.

17                 MR. WALL:      So in -- it's a problem of fairly

18   recent vintage, to be sure -

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, it is not a problem of

20   fairly recent vintage.         I'd say for 200 years there is

21   no case.    The only case, as far as I have been able to

22   discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created

23   the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh

24   Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided

25   that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the

                                       24

 1   government to assert a civil penalty.                    That's what

 2   created the problem.        Before that there was no problem;

 3   it was clear the government couldn't do it.

 4                  All right.       Now, you will tell me that I'm

 5   wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong.                    And

 6   that's what I'm asking.           I want to be told I'm wrong,

 7   sort of.

 8                  (Laughter.)

 9                  MR. WALL:      And I guess what I want to tell

10   you is there aren't cases out there one way or the

11   other.     There aren't cases endorsing or declining to

12   adopt the discovery rule in the context of fraud or

13   concealment with civil penalty actions -

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You'd expect that - you'd

15   expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred

16   years.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:            No, I haven't found one.

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Fraud is nothing new, for

19   Pete's sake.

20                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, it's not that -

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            This is brand-new assertion

22   by the government that -- tell -- is there much

23   difference between the rule you are arguing for and a

24   rule that there is no statute of limitations?

25                  MR. WALL:      Absolutely there is.             Since -

 1   look, in 1990 the Commission was given the right to seek

 2   civil penalties, so it could only have brought these

 3   actions for the last 20 years.                  In those 20-plus years,

 4   we have seen 25 reported cases dealing with 2462 and

 5   civil penalties.     In 19 of those cases, the Commission

 6   brought its action within 5 years of the end of the

 7   fraud.   It used the discovery rule only to reach back

 8   and get the beginning of the fraud.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Well, but that

10   ignores the point that has been raised, is that this

11   statute does not just apply in the SEC context.                       How

12   many cases have you found across the board in the range

13   of those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued?

14                MR. WALL:        There are cases from the 1980s

15   and 1990s dealing with concealment, and in our view the

16   justification is the same for concealment as fraud.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:              I mean, we are asking the

18   same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude

19   there is none.     What I want is a case before the year

20   2000 in which the government sought a civil penalty and

21   was not trying to recover money or land that it had

22   lost, and I want the name of that case in which they

23   said that the discovery rule applies.

24                The two that you cited, Amy and the case of

25   Broderick's Will, did involve the government being

                                        26

 1   injured by losing land or losing money, something like

 2   that.   So I have those and I don't think they count, but

 3   I will look at them again.             Is there anything else you

 4   would like to refer me to?

 5                MR. WALL:      Justice Breyer, I don't think

 6   there is anything on either side of the ledger, I will

 7   be very upfront, other than the Maillard case, which I

 8   think even courts at the time, an exploration company,

 9   the court of appeals recognized -

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not a matter of there

11   being nothing on either side of the ledger.                    What's

12   extraordinary is that the government has never asserted

13   this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed

14   and -- and repudiated its position.                    It isn't just that

15   there are no cases against you.                 It's you've never -

16   the government has never asserted it before.

17                MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, there were very

18   few civil penalty actions in which -- that involved

19   fraud or concealment, in which the government would have

20   needed to invoke it, or did invoke it and was rebuffed

21   by courts.   I mean, this is a fairly modern problem, and

22   the question is do all of the same concepts that

23   compelled one answer in these other contexts compel the

24   same answer here or does a rule that blankets the

25   waterfront -

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So, this is a very

 2   modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth,

 3   which talked about penalties as being a criminal

 4   sanction, but permitted private individuals, not the

 5   government, to seek the penalties and keep it.                   So you

 6   cite the statute of James, and I look at the statute of

 7   Elizabeth, and try to find the analogy between which

 8   one.

 9                MR. WALL:      Well, if this were a criminal

10   penalty, the government agrees -

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Even though private

12   parties could keep the money back then.

13                MR. WALL:      That's right.              But what the

14   Court's been clear on is that there are civil penalties

15   and there are criminal penalties and which side of the

16   line it falls on invokes a different set of background

17   rules and legal norms.        The Congress denominated this as

18   a civil penalty -

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Could I move you to

20   another issue?   If a party can defeat the government's

21   claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't

22   reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish

23   that?   Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement

24   privilege, the -- some other privilege to block -

25   discovery?

 1                MR. WALL:      Justice Sotomayor, discovery is

 2   playing itself out in cases like these in district

 3   courts.   Privilege has not been a very major issue and

 4   the reason is defendants are by and large pointing to

 5   things in the public domain -- private lawsuits, public

 6   filings with the Commission, public statements -- to say

 7   those put the Commission on constructive words -

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, if they fail

 9   there, don't you think that they are going to also fail

10   because they are not going to be able to look at your

11   records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't

12   know?

13                MR. WALL:      No, not invariably.                I mean, the

14   way this plays itself out in the district court is the

15   Commission says that it didn't know and a defendant

16   points to something in the public domain and says either

17   that put you on constructive notice or -

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So it depends really

19   on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it

20   reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular

21   item in some publication.           Maybe if they've got 1,000

22   people reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and

23   that's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC;

24   it's all these other government areas.

25                It seems to me that it's going to be almost

                                      29

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   impossible for somebody to prove that the government

 2   should have known about something.                       And which part of

 3   the government?    I mean, it's a big, big government, and

 4   particular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense

 5   Contractor Board should have known, but does that mean

 6   that the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's

 7   office should have known?

 8                 It seems to me that, at least with respect

 9   to that aspect, you really are eliminating any real -

10   it's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well,

11   I've got to establish that this particular government

12   agency should have known about this.

13                 You certainly can't sit back and say, well,

14   5 years has gone by and -

15                 MR. WALL:      Mr. Chief Justice, they can't

16   point to a single case where it has been difficult here,

17   and it hasn't been difficult -

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     They can't point to

19   a single case?

20                 MR. WALL:      Where it's been difficult in

21   order to make that determination.                       And it hasn't proven

22   difficult -

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So you think it's

24   significant if you can't point to a single case?

25                 MR. WALL:      Well, I think there are -- where

 1   you should expect those cases to exist, yes.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Are -- are there cases

 3   discussing whether or not a government agency has been

 4   diligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation?

 5   You see, in the private context we have some sense of

 6   what the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's

 7   rights.    He has to be diligent.                But to transpose that

 8   to a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over -

 9   overworked or underfunded?              I don't -- which way do you

10   come out when the government says that?

11                 MR. WALL:      Justice Kennedy, not just this

12   statute.    There are other statutes, the False Claims Act

13   and others, that have specific provisions requiring

14   courts to determine when a government official would

15   reasonably have been on notice of certain circumstances.

16   That hasn't proven difficult in those contexts.                  It's

17   not difficult here.

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:            What about the question that

19   Justice Kennedy just asked?              What if a claim could have

20   reasonably been discovered by a government agency if it

21   had more resources, but given the resources that it had

22   it couldn't have reasonably discovered the claim?                  Would

23   the discovery rule apply there?

24                 MR. WALL:      I -- I don't think so,

25   Justice Alito.    I mean, I think we could say that there

 1   might be circumstances where the Commission would be on

 2   constructive notice and not a private plaintiff because

 3   of its expertise.     It would see something in the public

 4   domain that should be meaningful to it that might not be

 5   meaningful to a private plaintiff -

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            The False Claims Act

 7   example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a

 8   case.

 9                  MR. WALL:      That's -

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, you can say the

11   government, having been cheated, should have known it

12   was cheated.     But we are talking here about prosecution,

13   essentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than

14   a criminal.     By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity

15   apply whether the penalty is criminal or civil?                  So if I

16   think the word "accrual" is, at best, ambiguous,

17   shouldn't the tie go to the defendant?

18                  MR. WALL:      No.        The court's been very -- I

19   mean, in all of the civil cases applying the fraud

20   discovery rule, the court has never looked to the

21   criminal analogies.        The canon here is that ambiguities

22   get construed for the sovereign, not against it.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            But my question is broader

24   than that.     Does the rule of lenity not apply to all

25   penalties?

 1                MR. WALL:        I don't think it applies in the

 2   context of a civil penalty.               I don't think the -- I

 3   don't think the -

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Are you sure of that?     My

 5   belief is the contrary.

 6                MR. WALL:        I can't say that I focused on it

 7   specifically, but I think if the Petitioner said -

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, it's an important

 9   issue in this case, surely.               I mean, if "accrual" is

10   ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should

11   interpret it to favor the defendant.

12                MR. WALL:        Justice Scalia, I don't --

13   Petitioner certainly couldn't claim that this civil

14   penalty should have to be proved beyond a reasonable

15   doubt, or that they are entitled to a constitutional

16   right to counsel.     I don't know why one legal norm among

17   them all should change in the civil context and not the

18   others.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:              The reason would be that

20   the -- you know, once you start talking about applying

21   this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare,

22   for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody

23   who did commit some fraud and they kept the money.                  You

24   know, she had five children not four, or she has five,

25   not six.   And I can understand it being fair when the

                                        33

 1   government catches her -- you know, 18 years later, they

 2   say, We want our money back.                Okay.         I say that's fair,

 3   not necessarily merciful, but fair.

 4               But then to go and say, and in addition we

 5   want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we

 6   couldn't have discovered it.                Don't you know there are 4

 7   million people who get Social Security or 40 million or

 8   something, and we can't police every one.                       And so

 9   suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to

10   getting your money back, but to also you're having what

11   looked like criminal penalties years later without much

12   benefit of a statute of limitations.

13               That is at the back of my mind.                       And I'd

14   like to know, having brought it up front, what -- what

15   your response is.

16               MR. WALL:         Absolutely.                There are anomalies

17   on both sides of the coin and I just want to touch on

18   both very briefly.      Take the example you gave.                   In that

19   situation, the defendant's fraud or concealment the

20   would allow it or him to escape paying civil penalties,

21   but not private damages.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:               That's right.

23               MR. WALL:         This Court has never privileged a

24   private lawsuit above a government enforcement action in

25   a securities context -

                                        34

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            But this is not the

 2   securities context.     This is the context of -- that's

 3   why I started down the road I was down.

 4               MR. WALL:      But even in that context, imagine

 5   if there's a private right of action, the private

 6   plaintiff will be able to recover damages and the

 7   government will not -

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, because you have two

 9   people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt.

10   For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the

11   statute of limitations and Congress focused on this.

12   And it wrote a two-tier statute.                 And it wrote a

13   two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned

14   about the problem you mention.               You have a victim.      So

15   you're either going to let the defendant keep the money

16   or the victim gets it back.            I understand that, but this

17   is not that context.     This is like a criminal context,

18   where not only are you getting your money back, but you

19   also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty.                   And in

20   that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't

21   understand why the government is so anxious to change

22   what has long been the apparent -

23               MR. WALL:      Just imagine the opposite, which

24   is far more dangerous.       Imagine a bank makes a bad loan

25   to a veteran, or a bank tells the FDIC that it's gotten

                                     35

 1   mortgage insurance to help lower income families buy

 2   homes, and then that fraud or falsity escapes detection

 3   for five years.    The Veterans Administration or the FHA

 4   then is barred from bringing a civil penalty action, and

 5   there is no private right of action.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's correct, you have a

 7   fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can

 8   get your money back.

 9                 MR. WALL:      But the reason there's no private

10   right of action in those contexts is, in part, because

11   government agencies can seek civil penalties.                     And I

12   cannot imagine that the Congress, which allowed agencies

13   to seek civil penalties, where here they had existing

14   remedies, would have thought that the only people who

15   could get away without paying them are the ones who

16   commit fraud or concealment and that remains hidden for

17   five years.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And the reason -

19   the reason there's no private action -- right of action

20   is not because the government could seek civil

21   penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a

22   private right of action.

23                 MR. WALL:      That's right because it thought

24   that the agencies could seek civil penalties and that

25   was sufficient.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, no, your case-

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But it didn't -- it

 3   didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case,

 4   that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later,

 5   18 years later, however long, so long as they were busy

 6   doing other things and didn't have a chance to know.

 7                MR. WALL:      No question.                And in the average

 8   typical case, the time that Congress afforded is enough

 9   and we're not here claiming any different, but that -

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And it is a generous

11   period.   It's -- it's 5 years.               And, Mr. Wall, maybe you

12   can explain the SEC's pursuit of this -- of this case.

13   The alleged fraud went on from 1999 to 2002.                     It was

14   discovered in 2003.      The SEC waited from 2003 to 2008 to

15   commence suit.   What -- what is the reason for -- for

16   the delay from the time of discovery till the time suit

17   is instituted?

18                MR. WALL:      Justice Ginsburg, there was a lot

19   of back and forth between the parties, document

20   exchanges, they wanted to make additional submissions.

21   The government hoped that there would be a settlement

22   that would encompass all the defendants.                     Ultimately,

23   there was a settlement that only went to the fund and

24   Petitioners did not settle and then the government put

25   together and brought its case.

 1                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even

 2   further than Justice Ginsburg.                  And this case actually

 3   seems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's

 4   no natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and

 5   Justice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a

 6   decision about enforcement priorities.                   The government

 7   had decided not to go after market timers.                   And it

 8   changed its decision when a State attorney general

 9   decided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had

10   made that enforcement priority decision, and then the

11   government made a different enforcement priority

12   decision.     But that's not the kind of situation that the

13   discovery rule was intended to operate on, is it?

14                  MR. WALL:      Justice Kagan, I don't think

15   that's fair.     We didn't go -- it wasn't market timing

16   that we discovered.        What General Spitzer announced was

17   there are advisors that are permitting market timing,

18   but misleading investors about it and they're doing it

19   in return for investments in other funds that they

20   manage, what are called sticky asset agreements, and

21   then we started doing market sweeps for those

22   agreements.

23                  And I don't think we can ignore the evidence

24   here because we shouldn't decide the case based on

25   feverish hypotheticals.           There are 25 reported cases

                                        38

 1   brought by the Commission involving this statute, 19

 2   were brought within 5 years and they were just reaching

 3   back to pick up the beginning of the fraud.                And the

 4   other six, including this case, the longest lag time was

 5   six and a half years from the end of the fraud to

 6   bringing the complaint.

 7                And the reason is these are dynamic markets.

 8   There's a lot going on in the public domain that puts

 9   the commission on notice, inquiry or constructive, and

10   starts the clock running.           Not only have we not seen a

11   10, a 15, a 20-year case, we haven't seen a 7-year case.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if all that's true,

13   and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am

14   right about this point, but remember your banking case

15   now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the

16   doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply?                That

17   is, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative

18   action to hide what's going on, the statute will be

19   tolled.   Is that right?

20                MR. WALL:      That's right, but that -

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.     As long as

22   that's right, then in all your banking cases, there are

23   bank inspectors all over these banks, I hope -- you

24   know, about once a month or so -

25                MR. WALL:      But Justice Breyer, that's -

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- or once a year.        And so

 2   the chance of there -- the chance of this somehow

 3   escaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which

 4   would allow the government to extend the toll strikes me

 5   as small, but am I right?

 6                MR. WALL:      Justice Breyer, I want to be

 7   clear.   In the government's view, the concealment would

 8   apply, though Petitioners or others like them will be

 9   back here making exactly the same arguments.              The

10   government's point is just that equity fraud and

11   concealment were a pair and the justification was the

12   same for both.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, perhaps I've missed

14   something.   I -- I came in here thinking that both

15   parties were willing to concede for purposes of this

16   case that there was a fraudulent concealment.                Is

17   that -- is that wrong?

18                MR. WALL:      I -- I -

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I mean, for purposes of

20   presenting the statute of limitations issue that's

21   before us.

22                MR. WALL:      I don't think the Petitioners are

23   disputing it here, but I think Mr. Liman acknowledged

24   earlier that, if pressed, his arguments could be

25   leveraged to get rid of the concealment doctrine, too.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             He didn't concede that

 2   there was fraudulent concealment.                        All he conceded is

 3   that there was fraud, but later concealment to cover up

 4   that fraud I don't think has been conceded.

 5                 MR. WALL:       Oh, no, no, not -- I didn't -

 6   I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.               I wasn't trying to mislead.

 7   This is not a concealment case.                   This is a fraud case.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:             I thought it was the

 9   opposite.    In other words, I thought both parties, for

10   purposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent

11   concealment has nothing to do with it.                        We are not to

12   consider fraudulent concealment.

13                 MR. WALL:       This is a fraud case, not a

14   concealment case.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Am I right when I say that?

16                 MR. WALL:       Yes.        I was just trying to say

17   that once you say there is a concealment exception, the

18   fraud exception follows from equity because they were of

19   a piece.    And once you say there is not a fraud

20   exception, the same arguments will be leveraged to get

21   rid of a concealment exception.                   And the reason that

22   equity treated them as -- of a piece was the deception

23   was the same.    The fraud was self-concealing or even if

24   it was non-fraud, the defendant could conceal, but

25   either way -

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Except that concealment is

 2   sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter.                    You -

 3   you -- it -- it doesn't apply always.                    It applies when

 4   there is concealment, and the person who is being

 5   subjected to the longer statute of limitations is on

 6   notice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending

 7   the statute.     So I -- I don't think that the one has to

 8   go with the other.      Maybe they're both equitable

 9   doctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we

10   have to apply them to this statute.

11                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, for 300 years,

12   English and American courts looking at this problem have

13   said where the defendant's misconduct, be it fraud or be

14   it concealment of a non-fraud, but where the defendant's

15   deception prevents a plaintiff from knowing that he, she

16   or it has a cause of action, equity suspends the running

17   of a statute of limitations.                Those -- that has been -

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And for 300 years, that has

19   been said only with respect to civil actions, not with

20   respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty.

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:            That's correct.

22                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, this is a civil

23   action.   I don't think even Petitioners are disputing

24   that.

 1   same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean,

 2   I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent

 3   concealment.     I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable

 4   estoppel, would you?

 5                  MR. WALL:      If I gave up anything on

 6   fraudulent concealment, I didn't mean to.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, no.    I mean -- I

 8   mean, there's nothing -

 9                  (Laughter.)

10                  MR. WALL:      I want to be very clear, I give

11   up nothing.

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            If we were to say -- if

13   we -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and

14   this is again tentative to get your response, but if the

15   -- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't -

16   rule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says

17   equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in

18   that that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing

19   in that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply.

20                  Now, you've shaken me a little bit on the

21   fraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other

22   two.

 2                  MR. WALL:      Oh, sure.

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Equitable estoppel, the

 4   person comes in and says, oh, yes, I'll tell you all

 5   about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a

 6   statute of limitations defense, I promise.                     And the

 7   Court says, hey, you just asserted one, you can't.

 8                  MR. WALL:      Justice Breyer, Petitioners in a

 9   future case would be back here saying:                     The text of the

10   statute says nothing about equitable estoppel.                     And even

11   if you've applied it to everybody else's actions, you

12   can't apply it to me because I'm somehow different.

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you will say nonsense

14   in that future case, won't you?

15                  (Laughter.)

16                  MR. WALL:      That's -- I'll be as right then

17   as I am now.

18                  (Laughter.)

19                  MR. WALL:      I mean, Petitioners' argument has

20   this sort air of unreality.               You've applied it

21   everywhere else he says, but not to me.                     Think how odd

22   that is, Justice Scalia, that where you have a

23   background canon that says ambiguities get construed

24   for, and not against, the sovereign.                     When the sovereign

25   sues quasi-sovereign to enforce the laws, that is

 1   somehow a subordinate interest and the sovereign alone

 2   cannot take advantage of the Fraud Discovery Rule.

 3                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Wall, why is it that you

 4   don't you have any cases?            I mean, you said way back

 5   when:   This didn't come up, this is a modern problem.

 6   So explain to me why this is a modern problem.                 This is

 7   obviously an old statute.            Are you saying that this

 8   statute has not been used very -- was not used very much

 9   until very, very recently?

10                 MR. WALL:      There are -- that's right.           There

11   are very few cases that deal with this statute at all

12   and, obviously, in this context because the Commission's

13   only had the ability to bring civil penalties for about

14   20 years.

15                 But I think that is not a problem unknown to

16   the law.    Again and again, facing garden variety

17   limitations provisions written just like this one, this

18   Court applied the fraud discovery rule.                 And now they

19   come in and say, oh, but you've never applied it to this

20   statute.    That's true, but everything about this statute

21   is identical as a matter of text and history to the

22   statute of Bailey.

23                 The cause of action equally accrued there,

24   and this Court's applied it across bankruptcy, land,

25   patent cases -

 1                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But what you're running up

 2   against is a skepticism, that -- you know, the

 3   government, which has not -- asserted this power for 200

 4   years, is now coming in and saying we want this.               And

 5   the question is why hasn't the government asserted this

 6   power previously?

 7                  MR. WALL:      I -- there are just very few

 8   cases on it.     I think there are very few civil penalty

 9   actions that are being brought at all, certainly to

10   which this statute apply, and certainly that deal with

11   fraud or concealment and reach outside the 5-year

12   period.   And I don't have a great answer for why there

13   aren't cases.     All I can tell you is that -- it isn't

14   like there are cases rejecting our arguments.               We just

15   see an absence of case law.

16                  But what we do see are -- is cases like

17   Exploration Company, where the government comes in, is

18   really suing in a sovereign capacity, to redistribute

19   land from some private land owners to another by

20   annulling their patents.            And this Court rejects

21   basically exactly the same arguments Petitioners are

22   making and says it applies equally to the government

23   when it brings an action as to private plaintiffs.

24                  Now, an action for civil penalties?            No, the

25   relief here is a little different, but if one looks back

 1   at the briefs the arguments are exactly the same.                        They

 2   made exactly the same claims that the sky was falling

 3   there, and for 100 years they have not been true.                        There

 4   is nothing important about this statute as a matter of

 5   text, structure or anything else from the other statutes

 6   to which this Court has again and again applied the

 7   rule.   And the justification is the same.                    It's the

 8   defendant's misconduct which keeps the plaintiff from

 9   knowing of her cause of action.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Counsel, you made

11   the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's

12   only the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the

13   discovery rule when other people can.                     But it's when

14   it's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the

15   concerns about repose are particularly presented.                        You

16   know, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can

17   decide to go after whomever it discovers, however many

18   years after -- whether it's the Social Security

19   recipient that Justice Breyer mentioned or -- or anyone

20   else.

21                So I at least don't find it unusual that

22   it's the sovereign in particular that doesn't get the

23   benefit of whenever you happen to find about it rule.

24                MR. WALL:      No question in the typical case,

25   but what equity has always said is in cases of fraud or

                                      47

 1   concealment the defendant is not entitled to repose

 2   until there is discovery of the fraud.                       And equity has

 3   never looked at the identity of the plaintiff, the

 4   elements of the cause of action, the plaintiff's status,

 5   role, party to what happened in the case.                       That is

 6   never -

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Would you agree that

 8   when we're talking about the interests in repose that

 9   the one plaintiff that we should be particularly

10   concerned about is the government?

11                  MR. WALL:      I -- I don't think that there's a

12   basis for separating as between private damages lawsuits

13   and civil penalties.        I think when Congress sets a

14   statute of limitations, that's a limitation on the

15   various forms of -

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about criminal

17   penalties?     Would your argument be different with regard

18   to criminal?

19                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia -

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Incidentally, what makes

21   something a civil penalty?               You just call it a civil

22   penalty and -- and you don't have to prove it beyond a

23   reasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this

24   extension that you are arguing for?

25                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, two very

                                        48

 1   important things.     Yes, our argument would absolutely be

 2   different in a criminal context.                    In cases like Marion

 3   and Toussie, this Court has explained how statutes of

 4   limitations function in the criminal context is very

 5   different.   They are presumptively not equitably tolled,

 6   whereas civil statutes are presumptively equitably

 7   tolled.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:              What makes -- what makes a

 9   penalty a civil penalty?

10                MR. WALL:        In Hudson v. United States -

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:              I mean, a penalty is a

12   penalty as far as I'm concerned if the government's

13   taking money from you.

14                MR. WALL:        Justice Scalia, the Court walked

15   through in Hudson v. United States the test for

16   denominating a civil from a criminal penalty.                    The main

17   thing is what Congress denominates it, although you can

18   look behind that.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's nice.

20                MR. WALL:        Here, there is no question that

21   this is a civil penalty.            It was denominated by Congress

22   that way, it functions that way, it is phrased that way.

23   I think even Petitioners and all of their amici -- not a

24   single person on that side of the case has attempted to

25   argue this penalty is criminal rather than civil under

                                        49

 1   Hudson.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:               That isn't my point, that

 3   it is criminal.     My point is, it doesn't seem to me to

 4   make a whole lot of difference as far as these issues

 5   are concerned.

 6               MR. WALL:         Justice Scalia, the Court has

 7   always said that whether the penalty is civil or

 8   criminal carries with it a different set of legal rules

 9   or norms, and no party has ever successfully come into

10   court and said, well, it may be civil, but it's a little

11   criminal-like, so I should borrow from the criminal

12   context.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       What about the -

14   what about the Halper case?

15               MR. WALL:         Mr. Chief Justice, I think Hudson

16   overruled Halper in large part, and no one here has

17   asked this Court to label this a criminal penalty.                       They

18   have asked the Court to call this a civil penalty and

19   yet say the fraud discovery rule does not apply.                       That,

20   there is no precedent for.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Thank you, counsel.

23               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN

24                    ON BEHALF OF THE Petitioners

25               MR. LIMAN:          Just a few points in rebuttal.

 1                First of all, with respect to whether this

 2   is a criminal penalty and whether the rules of lenity

 3   apply, this Court has held in the Commissioner v.

 4   Ackerly case that the rule of lenity applies to civil

 5   penalties.

 6                Just as an -

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I'm sorry.   What

 8   case?

 9                MR. LIMAN:        I believe it's Commissioner

10   against Ackerly.   It's cited in one of the -- one of the

11   amicus briefs.

12                Second, the concession that you just heard a

13   moment ago, that the statute would not apply as the

14   government says it should apply if this was deemed to be

15   a criminal penalty, we submit under this Court's

16   reasoning in Clark v. Martinez, it just gave away the

17   store in the government's case because if it is

18   possible -- if the government has now admitted it's

19   possible -- and I don't want to get into all of the

20   permutations of Hudson -- but if it is possible that the

21   label of civil penalty does not -- is not dispositive as

22   to whether a penalty is civil or criminal, then, as the

23   Court held in Clark v. Martinez, the lowest common

24   denominator applies.

25                One has to interpret this statute so that it

                                       51

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is applicable across the range of statutes.                 And if

 2   that's so, then it follows, it runs from accrual as that

 3   word is commonly understood.

 4                Next point.        The government said that there

 5   are no cases where the Court considered the -- the claim

 6   that it is making.     We would point the Court's attention

 7   to the Rotella case, in which in the context of a

 8   private plaintiff, who did not have the resources of the

 9   government, the argument was made that the RICO statute

10   should have a discovery of the violation-type principle.

11                And the argument was made there that RICO

12   can encompass a pattern of fraudulent acts.                 And the

13   plaintiff in that case said, as the government says

14   here, fraud can be concealed, can be complex, can be

15   difficult to discover.

16                And the Court unanimously had a response to

17   that.   The response was that, at least as soon as you

18   know the injury, where there is an injury element, the

19   difficulty of discovery of the actual violation doesn't

20   defer the running of the statute of limitations.                 It

21   would defeat the purposes of the statute of limitations.

22                The government also argued that the problems

23   of privilege are not significant ones.                 We would point

24   the Court's attention to the Joint Appendix in the

25   Second Circuit, where the government asserted privilege

                                      52

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   with respect to our questions about its investigations

 2   of the counterparty to this alleged quid -- quid pro

 3   quo.

 4               The Court also asked a question of whether

 5   there are any cases in which courts have dealt with

 6   government agencies being diligent, and the claim being

 7   the government agency was not diligent.                     The Court has

 8   dealt with that in a related context, in the

 9   Heckler v. Cheney context.            And in the Heckler v. Cheney

10   context the Court held that that type of issue, how an

11   administrative agency treats facts that are -- that it

12   discovers and whether it chooses to bring a claim or

13   not, whether it chooses to believe that they are in

14   violation of a statute, the agency is charged with

15   administering is not fit for judicial review.                     No

16   different result should apply here.

17               Just two more points.                     The False Claims Act

18   has a -- which has an explicit discovery rule, also has

19   a statute of repose.     It would be very odd, indeed, if

20   the one circumstance where Congress, one of the few

21   circumstances where Congress chose to use the word

22   "discovery," was where the government was injured, and

23   they -- Congress chose to impose a statute of repose,

24   where, as they say in the 100 or other statutes that use

25   language, fraud-like language, Congress intended there

                                     53

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to be discovery and no repose.

 2               And that really ties into the last point,

 3   which is that there are, by our count, if you look at

 4   fraud, misleading, false statement-type statutes, there

 5   are somewhere like 80 or 100-type statutes that use that

 6   kind of language that would be applicable if this Court

 7   affirms the Second Circuit.

 8               This case was in -- the government says this

 9   case was an outlier.     There is no reason to believe this

10   case will remain an outlier.

11               Thank you.
