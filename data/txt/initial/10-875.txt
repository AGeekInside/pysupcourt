 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 10-875, Hall v. United

 5   States.

 6               Ms. Freeman.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. FREEMAN

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MS. FREEMAN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Bankruptcy estates incur taxes when they

12   generate income.    The Government's attempt to limit the

13   effect of the farm sale statute, section 1222(a)(2)(A),

14   alters that fundamental principle in corporate chapter

15   11 cases and in all bankruptcy cases, as it requires

16   this Court to construe the administrative section in the

17   priority section of the Bankruptcy Code that do apply in

18   all of those cases.

19               In a chapter 12 case, the bankruptcy estate

20   consists of more than just the assets that existed as of

21   the date of filing.      They also consist of all of the

22   income that is earned thereafter, wages -- Mrs. Hall's

23   wages as a convenience store clerk are part of the

24   bankruptcy estate -- the proceeds from selling crops --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Does it include debts


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                            4
 1   incurred after the filing?

 2                 MS. FREEMAN:      From the period -- from the

 3   petition filing date until the confirmation of the plan,

 4   yes, it does.     Those debts are incurred in the operation

 5   of the estate --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Debts -- debts that were

 7   incurred after that date?

 8                 MS. FREEMAN:      Yes, Your Honor.        So that, for

 9   example, in operating an estate, you would incur a light

10   bill as well as incurring taxes.             All of the operating

11   expenses are incurred by the bankruptcy estate and are

12   payable from the income and from the estate assets

13   during that period from the petition filing date until

14   the confirmation of the plan.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that true of --

16                MS. FREEMAN:       That's the administrative

17   period.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that true of State --

19   you said taxes.    Is it true of State taxes?

20                MS. FREEMAN:       Yes, Your Honor, it is true of

21   State taxes as well as Federal taxes.              County taxes, for

22   example.    Property --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So, in this -- in this --

24   we're dealing with a capital gains tax on the sale of

25   the farm.   Suppose a State had a similar tax; it also


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                           5
 1   taxed the gain on the sale.

 2                 MS. FREEMAN:     Correct, Your Honor, and it

 3   did in this particular case.             So, there would be State

 4   taxes on the capital gains, and those would also be

 5   administrative expense priorities, except for the farm

 6   sale provision here, which demotes that priority if the

 7   debtor is able to earn a discharge.               And if so, then

 8   those farm sale taxes are demoted in priority and may be

 9   discharged under a plan of reorganization.               They would

10   share pro rata with the other prepetition claims of the

11   bankruptcy estate.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:       And who would file the State

13   tax return?   Would it be filed by the estate or would it

14   be filed by the debtor?

15                 MS. FREEMAN:     The debtor and the estate are

16   one in a -- in a reorganization case.              And so, the

17   taxpayers, Lynwood and Brenda Hall, would file the tax

18   return.   The way that it would actually be administered,

19   Your Honor, is shown by the Knudsen case.              And,

20   basically, there would be a tax return that includes all

21   of the income, the wages, the crop sale proceeds and so

22   forth.    And then it would compute it with the capital

23   gains tax, and there would be a separate pro forma

24   return that does not include the capital gains tax.

25                 Those would be sent to the Special

 1   Procedures Unit of the IRS, so that somebody there would

 2   know how to deal with it and would be able to count the

 3   difference.

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, how do you deal

 5   with section 346?

 6                 MS. FREEMAN:      Section 346, Your Honor,

 7   basically makes the State taxes consistent with the

 8   Federal taxes.     When you have --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I read 346(b) to say

10   that, unless the estate is a separate tax entity under

11   the code, that the debtor, not the estate, pays State

12   and local taxes.    This is totally contrary to what

13   you're saying, but the language of 346(b) --

14                 MS. FREEMAN:      Your Honor --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- basically answers the

16   question against you with respect to State and local

17   taxes.

18                 MS. FREEMAN:      Justice Sotomayor, I do not

19   think it does, in the sense -- in this sense:           The

20   bankruptcy -- section 346(b) made the State and local

21   taxes consistent with Federal taxes, and when you have a

22   bankruptcy estate that consists only of assets on the

23   petition filing date, then you have a separate taxable

24   entity with a separate tax I.D. number that is set up.

25   But under the Federal bankruptcy -- under the Federal


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             7
 1   tax code, under section 1399, whenever the bankruptcy

 2   estate had income during the course of the estate,

 3   during the administration period, as well as the assets

 4   on the petition filing date, then it's a single taxable

 5   entity.     And so, that single taxpayer would pay it.

 6                  Section 346 doesn't say what assets are used

 7   to pay the tax.     That's a matter of bankruptcy law.            The

 8   debtor, the individual taxpayer, is going to file the

 9   tax return under State and local and Federal law, but

10   he's going to use the estate assets because that's all

11   there is.    He doesn't have any other assets.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, the debtor is going

13   to pay.

14                 MS. FREEMAN:      The debtor pays --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And so, when this says

16   whenever the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides that

17   no separate taxable estate shall be created in a case

18   concerning a debtor under this title --

19                 MS. FREEMAN:      Right.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- chapter 12 doesn't

21   create a separate taxable estate.

22                 MS. FREEMAN:      Correct.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And that the income,

24   et cetera, shall be taxed to or claimed by the debtor

25   under State or local law.

                                                                          8
 1                  MS. FREEMAN:     That's correct, Your Honor.

 2   It's going to be on the debtor's tax return.             The

 3   debtor's the one who will have the deductions, and the

 4   deductions would include administrative expenses of the

 5   bankruptcy estate.

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         This -- this is hard for

 7   me to understand, given the last line.             "The estate

 8   shall be liable for any tax imposed on such corporation

 9   or partnership, but not for any tax imposed on partners

10   or members."

11                 By the logic of that last sentence, it seems

12   to me that the preceding section is not looking to the

13   estate, but to the debtor, to pay the taxes.

14                 MS. FREEMAN:      The debtor pays the taxes, but

15   with estate assets because those are the only assets

16   that exist.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, why -- why would the

18   last sentence be necessary?

19                 MS. FREEMAN:      The last sentence, I believe,

20   Your Honor, deals with a partnership, and in a

21   partnership case, just as outside the bankruptcy, the

22   partnership files the tax return and the partners

23   individually are the ones who pay the taxes.            But they

24   pay the taxes.    If a partner is in its own bankruptcy

25   estate with the only assets that exist -- all of his


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                            9
 1   income, all of his wages, all of those are property of

 2   the bankruptcy estate, and he would use it to pay the

 3   tax.   He's not individually liable any more than if a

 4   trustee were individually liable.            The trustee in a

 5   bankruptcy case uses estate assets to pay taxes.               And

 6   so, what --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it says the estate --

 8   the estate's not liable for the tax imposed on the

 9   partners.    So, if it's not liable, how can it ask for a

10   discharge?

11                 MS. FREEMAN:     The -- the debtor ultimately

12   is the one who receives a discharge.              Discharge

13   provisions are separate than the -- than the tax payment

14   issues.   Tax payment deals with what moneys are used to

15   make the payments of taxes during the course of

16   administration of a bankruptcy case.              The debtor

17   receives a discharge in a chapter 12 case if it

18   complies -- if he complies with all of the provisions of

19   his plan of reorganization and then receives a

20   discharge.

21                 There are exceptions to the discharge.

22   Certain prepetition taxes are excepted from a discharge

23   and would carry through during the -- postpetition.              But

24   the farm sale statute provides that these particular

25   administrative expenses would be subject to a discharge

 1   if he complies with the rest of the provisions of the --

 2   of his plan of reorganization.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:       What happens in a 12 or 13

 4   case, just your typical case -- and this must arise

 5   fairly often -- in year 1, on January 1, the farm or the

 6   ship or whatever is the subject goes into chapter 12 or

 7   13.   They have a lot of pre-1 debt.             Then in year 2 and

 8   year 3, the proceedings are going on, but the farm is

 9   operating, so is the ship, or whatever.             And they

10   earn -- they run up debts during that time.             People give

11   them fertilizer -- they give them, you know, all kinds

12   of things.   So, they have a lot of debts that they've

13   run up in that time.    Now it draws to a close, at the

14   end of year 3.

15                Now, what about those debts that have been

16   run up during that time?      There isn't a separate

17   bankruptcy estate for tax purposes, I understand.              But

18   if Joe Smith has loaned his farm some money during that

19   time, and it comes time to look at the future income to

20   subtract the prepetition debts, does his debt get wound

21   up and get some priority in that process, or is he just

22   at the end of the queue?

23                MS. FREEMAN:     He does get priority in that

24   process, Your Honor.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.       Well, if he


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                             11
 1   gets priority, then why in heaven's name shouldn't a tax

 2   get priority?

 3                MS. FREEMAN:     Your Honor --

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:       That's your point.

 5                MS. FREEMAN:     -- it does have that priority.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:       And if it does, then, of

 7   course, the exception that Senator Grassley put in

 8   applies to that.   So, that's a question I should ask

 9   them, given your answer.

10                MS. FREEMAN:     Yes, Your Honor.

11                And, in fact, those taxes, along with the

12   light bill and any other administrative expenses, would

13   be paid when due over that 2- or 3-year period.               And

14   that's certainly what happens in the large chapter 11

15   bankruptcy case, like a Delphi bankruptcy case or, you

16   know, a General Motors, for instance.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but I mean,

18   your -- it is a question for you, because these things

19   don't go for 2 or 3 years, do they?               I thought typically

20   they are wrapped up very quickly, and that's to the

21   advantage of the debtor.      And your position with respect

22   to postpetition taxes has the potential of extending

23   them beyond the kind of quick turnaround that helps

24   everybody.

 1   Justice, in chapter 12 cases, often the bankruptcy

 2   estate will drag on for 2 or 3 years, and certainly for

 3   longer than 1 year and much longer than a chapter 13

 4   case, because you do have sales of assets.                You have

 5   debts that need to be restructured.                You have leases

 6   that end up getting rejected.            You have a -- new crop

 7   subsidies that are applied for and received.                The

 8   chapter -- the -- the amicus curiae brief of the

 9   professors has a study, and shows how long chapter

10   12 cases generally last.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How long was this --

12   this one?

13               MS. FREEMAN:       This case, Your Honor, because

14   of this appeal, has lasted from 2005 through today.                  So,

15   a considerable period of time.           And all of the taxes

16   during that period of time and all of the operating

17   expenses during that period of time are administrative

18   expenses and are payable in the ordinary course.

19   There's an administrative expense claim if in fact they

20   haven't been paid.

21               And if -- if one of the creditors has not

22   received payment or if a taxing authority has not

23   received payment, it can move for payment as an

24   administrative priority.       It can ask that it be paid

25   now, and it can ask that the case be dismissed if it

                                                                         13
 1   hasn't been paid.     So, you do have that highest

 2   priority, and this is consistent with the Court's

 3   Nicholas case, 1966, which preceded the Bankruptcy Code

 4   and which the Bankruptcy Code really incorporated and

 5   continued with.

 6               In the Nicholas case, the Court said that

 7   all taxes incurred by a debtor-in-possession and

 8   incurred during the administration period have

 9   administrative expense priority, and they are payable by

10   the debtor-in-possession as an officer of the court, as

11   -- as the administrator of the estate under 28 U.S.C.

12   section 960, which is still in effect today, and which

13   requires that the person in control of the bankruptcy

14   estate, whether it's a trustee or a

15   debtor-in-possession, pay those taxes, but not pay them

16   with his own money.

17               As the Court said in the Nicholas case, you

18   pay them with the assets of the estate.            The individual

19   trustee is not responsible; the individual

20   debtor-in-possession is not responsible.           The

21   responsibility of the debtor-in-possession really is a

22   matter of the discharge provisions, whether he's going

23   to be separately discharged or if he has responsible

24   person liability because he's -- he's -- you're dealing

25   with trust fund taxes, with wages from some other

 1   person --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:       The -- what you say to me

 3   makes a great deal of sense, but I think one of their

 4   stronger arguments is, it may make sense.       But,

 5   unfortunately, even if Senator Grassley and the others

 6   wanted it, they didn't do it right technically.        They

 7   didn't amend the right provision of the code, and

 8   whoever's fault that is, is beside the point.       So,

 9   there's no way to get the words to get to the result

10   that you want.

11               I'll tell you the best I could do -- and I

12   see a problem with it -- is you say that -- you go to

13   1226(b)(1), and it says that any unpaid claim of the

14   kind specified in 507(a)(2); and 507(a)(2) talks about

15   administrative expenses and refers you to 503; and 503

16   includes taxes and administrative expenses; and then you

17   say it's -- at 1220 whatever it is, what did I just say?

18               MS. FREEMAN:     1226?

19               JUSTICE BREYER:       1226.

20               MS. FREEMAN:     Uh-huh.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:       It's like an Abbott and

22   Costello movie.

23               (Laughter.)

24               JUSTICE BREYER:       The -- the -- you get to

25   1226(b)(1), and it says that that's -- shall be paid any


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                            15
 1   unpaid payments of that kind, including administrative

 2   expenses.   And -- and so, then you have 1222(a), which

 3   refers to that, and then the amendment applies to that.

 4               But, now, what I did was I sloughed over by

 5   talking too quickly -- it talked about "claim" -- of a

 6   "claim," it says, any unpaid claim of the kind specified

 7   in 507(a)(2).   And when you look to 507(a)(2), it talks

 8   about claims and expenses; and then in (2) there, it

 9   refers to administrative expenses.               And so, I think the

10   Government says they left out what was key to you, the

11   word "expenses."

12               All right?     Now, I don't know what I'm doing

13   when I start tinkering with this Bankruptcy Code.              And

14   is that just true, what they say?           It does leave out the

15   word "expenses."   Will -- will we cause untold harm if

16   we were to read the word "claims" there to include

17   expenses?

18               MS. FREEMAN:      Your Honor, respectfully, you

19   would cause untold harm because this provision applies

20   in corporate chapter 11's and in all bankruptcy cases.

21   They all have the administrative expense provision, 503,

22   and they all have section 507.          So, you would stop taxes

23   from being payable in a big Delphi --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:        No, but I was thinking,

25   suppose I do it by reading the word "claims" --

 1                  MS. FREEMAN:     Right.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:       -- in 5 -- in 1226, when it

 3   says "any unpaid claim" --

 4                  MS. FREEMAN:     Right.

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Which is what you want to

 6   have include taxes --

 7                  MS. FREEMAN:     And claim --

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:       -- to read that word as

 9   including both the 507(a) claims, which are in (1)(a),

10   (1)(b), and -- and also administrative expenses in (2).

11   Can I do that?

12                 MS. FREEMAN:      You can, Your Honor, because

13   "claim" is defined in section 101 of the code as right

14   to payment.    "Creditor" is defined as someone who has a

15   claim that arose prepetition, which necessarily means

16   "claim" is broader and not just one that arose

17   prepetition.

18                 There are numerous provisions of the

19   Bankruptcy Code that refer to administrative expenses as

20   claims, including 1226.        And so, the Court can see that

21   those are interpreted consistently.

22                 This Court, in the Hartford Underwriters

23   case, referred to administrative claims, calling them

24   claims as well as administrative.             And really what the

25   Government's argument here is that administrative

                                   Official

                                                                       17
 1   expenses are outside of bankruptcy altogether, that

 2   they're not part of what get paid in a bankruptcy case.

 3   And that's simply untrue.

 4                If the Court looks at the provisions with

 5   respect to requirements of a plan, including 1222(a),

 6   which apart from the exception, it says that

 7   administrative expenses are required to be paid.

 8   Section 1228 says that a plan discharges all debts

 9   including debts provided for -- allowed under section

10   503.   Debt is a liability on a claim.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:         But that doesn't answer my

12   first question, what actually happens?            I mean, this

13   isn't the first year of chapter 12 and 13.

14               MS. FREEMAN:       Right.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:         And there must be instances

16   where the -- where the debts run up postpetition are

17   pretty big --

18               MS. FREEMAN:       And --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- and there isn't enough

20   money to go around, and they're going to have to be paid

21   out of future income along with the prepetition debts.

22   And it can be done, but there is a question of

23   priorities, and the Government is saying there is no

24   priority -- I think they're saying that -- for a

25   postpetition debt.    And -- and you're saying, oh, but of

 1   course there is.

 2               So, what actually happens?          There have been

 3   perhaps thousands and thousands of cases, haven't there?

 4               MS. FREEMAN:     And administrative expenses do

 5   get paid in the ordinary course.          And if the taxes

 6   aren't paid --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:       Get paid, if necessary, by

 8   assigning priorities?

 9               MS. FREEMAN:     Yes.      They have administrative

10   priority, and they do get paid.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:       And so, to look to a

12   hornbook on bankruptcy law which just tells me what

13   you've just said, I would look where?

14               MS. FREEMAN:     We -- we've cited a number of

15   hornbooks that have exactly that provision.         What's

16   particularly interesting with respect to the

17   Government's position here is that, at the Government's

18   urging, section 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, that

19   provided for prepetition priority, eighth priority, for

20   prepetition taxes within a short period before the

21   Bankruptcy Code, was amended; so that all of those

22   eighth priority taxes during the year of the filing, the

23   straddle year -- here the Halls filed their bankruptcy

24   case in August; so, during the entire period from

25   January 1 through August when they filed -- are treated

 1   as administrative expenses.       And yet, now they say

 2   administrative expenses mean nothing, and they don't get

 3   any payment as administrative expenses.

 4               Why urge the change?          Why make all of those

 5   year-of-filing taxes into administrative expenses and

 6   then say administrative expenses have no meaning?

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm going to ask the

 8   Government this, but are you aware of any circuit split

 9   or any cases below that have accepted the Government's

10   arguments that chapter 12 involves prepetition debts

11   only and that don't pay administrative expenses

12   postbankruptcy?

13               MS. FREEMAN:     There are several cases that

14   have interpreted section 1222(a)(2)(A).          None of them

15   have addressed the change in 507 or what that means.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         A different question.

17               MS. FREEMAN:     Okay.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         The Government's now

19   saying that chapter 12 involves only prepetition claims.

20               MS. FREEMAN:     Right.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And it's basically, by

22   that argument, saying it doesn't involve and can't

23   involve administrative expenses.          That's how I read

24   their argument.

25               MS. FREEMAN:     I think that's --

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And so, I'm asking is --

 2   are there any courts that you're aware of below who have

 3   been presented with this argument, outside of the tax

 4   situation, who have accepted it?

 5                MS. FREEMAN:     I --

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Who have failed to give

 7   priority to administrative expenses?

 8                MS. FREEMAN:     None outside of this tax

 9   situation.   And, Your Honor, I don't believe that any of

10   the cases that have followed the Government's

11   interpretation of this farm sale statute, 1222(a)(2)(A),

12   have addressed the impact on other administrative

13   expenses and other tax claims.          The wages -- the taxes

14   on wages that are incurred, the lottery winnings that an

15   individual farmer might have, and the fact that those

16   have administrative priority and that those would need

17   to be paid off the top as administrative expenses --

18   none of the cases address those.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm not asking you to

20   defend their position.

21                MS. FREEMAN:     Okay.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         It's just such a broad

23   position that I'm trying to understand if there's a

24   split out there that we are unaware of.

25                MS. FREEMAN:     And the problem, Your Honor,


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is that it does have these broad impacts, and none of

 2   the courts have really addressed it.                And I don't

 3   believe that certainly the --

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, can we go back to

 5   the issue that gives me trouble?

 6                 MS. FREEMAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           How to read "incurred by

 8   the estate."    If the estate doesn't pay taxes --

 9                 MS. FREEMAN:       To incur --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- how could it be

11   incurred by the estate when Congress, if it intended

12   what you're saying it intended, could have said

13   "incurred during bankruptcy"?

14                 MS. FREEMAN:       Incurred -- to incur is to

15   take on liability.      So, at the point in time that income

16   is generated during a bankruptcy case, then liabilities

17   are taken on at the same time, the operating expenses,

18   the taxes.    Here, you had a clear estate asset, the Hall

19   farm.   It was sold.      That generates an income tax

20   liability, a capital gains liability.               And so, that

21   is -- it's tied to the income, which is here property of

22   the estate.    The -- the important thing is --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         But -- but the problem is

24   that, with an exception that -- that's not applicable

25   here, section 1399 of the Internal Revenue Code provides


                            Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that no separate taxable entity shall result from the

 2   commencement of a case under Title XI of the United

 3   States Code.

 4               How can you incur a tax when you are not a

 5   separate taxable entity?

 6               MS. FREEMAN:      Your Honor, because you are a

 7   single taxable entity instead of a separate taxable

 8   entity.   The whole reason for the separate taxable

 9   entity section was when you had a bankruptcy estate that

10   consisted only of the assets on the petition filing

11   date, and the debtor earns income independently.         So,

12   the debtor would independently have tax liability, and

13   that would be separate from the estate.

14               But when you have a reorganization case, a

15   corporate chapter 11 or a chapter 12, then the estate

16   and the debtor are a single taxable entity, and the

17   debtor is the one that files the tax returns or the

18   debtor-in-possession, the trustee, if there's a trustee

19   in control --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, if -- if that

21   exception were intended, the provision I read contains

22   an exception.   It says "except in any case to which

23   section 1398 applies."     1398 applies to chapter 7 and

24   chapter 11 where the debtor is an individual.

25               MS. FREEMAN:      That's --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Now, if there is an

 2   additional exception for chapter 12 of the sort that you

 3   allege, why wasn't that put in there?

 4                MS. FREEMAN:      There is no exception, and

 5   there shouldn't be an exception, Your Honor.           They're

 6   within section 1399, just like corporate chapter 11

 7   debtors.   The debtor is the one that files the tax

 8   return.    The debtor and estate are one.         All of that

 9   corporate earnings, all of the wages, the lottery

10   winnings, the farm sale proceeds, all of those are part

11   of the estate.   And so, those --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:        What does it mean, then, to

13   say that no taxable -- "no separate taxable entity shall

14   result"?   What does it mean, unless it means that it is

15   not the estate which incurs the tax?

16                MS. FREEMAN:      Your Honor, respectfully,

17   there's a difference between taxable entity and estate.

18   The estate is a collection of property.           That is the

19   collection of property that's operated by the

20   debtor-in-possession or trustee in a reorganization

21   case.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, but they -- but they

23   would not have needed the exceptions for chapter 7 and

24   chapter 11 where the debtor is an individual if what you

25   say is true, if indeed a bankrupt estate is, as you say,


                          Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                             24
 1   not an entity at all.

 2                MS. FREEMAN:     You need that exception, Your

 3   Honor, in a chapter 7 case for an individual because the

 4   individual earns income that is wholly independent from

 5   the estate, that's not part of the estate.               So that the

 6   bankruptcy estate consists of the assets the individual

 7   owns on the petition filing date.           The trustee

 8   administers those, sells the assets, may incur some

 9   liability for selling the assets for taxes, pays those,

10   and deals with those, while the individual continues to

11   earn income postpetition that's his own income.              And so,

12   you need to have a separate taxable estate in those

13   instances.

14                But when the income that's earned during

15   this whole period of administration, from the petition

16   filing date to the confirmation date of the plan, is all

17   property of the estate, then the debtor, the corporate

18   chapter 11 debtor or the -- the corporate chapter 12

19   debtor or the individual chapter 12 debtor is incurring

20   that income as part of the estate.               It's all property of

21   the estate in a chapter 12 case.           Section 1207 says

22   that.

23                And so, the debtor is the one that files the

24   tax returns, and the debtor uses the estate assets to

25   make the payments of the taxes and to make the payments

 1   on the light bill and to make the payments on all of the

 2   other expenses of administration during this period of

 3   administration.    That's what this Court held in

 4   Nicholas, and that continues on in effect today.

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       But, Ms. Freeman, wouldn't

 6   it be fair to say then that the taxes are incurred by

 7   the debtor and payable out of the estate?          Why would it

 8   say "incurred by the estate"?

 9                  MS. FREEMAN:     It uses the term "incurred by

10   the estate" I think based upon the same kind of language

11   that this Court used in Nicholas, as incurred by the --

12   incurred during the administration period, incurred by

13   the debtor-in-possession.         It's -- it's really a broad

14   sense of all of the kinds of bankruptcy estates in a

15   chapter 7 case.    It -- this refers to all bankruptcy

16   cases.

17               And so, in a chapter 7 case, it's going to

18   be just the assets that exist there on the petition

19   filing date.    If it's a corporate case, it's going to be

20   the -- all of the assets that are generating the income

21   during the course of the administration of the chapter

22   12 or the chapter 11 case or even the chapter 13 case.

23               In chapter 13 cases, you have a specific

24   additional provision, section 1305, that deals with

25   taxes payable postpetition, and it also includes


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                             26
 1   postconfirmation.    So, it gives the government a broader

 2   kind of right so that --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The argument that is made

 4   against your position -- 1305 was one of the provisions

 5   that was featured, I think, both in the Ninth Circuit

 6   and the Tenth Circuit, and their position seems to be

 7   that 1305 gives the government an election.

 8                 MS. FREEMAN:     It does, Your Honor, provide

 9   for an election for the government.               What's important is

10   that in a 13 case, unlike a 12 or an 11, you have a very

11   short period of administration.           They have to file their

12   plan within 15 days.     It's confirmed within a month or

13   two.   And it's very unlikely that April 15th is going to

14   fall within that short period of time, and that's when

15   the Government says that your taxes are incurred.              So,

16   you're going to have a -- it's unlikely you're going to

17   have an administrative expense claim for your income

18   taxes during the period of administration of a chapter

19   13.    It's a very short period.

20                So, the government has the option not only

21   during the administration period, but also during the

22   whole period of the plan, to elect to say:              All right,

23   there have been some big commissions earned here, and I

24   want to go ahead and collect from the estate rather than

25   just wait and see what the debtor earns afterwards.              And

 1   so, it then can go ahead and file a claim and ask to

 2   have that claim paid out of the bankruptcy estate, and

 3   it really gives the government much broader rights than

 4   it does in a normal chapter 11 or a chapter 12 case or a

 5   7.

 6                If I may reserve the remainder of my time

 7   for rebuttal.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Shah.

12                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

13                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14               MR. SHAH:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the Court:

16               The postpetition income tax liability at

17   issue in this case is not subject to section

18   1222(a)(2)(A) and thus cannot be treated as a

19   dischargeable nonpriority debt for two reasons.                First,

20   consistent with the structure of chapter 12, a chapter

21   12 plan is limited to prepetition debts and does not

22   cover postpetition debts, including administrative

23   expenses.   Rather, postpetition administrative expenses

24   are paid separately through section 1226(b)(1), which

25   contains no farm sale exception.            Because section


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                             28
 1   1222(a)(2)(A) strips priority only from a subset of

 2   claims covered by a chapter 12 plan and does not alter

 3   which debts fall within that plan, it cannot apply to

 4   the postpetition tax liability at issue.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So, what -- what farm

 6   sales would be included?       What farm sales would get this

 7   benefit that Senator Grassley obviously wanted them to

 8   have?

 9               MR. SHAH:      Your Honor, it would be

10   prepetition sales.    That is, any capital gains tax

11   incurred from a prepetition sale, those would be

12   priority expenses covered under a chapter 12 plan under

13   section 1222(a)(2), because they fall under -- they're

14   an -- they're a priority claim under section 507(a).

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does that -- does

16   that make sense, though, in terms of if you're talking

17   about farmers and fishermen and you're talking about the

18   treatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm

19   or typically the boat, and they either want to try --

20   they want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they

21   go into bankruptcy, and the big issue is how that

22   asset's going to be treated.             And your position is it's

23   not in the bankruptcy at all; it's outside of it.                That

24   seems to me to be at least counterintuitive.

25               MR. SHAH:      Well, Your Honor, two points:


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                            29
 1   One, as a practical matter, chapter 12 is a

 2   reorganization provision.       This is not a provision just

 3   designed to allow farmers to get out of the business of

 4   farming.   So, often what will happen is that farmers

 5   will try to reorganize some of their farm sale assets,

 6   sell some of their livestock, change their farming

 7   operation, to see if they can save it outside of

 8   bankruptcy first.

 9                All of those sales -- an example of that is

10   the Knudsen case.   Knudsen is the only circuit case to

11   go Petitioners' way.    In Knudsen, it not only involved

12   the postpetition tax liability of the type at issue in

13   this case; it also had a significant prepetition tax

14   liability component in that case based upon just what I

15   was explaining, the farmer trying to -- trying to change

16   their farming operation to save the farm without having

17   to go into bankruptcy.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But also, I gather,

19   it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers

20   that might want to sell part of the farm.              You know,

21   they have dairy and corn operations or something, and

22   they sell one to try to preserve the other.              And that's

23   -- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be

24   considered in the bankruptcy context.              And yet, your

25   position says we're going to treat it outside the


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   bankruptcy.

 2                 MR. SHAH:     Well, Your Honor, it certainly

 3   happens within the bankruptcy, and I'm not disputing

 4   your point that that may -- that may arise in a

 5   bankruptcy case just like it arises in this case.                 And

 6   it will be dealt through the bankruptcy.                 That is, the

 7   sale will happen, and it will be approved by the

 8   bankruptcy court.     The question is, how do you treat the

 9   capital gains tax arising --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But that's a big

11   deal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work,

12   whether they -- I mean, what the amount was here was big

13   for the farmer, and the idea of, well, we're going to

14   pretend that's not at issue here seems to me to be --

15   again, not -- not to make a lot of sense.

16                 MR. SHAH:     Your Honor, we're not asking, to

17   be clear, to pretend that that's not there.                 How the tax

18   liability would be dealt with under the Government's

19   view is at the time the debtor moves to sell the farm

20   asset during the bankruptcy case -- like in this case,

21   that sale of the farm asset generated $960,000.                 That

22   was the sale price.      The capital gains tax liability in

23   this case is $29,000.       If they would have set aside from

24   that $960,000 sale price $29,000 to pay the capital

25   gains tax debt, that would resolve the issue.                 We're not

 1   saying that you ignore it.

 2               JUSTICE KAGAN:          But there's every reason to

 3   think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about

 4   here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be

 5   approved at all because there were very high capital

 6   gains taxes that would result from a sale and that that

 7   was the problem that everybody was focused on, was

 8   making sure that farmers could take advantage of section

 9   12.   So, it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more

10   than a little bit odd.       It's a lot odd to read the

11   statute to apply not in that context but only as to

12   people who have somehow managed to sell their property,

13   you know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy.

14               MR. SHAH:       Sure.         So, Your Honor, when you

15   say that everybody was focused on this problem, we have

16   the evidence of exactly one person as to what one

17   legislator thought that this bill would do.              That's

18   Senator Grassley.   Now, admittedly, Senator Grassley's

19   statements do indicate an intent on his part to reach

20   postpetition taxes.      But the pre-existing statutory

21   framework does not permit that result.

22               What section 1222(a)(2)(A) does is it allows

23   the debtor to strip priority from a certain subset of

24   governmental claims, such as prepetition taxes, and

25   there is no doubt that Senator Grassley correctly

                                                                        32
 1   understood that's how section 1222(a)(2) --

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:       But it's not just Senator

 3   Grassley.   Your interpretation makes this provision,

 4   1222(a)(2)(A), of very, very little practical value.

 5   And you think that's what Congress intended?            Not only

 6   would it -- would it mean that postpetition capital

 7   gains on the sale of part of the farm or the entire farm

 8   would -- would be outside of the bankruptcy, outside of

 9   the bankruptcy, but all of the prepetition capital gains

10   would be outside of it too, unless they occurred in a

11   previous taxable year.

12               MR. SHAH:       A couple of responses, Your

13   Honor.   First of all, I don't think it's sort of a null

14   set or a vanishingly small set.            There's the Knudsen

15   case which qualifies.       Of -- in the professors' amicus

16   brief, on page 10a of their amicus brief, they provide a

17   chart of representative cases involving postpetition tax

18   liabilities.    They cite eight cases in their chart on

19   page 10a.   Three of those eight cases involve

20   significant prepetition tax liabilities, even under the

21   narrower definition of "prepetition."

22               But -- but to get to your larger point, even

23   to the extent it might be narrower than what Congress

24   intended, Congress certainly knew how section 1222

25   operated in the sense that it would strip priority from


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                               33
 1   certain claims that are already entitled to priority

 2   under a chapter 12 plan, such as prepetition taxes.                 And

 3   both sides agree that that's how section 1220(a)(2)(A)

 4   works.   There's no dispute about that.

 5                  The dispute is about whether this

 6   postpetition tax liability comes within the chapter 12

 7   plan in the first place.        That dispute turns on

 8   pre-existing code provisions, part of the 1978 Act, part

 9   of the 1980 Act, and the 1986 Act.                 Whatever deference

10   Senator Grassley is owed as to the operation of section

11   1220(a)(2)(A) itself, he's owed no deference whatsoever

12   as to the proper interpretation of those pre-existing

13   code provisions.

14               It's our position that those pre-existing

15   code provisions, section 503(b), section 346, and

16   section 1398, 1399, all lead to the result that

17   postpetition tax liabilities are not an administrative

18   expense within the meaning of the code.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about employment tax?

20   Employment taxes?

21               MR. SHAH:       Your Honor, employment taxes

22   arguably could be treated differently.                Now, as a matter

23   of discretion, the IRS has chosen not to treat them

24   differently.    That is, they don't try to seek those as

25   administrative expenses.        I think there would be an


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   argument -- and we set this -- set forth the argument in

 2   a footnote of our brief.      What the potential argument

 3   would be is that they could be deemed an administrative

 4   expense not because they're incurred by the estate, but

 5   under the other part of the definition of an

 6   administrative expense under 503(b)(1)(A).

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:        Just following up on

 8   that --

 9               MR. SHAH:     Sure.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- I'm looking for what I'd

11   call past practice, where there must be a lot --

12               MR. SHAH:     Yes.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- that would shed some

14   light on this.   So, I see -- your point that we cannot

15   call these taxes administrative expenses is because when

16   that's defined in 503 for the entire code --

17               MR. SHAH:     Yes.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- it talks about

19   administrative expenses incurred by the estate.

20               MR. SHAH:     Yes, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:        And so, you're saying here

22   are three people who incurred their own taxes.         One is

23   section -- section 12; one is section 13; and one is

24   individuals in section 11.        Is that right?

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:        At least that's my --

 2               MR. SHAH:     Yes.     Yes, Your Honor.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes.     Okay.      So, we have

 4   three categories of people that -- where the taxes,

 5   literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes.               Now,

 6   the bite would come up if it turned out, when they were

 7   getting around to settle these things, that there isn't

 8   enough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's --

 9   no, to pay fully domestic support obligations, wages,

10   and also Federal taxes.

11               Isn't that -- that's where it's going to

12   show up, because the question will be, do you have to

13   shave the Federal taxes because they're coming in to be

14   paid as an administrative expense priority which is

15   only there as number 2, I think, in light of number 1.

16   Or do you not shave them at all?           If they're liable

17   personally, there isn't any reduction in the amount of

18   the Federal Government -- if they're allowed because

19   it's one of the estate's expenses basically, using the

20   estate very, very loosely, then they would have to take

21   a reduction, too.   Am I right?         Are you following it?

22               MR. SHAH:     I think so.            Let me try to say

23   what I think what you're saying.           Under chapter 12 and

24   13, if it is in fact a priority claim, whether it's a

25   priority claim or an administrative expense, those have


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             36
 1   to be paid in full.      There isn't an ability for the

 2   court to shave those --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:         No.     The administrative

 4   expenses don't have to be paid in full if there isn't

 5   enough money for them too in unsecured claims for

 6   domestic support obligations, because administrative

 7   expenses is the second priority; it isn't the first.

 8                MR. SHAH:      Okay.         So, Your Honor, there is a

 9   misunderstanding I think in what you are saying.                That

10   is, in a chapter 12 plan, the priorities matter more in

11   terms of the relative priority between category 1, 2, 3,

12   4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.     They matter more in a chapter 7

13   liquidation where there's a finite set of assets being

14   liquidated, and then those will be paid out in the

15   priority that you're talking about.                In a chapter 12 or

16   13 case, there's going to be a plan proposed, and that

17   plan will be confirmed.

18               Now, under 1222(a)(2), any of those priority

19   claims, whether it's first priority or eighth priority,

20   has to be set out and to be paid in full in order for

21   the plan to be confirmed.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.

23               MR. SHAH:       So, the plan won't be confirmed

24   at all.   There isn't a matter of ordering the priorities

25   in a chapter 12 or 13 case.

 1                Now, if I could turn back to Justice

 2   Sotomayor's question.

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could you turn back

 4   to -- before you answer my other question, could you

 5   finish your thought on what you're doing with wages?

 6   Are they given priority or aren't they?            If you're

 7   saying they're not -- if we accept your reading of this,

 8   employee wage taxes are not administrative expenses.

 9                MR. SHAH:    Right.         Well, Your Honor, they're

10   certainly not administrative expenses under the

11   definition of incurred by the estate.            That would be the

12   relevant issue in this case.            They may come under the

13   other definition of administrative expense; that is, the

14   costs -- necessary costs of preserving the estate, like

15   wages.   If you consider the employment payroll tax

16   that's paid simultaneously as the wage, as part and

17   parcel of the wages, you could get at it that way.              But,

18   again, that doesn't have anything to do with the

19   "incurred by the estate" language.

20                The "incurred by the estate" language, as

21   you properly point out, is relevant -- the most relevant

22   provisions as to whether a tax is incurred by the estate

23   are sections 346(b) and 1398 and 1399 --

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:       How does that work,

25   Mr. Shah?   Because this was a part of your argument that


                         Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                        38
 1   I have to say sort of tripped me up --

 2               MR. SHAH:       Okay.

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:          -- because you define

 4   "incurred by the estate" by reference to those

 5   provisions, but those provisions were enacted 2 years

 6   and 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to

 7   define.

 8               MR. SHAH:       Sure.

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:          So, it must have been a very

10   prescient Congress.

11               MR. SHAH:       Well, Your Honor it was a

12   prescient Congress, because in the legislative history

13   that we cite, they say -- and it's not true that all of

14   the -- separate taxable entity rules weren't implemented

15   until afterwards.   There -- section 346, which dealt

16   admittedly only with State and local taxes, they set up

17   rules, the same separate taxable entity rules that

18   Congress later enacted 2 years later, to apply to State

19   and local entities.      And that's the provision 346 that's

20   reprinted in our appendix at page 2.

21               What Congress said when they passed 346 is

22   "we fully" -- "we fully expect" -- and as they had

23   originally drafted them in the 1978 Act, to also apply

24   to Federal taxes.   But it decided to pull them out of

25   the Act so as not to step on the shoes of the

 1   jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee.          That's

 2   the explanation that Congress provided and then 2

 3   years --

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:          But you're saying that as of

 5   1978, there was kind of an idea in people's heads about

 6   this separate tax entity or at least in some people's

 7   heads, but that idea had never been converted into any

 8   statutory language.      And you're suggesting that we

 9   should take this phrase "incurred by the estate" and

10   read it as if they were referring to something real that

11   was in a statute.

12               MR. SHAH:       It's not simply taking out of

13   their head, Your Honor; the section 346 rules which are

14   parallel and apply to State and local taxes, those

15   didn't come out of nowhere.          Those came out of prior IRS

16   rulings as to when there is a separate taxable entity in

17   a bankruptcy case.

18               There were pre-existing -- before the 1978

19   Act, in particular, there was a 1972 IRS revenue ruling

20   which set forth the rules about when there is a separate

21   taxable entity, whether the Act should -- whether the

22   tax should be taxed to the estate or to the debtor.

23   Section 346 in the 1978 Act codified those rules for

24   State and local income taxes.

25               In the intervening 2 years between 1978 and


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   1980 when Congress consummated the step and extended

 2   those to Federal taxes, the IRS was still applying its

 3   pre-existing practice based on its revenue ruling.            So,

 4   there wasn't a gap where there was no guidance as to

 5   whether -- how to determine whether these were incurred

 6   by the estate or not.

 7                 Courts may -- courts readily would have

 8   looked, I presume, to the 1972 Treasury ruling and the

 9   parallel 346 rulings in that gap time until the

10   legislative guidance came along and then codified that

11   result with respect to Federal taxes.

12                 Now, I think to --

13                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Can I ask another

14   question --

15                 MR. SHAH:    Sure.

16                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       -- while we are on this?

17   Because the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we're looking

18   to this separate taxable entity, but if I understand

19   correctly, in the corporate context, the IRS actually

20   does not look to that.      It looks to just the question of

21   who's filing the tax return.

22                 So, if that's the case, aren't you, in that

23   very large bankruptcy context, losing your textual

24   anchor entirely?

25                 MR. SHAH:    No, Your Honor.        There are two


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                          41
 1   ways that a bankruptcy estate can incur a tax.             One is

 2   if it's a separate taxable entity, then it -- then it's

 3   responsible for the taxes.         All the taxes are taxed to

 4   the estate, and it has to file the return and pay it.

 5                 The other way is if it has the duty to file

 6   the return.    That's a different provision of the

 7   Internal Revenue Code, section 6012(b)(3).             6012(b)(3)

 8   also appears in the Government's -- in the appendix to

 9   the Government's brief.       What 6012(b)(3) on page 14a

10   says is that, in a bankruptcy case, the trustee of a

11   corporate bankruptcy estate shall make the return for

12   income in a corporation.

13                 What this Court held in Holywell, which both

14   sides cite and both sides agree, is that when a

15   corporate trustee has a duty to file a return under

16   6012(b)(3), it also has a duty to pay the tax.            That is,

17   it incurs -- it's liable for or incurs the tax.

18                 So, there are two ways to incur the tax:

19   One is separate taxable entity; the other way is if the

20   code imposes an obligation on the bankruptcy estate

21   to -- to file and pay the tax return.             That's the other

22   way to interpret it, and that's why all the chapter 7

23   and 11 corporate cases that are cited by Petitioners are

24   inapt.   In those cases, the postpetition tax liabilities

25   are, in fact, incurred by the estate.

 1                  What's remarkable is that Petitioners do not

 2   cite a single chapter 12 case in which a postpetition

 3   tax liability has been treated as an administrative

 4   expense.    Chapter 12 has been around since 1986, and

 5   yet, there is not -- if this was such a big problem that

 6   Congress was trying to get at it through this way, you

 7   would have expected at least a single case in which a

 8   postpetition tax liability had been treated as an

 9   administrative expense.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:         How would it show up?     I

11   mean, what difference -- suppose -- suppose you -- in 11

12   individual, 12, or 13, what's the difference whether you

13   treated it as an administrative expense or not, as long

14   as they all have to be paid anyway, you say?

15                MR. SHAH:      Sure.         So, the difference is, in

16   chapter 12 and 13, they are treated outside of the

17   bankruptcy plan itself, but they do need to be paid up

18   front.   And, in fact, they receive a special --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:         No.     I mean, how would we

20   know?    How would we know --

21                MR. SHAH:      Oh, that they're treated

22   differently?

23                JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

24                MR. SHAH:      Through the code.        So, in chapter

25   12 and 13, 1226(b)(1) and 1326(b)(1), the parallel

 1   provisions in chapter 13, they pull out administrative

 2   expenses.   They pull them out --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:        I know.        Let's imagine

 4   you're absolutely right.      They mean to treat them

 5   differently.

 6               MR. SHAH:     Yes.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:        They mean to treat the

 8   postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government

 9   not as an administrative expense.            But this is an

10   instance where the business will continue, and,

11   therefore, you have said in order to continue, you have

12   to pay all your tax liability and all your

13   administrative expenses.

14               MR. SHAH:     Yes.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:        Therefore, what difference

16   does it make whether you do or whether you don't treat

17   them as administrative expenses?           What is the

18   operational difference?

19               MR. SHAH:     Sure.         Your Honor, it would be to

20   the government's advantage if these were in the ordinary

21   course -- at least before section 1222(a)(2)(A) was

22   enacted that stripped priority, it would have been in

23   the government's advantage to take the position that

24   these were administrative expenses.              And the reason why

25   it's favorable to the government is, those have to be

 1   paid up front as part of the bankruptcy.

 2                  If you don't treat them as administrative

 3   expenses -- and the government took the self-denying

 4   position here in the years leading up to 2005,

 5   consistently taking the position these were not

 6   administrative expenses, even though it was to the

 7   government's disadvantage, because the code required

 8   that interpretation.      And the disadvantage is you don't

 9   get -- the government didn't get them paid up front as

10   administrative expenses.        They would have to collect

11   them outside of the bankruptcy.            And when you go to

12   collect them outside of the bankruptcy, there's much

13   more uncertainty.    There may not be any --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it's certainly

15   not a self-denying position now, right?                You're arguing

16   that these are -- that the taxes of this sort are

17   administrative expenses when that puts you at the head

18   of the line.    You're arguing that they are not

19   administrative expenses, same type of taxes, when it

20   puts you at the back of the line, even though the

21   provision that puts you at the back of the line was

22   designed to particularly help the fishermen and -- and

23   farmers.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               No, I'm talking

 5   about the position you're taking now.               You argue for --

 6               MR. SHAH:     We have maintained our --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               -- different

 8   treatment of these taxes as to whether or not they're

 9   administrative expenses -- not solely, but it leads to

10   the result that you get the money first either way.

11               MR. SHAH:     Because Congress -- the

12   government has stayed consistent in its position.

13   Because Congress has changed the rules, it turns out

14   that that same interpretation --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, but then

16   you're saying that Congress changed the rules in a way

17   that, as Justice Alito's question suggested, really

18   doesn't do much at all, when what they wanted to do was

19   provide some real protection for farmers and fishermen.

 1   provision within 1222 that said something like -- use

 2   the language something like section 1305, that said any

 3   taxes that become payable after of the filing of the

 4   petition shall be treated as non-dischargeable,

 5   nonpriority debts and paid that way.

 6                 But they didn't do that.            And I think

 7   section 1305 is critical here, and this goes to your

 8   question, Mr. Chief Justice, as well, that the

 9   government is trying to take advantage here.              The --

10   adopting Petitioners' position would have a significant

11   ripple effect in chapter 13.             This is not simply a

12   matter of trying to get to the result that Senator

13   Grassley intended by narrowly interpreting

14   1222(a)(2)(A), and it won't have any other effects in

15   the code.   It will have a significant effect in the

16   intended operation of chapter 13.

17                 And -- and the reason why that's important

18   is, is to put this in perspective, there are about 600

19   to 700 total chapter 12 filings each year.             There's

20   somewhere on the upwards of 400,000 chapter 13 filings

21   each year, and here's where it would throw a wrench into

22   chapter 13.    If you look at section 1305 of chapter

23   13 -- and that's reproduced on page 11a of the

24   Government's appendix.      What 1305(a)(1) does is it

25   provides a special procedure for the government to file

 1   a claim for postpetition taxes, exactly the type of tax

 2   at issue in this case.     It says:        Government, you can go

 3   file a claim to have that included within the bankruptcy

 4   plan.

 5                If -- if you adopt Petitioners' position,

 6   there would never be a case in which the government

 7   would ever have any occasion to invoke 1305(a)(1),

 8   because they would --

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:       But why would that be a

10   problem?   You said that there would be a significant

11   ripple effect and practical difficulties.          And I

12   understand your argument about 13 shows that you have to

13   do this and why would 13 be necessary if Petitioner were

14   right, but you started out, I thought --

15                MR. SHAH:    It -- yes.

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:       -- by trying to show us that

17   it would be a significant practical problem --

18                MR. SHAH:    I said it would be a significant

19   disruption to the intended operation of chapter 13.          In

20   practice, it would actually mean that the government

21   comes out better under chapter 13 than in the

22   government's current position, because what Petitioners'

23   position would do, if you read --

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:       So, it just does

25   automatically for the government what is now done by --

 1   by some kind of government filing?

 2               MR. SHAH:      Well -- well, not even that, Your

 3   Honor, because under -- the reason why 1305(a)(1) would

 4   be dead letter -- you could just rip that page out of

 5   the code and throw it away if you accept Petitioners'

 6   reading.   The reason why that's true is because under

 7   their reading, it would get administrative expense

 8   priority, which are paid up front, super-priority, even

 9   before anything else; but under 1305(a)(1), it doesn't

10   get administrative expense priority; it may not even get

11   any priority at all.

12               And so, it's a significant change in the

13   operation of how the government would be seeking

14   postpetition tax liabilities.            Now, it would work to the

15   detriment of the debtor in chapter 13 cases, the upwards

16   of 400,000 chapter 13 cases that would --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But those are --

18   those are small potatoes compared to the sale of a farm

19   and a boat, right?

20               MR. SHAH:      I would -- I would --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Would there -- this

22   particular issue of large capital gains from a sale of

23   significant assets doesn't typically arise in the

24   chapter 13 cases.

25               MR. SHAH:      Sure, the capital gains tax

 1   wouldn't, but there's all sorts of postpetition income

 2   taxes that would arise in a chapter 13 case.             In a

 3   chapter 13 case, those are wages that are being incurred

 4   after the filing of the petition.          All of the taxes on

 5   those wages after the petition would be the -- the type

 6   of -- would be eligible for postpetition tax treatment.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, in chapter --

 8   chapter 13 cases are the ones that you -- that are

 9   typically resolved very quickly, right?

10               MR. SHAH:    Your Honor, it is true that --

11   from the statistics that I have seen, on average we're

12   talking about 4 months in a chapter 13 case.             On average

13   in -- in a chapter 12 case, according to the professors'

14   amicus brief, median time is about 8 months.

15               What's clear from the legislative history,

16   the reason why Congress set up the chapter 13 rules as

17   to make the tax incurred by the debtor rather than by

18   the estate is because Congress expressly said in the

19   legislative history, which is cited in our brief, that

20   they expected the confirmation time to be relatively

21   quickly in a chapter 13 case.

22               We know that they made the same assumption

23   in the chapter 12 case because, one, they enacted the

24   same separate taxable entity rules; and, two, they put

25   in actual deadlines in the code for chapter 13:             90 days


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to propose a plan, 45 days to confirm it.              So, roughly

 2   4 months is what Congress had extended.

 3                Now, in practice, it's been the case that

 4   bankruptcy courts have extended that time beyond the

 5   statutory deadlines.     So, perhaps they are open a couple

 6   months longer than what Congress had expected.              But that

 7   wasn't the intent that Congress had enacted this with,

 8   and if Congress wants to change that, it can go back and

 9   rewrite the rules to -- to make that change.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, before you

11   finish, could you answer my question of what impact your

12   broader reading, your chapter 12, affects only

13   prepetition debts?    What else is that kind of holding

14   going to affect?   Your narrow alternative holding

15   affects just this issue.       That broader reading -- I

16   worry about a broader reading when I don't know its

17   impact.

18               MR. SHAH:      I don't think it would have -- I

19   think -- I don't think it would have any adverse

20   effects.   And the reason is this:           The administrative

21   expenses, whether they're included in the plan or not,

22   are still going to be paid up front.              If you take

23   Petitioners' reading that administrative expenses are

24   really part of the plan under 1222(a)(2), rather than

25   1226(b)(1), you now have a conflict between 1226(b)(1),


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   which is on page 10a, which expressly addresses and only

 2   addresses administrative expenses, and states that --

 3   this is on page 10a.     It said those will be paid "before

 4   or at the time of each payment to creditors under the

 5   plan."

 6               Now, if you also said that they come under

 7   1222(a)(2), which is the only way that Petitioners could

 8   win -- if they also came under 1222(a)(2), 1222(a)(2)

 9   says that their -- they must be provided for full

10   payment in deferred cash payments.                So, deferred

11   interest-free payments over the life of a 3- to 5-year

12   bankruptcy plan.    That's very different than having them

13   get super-priority treatment under 1226(b)(1) and be

14   paid in front -- up front, separate from the plan.

15               So that -- that is one significant piece of

16   textual evidence that Congress thought that these should

17   be paid outside of the plan.

18               The other piece of textual evidence is

19   section 1227(a), which appears on page 10a as well, and

20   what it says is that the confirmed plan shall be binding

21   on each creditor.   That's the only potentially relevant

22   category to the government.

23               But section 101 defines "creditor" -- and

24   this is on page 1a of our appendix -- as "entity that

25   has a claim against a debtor that arose at the time of


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                      52
 1   or before the order for relief concerning the debtor."

 2   That is a holder of a prepetition claim.

 3                  If a confirmed chapter 12 plan is only

 4   binding on the holder of a prepetition claim, it makes

 5   no sense to include postpetition claims within a

 6   chapter 12 plan.     I don't even know what it would mean

 7   to have a confirmed -- to have a plan included that and

 8   not have that plan binding on the government.

 9                  And so, I think if you take those two pieces

10   of textual evidence together, I think that strongly

11   supports the interpretation of 1222(a)(2) that when it

12   says a claim of the type specified in section 507, it

13   means "claim" and doesn't mean "claim and administrative

14   expense."

15                 Now, admittedly, Congress has not been

16   perfectly clear in using that term.                It uses --

17   sometimes it uses the term "claim" to mean claim and

18   administrative expense.        Sometimes it means it to only

19   mean claim.    But we should give effect to the

20   distinction between claim and administrative expense in

21   light of section 1226(b)(1), which specifically already

22   addresses administrative expenses.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But the problem with

24   that argument is that the two are used interchangeably

25   by everyone.    Congress, the Court --


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1               MR. SHAH:     Yes, Your Honor.        And if --

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The government in many

 3   situations, given the broad definition of "claims" --

 4               MR. SHAH:     Sure.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- the only logical

 6   conclusion is that it includes a subset, a liability

 7   created by administrative expenses.

 8               MR. SHAH:     Your Honor, and if you are only

 9   construing that language in isolation, if it only said

10   "claim" in 507(a)(2) and 1226(b)(1) didn't exist, I

11   would be in full agreement with you that you would read

12   it to mean "claim and administrative expense."           Because

13   we know that administrative expenses have to be paid in

14   some way through the bankruptcy case.

15               But 1226(b)(1) does exist in this code, and

16   we need to give that provision effect.

17               The last point I would make is Congress

18   knows how to include administrative expenses within a

19   bankruptcy plan when it wants to.           If you look at the

20   corresponding provision in chapter 11, as opposed to the

21   provisions in chapter 12 and 13 -- this is section

22   1129(a)(9)(A) -- it expressly provides for the payment

23   of administrative expenses within the context of the

24   chapter 11 plan.   Chapter 12 and 13 take a different

25   approach, and the Court should give effect to the choice

 1   that Congress made to treat administrative expenses

 2   outside of the bankruptcy plan.

 5                 MR. SHAH:     Thank you, Your Honor.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Ms. Freeman, you

 7   have 2 minutes remaining.

 8               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. FREEMAN

 9                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10                 MS. FREEMAN:      Your Honor, one of the first

11   things that Mr. Shah said was that the debtor should

12   have set aside $29,000 from the sale proceeds to pay the

13   taxes.   That's $29,000 in sale proceeds are property of

14   the estate.    And, yes, those are ordinarily set aside to

15   pay the taxes.    That's how bankruptcy cases work.

16                 Because you have 1222(a)(2)(A), that $29,000

17   didn't need to be used to pay the taxes, and instead was

18   set aside to be treated under the plan of

19   reorganization, where that tax claim could be demoted in

20   priority to a prepetition claim and discharged.

21                 But the ordinary course is that the sale

22   proceeds are used to pay the taxes, the administrative

23   expenses.   That's how bankruptcy works.               And the

24   Government's argument here completely undercuts that.

25                 With respect to section 1305, the language


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        55
 1   is different because it uses the word "payable."          It

 2   includes all postpetition, postconfirmation, all the way

 3   through to the end of the bankruptcy case.          Not just the

 4   short period of administration.

 5                In chapter 13 cases, you still have to pay

 6   administrative expenses.      It's just that it's pretty

 7   rare that you have a tax that is incurred during that

 8   short period of administration.          And so, you have a

 9   separate statute that covers the whole period through

10   the entirety of the plan of reorganization.

11               The Court was -- Mr. Shah was asked about

12   cases where -- and in fact an administrative expense

13   claim was incurred for a capital gains tax in a

14   chapter 12 case.   We would cite the Court to the Specht

15   case.   A copy of that is attached to the professors'

16   amicus brief.   And that shows where a plan was defeated

17   because of the large capital gains tax from the sale of

18   the family farm.   And that, in fact, is cited in some of

19   the -- some of the legislative -- not the legislative

20   history, but some of the commentary about one of the

21   reasons why Senator Grassley supported section

22   1222(a)(2)(A) and drafted it in the first place.

23               This prevents a plan from being confirmed.

24   In so many chapter 12 cases, family farmers are not able

25   to go through with their plans.          And that's why you have

 1   the demotion in priority.

 2               It does have very little practical value if,

 3   in fact, it only applies to prepetition sales -- and not

 4   just prepetition but more than a year prepetition in

 5   most instances.   The professors' amicus brief just

 6   refers to prepetition, and its little chart doesn't say

 7   that those are not within the scope of 507(a)(8), and

 8   those eighth priority -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
