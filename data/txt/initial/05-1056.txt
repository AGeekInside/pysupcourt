 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:             We'll hear argument now in

 4   No. 05-1056, Microsoft against AT&T.

 5                 Mr. Olson.

 6                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 7                           ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. OLSON:       Thank you, Justice Stevens.            May

 9   it please the Court:

10                 The limited monopoly granted by U.S. patent

11   laws protects against the making, using or selling a

12   patented invention within the United States.                Section

13   271(f) also makes it an infringement to make components

14   of a patented invention within the United States and

15   then simply ship them abroad for reassembly.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Olson, before you get

17   into the merits I have a question, a preliminary

18   question.     I understand from AT&T's brief that there has

19   been a stipulation entered into between the parties

20   after the judgment below which preserved Microsoft's

21   right to appeal and prescribed different dollar amounts

22   that Microsoft must pay AT&T depending on the outcome of

23   the appeal.     Does that raise any, any muteness problem?

24   Can you sort of wager on the outcome of an appeal that

25   way?

 1                 MR. OLSON:       No, I don't believe so, Justice

 2   Scalia.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, suppose two parties

 4   just, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a

 5   case or controversy, bet each other that the district

 6   court will come out one way or the other way in, in a

 7   trumped-up suit.     Does that create a standing --

 8                 MR. OLSON:       This is by no means a trumped-up

 9   suit.     It's a very serious suit.              The outcome, the

10   judgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not

11   a matter of wager.      It depends upon the decision of a

12   matter of law of an interpretation of a statute of the

13   United States.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you could say the

15   same thing in the hypothetical I gave.                    It is a matter

16   of wager, which way the Court will come out.

17                 MR. OLSON:       This is an entirely legitimate,

18   I submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal

19   issue depending upon how a legal question is decided.

20   The only thing that's been resolved is the amount that

21   will be paid as damages depending upon the outcome of

22   the appeal.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you know of any, any

24   precedent for that?

25                 MR. OLSON:       It seems to me, Justice Scalia,


                                          4

 1   that it happens frequently, especially in criminal cases

 2   where there is -- someone pleads guilty in and

 3   preserving a right to appeal a certain issue.                  I don't

 4   have a case to cite to you but it strikes me as quite

 5   understandable that the parties might agree if the

 6   outcome of the legal question that the judge might

 7   decide is going to be X, then the consequence will be a

 8   liability for Y. If it's -- if it's of the opposite

 9   outcome, the outcome will be different.                  That's --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose the amount were

11   trivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this

12   question?

13                MR. OLSON:       Well, I think that if the

14   amount --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Then there would be a case

16   with a controversy problem, I should think.

17                MR. OLSON:       I don't know what the Court

18   might mean by the word trivial, Justice Kennedy, but

19   this is a very significant major amount involved in this

20   case.   There is no question that the parties are very

21   serious.    It's a very significant legal question with

22   respect to the interpretation.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's so, but is there a

24   lot of money involved depending on whether you win or

25   lose?

 1                MR. OLSON:       Yes.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Okay.

 3                MR. OLSON:       In this case, notwithstanding

 4   the limitation of in Section 271(f) that the components,

 5   there's -- liability of the components are created here,

 6   and reassemble the broad.           The Federal Circuit held that

 7   foreign made tangible reproductions of computer

 8   operating code installed in foreign-made computers may

 9   be components which are deemed or essentially supplied

10   from the United States, because copying is part and

11   parcel of software distribution, and thus subsumed in

12   the act of supplying.       Under this ruling, U.S. companies

13   may be held liable for patent infringement whenever

14   their products are copied or replicated abroad.             This --

15   the court of appeals decision and the position of

16   Respondents requires reworking several words in the

17   statute.

18                The statute says supplied from the United

19   States.    The court of appeals said, well, it might be

20   deemed supplied from the United States after it's copied

21   abroad.    The Respondent takes the words "such

22   components" in the statute and reads them as not the

23   same components.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Olson, isn't one of

25   the questions whether the software is really being


                                         6

 1   copied when it's transferred from the golden disk to the

 2   new manufacturer, or whether it's actually being

 3   supplied?

 4                MR. OLSON:      It is being copied.             There isn't

 5   any question that it's being copied, Justice Stevens.

 6   The stipulation which is in pages 44-A through 47-A of

 7   the petition appendix contains the words -- this is

 8   words to which respondent stipulated -- foreign-made

 9   copies replicated object code, foreign manufactured

10   copies, foreign replicated object code.                  What happens,

11   Justice Stevens, is that the golden master of the disk

12   which contains the physical manifestation of the object

13   code is read by a machine somewhere outside the United

14   States, looked at and then copied onto another physical

15   medium, either a hard drive or a disk.                  Many hard

16   drives, many disks.     Those foreign replicated physical

17   tangible copies are then installed in computers and they

18   become components of those computers.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is the master disk a

20   component?

21                MR. OLSON:      The master -- well, AT&T has

22   taken two positions on that.            We --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What's your position?

24                MR. OLSON:      Our position is that it's not a

25   component of the final product computers that are made


                                        7

 1   abroad.   What is a component is a replication, a copy of

 2   a new hard drive or a new disk that's made a part of

 3   those computers which, without which --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Just the disk but not the

 5   information on the disk is the component.

 6               MR. OLSON:       The information on the disk is

 7   of no use to the computer unless it's made into a

 8   physical machine readable document -- object.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That -- Mr. Olson, that

10   is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what

11   you call the object code appears in the -- in the

12   computer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with

13   the master disk, and the object code is the critical

14   component, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the

15   first question that you raised, whether digital software

16   code, an intangible sequence of 1's and 0's may be

17   considered a component of a patent, patented invention?

18               MR. OLSON:       If I understand your question,

19   Justice Ginsburg, let me answer it this way.            AT&T has

20   taken two positions.      The most recent position is that

21   it's the intangible object code, the series of 1's and

22   0's, or instructions to a computer switch to be on or

23   off, that is a component.          They also took a position

24   earlier in the case and which is referred to in the

25   stipulation that it was the golden master, the physical


                                        8

 1   manifestation on the -- on a master disk that went

 2   abroad that was the component.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I still would like to

 4   know your position.     The golden disk is or is not a

 5   component?

 6                MR. OLSON:      It is not a component --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But copies of the golden

 8   disk are or are not components?

 9                MR. OLSON:      The copies, the physical

10   manifestation on a hard drive --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Physical manifestation?

12                MR. OLSON:      Our components of the foreign

13   manufactured computers.        Those components are not

14   supplied from --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I suppose if you could, if

16   you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components.               Then

17   if you used -- if you're going to make 100 machines.              If

18   you used for your disk the master disk for the last

19   copy, then that would have been -- that would -- then

20   the master disk would be a copy, a component of the last

21   machine.

22                MR. OLSON:      If -- well, I think, if I

23   understand your question, if you make -- and it depends

24   upon where you make it, where you transfer --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You make them abroad.

 1                 MR. OLSON:       If you make it abroad, that --

 2   and it's -- that is where the component is supplied

 3   from.     Copies are made abroad.             There's no question

 4   about that and --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But if the disk, if the

 6   golden disk itself after they finish the copies, were

 7   used --

 8                 MR. OLSON:       If the physical --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- in a hardware, then

10   that would be a component.

11                 MR. OLSON:       If that physical golden disk

12   were actually put into a computer and used without more.

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, I'm a little

14   confused, because I thought the golden disk was just one

15   method of getting the software into the new computers.

16   And I thought it was the software which was arguably the

17   component, not any physical manifestation.

18                 MR. OLSON:       Well, that's why I said AT&T has

19   taken two positions.        Here's the position that they took

20   in their brief before the court of appeals.                Three

21   decades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively

22   recognized software to be a physical and structural

23   component of patented machines.                The problem, Justice

24   Stevens --

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But do you -- what is your

 1   view on whether or not software is a component?

 2              MR. OLSON:          The -- if I may answer that by

 3   saying that people use the word "software" in two

 4   different ways.     One of which, they use it as the

 5   intangible series of 1's and 0's. We submit that the

 6   correct way to understand the word "software" is the

 7   physical manifestation of that what is called source

 8   code, which is made into object code, which is made into

 9   machine readable code.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Or at least the correct way

11   to understand component.

12              MR. OLSON:          It is the correct way to

13   understand the --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               And the component then

15   would be either a disk which is put into a computer or

16   the portion of the hard drive to which the code is

17   transferred.

18              MR. OLSON:          Yes.       As I understand it,

19   Justice Souter, and I think the stipulations make this

20   clear, there's a reference in the stipulations to

21   encoded transmissions but there's a -- but the parties

22   also agree that's the same process as the golden disk.

23   The golden disk is sent abroad.                That is read by a

24   machine and then the machine understands -- it's almost

25   as if you were to read physically any other type of

 1   document, read it to a machine.                The machine understands

 2   what is said, puts it into a physical manifestation on a

 3   disk or on a hard drive.           Many copies are made in that

 4   fashion.     They are installed in computers made abroad,

 5   sold to foreign purchasers.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So are you saying that

 7   neither the source code nor the compilation are a

 8   component?

 9                 MR. OLSON:       Of the foreign?            The language of

10   the statute is the foreign manufactured product.                      Those

11   are the computers that are sold abroad.                   It is our

12   position that the only components that are in issue in

13   this case are the physical manifestations of the object

14   code on a hard drive or on a disk.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So that neither the source

16   code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the

17   compilation is put on a disk?

18                 MR. OLSON:       That's correct.            And the -- the

19   thing that's on the disk in the foreign --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That seems odd.       I mean,

23                 MR. OLSON:       Justice Kennedy --

 1              MR. OLSON:       But the program is nothing until

 2   made into a physical manifestation that can be made by

 3   the computer.

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:            What is patented?          Is the

 5   physical object patented or is the software patented?

 6              MR. OLSON:       The AT&T patent --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Right.

 8              MR. OLSON:       The '580 patent is a program, as

 9   I understand it, that's married to a computer, has to be

10   married to a computer in order to be patented.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You can't patent, you know,

12   on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?

13              MR. OLSON:       That's correct, Justice Scalia.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            There needs to be a device.

15              MR. OLSON:       An idea or a principle, two plus

16   two equals four can't be patented.                It has to be put

17   together with a machine and made into a usable device.

18   The bind that AT&T is in here is that the components

19   that make the machines run that are produced abroad are

20   not supplied from the United States.                   They are made in

21   Belgium or Frankfurt or something.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That depends on what you

23   consider the component.       They define component as

24   including the, what you've been calling the abstract.

25              MR. OLSON:       They have attempted, Justice

 1   Ginsburg, with respect, to have it both ways.                 They've

 2   said that it is a physical and structural thing,

 3   something that's on the golden master disk.                 And then

 4   they say it's just the binary code in the abstract, but

 5   that in the abstract never becomes a part of the

 6   computer.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What did the Federal

 8   Circuit say?     And I read the opinion a couple of times

 9   and it was, it seemed to me ambiguous whether the

10   Federal Circuit was identifying the component as the

11   object code itself or the master disk.

12               MR. OLSON:         Yes.       I agree with you.     The

13   Federal Circuit was ambiguous, in part because there

14   were two separate decisions.              The court considered the

15   component issue in the Eolas case and then when this

16   case came along, said we've already decided the

17   component portion of the statute; now we must decide the

18   supplied from.    So the language which the Federal

19   Circuit used is a bit confusing.                 Basically what it

20   said, though, is that the act of supplying embraces the

21   act of copying.    That means that any, any company

22   sending a machine or a patented product abroad, that

23   that machine must be copied in order to be mass produced

24   abroad.   It might be a pill.             It might be a mousetrap.

25   It might be a Buick.        That exact identical copy if

 1   replicated abroad does not violate the statutes, the

 2   patent laws, it doesn't constitute an infringement.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose you had a patent

 4   on a biological organism and it was contained in a

 5   little vial, and you shipped it abroad.                 Just by doing

 6   nothing at all, it grew, and it had -- it grew into 100

 7   different parts.

 8               MR. OLSON:       If it reproduces itself, Justice

 9   Kennedy, somewhere outside the United States --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

11               MR. OLSON:       What you're suggesting is that

12   there is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold.

13   It could be the same thing.            If it's reproduced outside

14   the United States by some laboratory outside the United

15   States, then the components are not being sent from the

16   United States for reassembly abroad.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't this an artificial

18   distinction in -- when you're talking about the making

19   of a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved

20   in doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time

21   involved.   But with, with software, the Federal

22   Circuit's point was that it is so easy and inexpensive

23   and fast to copy it that simply sending the information

24   abroad, sending the object code abroad in the form of

25   the golden disk, is tantamount to manufacturing copies

 1   overseas.

 2                 MR. OLSON:       I think there are three answers

 3   to that.    Surely the patent laws cannot be determined

 4   according to whether it's easy or fast or efficient to

 5   replicate something.        There has to be a line that makes

 6   some sense.    Number two, it may be fast and efficient

 7   but there are certainly costs involved in taking the

 8   machines to do it.      Number three, where would that take

 9   us?   A design -- every product contains its own

10   manifestation of its design.              That would take us

11   everywhere, because any product can be copied abroad.

12   However -- and maybe there are going to be fast ways to

13   produce other things.        These are replicas,

14   reproductions, copies.         These are not such components

15   that are supplied from the United States.                   If I may

16   reserve the balance of my time?                Thank you.

23                 It might help if I could start by putting

25   international patent law.            Section 271(f) is a limited

 1   extension of normal territoriality principles that is

 2   designed to shore up the prohibition against actually

 3   making a patented invention in the United States, but it

 4   does not take the further and extraordinary step of

 5   applying United States law to the conduct of copying

 6   parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is

 7   properly the subject of foreign law.

 8              As a result, in the context of traditional

 9   manufacturing, for example, it has always been

10   understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while

11   companies cannot make parts in the United States for

12   final assembly abroad -- that's too close to making it

13   here -- they may make copies in a foreign country by,

14   for example, sending the design to the foreign country

15   or sending a specific part to the foreign country that

16   can be copied there.

17                  That distinction between copying in the

18   United States and copying in the foreign country has two

19   critical dimensions.      The first is that it protects the

20   foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish

21   the rules of competition that will govern companies that

22   wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by

23   copying their products abroad, assembling them there and

24   selling them there.

25                  The second, which is the flip side of

 1   that point, is that it enables United States companies

 2   to compete on an even playing field abroad against their

 3   foreign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and

 4   selling parts abroad, subject --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Joseffer, to the, to

 6   the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign

 7   nations that would have an interest in this, usually

 8   when that is so, hear from them and in this case there

 9   is a strange silence in that regard.

10              MR. JOSEFFER:          I think that -- I can say --

11   a couple points I can make.           One is, this case has, has

12   been viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to

13   tie this to software on the grounds that software can

14   easily be copied abroad, I think this case has been

15   somewhat narrowly viewed as a software case.                   But in

16   truth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from

17   anything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was

18   actually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt

19   that other nations would be quite concerned, like in --

20   in two ways.

21              One is we have looked, not exhaustively but

22   we have looked, and we have not been able to find a

23   single other country that would apply its law in the

24   circumstances if they were reversed.                   In other words if

25   a German condition wanted to compete in the United


                                      18

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   States subject to German law by making copies here,

 2   assembling them here, selling them here, Germany would

 3   stay out of that because it's the United States'

 4   prerogative.   Also there are significant differences

 5   between the nations' patent laws.                For software in

 6   particular, the United States is much more bullish on

 7   the patentability of software-related inventions than

 8   many other countries.      But even for more mundane

 9   reasons, if we were talking about anything -- it could

10   be that the foreign government doesn't think that an

11   invention is particularly novel, it just disagrees with

12   us about that, or it doesn't think there is sufficient

13   advance in the prior art sufficiently inventive to

14   warrant patent protection.          And if the foreign country

15   is going to make that determination regarding

16   competition policy in its own borders, it's entitled to

17   make that determination.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let me ask you about a

19   domestic law question.       One side is telling us it's the

20   component that's supplied, whether it's the master disk

21   or the object code.     And the other side says this is

22   just like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template.

23   Can a blueprint be patented?            Can a mold be patented?

24                MR. JOSEFFER:         Not ordinarily.       I mean --

25   I'm sorry.

 7   think the most important point here is that the

 8   components of patented inventions do not have to be

 9   patentable.    Many patented inventions are comprised of a

10   bunch of parts where the parts themselves would not be

11   patentable because say they were standard off the shelf

12   parts.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, there can be a

14   process patent.

15                 MR. JOSEFFER:         Yes, and we don't -- I mean,

16   process patents, a process patent is a series of steps

17   or acts for performing a certain function, such as

18   turning rubber into a tire.             We don't think process

22   what the component is in this case.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:            The software is the

 2   component?

 3                MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, but the, the -- but

 4   like with anything, you could say a computer is also the

 5   component, but it's the actual computer, not you know,

 6   any copy of the same computer.

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But in this case, you're --

 8   but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or

 9   the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded

10   instructions are transferred.

11                MR. JOSEFFER:          Right.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you accept that?

13                MR. JOSEFFER:          The United States view -- I'm

14   not sure exactly how much we disagree on this -- but the

15   United States view is that, for example, a blank disk is

16   not a component of this invention because you don't need

17   a blank disk to practice this invention.                 The -- the

18   actual component is the physical substantiation, the

19   physical copy of the software that's inserted into a

20   computer and if you get a disk --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            In other words, the disk

22   plus the -- plus the coded instructions.

23                MR. JOSEFFER:          Yes.      And again the coded --

24   the software could be on a disk or it could be on some

25   other technology.    It doesn't matter how it --

 2   drive.

 3                 MR. JOSEFFER:         And once it's copied on to

 4   the hard drive, then the copy on the hard drive is

 5   itself a component.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I take it that we are

 7   operating under the assumption that software is

 8   patentable?    We have never held that in this Court, have

 9   we?

10                 MR. JOSEFFER:         No, but as I was saying

11   before --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So what should we do here?

13   Should, if we are writing this, since it's never been

14   held that it's patentable in this Court --

15                 MR. JOSEFFER:         I think if --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           If I were writing

17   something, should I say on the assumption that it's

18   patentable?    Since the issue isn't raised?

19                 MR. JOSEFFER:         No.      I think, I think the

20   reason that's not relevant here is that the patented

21   invention in this case is not software.                  It's computer

22   that has software loaded into it.                 And the components of

 1   copyright on a program?

 2                MR. JOSEFFER:           Ah, if you wrote it out, yes.

 3   If I wrote out a string of 1's and 0's I could copyright

 4   the strings of 1's and 0's that was -- that was written

 5   out on a piece of paper.           But the -- in terms of what

 6   the component is here, the other things --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can I ask you, the point I

 8   don't understand when you say the -- the component is

 9   the disk that contains material, I understand that

10   because here is a separate piece; it's a disk.                      You plug

11   it in; it has the information on it.                      But then you say,

12   if you put it on the hard drive it becomes the

13   component.     But the hard drive is not a separate thing

14   like a disk.     And when you say you put it on the hard

15   drive you have nothing there but -- but -- but ons and

16   offs.   You have nothing there but the -- but the

17   thought.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             How can you call, you know,

20   what?   Is it a separate section of the hard drive?                     No.

21                MR. JOSEFFER:           Well, you could go later in

22   and delete that software off the hard drive which

23   confirms that the software does have a separate physical

24   existence in there.       But the main point is that the --

25   the component is the, is the physical substantiation of

 1   the software.   The actual copy of the software.                It

 2   doesn't matter if it's on a hard disk; doesn't mean it's

 3   on a disk; it doesn't matter if it's in the air in

 4   wireless transmission.         It's just the physical copy of

 5   the software.   And you could have a situation where

 6   there are multiple copies of that same component in a

 7   computer.   One --

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:            If these -- if these

 9   computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows

10   installed, the component is the electrons on the hard

11   drive?   Is that what, that's your position?

12               MR. JOSEFFER:            It's the physical embodiment

13   of the software which in some instances is manifested by

14   -- by those electrons.         Now AT&T's contrary view is that

15   the abstract code in the abstract is the component.                  The

16   reason that can't be is that object code in the abstract

17   is just a series of 1's and 0's.                 In theory I could

18   memorize in my head or write down on a piece of paper.

19   But that's not going to combine with other, with other

20   parts to make a patented invention.

21               And if I could illustrate that with a simple

22   lock and key example, a key has a series of ridges on it

23   that enable it to open a lock.                And that series of

24   ridges can be denoted by a sequence of numbers, bigger

25   numbers for deeper ridges.            But the component is the key


                                         24

 1   that actually turns the lock, not the abstract sequence

 2   of ridges on the key.      And you can then say that about

 3   anything; you can always say that any physical product,

 4   any physical part, is a physical manifestation of its

 5   abstract design.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Is that analogous to the

 7   source and the compilation, the source being the design,

 8   the compilation being the key?

 9              MR. JOSEFFER:           No.      The source code and

10   object code are just different computer languages for

11   expressing the same thing.          There is no -- there's no

12   difference between them.         One is words and one is

13   numbers, but they mean the same thing.                  There is no

14   reason to treat them differently.

15              The point is just that if you treat the --

16   either the source code or the object code as the

17   component, that's just the design of the actual physical

18   software that goes into the computer.                   If you did that

19   you'd have a vastly different statute because any

20   physical part has a design, but the whole point of the

21   statute is to prohibit copying of parts in the United

22   States while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale

23   abroad.

24              But if the design itself was a component

25   then you could never copy parts abroad when something

 1   was designed in the United States, because something

 2   designed abroad would always infringe because the

 3   something designed abroad would itself be the component,

 4   and that would be a vastly different statute there's no

 5   reason to think Congress intended here, especially

 6   because of the extraterritorial consequences.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Windows wasn't around

 8   when this statute was passed.

 9              MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, the statute was enacted

10   in 1984 when software was certainly present.                It's fair

11   to say that Congress was not thinking of software, but

12   that's further caution for not expanding the statute

13   beyond traditional territorial reaches.                Because first,

14   this Court has cautioned, has said that it should be

15   cautious in applying existing electrical property

16   statutes to new technologies.            And in addition it's

17   emphasized in Deepsouth that the caution against

18   extraterritoriality applies in this very context.                So

19   Congress is writing against the backdrop of normal

20   territorial principles, which are the making, using or

21   selling inventions of foreign countries subject only to

22   foreign law, and against the backdrop of Deepsouth,

23   which has specifically held that Congress has to speak

24   clearly to enact of statute like this.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought it was the

 1   position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be

 2   brought into an electronic era, and so the -- the

 3   Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp

 4   deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that

 5   notion should apply to an electronic world.

 6                 MR. JOSEFFER:         Right.        And the reason that

 7   doesn't work in the statutory text and policies is that

 8   the component that we are talking about here is the

 9   specific part that goes in the machine.                  And if -- and

10   if -- and under the statute you have to let the company

11   send the design abroad to manufacture it abroad, both to

12   protect the company's ability to compete abroad and to

13   protect the foreign government's prerogatives.

14   Otherwise it's just a vastly different statute than the

15   one that Congress enacted.           That's really our terms of

16   the politics.

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Your time is up, but I

18   want to ask you one yes or no question.                  In your view is

19   software patentable?

20                 MR. JOSEFFER:         Standing alone in and of

21   itself, no.

 1                MR. WAXMAN:        Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it

 2   please the Court.

 3                There is no question that Microsoft supplies

 4   the Windows object code, that is the precise, machine

 5   readable sequence of commands that instructs a

 6   computer's processor.       From the United States, that is

 7   paragraph 7 of the stipulation.

 8                There is likewise no question that it does

 9   so with the intent that precisely the same sequence,

10   which runs to millions of lines of binary digits, will

11   be installed and stored -- those are Microsoft's

12   words -- in foreign computers precisely so that they may

13   practice AT&T's invention.

14                Those facts resolve this case because it is

15   thus entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of

16   the words of the statute to say that Microsoft has

17   quote, "supplied" a quote, "component" that when quote,

18   "combined with hardware" enables the practice of AT&T's

19   invention.   Now let's look at --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose I send someone to

21   the Patent Office --

22                MR. WAXMAN:        Excuse me?

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose I send someone to

24   the Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and

25   this patent is written very, very, very concretely and


                                        28

 1   specifically.   Gets on the phone, phones somebody in

 2   Germany and reads it to him.             And that person, having an

 3   excellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the

 4   precise instruction necessary to change the machine

 5   around or put various things into it.                    So now it is a

 6   precise copy of the machine in the United States.

 7               MR. WAXMAN:         That's not the --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             Is that -- how is that

 9   different from this?       How is it different?

10               MR. WAXMAN:         That is very different than

11   this case because what -- first of all, we all agree

12   that software code in and of itself, removed from a

13   physical structure, cannot be patentable and when

14   software -- when some -- when an invention that is

15   practiced with software is patented, at the most what

16   you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code

17   which is language that humans understand and which

18   computers do not.

19               A lot of work has to be done in items of

20   debugging and testing and compiling to create what is,

21   by stipulation, at issue in this case, which is the

22   precise, machine readable sequence that commands a

23   computer's CPU millions of times a second.                   Source code

24   would do nothing.    Source code has to be worked on

25   overseas.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no.          We have a genius

 2   -- we have, as they used to have to get all the stuff

 3   that we stole from England, with the -- with the --

 4   remember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners

 5   and so forth?    This genius comes over here; he looks at

 6   a really complex machine; it is now stored in his head,

 7   the precise details that nobody else could do.                     He runs

 8   back to Germany, and he builds it.                  Well, he has

 9   absolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex

10   details of this machine.

11                 MR. WAXMAN:       Well --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, does it matter, if

13   instead of sending the individual, we send the machine

14   to Germany.    This genius looks at it in Germany and

15   there he makes the copy.          Are they any different?

16                 MR. WAXMAN:       When you're talking -- when

17   you're talking about sending designs over or blueprints

18   or management instructions or a high level version of,

19   gee let's have a code that will perform the following

20   functions, and you have people design and make and

21   compile and test and debug that code overseas, of course

22   that component, the component is the object code, the

23   precise commands that reside in the computer and

24   continually interact with the hardware of the computer

25   in a way I'm going to describe and is not disputed,

 1   millions of times a second.

 2               Let's take this case.                 Okay.   Is it -- the

 3   question is, is it a component and whether what was

 4   supplied was in fact combined.               That's, that's -- that's

 5   what this case boils down to.              As to the component.

 6               We have something, software program, the

 7   NetMeeting and sound recorded program that can in its

 8   object, its machine readable command form, is developed,

 9   bought and sold entirely separately from any hardware

10   that it commands.

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:             And that is what is on

12   master disk.

13               MR. WAXMAN:         And that is what is either on

14   the master disk or, although either side obscures this,

15   that is what is represented in the electric --

16   electronic transmission, that is another means by which

17   the code is supplied.

18               And in paragraph 7 of the stipulation

19   Microsoft acknowledges that it supplies the Windows

20   object code by transmitting it to manufacturers

21   overseas.   And the way that happens is the code, the

22   machine language, is resident in Redmond, either in the

23   pits and lands of a CD or on the varying magnetic

24   orientations of a hard drive, and a, some engineer from

25   Microsoft presses a button and it is essentially, it is

 1   taken and converted into photons which stream whatever

 2   it is, 7,000 miles, under the land and under the

 3   Atlantic Ocean and emerges into a machine, a computer, a

 4   bit of otherwise inanimate parts that are sitting there

 5   in Dusseldorf, where it is loaded onto the hard drive,

 6   it's converted from photons to a series of electrical

 7   pulses.

 8                     JUSTICE STEVENS:               Is that really what

 9   happens?     As I understand it there is an intermediate

10   step.     They don't send it directly from the United

11   States to each of the individual computers in Germany.

12   They send it to a central point which then redistributes

13   it.     Is that not right.

14                 MR. WAXMAN:        Well, I think that paragraph 7

15   of the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the

16   other, but their case, Justice Stevens, depends upon the

17   following.     Because if I --

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            If you're correct that

19   they're just sending from New York direct to the 500

20   different machines all on one transmission from New

21   York, there's no lawsuit here.

22                 MR. WAXMAN:        Let me give you two examples --

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is that what you're trying

24   to tell us, that they do send it directly from New York

25   to 500 different recipients in Germany?

 1               MR. WAXMAN:        No, no, no.              And it wouldn't --

 2   what I'm saying is there is at least one violation of

 3   271(f) here.   271(f) looks exclusively at what is done

 4   in the United States.      It is entirely irrelevant to

 5   271(f) what, if anything, is done overseas.                   The Federal

 6   Circuit has made this clear in the Waymark case and it's

 7   consistent with the language.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would it be a violation if

 9   they sent, if they sent the golden disk abroad and

10   nobody ever copied anything off the golden disk?

11               MR. WAXMAN:        If they sent the golden disk

12   abroad or if the Microsoft engineer --

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would you answer my

14   question?

15               MR. WAXMAN:        I think I am.             The answer is --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If they send the golden

17   disk abroad and never use it, would that be a violation?

18               MR. WAXMAN:        If they had the necessary

19   intent and purpose.     They had to have had the specific

20   intent and purpose that it be combined in order to

21   create a device that wouldn't --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Suppose it is never, it is

23   never combined?

24               MR. WAXMAN:        It wouldn't matter.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:            So you -- and the reason it

 1   wouldn't matter on your view is that the component is

 2   the object code on the disk, not the disk itself?

 3              MR. WAXMAN:           That's right.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:               All right.        Then why

 5   doesn't that get you --

 6              MR. WAXMAN:           It could be --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why doesn't that get you

 8   right back to the point that Justice Breyer was making?

 9   You are saying, I think, in essence if you send a

10   blueprint -- this is like a blueprint.                    It tells, it

11   tells a machine which may be in Europe how to put the

12   object code on other disks or on hard drives.                    The

13   machine in Europe is following instructions just the way

14   an artisan would follow a blueprint.

15              MR. WAXMAN:           Here's the difference.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:               What is the difference?

17              MR. WAXMAN:           And it's nicely embodied in

18   Microsoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word

19   "antecedent."     A blueprint or a design is a precursor to

20   the actual device.      It is the instructions about how to

21   make something.     It's not the thing itself.                 And here

22   what we have is the object code that is the precise

23   commands that, unlike design information, interact

24   continuously with the hard drive and with the processor

25   in order to make physical changes on an ongoing basis.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but the "continuously"

 2   does not describe the process of going from the master

 3   disk to what you claim to be the infringing computer

 4   sold in Europe.     There is no continuous process there.

 5   As I understand it, what happens is -- let's just take

 6   the master disk and forget the photon for the moment.

 7   The master disk functions like a blueprint.                   They send,

 8   from the United States they send the blueprint to

 9   Europe.    The blueprint is put in some kind of a machine

10   in Europe.     And by the use of the blueprint the machine

11   puts electrical charges on a disk or on a hard drive,

12   and that it seems to me does bear out the blueprint

13   analogy.     And if it does, then any export of a blueprint

14   or indeed the simple export, the simple sending of the

15   '820, if that's the right number, patent in this case

16   would be a violation.

17                 MR. WAXMAN:        I have to disagree, Justice

18   Souter, because the blueprint -- the patent is not the

19   actual series of commands that runs the machine and

20   neither is the blueprint.            The blueprint is

21   instructions, to be sure, and it can be reflected in

22   intangible code, but it's instructions about how to make

23   something and once it's made it's done.                   You can say, as

24   Mr. Olson did, that the design is embodied in the thing

25   that is made.     The blueprint for a semiconductor chip in

 1   some sense is always reflected in that chip.                     But if you

 2   don't like the chip you have to get rid of it.                     Software

 3   can be -- if you don't like Microsoft Word, you can

 4   download it and you can delete it and download

 5   WordPerfect and use that.          And what happens in the

 6   computer -- and I think this does bear on what the

 7   nature of the component is and why in the ordinary sense

 8   of the word "component" and the ordinary sense of the

 9   words "supply" and "combine," they apply naturally to

10   what Microsoft does.

11               I mean, is a disk, is a typewriter, is a

12   screen, is a hard drive, is a CPU a component?                    Are they

13   components when they have the code embedded in it?                      Of

14   course.   But that doesn't -- a tire doesn't become not a

15   component of a car just because a tire with a wheel

16   attached to it is also a component.                     The question is --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But suppose, suppose you

18   had a machine that makes another machine, and if you

19   ship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for

20   the machine that makes it.          If you ship it to Europe and

21   it starts making another machine, the statute is not

22   violated; and isn't that just what's happening here?

23               MR. WAXMAN:        No, no, no.              This is not a

24   machine tool.   The thing that was violated, the machine

25   readable object code, is precisely what is installed on

 1   the computer and precisely what is moved from one part

 2   of the computer to another in different forms as the

 3   computer operates and it continually instructs.             This is

 4   dynamic.    It's not --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            How would you, how would

 6   you -- go back for a second, please, because, if you're

 7   finished with that, because I don't see how to decide

 8   for you without at the same time permitting a person to

 9   walk over to the Patent Office, to read that application

10   and the description, which after all at least can be a

11   very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make

12   a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just

13   like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in

14   Europe.    They then make it.           And that on your reading

15   would violate the statute.           It can't be right that that

16   would and you don't even think it would.

17                MR. WAXMAN:        I don't because --

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            And so what's the

19   difference between that and this case for you?

20                MR. WAXMAN:        Justice Breyer, there is a

21   long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes,

22   goes from high level system architecture to all the way

23   down through component architecture, pseudo code, source

24   code, which is, which is a description that humans

25   understand, and the actual machine language that a

 1   computer will understand.            Invention -- patents do not

 2   specify machine language.            The machine code is totally

 3   dependent on what type of processor it's relating to and

 4   somebody who takes source code -- I could make an

 5   argument that if you take, steal the Microsoft source

 6   code, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade

 7   secret of this country, it will not be sent overseas,

 8   but if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers

 9   and said, you know, convert this into, convert this into

10   something a computer will understand that will combine

11   with a computer, that involves a question of whether

12   what's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to

13   assembly.

14                 Look at it from the perspective -- maybe

15   this helps.     Let's look at the question from the

16   perspective of Microsoft, the OEM, and the user

17   overseas.     Object code is the end of Microsoft's

18   manufacturing process.         That is what they make.       They

19   don't make hard drives, they don't make disks, they

20   don't make computers.        They fully finish their product,

21   the Windows operating code, and then send it overseas.

22   The OEM is --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That, that code is not

24   patentable, you've said.

25                 MR. WAXMAN:        The code is not patentable.

 1   The expression is copyrightable.                 AT&T has not sought to

 2   get a patent on the code.            AT&T has a patent on a system

 3   that can be practiced, among other ways, through the use

 4   of software.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But what is it that they

 6   export and send overseas?

 7                 MR. WAXMAN:        They export in a variety of

 8   different physical forms --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Right, it's a thing.       It's

10   an object of some sort, isn't it?

11                 MR. WAXMAN:        It is an intangible sequence of

12   commands that is carrying --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It is an object that has

14   coded onto it, transferred to it in a readable way,

15   those commands.     But it's an object, isn't it?

16                 MR. WAXMAN:        Well, it's not necessarily an

17   object.    I don't know whether you would call a stream of

18   photons that is constantly repeated under the Atlantic

19   Ocean an object.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Waxman, this may,

21   this may help focus that question.                   Suppose the master

22   disks were made abroad.          You would be taking the same

23   position, would you not?

24                 MR. WAXMAN:        If -- that depends how it were

25   made.     If it were --

 1                   JUSTICE SCALIA:            I hope we can continue

 2   calling it the golden disk.             It has a certain

 3   Scheherazade quality that really adds a lot of interest

 4   to this case.

 5              (Laughter.)

 6              MR. WAXMAN:          Justice Ginsburg, the question

 7   is what is made.    If making it means somehow creating,

 8   reconfiguring the precise sequence of commands --

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               No.      That's given by

10   Microsoft to one of its offices in Europe.                 But the

11   golden disk itself is made abroad.

12              MR. WAXMAN:          If the, if the object code

13   itself, the very precise sequence that can't be changed,

14   is supplied from the United States --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes.

16              MR. WAXMAN:          -- the act is implicated.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So the only thing --

18              MR. WAXMAN:          Regardless of --

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The only thing supplied

20   is this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it

21   something else.    But anyway, it is the series of 0's and

22   1's; that's the only thing that's supplied from the

23   United States?

24              MR. WAXMAN:          That's right.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Any physical

 1   manifestation of it is done abroad.                    You would still be

 2   taking the position that you're taking, is that not so?

 3              MR. WAXMAN:        Well, yes, except that the

 4   intangible sequence of commands can only be carried in

 5   the form of, by attaching it to a physical platform or a

 6   bucket.

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but it doesn't have

 8   to be --

 9              MR. WAXMAN:        Even a radio wave.               Microsoft

10   has patent claims for software.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:            The physical object does

12   not have to originate in the United States.                   Can they

13   not transmit the commands to a physical object in

14   Germany and have that be the substitute for the golden

15   disk?

16              MR. WAXMAN:        Well, of course, and they do

17   that.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes.

19              MR. WAXMAN:        They press a button and they

20   have an electronic transmission that sends a stream of

21   protons under the Atlantic Ocean and are changed into

22   electrical impulses that are used to inscribe the

23   precise code onto a hard drive in the form of

24   electromagnetic pulses.

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that they now send to

 1   some central point which redistributes them.                   They send

 2   one copy to, say, the wholesaler, who then makes 500

 3   copies that are sent to the retail customers, isn't that

 4   correct?

 5               MR. WAXMAN:        That may be.             We don't --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Which is exactly what

 7   happens in this case?

 8               MR. WAXMAN:        It's one of the things that

 9   happens in this case.      We have a stipulated record that

10   is not very detailed, but in that instance there is only

11   one violation.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            My question is if that is

13   what happens, when the retransmission takes place when

14   one copy is converted into 500 how can those 500 all be

15   components rather than copies of the single component?

16               MR. WAXMAN:        Well, the only -- I have two

17   answers to that question, both of them I think directly

18   answering your question.         First of all, the statute is

19   violated only when the precise object code is

20   expatriated from the United States, when it is supplied

21   from the United States.        That's the violation.            The

22   other issues are damages, what damages are you entitled

23   to.   What is combined with the computer is the precise

24   thing that is supplied because it is the precise

25   sequence of commands.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But is there any precedent

 2   for that sort of thing?         That is, I understand your

 3   point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to

 4   come down to the fact that this very, very complex and

 5   detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set

 6   of numbers.    And I can understand how the patent

 7   application does not itself contain that set of numbers,

 8   but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate

 9   that set of numbers.

10                 But I then would be quite frightened of

11   deciding for you and discovering that all over the world

12   there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be

13   thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this

14   one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of

15   information themselves and alone become components.            So

16   I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field

17   analogous instance where the transmission of information

18   has itself been viewed as the transmission of a

19   component?

20                 MR. WAXMAN:       I'm not aware of any.     In the

21   lower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech

22   industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious

23   differences between what is supplied in terms of object

24   code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a

25   sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of


                                        43
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   nucleotides.     But I think we need to be quite precise

 2   here.   We are not complaining that the component is an

 3   idea.   We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a

 4   component is some form of information.                    What we're

 5   saying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of

 6   dollars from an idea.        When the commands are loaded onto

 7   the hard drive of a computer in the form of

 8   electromagnetic orientations and when you press a button

 9   saying give me NetMeeting, and the processor says -- and

10   this is what electrical engineers say -- fetch the

11   instructions, fetch the commands to the random access

12   memory where it's -- where it is there reflected in a --

13   in a form of patterns of electrical charges.                   And when

14   the code then moves back and forth, the instructions

15   move back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they --

16   they -- millions of times a second they are replicating

17   themselves.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, is it an answer to

19   Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no

20   conceptual problem saying there would be liability if

21   this happened within the territorial limits of the

22   United States?

23                 MR. WAXMAN:        Absolutely not.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And so there shouldn't be

25   a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   it abroad.

 2                 MR. WAXMAN:       That's --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, sure, there is.     It's

 4   a bigger --

 5                 MR. WAXMAN:       If I can, I just want to make

 6   sure I answer your question.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But it's totally different

 8   in that of course it violates the patent in the United

 9   States.   The whole question here is whether or not the

10   person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can

11   do or not do.    And the -- the concern that I'm worried

12   about is in the future it might be outside your field,

13   it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the

14   transmission purely of information is the transmission

15   of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see

16   in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction

17   and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create

18   other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri

19   dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that

20   detailed information abroad.             Then suddenly it's our

21   patent law and not the foreign patent law that would

22   govern.   That's why I asked for precedent.

23                 MR. WAXMAN:       Okay.        First of all, this

24   statute does not reach anything that is done overseas.

25   It doesn't reach what the German OEM does.               It doesn't


                                        45
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reach what anybody does overseas.               It -- it makes liable

 2   as an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the

 3   United States who supplies from the United States a

 4   component with the intent, with the express intent that

 5   that component be combined in a way to create a device

 6   that would practice a U.S. patent.                Now I don't believe

 7   -- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at

 8   issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions

 9   about what is or isn't a component.                    I might think that

10   a design is a component or it isn't a component, but

11   think of these three features:             One, this is something

12   that is totally modular.        It is developed, bought and

13   sold entirely independent of any of the hardware to

14   which it is, with which it is combined, and between

15   which it moves continuously as it operates.                   Number two,

16   it can be removed or updated entirely independently of

17   the other components.     And it is dynamic, unlike

18   designs, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to

19   make something, all of which are exhausted.                   They have

20   done their work when the thing is made.                   That's why

21   those things are called hardware.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            All right.          But --

23              MR. WAXMAN:        These are instructions not

24   about how to make something.           They are instructions

25   about what the other things that are made should do and


                                      46
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   how they do it.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:               You can perfectly well say

 3   that in this case.      You can say that the instruction is

 4   exhausted once the golden disk has sent its information

 5   through an intermediary machine onto the new disk that

 6   is made.

 7              MR. WAXMAN:           You could not say that because

 8   if you take the information from a golden master or a

 9   stream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless

10   that continues to move and change in form, the computer

11   will not work.    The computer operates by having you

12   press a button saying do this function.                     The central

13   processing unit then says where are my instructions on

14   how to do it.    It says find them and put them in random

15   access memory, where it is then replicated in the form

16   of patterns of electrical charges, quite a different

17   physical form than it exists on the hard drive.                     And the

18   program counter --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               That simply means that

20   after the -- the -- the -- the idea as you put it, has

 1   through an intermediary machine on its way ultimately to

 2   a working computer just -- and my only point is -- just

 3   the way you can say that the blueprint in effect is

 4   exhausted once the house has been built.

 5                MR. WAXMAN:        It's not because the blueprint

 6   has no further work to do.           It was something that --

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Sure.       You can use it

 8   again.

 9                MR. WAXMAN:        Something you teach, has no

10   further work to do with respect to the infringing

11   device, but the object code works continuously and gives

12   continuous instructions to the various hardware

13   components completely unlike.              But let me go to --

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            The object code has several

15   jobs.    One job when embodied on the golden disk is tell

16   a -- is to tell a machine how to make disks or how to

17   put a message on a hard drive.               Another job that the

18   object code has is when the object code gets on the

19   resulting disk or the hard drive.                 But in fact, the

20   manifestation of the object code on the golden disk and

21   the manifestation of the object code on the resulting

22   disk are separable, just as the blueprint is separable

23   from what is constructed.

24                MR. WAXMAN:        Justice Souter, just taking

25   your -- taking that as -- that as the case, the United

 1   States in footnote 2 of its brief repeats what Microsoft

 2   argued in the court of appeals and the district court,

 3   which is that if it took instead of one golden master,

 4   but 100,000 CDs, which is what a golden master is, one

 5   for each computer, that would be a 271(f) infringement.

 6   But that also requires copying and transforming the code

 7   that is on the CD-ROM which is in the form of physical

 8   pits and lands and indentations, and downloading it into

 9   the hard drive where the same exact sequence is

10   manifested as varying orientations of electronic,

11   electromagnetic fields, and that is no different

12   whatsoever than this case.

13                If you say, well, what destroys you in this

14   case is that the code has to be copied, replication,

15   precise instantaneous replication is simply how software

16   works.   It's not just how it's supplied.                 It's not just

17   how it's combined.      It's how it interacts dynamically

18   within the computer.        And that's why we say it's a

19   component.

20                Let me just be clear about what the

21   statutory interpretation question here is.                 It's not as

22   whether our conception of the component as the code --

23   as the -- as the command is better than their conception

24   of the component as a CD or a light wave or a telephone

25   wire that contains that.

 1               The question is, there may very -- it may

 2   very well be both things.           The question is whether the

 3   word component naturally applies to what we do.                 And our

 4   -- we have given dozens of references to the use of

 5   intangible software, program software as components.                    We

 6   have given you the dictionary definition with an example

 7   from Webster's.    They have not responded with one

 8   counter-example.   The only dictionary example they

 9   provide you relates to the word "such", and it's in

10   their reply brief on page 5.             But they have given you

11   not the first definition of such under Black, in Black's

12   Eighth, they have given you the second one.                 The first

13   one is, of this or that kind, she collects a variety of

14   things.   And that definition, under that definition it

15   wouldn't matter whether you said, well, the component

16   has to be physical or, you know, it could be either.

17   Because even if it has to be physical --

18               JUSTICE ALITO:           Can you think of any

19   machine -- can you think of any machine other than a

20   computer that has a component that is not a physical

21   thing?

22               MR. WAXMAN:         I can't.          And that's why it

23   seems to me, I mean -- and there are -- there are

24   machines that have nonphysical things in them but not

25   that operate in the sort of same dynamic way.                 We gave

 2   book.   And they give the example of, you know, an

 3   incredibly complicated series of circuits on a -- on a

 4   chip.   But those don't continue to operate and interact

 5   in the way that this paradigmatic component does.                 Thank

 6   you.

 9            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

10                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11               MR. OLSON:       Thank you, Justice Scalia.            I

12   mean Justice Stevens.

13               (Laughter.)

14               I was about to address Justice Scalia and

15   recite the case -- cite the case Nixon versus

16   Fitzgerald, which is directly responsive to the question

17   Justice Scalia raised at the very beginning of the

18   audience, that a stipulation with respect to damages

19   does not make a case moot.          And also with respect to a

20   question raised by Justice Scalia, or a comment made by

21   him, it doesn't have to be gold.               It's a master disk.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm sorry.

23               MR. OLSON:       What this essentially comes down

24   to is something that Mr. Waxman repeatedly said.                 It is

25   the commands that are a component.                 The commands to the


                                       51

 1   individual foreign made computers.                 Those are -- those

 2   commands cannot be understood and cannot be used by that

 3   computer unless they are in a physical medium that is

 4   created as a copy of the master disk that sends abroad

 5   -- that's sent abroad.

 6                As I said at the beginning, the stipulation

 7   is full of the word "copies", foreign replicated copies.

 8   That's what we're talking about here, something that is

 9   recreated.   And Justice Breyer, your question about

10   someone who's got a really good memory and can go abroad

11   and recite the 1's and 0's, pictures can be taken,

12   copies can be made in lots of different ways.

13                And in response to Justice --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           His answer to me is that --

15   that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if

16   it's just information, because it's really a method that

17   switches things at a level of detail that is impossible

18   to put in a patent application.              It's taking the

19   information in a patent application, it's transforming

20   it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not

21   really even 1's and 0's. What they are is things that

22   happen with electricity.

23                MR. OLSON:      That's right.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           And it's putting that on

25   the disk and then it makes other things happen.

 1               MR. OLSON:        I agree.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             It's putting something

 3   physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that

 4   are copied from the master disk and then put into either

 5   a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing.              It's

 6   something that is into the computer that will make the

 7   computer operate.

 8               You're right, Justice Ginsburg, that the

 9   court of appeals for the Federal Circuit thought it was

10   bringing this statute up to date and it even said so.

11   We are making an extension of the statute to keep up to

12   date with the technology.           That is not for courts to do.

13   This Court is --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Are you saying that the

15   infringement act that happened in the United States

16   involved no components?

17               MR. OLSON:        The infringement that happened

18   in the United States which was under Section B, which

19   provides Section B inducement liability for making

20   copies domestically of -- the same thing that happened

21   here.   Copies of the object code were put on physical

22   mediums and sent to domestic manufacturers.              Domestic

23   reproduction constitutes infringement under Section

24   271(b) but foreign reproduction is not a violation of

25   Section 271(a) or 271(b).           Hence, we're talking about

 1   the two sections where --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             So they had a license to do

 3   that, because if they didn't have a license to make the

 4   master disk here in the United States, the making of it

 5   would have violated the patent; is that right?

 6                MR. OLSON:        The making of the master disk if

 7   actually used in a computer with a microphone and a

 8   speaker, and that's the liability that existed in the

 9   stipulation under 271(a).            Making copies is liability

10   domestically under 271(b).            If it's going to be liable

11   for foreign made replications, then it must be under

12   271(f).   The language of the statute, we submit is

13   clear.    Physical things must be components under 271(f)

14   because they must be supplied from somewhere.               Ideas

15   have no physical from.         They're in the air.        The words

16   used, "supplied from" tells us that it must be a

17   physical thing combined with.               Ideas don't combine with

18   physical things to make a patented invention.               Physical

19   things do.    Thank you, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Thank you, Mr. Olson.     The

21   case is submitted.
