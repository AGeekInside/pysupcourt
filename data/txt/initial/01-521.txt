 3               CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:                We'll hear argument


 4   now on number 01-521, The Republican Party of Minnesota,


 5   et al., versus Verna Kelly.              Mr. Bopp.


 6                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,


 7                           ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER


 8               MR. BOPP:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


 9   the Court:     Like most states, Minnesota selects its judges


10   through periodic popular elections.                   And when candidates'


11   speech is severely restricted, the people are denied


12   access to the information they need to make an informed


13   choice.   While state court judges are different from other


14   elected officials, Minnesota's Announce Clause, as now


15   interpreted by its supreme court, goes too far resulting


16   in elections without campaigns.


17               QUESTION:        Could we find out from you just what


18   the Announce Clause prohibits that isn't already


19   prohibited by the Pledges and Promises Clause, as it's


20   been interpreted?


21               MR. BOPP:        Yes, Justice O'Connor.               The Announce


22   Clause prohibits, according the decision of the Eighth


23   Circuit, any general -- allows general discussions of the


24   law, while it prohibits any implying of how a person would


25   rule -- a candidate would rule, on an issue or case before


                                                3

 1   the Court.


 2                QUESTION:        How does that differ, then, from the


 3   Pledges or Promises Clause?


 4                MR. BOPP:        The Pledges and Promises Clause


 5   prohibits any pledge or promise that -- other than


 6   faithful performance of duties in office.                       The difference


 7   between "announce," the plain language of the clause, and


 8   "pledge or promise" -- "announce" is simply making known,


 9   is one of the formulations of the Eighth Circuit, or


10   implying; while "pledging or promising" is making a


11   commitment on how you would rule in a future case.


12                QUESTION:        But you think the Announce Clause,


13   even as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit to be the same


14   as the ABA canon, goes beyond that?


15                MR. BOPP:        Well, Your Honor, there is one aspect


16   of the current 1990 ABA canon that has -- was not


17   discussed by the Ninth Circuit or by the ABA brief.                               And


18   that --


19                QUESTION:        And where does that appear in your


20   brief?     Where is the ABA canon we're talking about?                            Where


21   is it?     I want to look at it while you're talking about


22   it.


23                MR. BOPP:        I do not have a reference to the ABA


24   canon, Your Honor.          I apologize.          The ABA canon states


25   that a -- the 1990 ABA canon states that a candidate may


                                                 4

 1   not make statements to commit, or appears to commit in


 2   deciding cases, controversies, or issues likely to come


 3   before the Court.       While the ABA and the Eighth Circuit


 4   seem to imply that the 1990 canon was similar, if not the


 5   same, as the 1972 canon, they did not discuss the


 6   difference between the words "announce" and "commit."


 7               "Commit," if you look in the dictionary, says


 8   "pledge."    And, thus, the 1990 canon appears to be more


 9   narrow under plain --


10               QUESTION:      Well, the Eighth Circuit did say that


11   it was -- that Minnesota's provision is the same as the


12   ABA canon, right?


13               MR. BOPP:      It did, Your -- it did, Your Honor.


14               QUESTION:      And the ABA canon prohibits


15   candidates, judicial candidates, from making statements


16   that commit or appear to commit a candidate.


17               MR. BOPP:      Yes.


18               QUESTION:      And that looks very much like the


19   Pledge or Promise language.            I -- I don't know how we


20   should interpret this.


21               MR. BOPP:      Well, one of the problems, Your


22   Honor, is that the January 29th opinion of the Minnesota


23   Supreme Court interpreting the Announce Clause adopted the


24   Eighth Circuit opinion and its interpretations.


25               QUESTION:      Right.


                                              5

             1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1             MR. BOPP:        Unfortunately, the Eighth Circuit had


 2   conflicting statements about the scope of the


 3   interpretation that it was announcing.


 4             QUESTION:        Well, you were -- you appear to be


 5   arguing, in your brief at least, that the Announce Clause


 6   is unconstitutionally vague.


 7             MR. BOPP:        Yes, Your Honor.


 8             QUESTION:        Is that your argument you're making?


 9             MR. BOPP:        Yes, we are.


10             QUESTION:        But did you make that argument below?


11             MR. BOPP:        Yes, we did, as to the interpretation


12   proffered in the district court, adding the words "likely


13   to come before the Court."            But where we are now, Your


14   Honor, is that the Eighth Circuit sua sponte added other


15   glosses to this canon, even though it was not advocated by


16   any of the parties.


17             QUESTION:        You didn't include a vagueness


18   challenge in your petition for certiorari, did you?


19             MR. BOPP:        Yes, we did.


20             QUESTION:        Is it in the question on which we


21   granted cert, do you think?


22             MR. BOPP:        No, but it is encompassed within the


23   violation of the First Amendment that we allege.


24             QUESTION:        But I wouldn't have thought vagueness


25   was a First Amendment issue.

 1             MR. BOPP:        Well, in the context of First


 2   Amendment protected speech, a -- something that chills


 3   First Amendment speech, because of -- it is a vague rule,


 4   and therefore does not provide a bright line necessary for


 5   the exercise of that speech, that it constitutes a First


 6   Amendment violation.


 7             QUESTION:        One of the statements of the Eighth


 8   Circuit -- and I don't have the citation to the brief; I


 9   have the citation to the Federal Third -- 247 F.3d 881. 


10   It says that the Announce Clause applies only to


11   discussion of a candidate's predisposition on issues


12   likely to come before the candidate if elected to office.


13             MR. BOPP:        That is one of the three


14   constructions.


15             QUESTION:        If we could -- would you agree that


16   that's perhaps the narrowest of the three constructions? 


17   I want to find what might be the most likely statement to


18   survive review and then have you discuss that, because I


19   take it that you would not be                -- you would not agree that


20   even that is constitutional.


21             MR. BOPP:        It is not the narrowest, Your Honor,


22   because it uses the word "issue."                There are other


23   formulations --


24             QUESTION:        Yes.


25             MR. BOPP:        -- in the Eighth Circuit case where


                                              7

                                   Alderson Reporting Company
             1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   they use the word "decide a case," such as on page 45a of


 2   the petition -- the petition appendix.                         It prevents


 3   candidates from, quote, "implying how they would decide


 4   cases," end of quote.            And they also, on page 52a of the


 5   appendix to the petition, say that, quote -- that the


 6   canon, quote, "applies only to discussions of a


 7   candidate's predisposition on issues," as you've quoted,


 8   and then finally concludes on page 53 with the statement


 9   that it prohibits candidates, quote, "only from publicly


10   making known how they would decide issues."                             So we have


11   conflicting interpretations of --


12              QUESTION:          Well, let's take the -- let's take


13   the last one.       I take it, if that were the authoritative


14   narrowing constructing that were before us, you would


15   disagree with its constitutionality.


16              MR. BOPP:          Yes, Your Honor.


17              QUESTION:          Would you agree that that would be a


18   constitutional standard if it were part of a code of


19   judicial ethics that applied to the judge after the judge


20   was on the bench?


21              MR. BOPP:          No, and -- but I believe that this


22   canon does apply to judges once they are elected and on


23   the bench.


24              QUESTION:          Well, are judges, after they are on


25   the bench, subject to, all of the same rights that they


                                             8

 1   have before they go on the bench, insofar as making public


 2   comments?


 3                MR. BOPP:      No, they may be limited in a number


 4   of different ways, Your Honor, that are necessary to


 5   advance compelling interests.


 6                QUESTION:      Well, why is it that, if an election


 7   is in July, the State can, under your view, not prohibit


 8   statements in June before he's elected, but they can


 9   prohibit the statements in August, after he's elected?


10                MR. BOPP:      Well, Your Honor, the First Amendment


11   applies -- has its most urgent application in campaigns


12   for election, and it is -- and while both judges and


13   judicial candidates may be limited in their speech, it has


14   never been held that simply announcing your views on a


15   disputed legal or political issue constitutes an


16   indication of partiality such that would justify, for


17   instance, recusal or disqualification.


18                QUESTION:      But I thought you said it would be


19   okay.   Then maybe I didn't understand your answer.                         I


20   thought you said that the kind of limitation that Justice


21   Kennedy referred to would be all right for sitting judges,


22   that you could prohibit sitting judges from letting their


23   views be known on any controversial issues.


24                MR. BOPP:      Well, then I misspoke, if that was


25   your understanding.

 1              QUESTION:        Like the incorporation doctrine or


 2   substantive due process and so forth --


 3              MR. BOPP:        Canon 4 --


 4              QUESTION:        -- you think you could prohibit


 5   judges from discussing those matters.


 6              MR. BOPP:        No.     Canon 4 -- and in fact, Canon


 7   4(b) of the Minnesota canons encourages judges to propose


 8   changes in the substantive and procedural law, even


 9   individually.


10              QUESTION:        Sitting judges -- sitting judges run


11   for election.      So whatever rights the contender would have


12   in an election, I assume that the sitting judge who was


13   running for reelection would have those same rights, in


14   your view.


15              MR. BOPP:        We believe that they should.


16              QUESTION:        Because the sitting judge could not


17   be restricted, could he or she, in a way?


18              MR. BOPP:        Well, sitting judges are restricted,


19   for instance, from commenting on pending cases that are


20   pending before them, quite properly.                  But here we are


21   talking about stating general views about the law.


22              QUESTION:        So sitting --


23              QUESTION:        You wouldn't object to candidates


24   being prohibited from commenting about particular cases


25   either, would you?

 1              MR. BOPP:        No, I would not.


 2              QUESTION:        I didn't take your objection to be


 3   that you say, you know, that there's a case pending in the


 4   courts, if I were appointed, I'll tell you how I would


 5   decide that case.        You --


 6              MR. BOPP:        We --


 7              QUESTION:        -- wouldn't permit that, would you?


 8              MR. BOPP:        We believe that that can properly 


 9   be --


10              QUESTION:        I thought you gave examples, or your


11   -- one of the briefs gave examples of commenting on


12   specific decisions that had been rendered by the Minnesota


13   Supreme Court, and you said that restraint on that comment


14   was impermissible.


15              MR. BOPP:        Yes.


16              QUESTION:        Am I not right?


17              MR. BOPP:        Yes.     That is our position.


18              QUESTION:        So you're making --


19              QUESTION:        That was a past case.               That was a


20   distinction you're making between past cases and pending


21   cases in the court that are likely to come before you if


22   you're elected.


23              MR. BOPP:        Yes, I -- the First Amendment


24   protects discussion of past cases.                 However, the Eighth

 4              QUESTION:        Well, supposing that -- supposing


 5   that Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court had


 6   announced that its Fourth Amendment was more protective


 7   than the federal Fourth Amendment and a candidate running


 8   for that court saw that several cases, the evidence had


 9   been suppressed in Minnesota courts, the defendant was


10   acquitted, so he said, "I think we should go back to the


11   idea that our Fourth Amendment is the same as the federal


12   Fourth Amendment."        Would that be permitted under this


13   rule?


14              MR. BOPP:        Under the Announce Clause?


15              QUESTION:        Under the Announce Clause.


16              MR. BOPP:        Not if it's considered implying how


17   you would rule in a future case.


18              QUESTION:        But do we know that -- do we -- is


19   there any mechanism for getting a clarification?                         And the


20   big problem in this case is this is a frontal attack, and


21   so we have no specific examples.                And you can say, "I


22   think this would fit, and I think that wouldn't fit."                           Is


23   there any mechanism in Minnesota for seeking


24   clarification?      For example, whether the Minnesota Supreme


25   Court's current rule is, indeed, the ABA's 1990 rule?

 1               MR. BOPP:       You can seek a private advisory


 2   opinion that is not binding on either the office or the


 3   board.   And petitioner Wersal sought such an opinion after


 4   suit was filed regarding other matters, and they declined


 5   to provide that advice.


 6               QUESTION:       Mr. Bopp, I would assume your answer


 7   would be that if it's too fuzzy for us to understand what


 8   it means in order to rule upon its constitutionality, it's


 9   also too fuzzy for a judicial candidate to know what it


10   means in order to conform his conduct to it and,


11   therefore, unconstitutional.


12               MR. BOPP:       Yes, sir, Your Honor, not only to


13   candidates, but this canon binds the family members, the


14   supporters of the candidate.              If they say anything that is


15   viewed to violate this construction -- this new


16   construction of this rule, then the candidate, him or


17   herself, is subject to discipline or removal from office.


18               QUESTION:       Well, I still want to make clear your


19   position.    Your position is -- is that the judge can,


20   after the judge's election, be disciplined, sanctioned for


21   certain remarks that he could not be sanctioned for before


22   the election.      Is that correct?


23               MR. BOPP:       No, Your Honor, and if I gave you


24   that impression, I apologize. 


25               QUESTION:       In other words, the rule --

 1                MR. BOPP:      I am not --


 2                QUESTION:      -- post and pre-election, the 


 3   rights --


 4                MR. BOPP:      The rule --


 5                QUESTION:      -- to speak are the same.


 6                MR. BOPP:      The rule is the same.               But I think


 7   the point I was making was that once a judge assumes


 8   office, there are restrictions on, for instance, his


 9   ability to discuss a pending case that is not imposed upon


10   a lawyer that is not involved in the case in any way.


11                QUESTION:      Well, do you claim --


12                MR. BOPP:      So then --


13                QUESTION:      All right.         Then your position is


14   that there is a difference as it applies to pending cases


15   as to which a sitting judge has to -- to which a sitting


16   judge has been assigned.


17                MR. BOPP:      Yes, there are specific ethical 
 --

18                QUESTION:      And --


19                MR. BOPP:      -- canons that apply in that.


20                QUESTION:      And that's all.


21                MR. BOPP:      And that's appropriate --


22                QUESTION:      Now --


23                MR. BOPP:      -- an appropriate limit.


24                QUESTION:      -- are there limits on what the


25   candidate can say?

 1               MR. BOPP:       Yes.     I --


 2               QUESTION:       And those are what?


 3               MR. BOPP:       It's in the realm of Pledges and


 4   Promises.    It would apply to candidates whether they're


 5   sitting judges or not, and that is that a candidate for


 6   judicial office shall not pledge or promise certain


 7   results in deciding a particular case or issue in a case


 8   without regard to the law or facts of the case.


 9               QUESTION:       Suppose he said, "There are a lot of


10   criminal cases pending," and, to take the Chief Justice's


11   hypothetical, "we've gone too far in interpreting the


12   Fourth Amendment, and I'm going to be more strict."                             In


13   your view --


14               MR. BOPP:       I think that's a --


15               QUESTION:       -- that could be prohibited.


16               MR. BOPP:       No, that is allowed, Your Honor,


17   because he's not promising certain results in a particular


18   case.   That is, again --


19               QUESTION:       He says, "I promise when these cases


20   come before me, this is what I'll do."


21               MR. BOPP:       Then that is a pledge or promise of


22   an outcome.


23               QUESTION:       And in your view, that can be


24   prohibited.


25               MR. BOPP:       Yes, because there is a --


                                              15

 1              QUESTION:        Well, I'm surprised you take that


 2   view.


 3              MR. BOPP:        Well, Your Honor, there is a public


 4   perception of the impartiality of the judiciary that I


 5   think properly can be taken into account.


 6              QUESTION:        Well --


 7              MR. BOPP:        And I think this rule announces a


 8   rule that is consistent with the judge's obligation to


 9   decide cases in accordance with his or her role.


10              QUESTION:        Well, that's an extremely fine line


11   you're drawing, it seems to me, because I think a moment


12   ago, in response to my question, you said that a candidate


13   would be prohibited, and wrongly prohibited, under your


14   view -- on your view of it and from saying that Minnesota


15   should adopt the federal Fourth Amendment standard rather


16   than the more liberal Fourth Amendment standard that the


17   Supreme Court of Minnesota hypothetically had it.                          You say


18   that a candidate ought to be allowed to do that, but he


19   isn't under the Minnesota rule?


20              MR. BOPP:        He is not, under the -- well, to the


21   extent that we know what the Announce Clause means --


22              QUESTION:        Yeah.


23              MR. BOPP:        -- with this conflicting formulations


24   under the Eighth Circuit opinion, talking about cases or


25   issues -- talking about, implying, or making known -- to

 1   the extent that we know the rule, it would appear that


 2   such a statement would be prohibited --


 3              QUESTION:          And you --


 4              MR. BOPP:          -- because it would imply what he


 5   would rule in the future.


 6              QUESTION:          And you say that the First Amendment


 7   prohibits that?


 8              MR. BOPP:          No, I'd say the First Amendment


 9   protects talking about prior decisions.


10              QUESTION:          What about --


11              MR. BOPP:          And one of the problems is we're


12   talking about the rule -- the Minnesota rule versus --


13              QUESTION:          Yeah.


14              MR. BOPP:          -- other proposed rules.


15              QUESTION:          But if --


16              QUESTION:          What about comment on a -- by a


17   candidate who is not yet a judge on a case which is then


18   pending before the court?               In your view, can the State


19   prohibit the candidate from saying, "I've been reading


20   about this case.         I know what the evidence is, and I


21   believe so and so should be convicted, and I think the


22   sentence ought to be the following."                       Could the State,


23   consistently with the First Amendment, prohibit that kind


24   of a comment?


25              MR. BOPP:          Well, there would seem to be, under

 3               QUESTION:        What's the answer to my question?


 4               MR. BOPP:        I think -- I think it could not be


 5   prohibited.


 6               QUESTION:        In the question that the Chief


 7   Justice asked, suppose the judge said, "I pledge and


 8   promise that if you elect me, I will vote in every Fourth


 9   Amendment case to restore the law to what it was."                           That's


10   a pledge and a promise, which I thought your argument


11   started out saying you accept that the pledge or promise


12   is a valid restriction --


13               MR. BOPP:        I do, Your Honor.


14               QUESTION:        -- that you can't go on that to the


15   Announce.    So suppose that instead of -- the Chief Justice


16   suggested, "I think it would be a good idea if the court


17   went back there" -- but if he said, "I pledge and promise


18   that I will vote that way" --


19               MR. BOPP:        That is a classic pledge and promise


20   that I think can be appropriated prohibited under the


21   First Amendment.


22               QUESTION:        As to issues and not as to particular


23   cases.


24               MR. BOPP:        As both to issues and cases.

 2              MR. BOPP:        Open minded.


 3              QUESTION:        -- persuaded by counsel that the


 4   views you've held your whole life over the incorporation


 5   doctrine, turn out to be wrong.


 6              MR. BOPP:        Yes.     And while judges certainly have


 7   views, and they announce these views in numerous different


 8   ways, if they are binding themselves not to have an open


 9   mind and to decide a case in advance, then that is a


10   violation of the oath, and that type of pledge or promise


11   should be and can be prohibited under the First Amendment.


12              QUESTION:        Is this different from that?                   That


13   is, I read through the Minnesota Bar Association's brief,


14   the ABA's brief, and portions of the Brennen brief.                             All


15   right?   They all suggested to me that this ethical rule,


16   like all ethical rules, is vague, interpreted by


17   interpretive opinions, of which there are many.                        I mean,


18   there are two pages of them in these briefs.


19              Now, as I understood it, it comes down to an


20   effort to do just what I did in my own Senate confirmation


21   hearing, to say, "I will try to reveal my judicial


22   philosophy.    I will try to stay away from anything that is


23   going to commit myself or appear to commit myself about


24   how to decide a future case."              All right.


25              MR. BOPP:        And I agree.

 1              QUESTION:        Now, if that's what they're trying to


 2   do -- do you agree that is what this is trying to do? 


 3   And, second, if that is what they're trying to do, why is


 4   that unconstitutional?


 5              MR. BOPP:        If it amounts to a pledge or a


 6   promise --


 7              QUESTION:        No, it doesn't.           I used the words


 8   that -- of the ABA brief.            I've used the words -- I'm


 9   referring to the briefs to call those arguments to your


10   mind.


11              What they say this comes down to is you cannot


12   commit yourself or appear to commit yourself as to how you


13   will decide a particular case or issue if it arises.                            But


14   you can, and there are two pages of this in the Minnesota


15   Bar brief.    I'm just trying to call that to your mind --


16              MR. BOPP:        Thank you.


17              QUESTION:        -- of all the things you can discuss:


18   judicial philosophy, character, this and that.                        There were


19   two pages of them, and they're all quotes -- in quotes. 


20   All right.    So, one, am I correct in my interpretation? 


21              MR. BOPP:        Yes.


22              QUESTION:        Two, if I am, why does the


23   Constitution forbid it?


24              MR. BOPP:        If the word "commit" means "pledge,"


25   then I think you're correct in --

 1                 QUESTION:        No, I told you what it means. 


 2   "Commit" means "commit."               We can't go more than the words


 3   "commit" or "appear to commit," other than to illustrate


 4   them by example.          And the Bar Association brief contains


 5   18 examples that have been given.                    They're all in quotes. 


 6   They come from an authoritative source.                       So that's where I


 7   am in what this means.              Am I right?         And if I am right,


 8   what's wrong with it?


 9                 MR. BOPP:        Well, Your Honor, what is wrong with


10   it --


11                 QUESTION:        But first, am I right, in your


12   opinion?


13                 MR. BOPP:        you're not right.            And what is wrong


14   with it is that the ABA suggested that "commit" means the


15   same thing as "announce."               And what I -- my course of my


16   argument is that "commit" means "pledge," and that, to


17   that extent, the ABA canon is different than the current


18   Announce Clause.          In fact, it's --


19                 QUESTION:        All right, so if you're saying the


20   word is "announce," and all these briefs and the bar


21   association are wrong when they say that means commit or


22   appear to commit, on that view, what should I do with this


23   case?


24                 MR. BOPP:        You should strike down the Announce


25   Clause, because it is impossible -- hopelessly impossible

 2   outside the rule.           That, and not only did the Eighth


 3   Circuit use different formulations of the rule that mean


 4   different things, in terms of its scope and application,


 5   but it also had exceptions to the rule, discussion -- a


 6   general discussion of case law or a candidate's judicial


 7   philosophy, but with the proviso that if you imply how you


 8   will rule in a particular case, then you have violated the


 9   rule.


10                 QUESTION:        And on an issue on a particular case.


11                 MR. BOPP:        An issue, including --


12                 QUESTION:        Can I just follow that up for one


13   second?     All right, now take the other assumption.                          Let's


14   assume that it does mean, as the ABA says, "appear" or


15   "appear to commit."            On that view of it -- and assume that


16   I'm right.       I know you think I'm wrong on that.                      Assuming


17   that I'm right --


18                 MR. BOPP:        With all due respect.


19                 QUESTION:        -- then is it constitutional, in your


20   opinion?


21                 MR. BOPP:        No, because of the "appear to commit"


22   language.


23                 QUESTION:        So you think the ABA can and is,


24   itself, unconstitutional.


25                 MR. BOPP:        As I interpret it, yes, because the


                                                 22

 1   "appear to commit" takes us back away from a bright line


 2   of a pledge or a promise into the realm of implying what


 3   you are saying.       And there --


 4              QUESTION:        What is the ABA's position on


 5   judicial elections?


 6              MR. BOPP:        They are not in favor of judicial --


 7              QUESTION:        I didn't think they were.


 8              (Laughter.)


 9              QUESTION:        But you're submitting this case to us


10   on the proposition that, under the First Amendment, a


11   judicial candidate can be subjected to restraints on


12   speech that other -- that are inapplicable to other


13   candidates.


14              MR. BOPP:        I believe that they can, Your Honor,


15   because judges have a dual role.                One role is to make law,


16   and particularly state court judges making common law, but


17   they also have a duty to decide cases impartially.                          So


18   while they are running for office, in order to respect


19   judicial impartiality, they should not be pledging to


20   violate the oath.        That is promising now how to decide a


21   case in the future when it comes before --


22              QUESTION:        Well, how does this play out with


23   sitting judges who write opinions saying, "In my view, for


24   example, I think the death penalty is unconstitutional"? 


25   There it is for everybody to see.                 And presumably in a


                                              23

 1   state like Minnesota, that judge will come up for election


 2   again or in another state for retention election.                         You


 3   don't think it's -- can that be prohibited --


 4             MR. BOPP:        No.


 5             QUESTION:        -- somehow?


 6             MR. BOPP:        No.     No, it may not.


 7             QUESTION:        And that judge has expressed a view


 8   that presumably the judge will follow in a future case.


 9             MR. BOPP:        But that is -- but that is different


10   from declaring or announcing that you have a closed mind


11   as to any future --


12             QUESTION:        No.     I don't know, if it's thoroughly


13   expressed.   Now, if the next case comes along involving


14   that very issue, can the judge be changed for bias?


15             MR. BOPP:        No.     No, you may not be recused, and


16   due process is not violated.


17             QUESTION:        But what if a candidate says not, "I


18   pledge that in every case I will say vote against the


19   death penalty," but, "I have real doubts about the death


20   penalty jurisprudence."           I mean, I don't think Minnesota


21   has a death penalty, but --


22             MR. BOPP:        No, it doesn't.


23             QUESTION:        -- let's assume it does.                "And I


24   think it probably should change."                Is that permissible


25   under this rule?      And if the rule says it's not

 1   permissible, is that statement protected by the First


 2   Amendment?


 3              MR. BOPP:          I'm sorry.           Under the Minnesota rule


 4   or my rule?


 5              QUESTION:          Under the Minnesota rule.


 6              MR. BOPP:          It -- well, it's very difficult to


 7   know, Your Honor.


 8              QUESTION:          Okay, well, under your rule.


 9              MR. BOPP:          Under our rule, it would be allowed. 


10   And, in fact, judges are encouraged to do -- make


11   proposals just like that under these canons.


12              QUESTION:          Now I don't understand what you say


13   the Minnesota rule is.             I would have thought your answer


14   would be, "That's probably okay under the Minnesota


15   rules," because he only says probably -- "I think it's


16   probably, you know, unconstitutional."


17              MR. BOPP:          Under the Minnesota rule if you


18   simply imply how you might rule --


19              QUESTION:          Well, it doesn't.                It says, "I have


20   doubts about it," according to the Chief Justice, "I have


21   doubts about it."          I think that doesn't necessarily imply


22   -- but I thought --


23              MR. BOPP:          Well, it's --


24              QUESTION:          I thought --


25              MR. BOPP:          It's hard to know.

 1             QUESTION:        But I thought that your position with


 2   regard to judicial opinions is -- is that it is perfectly


 3   okay for a sitting judge to make known to the public his


 4   view on something like the death penalty when he does it


 5   in an opinion and, therefore, that can be out there.


 6             MR. BOPP:        Yes, it is --


 7             QUESTION:        Subject to criticism, indeed.


 8             MR. BOPP:        Yes --


 9             QUESTION:        But somebody who's running against


10   him in an election cannot let be known what his view is on


11   the death penalty.


12             MR. BOPP:        It is perfectly appropriate for a


13   judge to do that in an opinion or in speeches or a law


14   review article.


15             QUESTION:        In speeches?          You mean the judge


16   could go out and -- a sitting judge can go out and make a


17   speech and say, "In the next death penalty case to come


18   before me, I'm going to vacate.               I'm going to vote to


19   vacate the death penalty.           I don't care what the argument


20   is."


21             MR. BOPP:        Then not that statement.                If he made


22   that statement, he'd be subject to recusal and a proper


23   application of --


24             QUESTION:        Okay, well --


25             MR. BOPP:        -- the pledge rule.

 1                QUESTION:      Okay.      Well, then what he can say in


 2   speeches certainly is less than what he can say in a


 3   judicial opinion in which he says, "I vote to vacate the


 4   death penalty because I believe it's unconstitutional."                             I


 5   mean, there's some line between them.


 6                MR. BOPP:      Yes, I would think he would.                   He


 7   does, Your Honor.        And may I reserve the balance of my


 8   time?


 9                QUESTION:      Very well.         Mr. Gilbert, we'll hear


10   from you.


11                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. GILBERT


12                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


13                MR. GILBERT:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


14   please the Court:        I would like to take the opportunity to


15   try to clarify some of the questions and answers that have


16   been provided as to what the construed rule in Minnesota


17   means.   And I refer the Court to page 53a, of the cert


18   petition appendix, where the Eighth Circuit stated the


19   definitive narrow construction of this rule which says


20   that the rule only prohibits candidates from --


21                QUESTION:      Whereabouts on the page?


22                MR. GILBERT:        The beginning of the second


23   paragraph, Your Honor.           It only restricts judicial


24   candidates from publicly making known how they would


25   decide issues likely to come before them as judges.                             That


                                              27

 1   is the narrow construction of this Eighth Circuit opinion. 


 2   That is the construction that's being applied by the two


 3   boards that I represent, and that is the construction that


 4   has been incorporated in an authoritative order by the


 5   Minnesota Supreme Court.


 6                 QUESTION:        What about the example I posed to


 7   your opponent?         Someone says, "I think the Minnesota


 8   Supreme Court's ruling on the Fourth Amendment, the state


 9   Fourth Amendment being broader, is wrong, and I -- if you


10   will elect me as a judge, I would try to change that


11   around."


12                 MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, this is where the


13   record is very clear as to what Mr. Wersal has done.                               And


14   in response to your question, the candidate could


15   criticize a prior decision of a judge, but could not say


16   as to a future case how that candidate would decide the


17   case.   And that's precisely --


18                 QUESTION:        So let me put that to the test.                     If I


19   say, "I think the decision of the Supreme Court of


20   Minnesota two years ago saying that the Fourth Amendment 


21   -- state Fourth Amendment protected more than the federal


22   Fourth Amendment is wrong," he could do that, but he


23   couldn't say, "If you elect me to the Supreme Court, I


24   would carry out my view."


25                 MR. GILBERT:          Well, that would be a future case. 


                                                 28

 1   And there's other considerations --


 2               QUESTION:       Well, he told me he couldn't even


 3   say, "I think that opinion is wrong.                  And that is not my


 4   position concerning the meaning of the Fourth 


 5   Amendment" --


 6               MR. GILBERT:         Your Honor --


 7               QUESTION:       -- "in Minnesota."


 8               MR. GILBERT:         That's not correct, Your Honor. 
 I

 9   refer you to the record in this case and what Mr. Wersal


10   has said in his literature.             If you look at the first


11   volume of the Joint Appendix, pages 34 to 38, as well as


12   pages 86 to 91, they contain the actual statements that


13   Mr. Wersal made as part of his campaign.


14               QUESTION:       What pages?


15               MR. GILBERT:         30 -- let's see -- 34 to 38, and


16   86 to 91.    And look what he said.               First of all, he talked


17   about his judicial philosophy.                He has said that he can't


18   talk about his judicial philosophy.                  He did.       He said,


19   "I'm a strict constructionist," and he criticized the


20   Minnesota Supreme Court for being a judicial activist. 


21   But more --


22               QUESTION:       What does that mean?              I mean, that's


23   so fuzzy, that doesn't mean --


24               MR. GILBERT:         Well, but --


25               QUESTION:       -- that doesn't mean anything.                      It


                                              29

 1   doesn't say whether you're going adopt the incorporation


 2   doctrine, whether you believe in substantive due process. 


 3   It is totally imprecise.               It's just nothing but fluff.


 4                 MR. GILBERT:          And candidates can say that.                   And


 5   that's the point.


 6                 QUESTION:        Can they say anything more than


 7   fluff?


 8                 QUESTION:        Can they say anything that has any


 9   meaning?


10                 MR. GILBERT:          Absolutely.         And what they can do


11   -- look at what Mr. Wersal --


12                 QUESTION:        But what about my example?


13                 MR. GILBERT:          Your example, Your Honor, the


14   candidate can, as Mr. Wersal did, criticize a prior


15   decision of the Court.              And that's very clear from what


16   has happened in the Wersal case.                   What the candidate


17   cannot do is say that, "If I'm elected, I'm going to


18   overturn that decision."


19                 QUESTION:        Does that dichotomy make any sense at


20   all?


21                 MR. GILBERT:          Well, it does in the sense, Your


22   Honor, that there's different dynamics involved once a


23   judge is elected and has to overturn a decision that's


24   already precedent in the State of Minnesota.


25                 QUESTION:        So a candidate says, "This is the


                                                 30

 1   worst decision that's come down since Dred Scott, it's a


 2   plague on our people, it's an insult to the system, but


 3   I'm not telling you how I'll vote."


 4               (Laughter.)


 5               MR. GILBERT:         Your Honor, that's the point.


 6               QUESTION:       It's more than that.              You assert that


 7   that does not, within the language that the Supreme Court


 8   has adopted, it does not imply how he will vote on that


 9   issue at a future date.           He says, "It's the worst case


10   we've ever done."        That doesn't imply how he's going to


11   vote on it?


12               MR. GILBERT:         Well, that might well imply


13   whether he's going to overturn it.                 But what the candidate


14   can say and what Mr. Wersal said -- if you look at the


15   criticism that he leveled at these decisions of the


16   Minnesota Supreme Court, he said just as you indicated,


17   Justice, that, "These decisions are" --


18               QUESTION:       What are you reading?               Where are you


19   reading from?


20               MR. GILBERT:         If you look at pages -- page 36,


21   for example, of the -- this is of the Joint Appendix -- he


22   says, on abortion, "The Court ordered the State must use


23   welfare funds to pay for abortion despite state law to the


24   contrary.    The dissenting judge remarked," et cetera. 


25   This is under the topic of "Examples of Judicial


                                              31

 1   Activism."     But then he goes into greater detail on page


 2   38.


 3                QUESTION:      But is the statement at page 36 that


 4   you read -- is that proscribable under the State's rule?


 5                MR. GILBERT:        No.    And that's the point.               What


 6   has happened here, Your Honor, is that there was a


 7   complaint filed against Mr. Wersal for all of this


 8   campaign material.        And the then-director of the Lawyers


 9   Board, Marcia Johnson, in an opinion, on pages 20 and 21


10   of this appendix, said that the statements made by Mr.


11   Wersal are not proscribable.              And that's even before the


12   rule is narrowed.


13                And if you look at page 21, the executive


14   director said specifically that Mr. Wersal can criticize


15   prior decisions of the Court.              And that's consistent with


16   what the Board on Judicial Standards did in --


17                QUESTION:      What do you say --


18                QUESTION:      May he also, at the same time as they


19   criticized the decision, say, "I do not believe in stare


20   decisis"?


21                MR. GILBERT:        Yes.     He can't, because that 


22   is --


23                QUESTION:      Well, then isn't he saying how he's


24   going to rule on the case then?


25                MR. GILBERT:        Well, Your Honor -- it might be,


                                              32

 1   Your Honor.   People might be able to imply from it, but


 2   it's still -- the distinction is --


 3             QUESTION:        Might be able to imply that I don't


 4   believe in stare decisis and I think this case is wrong.


 5             (Laughter.)


 6             QUESTION:        Pretty clear, I think.


 7             MR. GILBERT:          No, and I understand what you're


 8   saying, Your Honor.        The distinction that's made, if you


 9   look at all the cases that have dealt with this issue, is


10   a distinction between past cases on one hand and then


11   pending and future cases on another.


12             QUESTION:        As long as you're silent on your


13   views on stare decisis, that's a fine distinction.                         But if


14   you do reveal your views on stare decisis, that


15   distinction is meaningless.


16             MR. GILBERT:          Perhaps.       There could be other


17   issues that come up in terms of a case that would be a


18   vehicle to overturn particular decisions -- standing,


19   things of that kind.


20             QUESTION:        So now you're saying there's a


21   distinction between issues and cases.                  And I'm saying


22   you're categorically stating your view about a particular


23   issue, as the Chief Justice's example states, and you also


24   categorically state, "I think stare decisis has no place


25   in constitutional adjudication."               Can he do that?

 1              MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, again, the -- no,


 2   under the State's interpretation of the rule.                       And I


 3   understand your point.           It is a fine distinction.                 But


 4   what the State is trying to do is protect the integrity of


 5   the judiciary at that point.              And to the extent --


 6              QUESTION:        This protects its integrity?


 7              MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, we think so.                And the


 8   reason for that is that --


 9              QUESTION:        I mean, it's just a game.                 It's just


10   a dance, you know --


11              MR. GILBERT:          Well, this is --


12              QUESTION:        -- I don't say anything about stare


13   decisis and it's okay.           If I say something about stare


14   decisis, it's not okay?


15              MR. GILBERT:          Well, again, Your Honor, I


16   understand the hypothetical.              This is a hypothetical that


17   is kind of on the fringe.            I would agree with you.                But at


18   the same time, most of the situations are going to be


19   clear, are going to be --


20              QUESTION:        Well, it is such a problem to know


21   exactly what the provision covers now.                   It isn't clear to


22   me.   And what we end up with at the end of the day is a


23   system where an incumbent judge can express views in


24   written opinions, and perhaps otherwise, as well, and yet


25   a candidate for that office is somehow restricted from


                                              34

 1   discussing the very same thing in the election campaign. 


 2   That's kind of an odd system, designed to what?                         Maintain


 3   incumbent judges, or what?


 4               MR. GILBERT:          No, it's not, Your Honor.                 In


 5   fact, that is not correct in terms of the effect of that


 6   situation.     Again, if you look at page 20 of the Joint


 7   Appendix, what the executive director of the Lawyers Board


 8   has said is that an incumbent judge can criticize the


 9   prior decision of that sitting judge.                    So that the


10   challenger actually has greater opportunity than an


11   incumbent judge, because an incumbent judge has a record


12   of decisions.


13               QUESTION:        Do you -- you misspoke, I think.                     You


14   meant the challenger --


15               QUESTION:        You did --


16               MR. GILBERT:          The challenger.           I'm sorry.


17               QUESTION:        -- the challenger, who is not a


18   judge, can criticize the specific decision of the judge


19   who wrote it.


20               MR. GILBERT:          That's correct, Your Honor.


21               QUESTION:        So they're equally free at the least


22   to discuss the specific past cases.


23               MR. GILBERT:          At the least.          And I would submit


24   that the challenger is in a better situation because of


25   the --

 1              QUESTION:        All right.         Can I ask you this


 2   question --


 3              MR. GILBERT:          Yes.


 4              QUESTION:        -- because I understand that -- I


 5   have two questions, really.              One is the line that's being


 6   -- that you're trying to draw, everyone would concede is a


 7   very difficult one to draw, but it is the line that I


 8   tried to draw.


 9              MR. GILBERT:          Yes.


10              QUESTION:        Now, what would happen if, instead of


11   my being in the Senate, I had been in an election


12   campaign, and I was trying to draw this very line between


13   commitments to future cases, specific ones, and general


14   judicial philosophy.         And suppose my opponent, after,


15   said, "Breyer made a mistake.              He didn't get it right,"


16   but I was in good faith.            What could happen, or would


17   likely happen, to me under this rule?


18              MR. GILBERT:          As a -- I'm sorry, as a sitting


19   judge, Your Honor?


20              QUESTION:        Well, I then -- suppose I won.                      Fine. 


21   I've won the election.           My opponent -- what I'm trying to


22   understand is what are the consequences?                     It is, after


23   all, an ethical rule, and ethical rules are often blurry.


24              MR. GILBERT:          Yes.


25              QUESTION:        And I want to know what would likely

 2   very fine line, assuming that it's in good faith.


 3             MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, the Board on Judicial


 4   Standards or the Lawyers Board would have jurisdiction


 5   with respect to a violation which sounds like a technical


 6   violation, as you describe it, and could impose some


 7   discipline, but I would suspect that discipline would be


 8   very minute, if at all --


 9             QUESTION:        Could a state --


10             MR. GILBERT:          -- under those circumstances.


11             QUESTION:        -- make a violation of the provisions


12   you described a criminal offense?


13             MR. GILBERT:          No, Your Honor.           These are not


14   criminal statues.


15             QUESTION:        But could a state do it under the


16   First Amendment?      Is there any authority you have for the


17   proposition, that can -- a state can impose a civil


18   sanction, but not a criminal sanction?


19             MR. GILBERT:          I'm not aware of any authority


20   that would allow a criminal sanction for such a thing.


21             QUESTION:        Can I ask you one other question?


22             QUESTION:        That's not my question.                Is there any


23   authority that a state, under the First Amendment, is free


24   to impose a civil sanction but not a criminal sanction on


25   particular speech?

 1             MR. GILBERT:          I'm not aware of authority to that


 2   effect either, no.


 3             QUESTION:        This is a technical question, but the


 4   sentence you started out reading from the Eighth Circuit's


 5   opinion is not identical to the ABA canon.                     And obviously


 6   if this rule differs from the ABA canon and is stricter,


 7   one could say there's a less restrictive alternative,


 8   namely the ABA canon.         And so I'm quite concerned about


 9   how to deal with that problem.               Do I assume that, in fact,


10   Minnesota does mean it's indistinguishable from ABA canon,


11   which is what the ABA says?            Or what your opponent says? 


12   How do I deal with that?


13             MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, our position is, just


14   as the ABA indicated, that our rule is the functional


15   equivalent of a commitment clause.


16             QUESTION:        The Minnesota Supreme Court turned


17   down the ABA rule, the ABA rule -- we're talking --


18   they're both ABA rules.          Minnesota now has on its books


19   the 1972 rule.     The 1990 rule is the one that you said is


20   the functional equivalent of the current rule.                       And yet


21   the Minnesota Supreme Court considered and turned down


22   that rule.   So that's one of the aspects of this case that


23   makes it very fuzzy.        The court that turned it down now


24   says, "We agree with the Eighth Circuit."                    And you're


25   telling us that the Eighth Circuit has adopted,

 1   essentially, the ABA's current rule.


 2             MR. GILBERT:          Yes, Your Honor, and that is the


 3   case, and you are right.           Back in 1995, there was


 4   discussion of adoption of the commit clause by the


 5   Minnesota Supreme Court.           It did not occur at that time. 


 6   There has been a lot that has evolved over the last seven


 7   years, Your Honor, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has


 8   made the decision in its January 29th, 2002, order that


 9   this construction by the Eighth Circuit is the


10   construction that they are going to place on their clause.


11             QUESTION:        Whatever that is.


12             MR. GILBERT:          Well, this construction, Your


13   Honor, is, for all practical purposes, identical to the


14   commitment clause.       And --


15             QUESTION:        Mr. Gilbert, may I ask --


16             MR. GILBERT:          Yes.


17             QUESTION:        -- a question based on what you said


18   about stare decisis?        You say -- have said consistently


19   you can discuss your judicial philosophy.                    Well, why


20   wouldn't one's position on stare decisis fall under


21   judicial philosophy?


22             MR. GILBERT:          I think it would, Your Honor.


23             QUESTION:        So that -- so you're changing back


24   then, because you said a while ago that stare decisis --


25   if you said, "I think that decision about the Fourth


                                             39

 1   Amendment was wrong, and I don't believe in stare


 2   decisis," you said you couldn't put those two together.


 3               MR. GILBERT:         Your Honor, you can put them


 4   together.     I think the question was, could someone then


 5   conclude from that what the ramifications would be if that


 6   particular candidate came to the Supreme Court, for


 7   example, on what the candidate would do with respect to


 8   that decision -- whether the candidate would overturn or


 9   not.


10               QUESTION:       And your answer was it would imply


11   how he's going to vote and, therefore, would not be --


12               MR. GILBERT:         Again --


13               QUESTION:       -- would not be acceptable, right?


14               MR. GILBERT:         Yes, Your Honor, with the


15   distinction being to protect the integrity of the


16   judiciary.


17               QUESTION:       Well, let me ask about that.                   You


18   know, in evaluating whether a state has demonstrated the


19   kind of significant interest necessary to abridge speech,


20   it seems to me we have to look at the entirety of the


21   state law to see what interest it's pursuing.


22               I, frankly, am absolutely befuddled by the fact


23   that Minnesota wants its judges elected -- that's its


24   constitutional provision -- and then enacts statutory


25   provisions that are intended to prevent the electorate


                                              40

                                    Alderson Reporting Company
              1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   from knowing, even by implication, how these candidates


 2   are going to behave when they get on the bench.                       It seems


 3   to me a total contradiction.             And, indeed, it looks to me


 4   like a legislative attempt to simply repeal Minnesota's


 5   constitutional provision providing for the election of


 6   judges, which is a neat and easy way to get rid of it if


 7   you can't do it by plebiscite.


 8               Why does it make any sense to vote for a judge


 9   in an election, a judge who is not able, even by


10   implication, to tell the electorate what kind of a judge


11   he would be?


12               MR. GILBERT:        Well, but, Your Honor, that's the


13   fallacy in that statement, is that a candidate can tell


14   the electorate what kind of candidate they are.                       The only


15   thing that the candidate cannot say -- it's a very limited


16   restriction -- and that is, how I am going to decide a


17   future case.


18               QUESTION:      Not a particular -- well, no, not


19   just a future case, a future issue -- any, not a


20   particular case, but any issue --


21               MR. GILBERT:        And --


22               QUESTION:      -- how I will vote on the Fourth


23   Amendment situation, how I will vote on the incorporation


24   doctrine.    I can understand your saying, he shall not


25   commit himself, "I promise to vote this way."                      No judge


                                             41

 1   should do that.      He should be able to be persuaded that


 2   he's been wrong.      But to say that my current view is that


 3   the Fourth Amendment should be just like the federal


 4   Fourth Amendment, and stare decisis in constitutional


 5   matters is not a doctrine that I think is very strong --


 6   it seems to me you ought to be able to say that.


 7             MR. GILBERT:          And they can say that.               I think


 8   the difference of opinion we have here is whether they can


 9   go the extra step and just say, "And I would try to


10   overturn the decision if I'm elected."


11             QUESTION:        Well, if that --


12             MR. GILBERT:          I have to --


13             QUESTION:        -- if that indicates a


14   disqualification or a lack of temperament for the bench,


15   the voters can decide that.            The bar association and the


16   judges can come out and say, "We have a candidate running


17   who doesn't have the right judicial temperament," and the


18   voters decide.     That's the way elections work.


19             MR. GILBERT:          They can do that, but I submit to


20   you, what happens if that judge wins?                  What happens if

22   who has prejudged that case?


23             QUESTION:        Well, I suppose the people have said


24   what kind of judges they want.


25             MR. GILBERT:          Oh, and it's all of a sudden

 2                QUESTION:      Why is that any worse than litigants


 3   who come before a judge who's already sitting and who has


 4   said in a prior opinion that he thinks the Fourth


 5   Amendment in Minnesota should be interpreted the same way


 6   the federal Fourth Amendment is?                Why --


 7                MR. GILBERT:        Because in --


 8                QUESTION:      -- is that any different?


 9                MR. GILBERT:        Because in a prior opinion, due


10   process was accorded, because the judge actually heard the


11   argument of the litigants, heard the facts and the


12   applicable law.


13                QUESTION:      You mean a judge can't have an


14   opinion without hearing from all sides and going in briefs


15   and so forth?


16                MR. GILBERT:        Absolutely.


17                QUESTION:      Well, what if -- even if he gives a


18   speech, does he have to first have this sort of vetting?


19                MR. GILBERT:        Not at all, Your Honor.               The only


20   -- again, the limited restriction here is that the -- a


21   judge cannot -- I'm sorry -- a judicial candidate cannot


22   prejudge a future case, cannot say, "I think this statute


23   over here is unconstitutional," or, "I think, in consumer


24   fraud cases, that anybody who wins is entitled to punitive


25   damages."

 1              QUESTION:        So you don't trust the electorate in


 2   Minnesota to decide whether a judge has a judicial


 3   temperament.     You wish us to depart from the usual


 4   philosophy --


 5              MR. GILBERT:          Again --


 6              QUESTION:        -- that we do not allow the State to


 7   presume that the public is better off not having complete


 8   information.


 9              MR. GILBERT:          Well --


10              QUESTION:        Maybe we should know about this


11   judge's temperament.         And if he spouts off on all sorts of


12   issues, we say, this is not the kind of judge we want.


13              MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, again, this is a


14   balance that's being struck.              There's competing interests


15   here.   There's the First Amendment interest that we're all


16   familiar with.      There's the due process interest of


17   individual litigants.          There's the compelling governmental


18   interests that the State has in ensuring the integrity of


19   the judiciary, both in terms of the actual integrity and


20   the perception of it.          And that's why this limited


21   restriction is appropriate.


22              QUESTION:        Maybe you shouldn't have judicial


23   elections if the last is a significant State interest.


24              MR. GILBERT:          Well, Your Honor, that's --


25              QUESTION:        To the degree that you're making it a

 1   significant State interest here.               See, I just question


 2   whether it is a significant State interest, because you


 3   have a constitution that says, "We're going to have


 4   judicial elections."        Now, that may be a very bad idea,


 5   but as long as that's in your constitution, I find it hard


 6   to believe that it is a significant State interest of


 7   Minnesota to prevent elections from being informed.


 8             MR. GILBERT:          Well, again, Your Honor, we're


 9   trying to weigh the different interests.                    I am sure you


10   wouldn't suggest that the State doesn't have a compelling


11   interest in the integrity of the judiciary, and that is a


12   competing interest that is being weighed here, and that


13   results in the commitment clause that the ABA has adopted


14   and the parallel provision that has been construed


15   narrowly by the Eighth Circuit, which, again, only forbids


16   or prohibits a judge saying, "I'm going to decide this


17   particular issue this way in the future."


18             QUESTION:        So you're saying the public doesn't


19   know enough in order to determine whether a judge has the


20   requisite qualifications for office.


21             MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, I'm not saying that


22   the public knows or doesn't know.                The concern is what


23   happens if that candidate is elected, and then you or any


24   other litigant comes before that candidate, who is now a


25   judge, and tries to litigate the issue that the judge has


                                             45

 2                QUESTION:        Well --


 3                MR. GILBERT:          How fair is that?


 4                QUESTION:        My goodness, we -- I think we have 


 5   -- I will say present company excluded -- I know we have


 6   had judges on this Court who have answered questions about


 7   particular legal issues to the Senate confirmation


 8   hearing.     Are you saying that those judges were


 9   disqualified from sitting in cases in which that issue


10   would later come up?


11                MR. GILBERT:          No, Your Honor, I'm not.                And


12   actually, I'm surprised to hear that.


13                QUESTION:        Is it -- oh.          It's --


14                MR. GILBERT:          I am surprised to hear that, in


15   light of the testimony that is in our brief and other


16   briefs --


17                QUESTION:        You should go before the Senate 
 --

18                (Laughter.)


19                MR. GILBERT:          But, Your Honor --


20                QUESTION:        I actually found that when they


21   approached a particular case about how you were going to


22   decide in the future, both the senators -- in my


23   experience, since it only concerns me -- would not press


24   the issue of how you would decide a particular case.


25                QUESTION:        I'm not talking about --

 1               QUESTION:        And that's why -- a particular case.


 2               QUESTION:        I was -- my reference was to a


 3   particular issue.          A particular issue.


 4               MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, cases are made up of


 5   issues.   And sometimes a case only has one issue.                          Issues


 6   are important in and of themselves.


 7               QUESTION:        Mr. Gilbert, do you think we should


 8   draw any distinction, or whether it would be reasonable


 9   for us to draw any distinction, between the application of


10   the rule to the candidates themselves and the application


11   of the rule to all of these ancillary individuals around


12   them -- their associates, their families?                      Let's assume


13   that we say that the rule passes muster with respect to


14   the candidate.       What's the justification for muzzling the


15   candidate's spouse?          I mean, I know, in fact, what --


16               MR. GILBERT:          Yeah.


17               QUESTION:        -- it is, because we figure, you


18   know, that's how you get the message out.                      But do we have


19   a more difficult First Amendment hurdle?


20               MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, I don't think so, not


21   at all.   I think it's really a misnomer to talk about


22   muzzling, which is what the petitioners have indicated.


23               QUESTION:        Let's say "limiting."


24               MR. GILBERT:          Well, it's not even that.                 What


25   the rule does is ask the judicial candidate to encourage


                                                47

 2   rule by announcing views that they might be aware of that


 3   the judicial candidate would support.


 4                QUESTION:      But if the family member says, "Well,


 5   I'm going to tell anyway."


 6                MR. GILBERT:        "I'm going to tell anyway" --


 7   there's no penalty.


 8                QUESTION:      But the --


 9                MR. GILBERT:        There's no --


10                QUESTION:      But there could be.              Do I understand


11   that there would be an inquiry in that event as to whether


12   the candidate had, indeed, encouraged the family member to


13   be quiet?


14                MR. GILBERT:        Your Honor, the standard is


15   "knowingly permit."         So, in other words, some -- the


16   judicial candidate would actually have to be the actor


17   behind those actions.


18                QUESTION:      All right, but I want to know, in


19   practical terms, what happens.                The spouse makes a


20   statement -- any one of the statements that have been


21   mentioned here, except as suggesting prejudgment of a


22   case.   The candidate stays mute.               I presume that a


23   complaint would be filed against the candidate, and I


24   presume the candidate would have to answer to the


25   commission as to whether the candidate had, indeed,

 2                MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, I'd assume a complaint


 3   would not be filed under those circumstances.


 4                QUESTION:        Why not?       I mean --


 5                MR. GILBERT:          Well, I don't --


 6                QUESTION:        Are your opponents forgiving in your


 7   state?


 8                MR. GILBERT:          Pardon me?


 9                (Laughter.)


10                QUESTION:        I mean, are opponents just forgiving


11   of their opponents in your state?


12                MR. GILBERT:          Well, Your Honor, it's a very


13   difficult standard to satisfy, "knowingly permit."


14                QUESTION:        Well, maybe it's difficult to


15   satisfy.     I'm just trying to get a sense of what the


16   burden on the individuals involved is.


17                MR. GILBERT:          Well --


18                QUESTION:        And I assume that there could be a


19   complaint, simply based on the emphatic statement of the


20   spouse.    And my question is, does the candidate have to


21   show, in that event, that he did not knowingly encourage,


22   or does the State have to show -- or the prosecutor or


23   whoever it is -- that he knowingly did encourage.                            What's


24   the drill?


25                MR. GILBERT:          Yes, of course, the burden's on

 3                 QUESTION:        Okay.


 4                 MR. GILBERT:          And the --


 5                 QUESTION:        But the candidate would have to


 6   answer.


 7                 MR. GILBERT:          The -- possibly.            The Lawyers


 8   Board --


 9                 QUESTION:        Why not?


10                 MR. GILBERT:          -- sometimes doesn't investigate


11   complaints where they don't have sufficient evidence to


12   think there's even a basis for the complaint.


13                 QUESTION:        Well, would they have sufficient


14   evidence in the event that a spouse made an emphatic


15   statement saying, "His view is," or "Her view is"?


16                 MR. GILBERT:          Yeah, it's conceivable, Your


17   Honor, but, again --


18                 QUESTION:        Counsel, is that -- is that part of


19   the canon part of the question in this case?                          I know it's


20   part of the canon.           I didn't understand that it was


21   presented to us in the petition.                   What's your view?


22                 MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, it's kind of oblique. 


23   The focus is on Mr. Wersal's comments.                      And then there are


24   other comments.          And I think one of the justices mentioned


25   a vagueness challenge.              To the extent there's any

 4   the issue --


 5                QUESTION:        Because we didn't have the


 6   interpretation that was later adopted --


 7                MR. GILBERT:          Right.


 8                QUESTION:        -- by the Eighth Circuit.                 What


 9   Counsel says is that the new vagueness issues that he's


10   raising are a consequence of the opinion which your


11   Supreme Court has adopted, the Eighth Circuit's opinion.


12                MR. GILBERT:          Well, we -- Your Honor, you're


13   correct.     However, the Eighth Circuit opinion is the


14   opinion that's being appealed here.                    And what the


15   petitioners have done is, they have refused to acknowledge


16   that narrow construction.              And the fact of the matter is


17   that the Minnesota Supreme Court has now authoritatively


18   adopted that as a state court construction.                        But the fact


19   of the matter is, as well, that the Eighth Circuit already


20   opined on what the standard is, and that issue was not


21   raised by them, in terms of vagueness.                     It simply was not


22   raised.


23                QUESTION:        Was not raised where?

 2   freedom of speech.         And one of the principles of freedom


 3   of speech is that you cannot -- you cannot chill speech by


 4   having a prohibition that is not clear.                     I don't think


 5   that this is a separate issue from the First Amendment


 6   issue at all.


 7               MR. GILBERT:          Well, they have not --


 8               QUESTION:        We have lots of cases like that,


 9   about chilling speech because it's not clear what the


10   coverage of the prohibition is.


11               MR. GILBERT:          Your Honor, in their petition,


12   though, they have not made those kinds of arguments


13   specifically as to --


14               QUESTION:        They certainly did in the reply


15   brief.


16               MR. GILBERT:          They have in the reply brief, but


17   not in the petition, which was the question that was asked


18   previously.     And as to vagueness, I should say that this


19   court has been really clear in the Broadrick v. Oklahoma


20   case, for example, and the Colton v. Kentucky case, that


21   sometimes rules and statutes -- and, frankly, all the


22   time, rules and statutes are not conducive to mathematical


23   precision, that there are going to be, as the Court has


24   said, germs of uncertainty in how these laws are applied. 


25   And these laws are going to be applied based upon facts

 1   and circumstances.           And in this particular case, I think


 2   it's really significant that we don't have any facts and


 3   circumstances as to what Mr. Wersal wants to say.


 4                 QUESTION:        Well, I think you could set up a


 5   system where you get advisory opinions, but I don't know


 6   that we've ever allowed that to be done in the First


 7   Amendment area.


 8                 MR. GILBERT:          Oh --


 9                 QUESTION:        "Please may I say this?"                You know,


10   you submit what you want to say, and somebody tells you,


11   "Yeah, okay.        You can say that."             That's certainly


12   contrary to our approach to the First Amendment.


13                 MR. GILBERT:          Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Your


14   Honor, first of all, I'm not a proponent of what                            -- of


15   that.   But in Letter Carriers, that was a critical


16   consideration in upholding the Hatch Act against


17   constitutional attack, because there was the ability of


18   people who had questions about the application of the


19   statute to actually go to an advisory board and get an


20   opinion.


21                 Similarly here, both of the boards that are


22   parties to this case do provide advisory opinions, and


23   they provide them on short notice, as well.                         So there is


24   that mechanism.          I'm not suggesting it's a substitute, but


25   it is a consideration in terms of if there is a close


                                                  53

 1   question on an issue and someone wants some assurance as


 2   to how that particular situation would be interpreted,


 3   they can go to the boards and ask that question.


 4                QUESTION:      Well, how soon can you get something


 5   from the board?       If somebody wants to give a speech in a


 6   political campaign, I assume you can't get a 12-hour


 7   ruling from the board.


 8                MR. GILBERT:        Well, they actually do advisory


 9   opinions over the phone, Your Honor, on very short order,


10   and they could do it in a matter of hours or days,


11   depending upon what the needs are.


12                QUESTION:      Mr. Gilbert, you brought out that


13   this is not just a question of the candidate informing the


14   voter, that behind all of this is a litigant who's going


15   to be in a future case.           How does it work in Minnesota? 


16   Suppose, to take an example that Mr. Bopp provided in his


17   brief, the judge -- or the candidate is campaigning "Tough


18   on Drunk Driving."        And then I'm a drunk driver, and I


19   come before this judge, now elected, and I say, I want him


20   to recuse, he said he's tough on drunk driving.


21                MR. GILBERT:        Are you asking in the --


22                QUESTION:      Would there be, under Minnesota law,


23   a grounds to say, "I don't want that judge, because he's


24   announced in the election that he's tough on drunk


25   driving"?

 1               MR. GILBERT:        No, I don't think so, Your Honor,


 2   not under those circumstances.


 3               One distinction I would like to make here -- oh,


 4   I'm sorry, Your Honor.


 5               QUESTION:      Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.                Mr. Bopp,


 6   you have three minutes remaining.


 7                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,


 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 9               MR. BOPP:      Your Honor, I don't think this is a


10   matter of mathematical precision.                The State brief,


11   itself, states two different formulations of the rule. 


12   They say, quote, "It is clear that the clause applies to


13   statements about how they would decide, quote, issues, end


14   of quote, on pages 1 and 47.             And then they say it is,


15   quote, "clear," end of quote, that the announced clause


16   applies to statements about cases.                And that is on pages


17   12 and 37.    The rule is not even clear in terms of the


18   State's own formulation of its scope.


19               Secondly, as the Joint Appendix indicates on


20   pages 111 through 123, announcing your views also includes


21   simply answering questions on radio interviews or after


22   speeches.    It is hardly a remedy for a candidate to call


23   up the board or the office for an oral opinion which is


24   not binding on them about whether or not they can answer a


25   question on the radio.


                                             55

 1               And, finally, it is undisputed that the people


 2   of Minnesota want an impartial judiciary.                      Governor Arnie


 3   Carlson, at Joint Appendix page 247, said -- who's a


 4   State's witness -- that people do not want judges who are


 5   pre-committed.       Thus, candidates who would make excessive


 6   statements, who would appear to be partial, risk defeat at


 7   the polls in Minnesota.            Thus, the people can be trusted


 8   to make the decisions that they, themselves, have


 9   conferred upon themselves, as long as they have the


10   information they need to make that choice.                       The First


11   Amendment guarantees that they should receive that


12   information, which the Announce Clause both prohibits and


13   chills.   It is, therefore, unconstitutional.


14               QUESTION:        Thank you.


15               CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:                Thank you, Mr. Bopp. 


16   The case is submitted.


17               (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the


18   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
