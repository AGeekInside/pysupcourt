 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   next this morning in Case 10-8145, Smith v. Cain.

 5               Mr. Shanmugam.

 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. SHANMUGAM:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10               In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established

11   the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must

12   hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense

13   before trial.   This case presents a flagrant violation

14   of that principle.

15               The Orleans Parish district attorney's

16   office produced almost no relevant evidence to the

17   defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was

18   convicted of first-degree murder based solely on the

19   testimony of a single eyewitness.            Unbeknownst to the

20   defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on

21   multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the

22   perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know

23   them if he saw them.

24               The suppression of those statements alone

25   justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's


                                      3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   office in this case also engaged in the wholesale

 2   suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses,

 3   statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness

 4   identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast

 5   doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the

 6   shootings.

 7                  If all of that information had been

 8   disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely

 9   would have viewed this case in a completely different

10   light.   The trial court therefore erred by rejecting

11   Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be

12   reversed.

13                  In our view, in order to conclude that

14   Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court

15   need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed

16   statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner.

17   Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld

18   from the defense before trial, and argues only that the

19   failure to disclose those statements was not

20   prejudicial.

21                  Those statements, however, could not have

22   more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident

23   identification of Petitioner at trial --

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, he saw a picture.

25   Boatner saw a picture in a newspaper, and that turned on


                                       4

 1   the light for him, right?        It wasn't any police

 2   suggestion.

 3                 MR. SHANMUGAM:       That is correct.      The basis

 4   for Boatner's identification was that he saw a

 5   photograph in the New Orleans newspaper of Petitioner.

 6   It was in connection with an article describing the

 7   shootings and suggesting that Petitioner was one of the

 8   suspects in the case.      And that was what led to his

 9   prior identification out of court.

10                 But just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg,

11   we're not arguing today that the identification was

12   somehow constitutionally problematic.             At most, we're

13   arguing that the identification was of questionable

14   validity in light of the fact that Boatner had only a

15   limited opportunity to see the perpetrators and in light

16   of the circumstances that led to his identification.

17                 Now, even if his identification were more

18   clearly reliable, our argument today would be the same.

19   In a case such as this one, in which the sole basis for

20   linking the defendant to the crime is the testimony of a

21   single eyewitness, and there is evidence that the single

22   eyewitness said on multiple occasions that he couldn't

23   identify anyone, we believe that, absent extraordinary

24   circumstances, that will be sufficient to --

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, aren't you


                                      5

 1   exaggerating a little bit about the value of the

 2   impeachment evidence regarding Boatner?              Now, my

 3   understanding is that he made his first statement to the

 4   effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene

 5   when he had been at the scene where five people that he

 6   knew very well had been killed.

 7                  He was lying on the floor with a big gash on

 8   his head.   He was questioned at the scene, and at that

 9   time -- and this was in the evening -- he said:                I can't

10   identify anybody.    But then, later that very day, wasn't

11   it, that very evening, after midnight, he was questioned

12   at the police station; am I correct?

13                  MR. SHANMUGAM:       Yes, that's correct.

14                  JUSTICE ALITO:       And at that point he gave a

15   description.    He did make an -- he did provide a

16   description of the person that he said was the one who

17   first came through the door.              So, you know, that -- I

18   don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were

19   statements to the effect that he couldn't identify

20   anybody.

21                  But in light of the fact that he did provide

22   a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the

23   very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you

24   exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times --

25   the effect of these statements that he couldn't


                                       6

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   identify --

 2                 MR. SHANMUGAM:       Justice Alito, it is true

 3   that Boatner provided identifying details in the later

 4   statement that night.      I would respectfully submit that

 5   they were relatively limited identifying details, simply

 6   the fact that the first man through the door had a

 7   low-cut haircut and gold teeth.           And as we indicate in

 8   our brief, those were characteristics shared by numerous

 9   other suspects in the case.

10                 But I think more broadly, with regard to

11   both sets of statements at issue here, the State's

12   explanations for those statements are at best plausible.

13   And we really think that in a case such as this one, in

14   which the evidence on its face is so clearly of high

15   exculpatory or impeaching values, it takes something

16   more than that.   It is not sufficient for Respondent to

17   argue here simply that, even taking into account these

18   statements, a rational juror could still reach the same

19   result and return a verdict of guilty here, because this

20   Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that the standard

21   for Brady claims is not a Jackson v. Virginia type

22   sufficiency of the evidence standard.

23                 So, again, where you have statements that on

24   their face are not simply statements calling a witness's

25   credibility into question, but statements that really


                                      7

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   directly contradict the confident in-court

 2   identification, it would take an exceedingly persuasive

 3   explanation for those statements to defeat a showing of

 4   materiality.    Now, with regard --

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The standard is a

 6   reasonable probability that the result would have been

 7   different, reasonable probability?

 8                  MR. SHANMUGAM:       Yes, that's correct.        And

 9   this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that that's

10   not a more likely than not standard.               That is

11   essentially the same standard that this Court has

12   articulated for prejudice for ineffective assistance of

13   counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, and by

14   now it's a quite clearly established standard.                And,

15   again, it requires something less than a showing of more

16   likely than not and perhaps something slightly more than

17   the showing required for harmless error under Chapman v.

18   California.

19                  But I do want to touch upon the State's

20   explanations for these statements and explain very

21   briefly why we think that those explanations are frankly

22   not even plausible.      With regard to the first statement

23   to which Justice Alito referred, the statement that was

24   made at the scene approximately half an hour after

25   initial -- officers initially responded to the scene,


                                       8

                                 Official


 1   the State's argument is that Boatner was somehow too

 2   traumatized to make an identification at the time.

 3               But not only did Boatner not so testify at

 4   the postconviction hearing -- in fact he testified that

 5   he couldn't recall the statement at all -- but the very

 6   officer who took the statement himself testified at

 7   trial in this case that at the time of the statement

 8   Boatner was, quote, "coherent and articulated very well

 9   the events that transpired."           And that is at pages 137

10   to 138 of the joint appendix.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:       That may be true, but if you

12   were a juror and Boatner testified and he was

13   cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based

14   on his failure to make an identification right at the

15   scene, and he said, well, that was because five of my

16   friends had just been killed and I was lying on the

17   floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had

18   a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later

19   when I collected myself and they asked me the same

20   question at the police station, I provided a description

21   and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody -- do you

22   think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he

23   couldn't identify him at the scene so he must have been

24   lying when he identified -- when he provided a

25   description later at the police station?

 1                MR. SHANMUGAM:        Justice Alito, I think that

 2   it's possible that a juror could credit that explanation

 3   in any retrial, though I --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Wasn't there also an

 5   intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he

 6   couldn't identify?    And that was after what he said on

 7   the night, the same night.

 8                MR. SHANMUGAM:        That is --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Five days later he said:

10   I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him.

11                MR. SHANMUGAM:        That is correct, Justice

12   Ginsburg.   But even if we didn't have the March 6th

13   statement or statements, I would frankly be happy to

14   take my chances with the jury, even with regard solely

15   to the March 1st statement, in light of that testimony

16   of Officer Ronquillo that Boatner was in fact coherent,

17   articulated very well the events that transpired, just

18   like any witness, and so on and so forth.

19                So, again -- -

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counselor --

21                MR. SHANMUGAM:        -- we don't think that it's

22   our burden to show that no juror could credit the

23   State's explanation.     It's simply that we think that

24   that explanation doesn't hold water.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counselor, your argument

 1   now and in your brief suggests that you're relying most

 2   heavily on the failure to provide the impeachment

 3   materials of the only witness to this crime and the only

 4   piece of evidence that ties your client to the crime.

 5   But you also mention other things, and Respondents spend

 6   90 percent of their brief arguing against the other

 7   things.   But I just want to clarify those other things.

 8                Number one, was the testimony mixed

 9   testimony about whether the assailants wore a mask

10   across their face or over their entire head?

11                MR. SHANMUGAM:        There --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What's the best take on

13   what the evidence showed that was presented on that

14   issue?

15                MR. SHANMUGAM:        There was some degree of

16   variation in what the witnesses said.             Now, in the main,

17   we're talking, again, about statements that were

18   withheld.   And I want to lay out those statements very

19   briefly, if I may.    There were two eyewitnesses who made

20   statements to the police indicating that some or all of

21   the perpetrators, including the first man through the

22   door, were wearing masks.        Those were the statements of

23   Shelita Russel and the statement of Dale Mims.

24                Now, with regard to the statement of Shelita

25   Russell -- and this was what we believe was the dying


                                     11

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   declaration that she made at the scene in the immediate

 2   aftermath of having been shot multiple times -- Russell

 3   said she saw people barge into the kitchen; one had a

 4   black cloth across the face, first one through the door.

 5   So, it is at least theoretically possible --

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could I ask you

 7   something?   Who determines that issue of whether that's

 8   a dying declaration?    Do we determine that in deciding

 9   whether the withholding of the Brady materials was

10   harmful or not?   Do we give deference to the lower

11   court's determination of that?          Do they have to decide

12   whether it was a dying declaration?              What's the standard

13   on something like this?

14                MR. SHANMUGAM:       The lower court did not make

15   such a determination in this case on this or any of the

16   other evidentiary issues that Respondent now advances,

17   at least in part because it does not appear that

18   Respondent advanced any of those arguments below.             But I

19   think more broadly, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of the

20   role of this Court or any other court considering a

21   Brady claim, this Court hasn't quite spoken to the

22   specific issue of whether a Brady court is supposed to

23   itself make an evidentiary determination where there's a

24   question about admissibility, but the closest that this

25   Court came was in Wood v. Bartholomew, in which this


                                    12

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   Court indicated that with regard to Brady material, it

 2   either has to itself be admissible or be reasonably

 3   likely to lead to admissible evidence.             And the Court's

 4   reasoning in Wood v. Bartholomew was somewhat spare on

 5   that score.   That was a summary reversal in a per curiam

 6   opinion.

 7                 But I do think that it would be appropriate

 8   for a Brady court to make that determination itself or,

 9   at a minimum, make a determination as to whether it

10   appears that it's reasonably likely that the evidence

11   would be admissible.

12                 Here, we really don't think that it's a

13   close question, particularly with regard to the

14   statement of Shelita Russell, because the context of the

15   handwritten notes makes clear that the statement was

16   taken at the scene of the crime.             Shelita Russell was

17   taken to the hospital approximately a half an hour after

18   the shootings occurred.       She told two witnesses that she

19   believed that she was dying.             And so, under the law on

20   dying declarations -- and I have no reason to believe

21   that the law is any different in Louisiana from the

22   Federal system or the 49 other States -- that would

23   comfortably satisfy that requirement.

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Now, Mr. Mims was the

25   neighbor who saw the two -- there were three assailants

 2               MR. SHANMUGAM:       There's some doubt as to

 3   whether or not there were three or four assailants.           And

 4   Mims himself, in all candor, was a little bit

 5   inconsistent on that point.         But he consistently said,

 6   both in the handwritten notes and in his testimony at

 7   the postconviction hearing, that all of the assailants,

 8   however many there were, were wearing masks and that --

 9   that he saw them as they were getting into the car.           He

10   didn't say anything further other than that the masks

11   were ski-type masks.

12               But the State's argument with regard to the

13   materiality of Mims's statement is that it is possible

14   that the men would not have been wearing masks when they

15   entered the house to allegedly commit the armed robbery;

16   and, therefore, the fact that Boatner saw the first man

17   unmasked can be reconciled with his statement.         And,

18   again, we would be happy to take our chances with the

19   jury and make the argument that that would be an

20   exceedingly unconventional way to go about committing an

21   armed robbery.

22               And, again, with regard to the Russell and

23   Mims statements, I think it's important to remember that

24   we view those statements as going directly to and

25   contradicting Boatner's in-court identification.         And


                                   14

 1   so, in some sense, we view those statements as being of

 2   a piece with Boatner's own prior statements in which he

 3   indicated that he could not identify anyone and that he

 4   did not --

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:       Does the defense have any

 6   theory as to why Boatner would lie about whether he

 7   could identify this individual?

 8                MR. SHANMUGAM:       First of all, Justice Alito,

 9   it would, of course, not be the defense's burden in any

10   subsequent retrial to come up with a theory of its own.

11   The defense could simply argue, as it did at the first

12   trial, that the prosecution simply didn't bear its

13   burden on reasonable doubt.          But --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:       But, yes -- but the -- the

15   impact of your impeachment evidence would be related

16   certainly to if a juror would ask, well, why would he

17   lie about this?   And I -- I'm just asking, would -- did

18   the defense have any theory about what his motive would

19   be about whether he could identify somebody, whether

20   this first person had a mask or not?

21                MR. SHANMUGAM:       As this Court will be aware

22   from its recent consideration of eyewitness evidence, it

23   doesn't necessarily follow from the fact that an

24   eyewitness identification is mistaken that the

25   eyewitness was somehow lying about it.           It may very well


                                    15

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have been that Boatner made a mistaken identification in

 2   good faith out of a desire to identify the person who

 3   killed several of his friends.

 4               And, indeed, as the amicus brief of the

 5   Innocence Project explains in this case, there is a

 6   phenomenon known as "mug shot exposure effect," where an

 7   individual who sees a mug shot in some other context is

 8   more likely to identify that same person when confronted

 9   with a subsequent line-up.       Of course, where, as here,

10   the individual is exposed to the mug shot for the first

11   time in seeing a newspaper article that depicts the

12   individual in question and suggests that that individual

13   is a suspect in the crime, it would not at all be

14   unusual for the individual, when confronted with that

15   photograph again in a line-up a few weeks later, to pick

16   that individual.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:       But the first time he -- he

18   said that the person wasn't masked and provided a

19   description was long before he saw any mug shots.           It

20   was the evening of the event.          It was when he was

21   questioned at the police station.

22               MR. SHANMUGAM:       Well, on the evening of the

23   event, he provided those limited details about the gold

24   teeth and the low-cut haircut.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:       Yes, but by doing that he's


                                   16

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   saying this person wasn't wearing a mask.                 That's the

 2   critical point.

 3                  MR. SHANMUGAM:       Well, that may suggest that

 4   the person was not wearing a mask.                 Of course, it's

 5   possible that the person somehow had part of his face

 6   covered.

 7                  But I think it's important to realize,

 8   Justice Alito, that even with regard to that statement,

 9   while it is true that Boatner provided those limiting

10   details, he also made statements suggesting that he was

11   not confident of his ability to actually make an

12   identification.    And in that statement, which is found

13   at page 296 of the joint appendix, he says:                 I was too

14   scared to look at anybody.          I wish I could give y'all a

15   description.

16                  So, in some sense, we think that the focus

17   on the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut in this case

18   is a bit of an aside, because the question here is not

19   whether he saw enough to support the subsequent

20   identification; the question is whether his suppressed

21   statements in which he repeatedly said, I can't make an

22   identification, contradict his in-court confident

23   identification of Petitioner.

24                  And we think that in order to decide this

25   case, all that the Court essentially need say in an


                                      17

 1   opinion is that in a case such as this one, in which all

 2   you have is the identification of a single eyewitness,

 3   where you have statements in which that eyewitness said

 4   I can't make an identification, and those statements

 5   have concededly been suppressed, the Brady materiality

 6   threshold is satisfied.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Am I right --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In looking at the

 9   appendix, there are some asterisks.               Were these

10   statements, the first two -- the one at 252 in the joint

11   appendix and then the statement on March the 2nd, which

12   is the one you just referred to, 296, were parts of

13   those statements given to the defense counsel or none of

14   the statements?    And how long were the documents?            Were

15   they 20 or 30 pages?     Can you tell me a little bit about

16   that?

17                 MR. SHANMUGAM:       First of all, none of those

18   statements were given to the defense.               The only

19   relevant --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I shouldn't have said

21   "statements."    None of the reports.

22                 MR. SHANMUGAM:       Yes.      None of the statements

23   or the surrounding materials was given to the defense at

24   all.    The only even remotely relevant thing that was

25   given to the defense was the initial police report,


                                     18

 1   which was a five-page document prepared by the officers

 2   who initially responded to the scene, with a one-page

 3   narrative of what took place.            And that document, for

 4   the Court's reference, is in volume 10 of the initial

 5   record that was received from the district court at


 6   pages R1907 to 1911.


 7               Now, with regard to these specific


 8   statements, both the narrative statements and the


 9   handwritten notes, the narrative statements were


10   contained in a relatively voluminous document -- I

11   believe it was an 83-page document -- that was a

12   narrative prepared by Officer Ronquillo that set out

13   everything that took place over the course of the

14   investigation.   And none of that was disclosed.

15               Respondent makes the argument that the trial

16   court reviewed that document in camera, but we think

17   that it is somewhat unclear what, if anything, the trial

18   court actually reviewed in camera.                There's no dispute

19   that that document was not handed over to the defense.

20               With regard to the handwritten notes, there

21   actually are a relatively small number of relevant

22   handwritten notes in this case, but all of them were

23   contained in the police files, and none of them, none of

24   the ones at issue on which we're relying, was handed

25   over before trial.

 1               So, this is not a case in which selective

 2   materials were handed over.          None of this material was

 3   handed over, and that's why we really think that this is

 4   a case that involves the categorical withholding of

 5   documents and not simply the withholding of selected

 6   documents that may subsequently turn out to be relevant.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you just tell me, how

 8   does Brady work?   Is there some obligation for the

 9   defense counsel to say please give me all relevant

10   reports?

11               MR. SHANMUGAM:        No.     This Court has made

12   clear that a request is unnecessary to trigger the Brady

13   obligation, and this Court has made clear in cases

14   dating back to Brady itself that the good faith or bad

15   faith of the prosecutor is irrelevant.           And, of course,

16   the prosecutor has a duty under Brady to hand over not

17   only materials in the prosecutor's own possession but

18   also materials in the possession of the police as well.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, is -- this

20   group or gang, all of them had gold teeth and faded hair

21   cuts?

22               MR. SHANMUGAM:        There were five other

23   suspects who had gold teeth or -- and low-cut haircuts.

24   Three of the other individuals who were primarily in the

25   frame for this murder had those characteristics.           I


                                    20

 1   believe that the three were Bannister, Phillips, and

 2   Young.   The only other suspect who is a reasonably

 3   likely suspect who didn't was Robert Trackling, the

 4   suspect whose confession to involvement in these

 5   shootings was withheld.

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           In short, faded hair

 7   cuts and gold teeth were not a unique characteristic.

 8                MR. SHANMUGAM:         They were not uncommon in

 9   the 1990s.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, what were these --

11                (Laughter.)

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           They're uncommon to me.

13   These --

14                (Laughter.)

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           These were not gold teeth

16   that were implanted, right?            They -- what was it?   Some

17   kind of a mouthpiece of gold?

18                MR. SHANMUGAM:         I have to admit that my

19   familiarity with this practice is perhaps not that much

20   greater than yours, Justice Scalia.                But my

21   understanding is --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm sorry to hear that.

23                (Laughter.)

24                MR. SHANMUGAM:         My understanding is that

25   these are gold teeth that are worn either as temporary

 1   or perhaps semipermanent implants, and that in hip-hop

 2   culture in the 1990s, this was relatively common.           But

 3   whatever the provenance of this practice, it is

 4   undisputed on this record that multiple other suspects

 5   had those characteristics.

 6               Justice Sotomayor, there was one thing you

 7   asked that I just want to get back to with regard to the

 8   remaining categories of evidence.           I just want to set

 9   them out, and then I'd be happy to answer any questions

10   that the Court has about them.          And if there are no

11   further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.

12               As we explain in our brief, there are three

13   other categories of evidence at issue here.           There was

14   the statement of Phillip Young, Petitioner's

15   co-defendant, suggesting that Petitioner was not

16   involved in the shootings.        There were also the

17   statements that would have called into question the

18   prosecution's theory that Petitioner was one of the

19   shooters, a theory that was essential to establishing

20   the intent required for first-degree murder under

21   Louisiana law.   Louisiana is somewhat different from

22   other States in that it doesn't require premeditation,

23   but that it -- but it does require a specific intent to

24   kill or inflict great bodily harm.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, on that point, the


                                    22

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction

 2   between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a

 3   9-millimeter automatic pistol.

 4                  MR. SHANMUGAM:       Well, we don't think that

 5   that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous

 6   sources in our brief that draw precisely that

 7   distinction.

 8                  But I think that what's noteworthy with

 9   regard to the statements at issue is that both Boatner,

10   who identified the weapon that the perpetrator whom he

11   believed to be Petitioner was carrying, and the State's

12   ballistics expert, Kenneth Leary, who identified the

13   weapon that was responsible for the firing of the

14   casings at issue, conspicuously failed to say that the

15   weapon at issue was a 9- millimeter handgun.         But at

16   trial their testimonies suddenly converged, and Boatner,

17   who had previously said only that the perpetrator was

18   carrying a handgun, said that the perpetrator was

19   carrying a 9-millimeter handgun; and Leary, who said

20   that the casings at issue had come from a machine pistol

21   of the Intratec or MAC-11 type, suddenly said that they

22   came from a 9-millimeter handgun instead.

23                  And so, at a minimum, if the defense had

24   possessed those statements, it could have sown doubt on

25   whether the firearm was in fact one and the same and,


                                      23

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   therefore, sown doubt on a critical element of the

 2   offense at issue.

 3                And finally, the only other category --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I'd just like to go back

 5   to that because I'm not sure I understand the argument.

 6   Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the

 7   casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter?           And I know

 8   that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was

 9   used.   And the issue was whether anybody would call a

10   MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol,

11   correct?

12                MR. SHANMUGAM:       Well, that's right with

13   regard to Leary's testimony.            I think the thing that was

14   a little bit odd with regard to Boatner's testimony was

15   the sudden degree of specificity.           Having said only that

16   it was a handgun or a chrome automatic in his prior

17   statements, he said at trial that it was a 9-millimeter

18   handgun, which he had not previously said in the

19   statements that were withheld.

20                And, finally, the last category of evidence

21   consists of the notes of the interview in which Eric

22   Rogers relayed Robert Trackling's confession to

23   involvement in the shootings.           As the amicus brief of

24   the NACDL points out, courts have routinely held that

25   confessions by other perpetrators constitute exculpatory


                                    24

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   evidence, even with regard to offenses that may have had

 2   multiple perpetrators.     And we certainly believe that at

 3   a minimum the suppression of those notes, when

 4   considered in conjunction with all of the other

 5   evidence, comfortably satisfies the Brady materiality

 6   standard, and it's for that reason that we think that

 7   the judgment of the trial court should be reversed.

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Shanmugam, just a quick

 9   one.   Was -- is all the evidence that you're discussing

10   here today -- was that presented to the State

11   postconviction court?

12                MR. SHANMUGAM:       Yes.     We believe that all of

13   this evidence was before the State postconviction court.

15   the -- Mr. Smith's photograph was pictured in the

16   Times-Picayune newspaper on June 7th, and this

17   particular line-up was shown to Mr. Boatner on March

18   22nd.   So, at that point, line-up 8, he stopped and

19   remarked about the hair --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could you tell me why

21   Boatner waited 2 weeks to -- or never told the police

22   that the face that he saw in the newspaper was the face

23   of his assailant?   I -- as I understand the facts, he

24   says he saw the newspaper, recognized his assailant, and

25   remained silent.

 1               MS. ANDRIEU:     Yes, he did.

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It wasn't until they

 3   presented him with the line-up including Mr. Smith's

 4   face that he identified Mr. Smith.              What's the reason

 5   for the delay?

 6               MS. ANDRIEU:     His reason, Your Honor, is --

 7   it's contained most specifically on page 191 of the

 8   joint appendix, and it is frankly that he was afraid.

 9   He -- and I think the jury would have understood that.

10   He obviously knew what Mr. Smith was capable of.              He --

11   I'm sure he feared --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And so what turned --

13   what changed his mind once the police showed him the

14   line-up?

15               MS. ANDRIEU:     Well, I don't know that he

16   changed his mind, but he was presented with a line-up,

17   and when he was presented with the line-up, he very

18   quickly identified Juan Smith and said:              That is him; I

19   will never forget his face.         So --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And that was before or

21   after the picture in the paper?

22               MS. ANDRIEU:     That was after.           And all of

23   this, by the way, was vetted during -- during a motion

24   to suppress hearing.    When the trial judge learned or --

25   that the photograph had been shown in the newspaper, he


                                   27

 1   reopened the hearing on the motion to suppress to

 2   determine -- and over the State's objection.          We argued

 3   that this was not State action.          But he reopened the

 4   motion to suppress to determine for himself whether or

 5   not that newspaper had in any way tainted the later

 6   identification of Juan Smith.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:         What is this?    I mean, I

 8   thought -- I may -- I thought the issue is that there

 9   were some notes, and the first note, which was made on

10   the day, the policeman says that Boatner said he could

11   not supply a description of the perpetrator, other than

12   to say they were black males.          Then he said they had

13   golden teeth and a low-cut haircut.

14               And 5 days later, he said he could not ID

15   anyone because he couldn't see faces.           Then he said he'd

16   only glanced at the first man.          He couldn't tell if they

17   had their faces covered and didn't see anyone.          Then he

18   said, I could not ID, would not know them if I saw them.

19   And another set of police notes says he said that he

20   could not identify any of the perpetrators of the

21   murder.

22               So, I guess those are all notes that the --

23   the prosecution did not give to the defense.          So, if you

24   were a defense lawyer, whatever this other stuff is, I

25   guess you would have been pretty happy to have those

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:         And so, what are -- you're

 5   saying that I guess it would have made no difference?

 6                 MS. ANDRIEU:     That's correct, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Then I'd like to hear that

 8   because it seems on its face that it certainly could

 9   have made a difference, that if he had those notes that

10   he could have tried to impeach him and said where did

11   this sudden recognition come from.

13   concern.    This Court has held that favorable evidence --

15   is not material need not be turned over to the defense.

18   material?   Here is the only eyewitness --

 1   statement on the scene, two statements the day of the


 2   incident.   To a first responding officer who was not


 3   Detective Ronquillo, he gave a description, and that


 4   description was heavy built, with a hair with a fade


 5   with a little small top, with a lot of gold in his

 6   mouth.   That was while he was at the scene.

 7                 Later, homicide Detective John Ronquillo

 8   arrived at the scene, and apparently, according to his

 9   notes and, most importantly, according to his

10   postconviction testimony, he asked Larry -- he asked

11   Larry Boatner for a description.            And Larry Boatner

12   said, I can't give you a description.

13                 I'll put them all in perspective and then go

14   back to what Detective Ronquillo and Mr. Boatner had to

15   say about that.   But in any case, Mr. Boatner's severe

16   laceration was treated, and then he was escorted to the

17   homicide office, where he gave his formal statement.

18   And in that statement, part of which has been reproduced

19   here by opposing counsel, Mr. Boatner said:            I can tell

20   you about the one, the one who put the pistol in my

21   face.    He was a black male with a low cut, golds in his

22   mouth.   I don't know how many; that's all.           I was too

23   scared to look at anybody.         All of them had guns, one

24   with an AK; one with a TEC-9.            The one who hit me had a

25   chrome automatic.    It was big.         So --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, and you

 2   could argue, presumably you did argue, that before the

 3   jury, and that would be compelling evidence for the

 4   jury.   And if you were the defense lawyer, you really

 5   would like to have that statement where he said:                  I

 6   couldn't identify them.

 7                MS. ANDRIEU:      You would like to have it, but

 8   it's not material because, sandwiched between two

 9   descriptions -- and he's -- between two descriptions, he

10   says, I can't identify.       And taken in --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           How does that make it not

12   material?   You can argue that it should be given

13   diminished weight.    But an inconsistent statement by the

14   only eyewitness seems to me most material and useful to

15   the defense in cross-examining the eyewitness.               I really

16   don't understand how you can -- you can argue that the

17   jury shouldn't put much weight on it because there were

18   these other things; but to say that it's immaterial I

19   find that that is -- is not plausible.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          And not only the only

21   eyewitness but, if I understand it correctly, the only

22   evidence against the defendant.           This was the only

23   evidence against him, this one eyewitness

 2   by testimony of the brother of Phillip Young.               The

 3   perpetrator who was left at the scene is an aphasic

 4   amnesiac.   So, he established a link that the two were

 5   known to each other, Juan Smith and --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well --

 7                 MS. ANDRIEU:     -- but yes.


 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But just on the


 9   materiality point, I -- I just have to agree with


10   Justice Ginsburg.    What you're telling us is that when

11   the defense stands up and said, and isn't it true that,

12   in this statement which you just have testified to on

13   direct and which the police have put in on direct, you

14   also said you could not identify any perpetrators of the

15   murder -- and then the prosecutor says immaterial, and

16   the judge says strike it.

17                 MS. ANDRIEU:     But that's not --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I just can't believe that.

19                 MS. ANDRIEU:     But that's not what he says.

20   He says:    I can tell you about the one, the one who put

 4   immaterial.   I find that just incredible.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Is it that you mean

 6   immaterial, or is it that you mean that it wasn't

 7   prejudicial because there's so much other evidence,

 8   there was no reasonable probability it would have made a

 9   difference in the trial?

10                 MS. ANDRIEU:     That is what I mean, yes.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Okay.       So, we can forget

12   the word "material."

13                 Now, you're saying there's so much other

14   evidence here against him that it wouldn't have made any

22   to Justice Kennedy's question, put it in those terms,

 1   space of hours, he has been telling the policemen that

 2   he can't identify anybody, he doesn't know.              I mean,

 3   what -- that sounds like there's a probability that

 4   would have made a difference.           Why not?

 5               MS. ANDRIEU:      The -- among the most

 6   important evidence in this case is the testimony or the

 7   transcript from the postconviction relief hearing.              John

 8   Ronquillo, whose notes these are, was asked about the

 9   March 6th statement.    And I guess we are

10   fast-forwarding.   The next -- the statement after the

11   statement made -- the one made in the homicide office

12   was made on March 6th.     And at that time, Detective

13   Ronquillo called Larry Boatner, and Larry Boatner said,

14   I can't identify anyone.

15               Based -- and what Detective Ronquillo had to

16   say about that -- first of all, Larry Boatner didn't

17   remember saying that.     But what Detective Ronquillo had

18   to say about it -- and he was the person who was --

19   whose impressions -- about whose impressions we're

20   speaking -- was that at that point, Mr. Boatner, like

21   many murder witnesses, was retreating, temporarily

22   equivocating, as we wrote in brief.              He was retreating

23   somewhat from his assistance with the police.              Not an --

24   not an abnormal phenomenon --

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What if -- what if --

 1   could the jury be entitled to reject that conclusion?

 2   They have four statements by this man who Ronquillo

 3   described as very coherent, very with it at the scene of

 4   the crime.    Would a jury be entitled to -- to reject

 5   that excuse by Ronquillo?

 6                 MS. ANDRIEU:     They would, Your Honor.

 7   And --

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And if they were

 9   entitled to do that, why would the absence of four

10   statements that I can't identify someone not have been

11   an argument that defense counsel could have used, number

12   one, and that had a reasonable probability of making a

13   difference?

14                 MS. ANDRIEU:     First of all, there were not

15   four statements that were made where Boatner said he

16   couldn't identify anyone, again.            He gave two statements

17   the day of where he described, and one statement --

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         At different hours.

19                 MS. ANDRIEU:     I'm sorry.

 1   statements.   My math is wrong?

 2                 MS. ANDRIEU:     I'm sorry.         Those are

 3   statements where he inculpated the defendant.             There are

 4   two statements.    Starting on the scene, there is a

 5   statement provided to the first responding officer,

 6   where he provides a description.            Larry Boatner provides

 7   a description --

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But it is a description

 9   that others, other suspects, fit.            The close-cut hair,

10   the gold teeth.    That didn't identify Smith, as opposed

11   to the other suspects who had those same

12   characteristics.

13                 MS. ANDRIEU:     Yes.       And those other

14   suspects' photographs were all contained -- were

15   contained in photo IDs -- in photo line-ups, and

16   Mr. Boatner never selected one of them.

17                 The other thing is he -- gold teeth.              He

18   knew that his perpetrator had gold teeth.             The next time

19   he saw Mr. Smith was at trial in court.             Mr. Smith

20   revealed his teeth, and he had gold teeth.             But as far

21   as the other suspects having the haircut or physical --

22   similar physical attributes --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It was a prior

24   inconsistent statement, and we can argue about whether

25   there were more consistent statements than inconsistent

 1   statements, but to say that this was not Brady material,

 2   we -- we're not saying that Larry Boatner made up a

 3   story on the stand that wasn't -- didn't conform to the

 4   truth.   The question is, should the prosecutor -- should

 5   the defense attorney have access to a prior inconsistent

12   you're -- you're relying almost entirely on the

13   testimony of one witness, and you have these notes that

14   were taken by, and are presumably in the possession of,

18                MS. ANDRIEU:     Absolutely.

20   and if there's anything in them that's -- that is

21   impeachment material, they have to be turned over to the

22   defense.   And under Louisiana law, is there are a rule

 2   course, under this Court's decision in Brady v.

 3   Maryland, if the prosecutor makes a determination that

 4   they would materially affect the outcome of --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You have to supply

 8   statements by a witness when they take the stand, don't

 9   you?   Those are immaterial?           Don't you have to turn

10   over --

11                MS. ANDRIEU:       No. 
 No.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
 Not in the State of

13   Louisiana?

14                MS. ANDRIEU:       No. 
 Not --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
 You don't have to turn

16   over witness statements when they're taking the stand?

17                MS. ANDRIEU:       No.       And these statements were

18   provided in camera.      There was -- defense filed a motion

19   for discovery, and he asked for Brady material.                He

20   asked specifically for the supplemental report, which is

21   where these statements are contained.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, you -- are you

23   claiming that the judge's failure to catch these

24   inconsistencies excuses your Brady obligation?

25                MS. ANDRIEU:       Not at all.        The Brady

 1   obligation is ours.      In fact, we believe that that's

 2   actually a poor practice.         But it is one --

 3                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Andrieu, if I could go

 4   back to Justice Alito's question, was the problem here

 5   that the prosecutors never received these statements

 6   from the police officers, or did the prosecutors make a

 7   determination similar to the kind of argument that

 8   you're making today -- make a determination that these

 9   statements simply should not be turned over because they

10   are not material?

11                  MS. ANDRIEU:     The prosecutor in this case

12   actually turned them over to the trial court for an in

13   camera inspection.     And article -- Louisiana Code of

14   Criminal Procedure article 718 actually provides for

15   that practice.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:         It's so odd that -- I mean,

17   look, it seems like here it is 5 days after the shooting

18   and well before, I guess, that this witness saw any mug

19   shots or did anything.       And he says, I could not

20   identify anyone, because he couldn't see the faces of

21   the people.    And now you're saying later, which you

22   introduce into trial, his having looked at the faces of

23   people and identified them from their faces.

24                  Now, previously, he said he couldn't see

25   their faces.    All right.      And in Louisiana, the State of

 1   Louisiana, the prosecution and the judges say that

 2   isn't -- you don't have to turn over that statement that

 3   he couldn't see the faces made earlier.

 4                 MS. ANDRIEU:     No.       What he --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:         What?

 6                 MS. ANDRIEU:     I'm sorry.         When he's saying

 7   that he could not see the faces, he is not referring to

 8   Juan Smith.   He and Detective Ronquillo testified at

 9   postconviction that he always said he could identify the

10   one, the one whose face appeared a handgun's length from

11   his own, unmasked, when he opened that front door at

12   2230 North Roman.

13                 Detective Ronquillo put this in perspective

14   at postconviction.    And as I said, he --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Oh, you mean all these --

16   all these statements that we have here, you're saying,

17   all referred to people other than the defendant.

18                 MS. ANDRIEU:     Juan.       Yes.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.     Well, was there

20   a finding on that?

21                 MS. ANDRIEU:     There was -- the judge did not

22   give express findings of fact or finding of law, but --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Perhaps the defense would

24   have liked to say they did apply to the defendant.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         You don't say all of them.

 3   when he says I can't describe anyone here, clearly --

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:         This was not at the scene.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:         That applied to everyone,

20   identify anyone, Smith is out of that group already?

21                MS. ANDRIEU:     Oh, I'm sorry.             No.   He's --

24   circumstances, he is saying -- the first time, he's

25   saying, I can't describe.       The second time, he is

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.       He says, I

 4   can't identify --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Excuse me.   I can't

10   heard --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:         He says, I can't identify

12   anyone because I couldn't see faces.               Okay?   That's what

13   it says here, at least in my notes that my law clerks

14   gathered.   And --

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:         All right, I -- and my

17   point then is this seems very odd, I mean, really

18   unusual that in the State of Louisiana that they have

19   some kind of system that doesn't turn that statement

20   over to the defense.

21                 MS. ANDRIEU:     It was turned over to the

22   judge under article 718 for in-camera inspection.

 1   1995.    There is a hearing.

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What you said in your brief

 3   was that the judge determined that the supplemental

 4   report relating to the North Roman Street murders

 5   contains no Brady material.

 6                 MS. ANDRIEU:       Yes.      Mr. Smith --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:         I didn't understand the

 8   record to be that all of Boatner's statements -- that

 9   all the statements of Boatner that we're concerned about

10   now were examined by the judge before--

19   prosecutor's office that because those materials were

20   turned over to the judge, assuming that they were turned

21   over to the judge, that that obviates the Brady

22   obligation?

 2   bad practice.    But it is --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Did you concede there was

 4   a Brady violation in this case?

 3                  MS. ANDRIEU:     No, there is not.

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, explain why what is

 5   on its face seemingly inconsistent statements are not

 6   required to be turned over.

 7                  MS. ANDRIEU:     With regard to the March 6th

 8   statement where Larry Boatner tells John Ronquillo at

 9   that point, I can't identify anyone, what Mr. -- what

10   Detective Ronquillo had to say about that is

11   dispositive.    And he said, at that point Larry Boatner

12   was withdrawing from -- he was afraid -- he was

13   withdrawing from police assistance.

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I don't understand how

15   he becomes the arbiter of what's Brady.             You said to me

16   earlier that a jury would be entitled to reject his

17   conclusion.    All right?      Tell me what -- how his

18   conclusion makes it non-Brady if a juror could decide

19   differently.

20                  MS. ANDRIEU:     The -- the postconviction

21   testimony is pivotal because there is a petition that's

22   filed with attachments, with exhibits.             That is what

23   gets, and that is what got, Mr. Smith his day in court,

24   his four-day postconviction hearing testimony --

25   postconviction hearing.        Larry Boatner took the stand.

 1   What Larry Boatner had to say and what John Ronquillo

 2   had to say -- because after all, these are John

 3   Ronquillo's notes -- I think they are important.              And I

 4   think they're important in a Brady analysis because

 5   those are --

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         There are two components

 7   to Brady.   Should they have been turned over?             And if

 8   they had, is there a reasonable probability of a

 9   different outcome?

10                  MS. ANDRIEU:     There is not.

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Should they have been

12   turned over?    That's the question that I think my

13   colleague asked you, and you're saying no.

14                  MS. ANDRIEU:     No.       I believe that a prudent

15   prosecutor would have.       I believe we're tacking a little

16   bit too close to the wind, but a prudent prosecutor

17   would have.    I also think that --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.    Now

19   articulate what legal theory --

20                  MS. ANDRIEU:     Because it -- because Mr. --

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- would say these are

22   not -- these are not materials that needed to be turned

23   over, when they say:      Could not ID; would not know them

24   if I saw them; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't

 1   don't know how many, that's all; I was too scared to

 2   look at anybody.    And --

 3                 What makes any of those statements --

 4                 MS. ANDRIEU:     If Mr. Boatner could not

 5   identify anyone, Mr. Boatner would not have viewed 15

 6   lineups.    When the lineups were presented to him --

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          This is all a jury

 8   argument.

 9                 MS. ANDRIEU:     I'm sorry --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Tell me why they didn't

11   on their face constitute Brady materials that needed to

12   be turned over.    What's the legal principle that doesn't

13   make them Brady?

14                 MS. ANDRIEU:     Because if they had been

15   presented -- if those statements had been presented to

16   defense -- or presented to a jury, the -- the outcome

17   would have remained the same.            The jury --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How do you know?   How do

19   you know?    How can you possibly know?           The jury is

20   supposed to decide on the credibility of this witness.

21   There's a statement that he made a prior inconsistent

22   statement.   The -- Mr. Shanmugam outlined five

23   categories of what he called Brady material.             Is -- are

14   never made a dying declaration.          What the defense is

15   presenting to this Court as evidence of a dying

18   point --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Was it a determination by

20   the judge that it wasn't a dying declaration?

21               MS. ANDRIEU:     The judge, again, did not make

22   specific facts of finding or law.          The judge -- I'm

23   sorry.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And how about Mims?

 1   because it was not turned over.            And with all respect, I

 2   think you misspoke when you -- you were asked what is --

 3   what is the test for when Brady material must be turned

 4   over.    And you said whether or not there's a reasonable

 5   probability -- a reasonable likelihood -- pardon me -- a

 6   reasonable probability that the result would have been

 7   different.   That's the test for when there has been a

 8   Brady violation.    You don't determine your Brady

 9   obligation by the test for the Brady violation.               You're

10   transposing two very different things.

11                  And so, that's incorrect.

12                  MS. ANDRIEU:     And I'm sorry, Justice

13   Ginsburg, your -- Shelita Russell did not give a dying

14   declaration.    The notes are --

15                  JUDGE GINSBURG:         All right.     Let's go to

16   Mims, who said, I saw them -- I saw the perpetrators go

17   to their car when they were exiting.               They had ski

18   masks.

19                  MS. ANDRIEU:     And that information -- Dale

20   Mims testified at postconviction.             He testified he did

21   not see the assailants arrive.            He did not see them --

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But isn't it most

23   unlikely, as your -- as Mr. Shanmugam said, that

24   robbers -- I mean, the people who are entering,

25   intruding on another's premises to rob, or whatever else

 1   they're going to do, would wear masks going out but not

 2   going in?   I mean, they don't want anybody -- they don't

 3   want anybody to be able to identify them.

 4                MS. ANDRIEU:     And it's plausible that

 5   Mr. Boatner -- I'm sorry -- that Mr. Smith masked

 6   himself upon escape after --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, is that maybe --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I thought -- I'm

 9   sorry.   I thought the idea was they were going to kill

10   everybody who might have seen them inside.               Their only

11   worry would be someone who would see them outside,

12   right?

13                MS. ANDRIEU:     Yes.       So worried that the car

14   that they arrived in had no license plate.               They were

15   definitely looking not to be identified.

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Andrieu, did your office

17   ever consider just confessing error in this case?

18                MS. ANDRIEU:     I'm sorry.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Did your office ever

20   consider just confessing error in this case?                 You've had

21   a bunch of time to think about it.               You know?   We took

22   cert a while ago.   I'm just wondering whether you've

23   ever considered confessing error.

24                MS. ANDRIEU:     Your Honor, we believe that we

25   have an argument that these statements of Larry Boatner


                                    50

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   are not material.   The other evidence that Mr. Shanmugam

 2   has put before this Court were either not suppressed or

 3   not favorable.   The -- Larry Boatner gave several -- he

 4   -- he did describe Juan Smith.            He described him on

 5   several occasions, and he ultimately identified him, and

 6   he identified him after scrupulously viewing 13

 7   line-ups.

 8                So, the suggestion that he said at one

 9   point -- because he's equivocating because his name is

10   on -- his name, address, contact information are on the

11   police report.   It is not a surprise -- and I don't

12   think it would be a surprise to Orleans Parish jurors --

13   to find that, early in an investigation, a murder

14   witness equivocates.    He --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But you're taking that

16   judgment away from the jury.            There was a prior

17   inconsistent statement.      Shouldn't that be the end of

18   it?   A prior inconsistent statement, one that is

19   favorable to the defense, has to be turned over, period.

20   I thought was what Brady requires.

21                MS. ANDRIEU:     And in this case --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I -- may I suggest that --

23                MS. ANDRIEU:     Yes.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- you stop fighting as to

25   whether it should be turned over?            Of course, it should

 1   have been turned over.      I think the case you're making

 2   is that it wouldn't have made a difference.

 3                 MS. ANDRIEU:     Made a difference.        Yes.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         And -- and that's a closer

 5   case, perhaps, but surely it should have been turned

 6   over.   Why don't you give that up?

 7                 MS. ANDRIEU:     Well, I -- and I actually

 8   thought I had when I said a prudent prosecutor would,

 9   but in making a sort of over-the-shoulder, rear-window

10   Brady analysis, I don't think that these statements --

11   that the statements made to -- the statement made to

12   Ronquillo at the scene where he's all shook up and he

13   says, I can't describe anybody; then he goes to the

14   hospital, gets his severe laceration taken care of --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, my worry is the

16   following:    You've read Cullen.

17                 MS. ANDRIEU:     I'm sorry?

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You read Cullen.

19                 MS. ANDRIEU:     Yes.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You read the dissent in

21   Cullen.   There has been serious accusations against the

22   practices of your office, not yours in particular but

23   prior ones.   It is disconcerting to me that when I asked

24   you the question directly should this material have been

25   turned over, you gave an absolute no.             It didn't need to

 1   be.   It would have been prudent, but it didn't need to

 2   be.   That's really troubling.

 3                  MS. ANDRIEU:     And I think I misunderstood

 4   your question -- I think I misunderstood your question.

 5   Should it have been turned over?             Yes.     Now that we are

 6   here 16 years later, and the Court is making --

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That's the second prong

 8   of Brady.   I said there were two prongs to Brady.                 Do

 9   you have to turn it over, and, second, does it cause

10   harm.   And the first one you said not.               That -- it is

11   somewhat disconcerting that your office is still

12   answering equivocally on a basic obligation as one that

13   requires you to have turned these materials over --

14                  MS. ANDRIEU:     Your Honor --

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- whether it caused

16   harm or not.

17                  MS. ANDRIEU:     If -- if I may explain.             I

18   obviously misunderstood your question.                Present-day

19   prosecutors -- oh, I'm sorry.             May I --

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You can, very

21   briefly.

22                  MS. ANDRIEU:     We would have -- today we turn

23   all of this over.    Our only concern is redacting victim

24   information, identifying information, so that -- for

25   victims' safety.    But it -- it should have been turned

 1   over.   I guess what I was addressing or attempting to

 2   address was the materiality prong of Brady.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 7              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                  MR. SHANMUGAM:       Thank you, Mr. Chief

10   Justice.

11                  Just three very quick points.              First of all,

12   with regard to Larry Boatner's statements on March the

13   6th, Justice Breyer, you'll be happy to know that your

14   law clerks' notes were correct.            Boatner on March the

15   6th said -- and this is at page 308 of the joint

16   appendix -- could not ID anyone because couldn't see

17   faces; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't see

18   anyone; would not know them if I saw them.

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:         I'm not surprised they're

20   correct.

21                  (Laughter.)

22                  MR. SHANMUGAM:       It is quite clear that that

23   statement applies to all of the perpetrators.                The State

24   advances the argument today, as it did in its brief,

25   that Boatner must have been too scared to cooperate by


                                      54

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   March the 6th, but that is utterly belied by the record

 2   in this case.   Boatner continued to cooperate with the

 3   police investigation in the following weeks, reviewing

 4   police line-ups.    He even testified that he wanted to go

 5   looking for Petitioner after seeing his photograph in

 6   the New Orleans newspaper, pages 489 and 494 of the

 7   joint appendix.    He didn't leave New Orleans until June,

 8   3 months later, and he actually returned to New Orleans

 9   before Petitioner was even apprehended.               So, again --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:        It is your understanding

11   that the -- that all of Boatner's -- all the notes about

12   Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge

13   before trial for in camera inspection?

14                MR. SHANMUGAM:        Justice Alito, it is

15   entirely unclear based on this record.               Counsel for

16   Respondent cites the transcript from October 31st, 1995,

17   a transcript that wasn't even prepared until after cert

18   was granted in this case.

19                It's clear that the court reviewed

20   something, but it is entirely unclear from that

21   transcript what the court reviewed.               And, of course,

22   even if the court had made an in camera determination,

23   it would no way -- in no way affect our claim after the

24   fact here.

25                My second point:            The State today for the


                                     55

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   first time says, in response to the question from

 2   Justice Scalia, that there was more evidence here

 3   linking Petitioner to the crime and relies on the

 4   testimony of Eddie Young, the brother of Phillip Young,

 5   the individual who was found at the scene.           But the sole

 6   substance of that testimony was that Phillip Young knew

 7   Petitioner.   And we would respectfully submit that that

 8   is scarcely inculpatory, and if it was, anyone in New

 9   Orleans who knows a felon ought to be worried.           And,

10   therefore, we really don't think that that adds anything

11   to the evidence in this case.            The sole evidence linking

12   Petitioner to the crime was the statement -- the

13   testimony of Larry Boatner.

14                 Third, there has been some discussion about

15   the language in this Court's cases in Kyles and Agurs

16   suggesting that prosecutors should err on the side of

17   caution.   That is part of the constitutional standard

18   because, after all, the materiality requirement is part

19   of the requirement for a constitutional violation under

20   Brady.   But all of the evidence at issue here, including

21   Boatner's statements, was withheld from the defense,

22   leaving aside this question of what the trial court may

23   have reviewed in camera.

24                 And the prosecutor's conduct in this case,

25   with all due respect to Ms. Andrieu, was not, quote, "a


                                     56

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   little too close to the wind."         The Orleans Parish

 2   district attorney's office acted with flagrant disregard

 3   for its obligations under Brady in this case.             The Brady

 4   standard has been around for half a century.             There is

 5   no real ambiguity about what that standard requires, and

 6   we think that the conduct in this case was in fact

 7   egregious and clearly violated that standard.             We think

 8   that the trial court erred by rejecting Petitioner's

 9   Brady claim, and for that reason, we think that its

10   judgment should be reversed.

11               Thank you.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel,

13   counsel.

14               The case is submitted.
