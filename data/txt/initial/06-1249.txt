 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 06-1249, Wyeth v. Levine.

 5                Mr. Waxman.

 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                MR. WAXMAN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                This case concerns conflict pre-emption

11   under the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented

12   here is stark.   Repeatedly over the years, the FDA

13   approved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under

14   all the conditions and methods of use described in the

15   labeling, including what is referred to as "IV push"

16   injection.   Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk

17   that the FDA had considered, determined that the precise

18   labeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact

19   rendered Phenergan "unreasonably dangerous."                 That --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Just at the outset, I'll

21   just make one comment.        You argue that it's impossible

22   for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same

23   time the Federal label.         As a textual matter, as a

24   logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that.                 I

25   think I could design a label that's completely


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   consistent and that meets the requirements that the

 2   Respondents wish to urge.

 3               Now, if you want to say that any alteration

 4   of the label violates Federal law, that's something

 5   else.   But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as

 6   a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.

 7               MR. WAXMAN:        Well, let me make sure, because

 8   I do think we do agree, and I want to make sure that I'm

 9   understood, Justice Kennedy.            I think what you've

10   articulated is the test which is, is it possible for a

11   regulated party to comply at the same time with both

12   Federal law and State law?          In other words, could they

13   use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use

14   the precise label that in approving the application in

15   1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the

16   label that the Vermont jury determined should be used,

17   and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening

18   and the closing a statement that you may not, should not

19   use IV administration or IV push, in other words that

20   you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate

21   something --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Waxman --

23               MR. WAXMAN:        -- that --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It didn't say -- it

25   didn't say IV across the board.              It said IV push is the


                                        4

 1   claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was

 2   aware of the IV use and a certain risk.                   But did it

 3   ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV

 4   administered the usual way by a drip bag?

 5                 MR. WAXMAN:        Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg,

 6   and I want to cite you to the portions of the record

 7   that demonstrate that it did.               But before I do so, I

 8   just want to underscore a point that I think is clear

 9   from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief,

10   which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event.

11   The question is what did the labeling say and upon what

12   information was the labeling decision made.

13                 But as to your particular question, there

14   are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record

15   from multiple parties, including experts from both

16   sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of

17   administration and the risk, including IV push.                  Their

18   experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the

19   labeling requires.      But most saliently, the labeling in

20   this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic

21   size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the

22   petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint

23   appendix, have four separate reference that, as we

24   explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply

25   to IV push.


                                          5

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               There is a reference to the use of the Tubex

 2   system.   That is a direct IV push system.                    There is a

 3   reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles.

 4   Again nothing to do with drip.              There is a reference to

 5   a maximum rate of administration.                Drip is gravity.          The

 6   testimony in the case was that an instruction that a

 7   particular rate of administration not be exceeded only

 8   referred to IV push.      And finally, there are cautions on

 9   the label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to

10   see if its bright or dark, which is only done in the

11   context of a needle that is being used to push something

12   into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case

13   because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately.

14               So the labeling plainly comprehended and

15   warned about the specific risks of IV push

16   administration, and that's not all.                     There is an

17   advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to

18   look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to

19   Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is

20   administered intravenously and it made specific

21   recommendations, including recommendations that go

22   directly to IV push.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          How could the -- how could

24   the FDA concluded that IV push was safe and effective

25   when on the benefit side of this you don't have a

 1   life-saving drug, you have a drug that relieves nausea,

 2   and on the risk side you have the risk of gangrene?

 3                MR. WAXMAN:        I mean, there was testimony --

 4   Justice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there

 5   is -- there was testimony in this very case about those

 6   very circumstances in which direct IV injection is

 7   indicated.    And there is also test -- there is also

 8   evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the

 9   1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the

10   context of talking about what warnings had to be

11   provided.    The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20

12   medical journals that addressed this problem, and in

13   footnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that

14   specifically address the circumstances in which IV push

15   administration is an important tool.                     The point here is,

16   I think, that --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that doesn't answer

18   the question of was it -- the risk of gangrene and

19   amputation is there.       No matter what benefit there was,

20   how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?

21                MR. WAXMAN:        Justice Ginsburg, this is

22   labeling that is directed at medical professionals.                     It

23   is labeling that is directed at physicians, who have to

24   be able to determine what method, what pharmaceutical

25   and what method of administration to use, given the


                                         7

 1   constellation of risks and benefits that a particular

 2   patient --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The FDA was never

 4   concerned with risks versus benefit?

 5                MR. WAXMAN:       The FDA -- well, the FDA

 6   certainly is.   And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is

 7   the FDA has to decide what information to provide to

 8   clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to

 9   use.   And it -- what it did here is it provided ample,

10   lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial

11   injection and exposure of an irritant drug like

12   Phenergan to arterial blood.            It provided in the

13   labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of

14   methods of administration.          It said intramuscular

15   injection is the preferred method.                 It then said with

16   respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any

17   irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it

18   into an IV infusion set that is known to be running

19   properly, in other words where a line has already been

20   established into the vein and the IV push occurs into

21   the line that's already established.

22                All that information was available to

23   physicians and the FDA has to understand and does

24   understand that in labeling to allow medical

25   professionals to make their judgments, taking options


                                        8

 1   away from physicians is not always better.                 It may

 2   not -- it may not even often be better.                 What the FDA

 3   has to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on

 4   the table and what's off the table and in terms of

 5   what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is

 6   this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted?

 7   The testimony in this case and in the administrative

 8   record was yes, there are circumstances --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'd like you to

10   address the distinction between the medical device area

11   and the drug area because in the medical device area, of

12   course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while

13   here in contrast you don't.

14               MR. WAXMAN:        Yes.       I mean, I think,

15   Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in

16   which this is difference than the medical device area.

17   But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case

18   directly points the Court to the nature of the

19   determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3

20   drugs.   It goes through the same preclearance process.

21   As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice

22   Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing

23   time-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical

24   devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and

25   it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the


                                        9

 1   particular drug in light of the conditions and methods

 2   of administration prescribed in the labeling.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If that's true you

 4   would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a

 5   similar express pre-emption provision.                  And one reason

 6   perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was

 7   passed you had an established background of State

 8   actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you

 9   didn't.

10                MR. WAXMAN:       Well, let me address both the

11   established background of State actions and then the

12   pre-emption clause difference, if I may.                 The Respondent

13   and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150

14   years in which tort actions have been brought with

15   respect to pharmaceuticals.            Very few of those cases --

16   and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that

17   the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is

18   where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the

19   information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling

20   standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can

21   reach a different conclusion about what is on the label.

22   The most -- those cases I believe all post-date

23   Cipollone.   Many of them postdate Geier.                And by my

24   count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of

25   the cases that have been decided and those issues --


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that issue had never come up and never could have come

 2   up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was

 3   only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific,

 4   preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the

 5   FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of

 6   licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance

 7   safety against effectiveness.

 8                And so the -- the constellation of common

 9   law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are

10   not seeking here a rule of field preemption.            We are not

11   seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that

12   violates Federal law.

13                What we are saying here is -- and this goes,

14   I think, finally to your point about the express

15   pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed

16   pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a

17   savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot

18   affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the

19   Federal Constitution.

20                Now, members of this Court are concerned

21   about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis

22   of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is

23   heartland.   A jury was asked to look at the same

24   information and conclude that the precise language that

25   the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to


                                       11

 1   use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, it required it

 3   because that is what the FDA had approved as a label.

 4   But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the

 5   company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any

 6   time and said, either based on experience or just our

 7   rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label

 8   ought to be changed to say "Don't use IV push."                  Wyeth

 9   could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't

10   do it.

11                And the -- the reason I raise this is

12   because it could have done it at any time, where, going

13   back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the

14   conflict?

15                MR. WAXMAN:       The liability in this case was

16   not predicated on the fact that Wyeth didn't go to the

17   -- remember, the FDA had approved this label two years

18   before Miss Levine was injured.              In approving the label,

19   it rejected stronger proposed language that Wyeth had

20   presented.   There was nothing that was -- Wyeth was --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But as I understand it,

22   Wyeth's argument is not this argument.                  Wyeth is not

23   saying the reason there is a conflict here is that we

24   tried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury,

25   in effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't

 1   allow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict

 2   between a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont

 3   rule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied.

 4              MR. WAXMAN:           Right.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:               As I understand it, Wyeth's

 6   argument is:     Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the

 7   standard of conflict.        It doesn't matter whether we

 8   tried or could have tried or didn't try.                   You simply

 9   look at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury

10   did; and if there is a -- if there is a difference

11   between them, there is a conflict.                   Am I right about

12   your argument?

13              MR. WAXMAN:           Yes, you are right.           We -- we

14   have both an impossibility form of conflict because, in

15   the absence of any new information or new analyses of

16   old information, we could not make the change in advance

17   of getting approval.        And we also have an -- an

18   objects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption

19   because the Vermont jury decided on the same information

20   that the labeling that the FDA had approved and required

21   was unreasonably unsafe.

22              And we cannot have a world in which the very

23   day after an intensive process -- the FDA says you may

24   distribute this drug, but you must use this specific

25   language -- either, A, manufacturers can just run in and

 1   change the label and ask for permission down the road;

 2   or, B, that a State jury -- let's take the easier case

 3   -- a State legislature or 50 State legislatures can

 4   decide:   Because you could have gone back and asked, we

 5   can impose an obligation on you that you must have done

 6   so or must have changed the labeling.                    That just is

 7   inconsistent with --

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, is it -- is it strict

 9   liability or negligence?          In other words, are they

10   saying you must have done so, or are they saying because

11   you could have done so and didn't you did not conform to

12   the standard of care?

13               MR. WAXMAN:         Either a negligence theory or a

14   strict-liability theory would be pre-empted.

 1   conflict with the FDA's determination that Phenergan

 2   injection is safe and effective under the conditions of

 3   use recommended or suggested in the labeling.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Kneedler, at the

 5   outset, would you clarify something that is central, I

 6   think, to this case?     Some of the briefs tell us that

 7   this represents a change of policy on the part of the

 8   FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts

 9   were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's

10   own efforts to protect consumers.               They helped because

11   they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that

12   were either unknown or under- evaluated.               Was that once

13   the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?

14              MR. KNEEDLER:          The -- the FDA, to my

15   knowledge, has never taken the position that -- that, as

16   a general matter, a manufacturer may change a label

17   without -- without the existence of new information that

18   justifies a revision.     The Respondents and the amici

19   relied primarily on some snippets of rule-making

20   proceedings and things like that in which FDA has

21   referred to the existence of tort remedies.               But we are

22   not arguing for the proposition that tort remedies are

23   -- are pre-empted as a general matter.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:            But when -- when would

25   there be a tort remedy?       What -- what situation would

 1   you envision?

 2              MR. KNEEDLER:            As Mr. Waxman mentioned, if

 3   -- if the State standard was the same as the Federal

 4   standard, there wouldn't be any conflict.                And, for

 5   example, if -- and not to mention the fact if there was

 6   adulteration of -- of the product or if the -- if the

 7   product in the box was not the same --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:              What if they found out

 9   about new information which would, if properly

10   considered, alter what the labeling ought to be?               Would

11   there be a tort remedy for the failure to bring that new

12   information to the attention of --

13              MR. KNEEDLER:            Well, the position we are

14   arguing for here would not cover that situation, but --

15   but there could be a further situation of pre-emption,

16   if I could just explain why.             I think --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              You mean if you failed to

18   provide the FDA the new information that you think

19   negates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still

20   couldn't be sued?

21              MR. KNEEDLER:            No.      If you -- if you failed

22   to provide it altogether, there would not be a -- a

23   pre-emption defense if there were -- if your

24   failure-to-warn claim was based on the new information

25   that you didn't furnish.

 1              I was -- I was going to identify the

 2   situation where -- and this has come up in the anti-

 3   depressant drug situation, for example, where there is

 4   evolving information.        There has been a rule- making

 5   petition, in fact several over the years, to the FDA to

 6   change the labeling to warn against -- to warn about the

 7   possibility of suicidal ideation.                         And FDA has

 8   rejected that even though it's -- it's new information

 9   arising after the drug was approved.                      If the information

10   is brought to the FDA's attention and FDA rejects the

11   proposed change, then you would you have conflict

12   pre-emption again.      But if the information was never

13   brought to the FDA's attention in the first place, then

14   -- then there would -- it would be not inconsistent with

15   Federal law to have a tort suit based on that.                     If it's

16   -- if it's been proposed and rejected, then you're back

17   with a conflict.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:               What if -- what if you

19   brought it to the FDA's attention and the FDA just

20   hasn't acted on it?       You would be authorized to change

21   the label on your own.

22              MR. KNEEDLER:             You would be authorized, but

23   if FDA then rejects -- rejects the labeling --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I understand, but in the

25   interim, you could -- could you be subject to a State

 1   tort suit for not changing the label when -- when you

 2   had the power to do so?

 3                 MR. KNEEDLER:         I -- if -- if FDA has taken

 4   no action at all, then I think you -- you could be.              I

 5   this it's very likely that FDA would have acted by the

 6   -- by the time that -- I mean, I suppose there could be

 7   a window in there before it was approved.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But why is that -- why is

 9   that likely, considering the huge number of drugs?              I

10   mean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that

11   have this approval.      Is the FDA really monitoring every

12   one of those to see if there is some new information

13   that should change the label?

14                 MR. KNEEDLER:         If I could make two points

15   about that:    The first is, as I said, we are not arguing

16   that there is pre-emption in a situation where there is

17   new information that is not brought to FDA's attention.

18                 But the second point is that in the 2007

19   amendments to the Act, Congress recognized the

20   difficulties with this and gave FDA important new

21   enforcement tools and resources to go after the problem

22   of things that arise after a drug is improved --

23   approved, that has given FDA the authority to direct a

24   change in the label, which it did not have before.

25                 It has given the FDA the authority to order

 1   new clinical studies, and it has ordered FDA to set up a

 2   data system where it will get electronic notification of

 3   -- of adverse events.

 4                I -- I should point out in the -- in the one

 5   year since these amendments were passed, FDA has, I -- I

 6   think, in 21 instances ordered clinical trials.            In four

 7   instances it has ordered a revision of labeling.            It has

 8   hired 430 new employees in the Center for Drug

 9   Evaluation and Research to address the post-marketing

10   situation.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           Why isn't -- why isn't the

12   fact that some certain number of people are getting

13   gangrene, why isn't that new information?

14                MR. KNEEDLER:         The risk -- the way FDA --

15   and this is set forth in the changes being affected

16   regulation amendment that was --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           That was all passed long

18   after the events here took place, I think.

19                MR. KNEEDLER:         But -- but --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           So at the time, you read

21   the regulation, I think a person would think that he was

22   free drug manufacturer if he learned something new to

23   strengthen -- strengthens the contraindication, put it

24   in.

25                MR. KNEEDLER:         As FDA explained in 2008,


                                       19

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   when it promulgated this regulation, it's been FDA's

 2   long-standing interpretation that only new information

 3   would justify a change.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:             Why wouldn't that be new?

 5                MR. KNEEDLER:           New information means new

 6   information about a risk that is greater in severity or

 7   frequency.     If you have --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:             If you get a certain number

 9   of cases.

10                MR. KNEEDLER:           There is no claim -- there is

11   no claim here that either of those -- in the record in

12   this case, that either of those was true.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:             That's because nobody

14   brought up this new information point.                    So if nobody

15   brought up the new information point at the trial and if

16   the burden is on the manufacturer to show that it's

17   pre-empted, isn't that the manufacturer's fault, because

18   if you simply read the regulation, you wouldn't find any

19   of all this complicated stuff about certain kinds of new

20   information.

21                MR. KNEEDLER:           That's a legal question not a

22   factual.    And it was argued to the Vermont --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes it's a legal question.

24                MR. KNEEDLER:           It was argued to the Vermont

25   Supreme Court, and I don't think -- I don't think that

 1   Respondent -- Respondent has noted that it wasn't

 2   raised, but I don't think it's argued that it's waived.

 3   And I think for the Court to fully address this

 4   situation, I think it would be good to take into account

 5   FDA's -- certainly going forward that is the regulatory

 6   regime --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:             But we are not making an

 8   advisory opinion.    We are deciding this case.              And this

 9   case here you say new information of a certain kind

10   would be okay, nobody argued it.                You read the reg, and

11   it doesn't seem to make all these distinctions end of

12   case.   Since the manufacturer has the burden of going

13   into this, which apparently it didn't do.                So, now we

14   have decided this case, and we go on to the next one.

15               MR. KNEEDLER:           Okay.       If I could make just

16   one further --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             What's your response to

18   that?

19               MR. KNEEDLER:           If I could make one further

20   point about that.    And that is the -- this act sets up a

21   prior approval situation.           In other words, Congress

22   wanted the FDA to look at the drug in advance,

23   balance -- against benefits as this Court said in

24   Rutherford, and -- Brown & Williamson, strike a balance

25   and approve it.

 1                It would be fundamentally inconsistent with

 2   a prior approval system to have a regime in which the

 3   very next day State law could require the manufacturer

 4   to change the very labeling that FDA has struck a

 5   balance --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I don't understand what

 7   we're talking about here.            The new information was not

 8   brought up by either side --

 9                MR. KNEEDLER:           Right.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- showing increased

11   frequency or increased severity?

12                MR. KNEEDLER:           That's correct.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Right?

14                And supposedly, it was burden of the drug

15   company to show --

16                MR. KNEEDLER:           No.      The drug company says

17   it's pre-empted, and the only escape hatch from the

18   preemption is new information.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You agree with -- you

20   agree with Mr. Waxman that the FDA specifically

21   addressed the risks and benefits of IV push as opposed

22   to the risks of arterial exposures?

23                MR. KNEEDLER:           It specifically addressed in

24   the labeling that the FDA approved, and I think that's

25   all that needs to be looked at in -- it's just as in


                                         22

 1   Riegle, where the preemption turns on that device, in

 2   that case, and the labeling that was presented.             Here

 3   the preemption turns on the labeling and the drug that

 4   was presented.    And FDA regulations prohibit the change

 5   unless there is new information.

 6                 If I could make one other point about

 7   Riegle.   Riegle does contain an FDA -- an expressed

 8   preemption provision.       But the reason why this Court

 9   found preemption in Riegle under that provision is very

10   instructive here, because as Mr. Waxman pointed out, the

11   premarket approval process in the two situations are

12   essentially the same.

13                 And what you had on the one hand was Federal

14   action having the force of law like under the file rate

15   doctrine or some administrative determination having the

16   force of law approving a license or -- or a drug, a

17   legal prohibition against changing that without new

18   information.    And on the state side, you have a rule of

19   law under the common law of torts imposing a different

20   obligation.    Those are squarely termed --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You're talking about

22   changing but you can supplement without changing the

23   label.

24                 MR. KNEEDLER:         No -- no, you cannot.       Any --

25   any change in the wording of -- of the label is a change

 1   that requires FDA approval unless it is --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You can supplement only

 3   when there is new information?

 4               MR. KNEEDLER:           When there is new information

 5   and even then, it has to be in the form of a new drug --

 6   a supplemental drug application to the agency.

17   be revised -- this is after an applicant, a sponsor has

18   obtained approval of the drug label -- "it shall be

19   revised to include a warning as soon as there is

20   reasonable evidence of an association of a serious risk

21   with a drug.    A causal relationship need not have been

22   proved."

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.       Those -- those

 5   risks were set forth on the labeling approved by the

 6   FDA.     Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to

 7   include a warning as soon, as soon as there is

 8   reasonable evidence of an association of a serious

 9   hazard that the FDA has not considered.                   And that is not

10   already addressed on the labeling.                   I mean to read it

11   as -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered

12   by the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out

13   of it.

14                 MR. FREDERICK:          FDA never considered any

15   comparative risks of IV push versus IV drip.                   The

16   evidence on this was clear.              Wyeth had a --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the

18   various portions of the label in the record that

19   Mr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the

20   FDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks?

21                 MR. FREDERICK:          What the evidence showed was

22   that FDA certainly was aware that there are different

23   forms of intravenous administration of drugs, but it

24   never considered that the risk of IV push so greatly

25   increased the risks of a catastrophic injury --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, they have to.

 2   When they determine that it's safe to use it under those

 3   circumstances that necessarily includes a consideration

 4   of the risk.     People can say it's safe for you to walk

 5   down the sidewalk.      That doesn't mean there is no risk

 6   that you get hit by lightning or something else.                   It

 7   just means in evaluating them together, they determine

 8   that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a

 9   physician determines that that's the indicated method.

10               MR. FREDERICK:            Mr. Chief Justice, here

11   there was no way FDA could have made this determination

12   because the risks of IV push are so catastrophic

13   compared to the benefit which the testimony at trial

14   showed --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, you're just

16   contradicting the label.           The fact is they could not

17   have approved that label unless they made that

18   determination.

19               Now, if you're telling me the FDA acted

20   irresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA.

21               MR. FREDERICK:            No.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But the labeling made it

23   very clear that the preferred method of administering

24   this medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that

25   there were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push.

 1                Moreover, your client didn't follow the

 2   labeling or your client's physician didn't follow the

 3   labeling prescription for IV push, did he?

 4                MR. FREDERICK:          The testimony at trial

 5   showed that the doctor acted with a standard of care

 6   that was not negligent, and that was based on expert

 7   testimony.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.     No.      Wait, wait.   He

 9   administered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in

10   excess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could

11   safely be used for IV push.

12                MR. FREDERICK:          And the testimony at trial

13   showed that that had no bearing on her injury,

14   because --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Had no bearing.        Are you

16   serious?

17                MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.       It did.     The testimony

18   at trial from Dr. Green disputed that point.                   Both

19   courts below rejected that notion.

20                But the idea that a label is set in stone

21   for all time misunderstands the way the process works.

22   When FDA approves a drug with a drug label, it does so

23   on the basis of small clinical trials with very few,

24   sometimes as few as a thousand or a couple of thousand

25   people.    And when the drug is marketed and goes to lots

 1   and lots of people that are not healthy, that are in

 2   different conditions, new problems arise.                  That's why

 3   the general -- the GAO found that over 51 percent of

 4   drugs have adverse drug events not known.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You established that there

 6   were new problems?      I mean, if there were new problems,

 7   then -- then they could have simply supplemented the

 8   labeling.   But did you establish that there were

 9   problems that had not been considered already by the

10   FDA?

11               I mean, the labeling says, you know, that

12   this is dangerous to use -- use IV push.                  It made it

13   very clear that it's dangerous.

14               MR. FREDERICK:            That was not our burden and

15   that was not how the testimony came in at trial.                  But as

16   the amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani, et al. at pages 54

17   establishes had Wyeth been a reasonably prudent

18   manufacturer over the years, it would have known that

19   the risks of IV push so far outweigh any bearing

20   negligible benefits, that it would have offered a

21   stronger instruction, it would have moved to revise its

22   label either with FDA approval or --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It proposed a more

24   restrictive label to the FDA, didn't it?                  And the FDA

25   said, no, you use this label.               In other words, it's --

 1   what you're saying was not its call.                    It was the call of

 2   the FDA.

 3              MR. FREDERICK:           Footnote one of the Vermont

 4   Supreme Court's opinion disputes that point, because it

 5   says the label was different.             And if you compare what

 6   was submitted to FDA versus what FDA looked at, there

 7   was no reference to IV push risks creating the risk of

 8   catastrophic harm versus negligible, Justice Scalia.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I thought your -- I

10   thought your theory was that this type of administration

11   of the drug should not be allowed.                 The label should not

12   say here are the risks, here are the benefits.                   You --

13   your jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling

14   that physicians should have this available.

15              MR. FREDERICK:           Well, as the jury was

16   instructed, Mr. Chief Justice, and the evidence came in

17   at trial, it was -- it was somewhat larger than that in

18   the sense that a State failure to warn claim doesn't

19   prescribe particular wording.             It simply says that the

20   existing wording is inadequate.              And if the case comes

21   to this Court --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, it simply says

23   that if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't

24   have to pay $10 million whenever it comes wrong.                   That's

25   having the effect, as our case has established, imposing


                                       29

 1   a limitation on the label.

 2              MR. FREDERICK:          But the label itself is not

 3   set in stone, Mr. Chief Justice.              Manufacturers change

 4   their labels all the time as new drug risks come in.

 5   And the regulations provide that the manufacturer is

 6   responsible not only for the label, but for monitoring

 7   post-market information.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your case depends

 9   upon us determining that the risk at issue here that was

10   presented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did

11   not consider?

12              MR. FREDERICK:          No.      It's not dependent on

13   that at all, Mr. Chief Justice.             It is dependent on a

14   finding that the manufacturer had a duty of due care and

15   it didn't live up to that.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if it referred to new

17   drug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you

18   are saying manufacturers change it all the time as new

19   drug risks become apparent?

20              MR. FREDERICK:          The testimony --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What you mean is whether or

22   not new drug risks become apparent, they have to change,

23   right?

24              MR. FREDERICK:          The question is what does

25   the manufacturer know and when did this manufacturer


                                      30

 1   know it?     And here, the testimony at trial showed that

 2   an antinausea drug called Vistrol -- this is at page 79

 3   of the joint appendix -- caused amputations in two

 4   cases.     Pfizer voluntarily removed IV push injection for

 5   that drug.     This was information in Wyeth's files; Wyeth

 6   knew this from the 1970s; and yet it did nothing to

 7   change the Phenergan label.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Suppose --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            With respect to the

10   obligation in this case, may I go back to an earlier

11   question that Justice Scalia asked you?                     And I -- I --

12   if you responded to this particular point, I didn't get

13   it.

14                 He said that he understood that Wyeth had in

15   fact asked the FDA to modify the label, at least to

16   strengthen the warning against IV push, and that request

17   was -- was denied, so that in fact that -- that created

18   the conflict.    What is your response to -- to the

19   factual basis for that -- for that comment?

20                 MR. FREDERICK:          Well, the FDA itself said in

21   the Solicitor General's brief at page 25 that it was

22   deemed to be a nonsubstantive change.                     These were

23   changes that were being made --

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, regardless of what

25   their, their semantic label was, was there a request at


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   least to -- to beef up the warning against using IV

 2   push?   And if so, did the -- did the FDA reject it and

 3   say no, you can't do that.

 4               MR. FREDERICK:            It was a different label and

 5   it was a different strength of warning, but it didn't

 6   have to do with the relative risks and benefits of IV

 7   push versus IV drip.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:              What would it --

 9               MR. FREDERICK:            That was the crucial point.

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:              What would it have said?

11               MR. FREDERICK:            This is set out at footnote

12   1 of the Vermont Supreme Court opinion, which is set out

13   in the joint -- in the petition appendix at pages 4a to

14   5a, and it goes on for two pages.                  But essentially what

15   the -- what the comparison was was talking about the

16   preferability of injecting it through the tubing of an

17   intravenous infusion set that is known to be functioning

18   satisfactorily, which would suggest to most medical

19   practitioners and was it the case in the trial testimony

20   given by Dr. Green below, that that would suggest an IV

21   drip, not IV push.

22               When FDA then rejected it for -- for

23   nonsubstantive reasons, it went back to the prior

24   verbiage which is set out at 5a, which simply says if

25   you put this drug in an artery the concentration can be


                                         32

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   such that it will -- it will cause harm.

 2              But our point is that these kinds of risks

 3   come to light frequently with drugs that are on the

 4   market and the need to revise these labels is the duty

 5   of the manufacturer.     Section 314. --

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you -- you also, to be

 7   clear on it, as I understand it, you do not accept the

 8   position that the FDA puts forward, that the obligation

 9   depends upon the accrual of new information.

10              MR. FREDERICK:          Well, how you --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Any information, new or

12   old, as I understand it, on your argument raises this

13   obligation to -- to act.

14              MR. FREDERICK:          I think that the dispute is

15   -- is what constitutes new information, because we don't

16   take issue with the notion that new information can be

17   new analysis of prior submitted data; and what the

18   amicus brief by Dr. Budhwani et al. Points out is that

19   there was a lot of unpublished information about the

20   harms of Phenergan that was known to Wyeth or should

21   have been known to Wyeth in the '80s and '90s that would

22   have justified a change under the CEE regulations.

23              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, suppose the record

24   showed that the FDA clearly considered whether IV push

25   should be contraindicated and concluded it should not be


                                      33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and prescribed the label that now appears on the drug;

 2   and then, as some of the other arguments have

 3   referenced, the very day after the FDA made that ruling,

 4   Ms. Levine was injured.         Would you still -- would she

 5   still have a claim in your view, a non-pre-empted claim?

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:         That be pre-empted.         And the

 7   reason it would be pre-empted is because the FDA would

 8   have considered and rejected on the basis of the same

 9   information or similar information the very duty that

10   underlies the State claim.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:         So your argument is -- is

12   predicated on the existence of new information.                  If

13   there was no new information, then the claim is

14   pre-empted?

15                 MR. FREDERICK:         No, it's -- well, it is

16   not -- I think there are two things to keep analytically

17   clear.   One is can the manufacturer come forward with a

18   label change on the basis of -- of information that is

19   assessing the risk or reassessing the risk, and under

20   the -- under the regulations it's absolutely clear it

21   can do that before FDA has approved it.                  It is subject

22   to FDA disapproval.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And -- and is entitled to

24   amend the labeling automatically.

25                 MR. FREDERICK:         That's correct.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I envision a -- a scheme

 2   under which manufacturers who are worried about jury

 3   liability of -- of the magnitude that occurred in this

 4   case saying, gee, why should we take chances?           And every

 5   time there is a jury verdict on some -- on some other --

 6   some other ground not -- not prohibited by the label,

 7   they just add that to the label; and they submit it

 8   to -- to the FDA and the -- and until -- unless and

 9   until the FDA conducts an investigation and disapproves

10   that label, that labeling change occurs.

11              How many -- how many -- you mentioned a

12   number of -- of times that -- that label alterations

13   are -- are proposed.     I mean, this is going to be a

14   massive operation for the FDA.

15              MR. FREDERICK:          Justice Scalia, that would

16   promote public safety, because it puts into the hands of

17   doctors the information that enables them to make

18   individualized risk determinations.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would not promote public

20   safety if you believe that the name of this game is

21   balancing benefits and costs.

22              MR. FREDERICK:          And Congress said --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And if you are simply

24   eliminating certain drugs which people who -- who have

25   real desperate need for could -- could be benefited by,


                                      35

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you're not benefiting the public.

 2              MR. FREDERICK:          No, and in fact that's

 3   contrary to the policy determination Congress made.               In

 4   the misbranding provision, which is Section 352(f), it

 5   calls -- that the label is misbranded unless its

 6   labeling bears adequate directions for use and such

 7   adequate warnings against use in those pathological

 8   conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous

 9   to health or against unsafe dosage or methods or

10   duration of administration or application.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that applies even if

12   it's approved by the FDA?

13              MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.       It's misbranded.   And

14   in the 1979 --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're saying FDA approval

16   doesn't -- doesn't give you any protection at all?

17              MR. FREDERICK:          It -- it provides you a

18   basis for marketing your --- your product.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            But -- but -- but the

20   marketing may be a misbranding?

21              MR. FREDERICK:          In -- the FDA itself said so

22   in 1979 in 44 Federal Register, which we cite in our

24   the drug manufacturer subsequently learns that it was

25   not adequate for the safe use of the drug.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well then, gee, then all of

 2   the qualifications you were making earlier about whether

 3   it's new information or a new assessment, that's

 4   irrelevant.

 5                 MR. FREDERICK:         No, it's --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You're saying whenever it's

 7   unsafe, whatever the FDA has approved, you have a

 8   lawsuit.

 9                 MR. FREDERICK:         No.      What I'm saying is that

10   the information developed after the original label is

11   approved, and it is not a floor and a ceiling --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           There -- there was nothing

13   about new information in what you just said.              You said

14   it's misbranded if it's not safe, new information or

15   not.

16                 MR. FREDERICK:         And that's --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that -- is that -- is

18   that your position?

19                 MR. FREDERICK:         Our position is that the

20   duty is on the manufacturer to make a safe label, and if

21   the label is --

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But getting to Justice

23   Scalia's point, as I understand your answer to an

24   earlier question, on the day that the FDA approves the

25   label, if there is no further information indicating


                                        37

 1   danger, then any liability that is based upon what the

 2   -- the kind of information that the FDA knew would be

 3   pre-empted.    The only time -- you're saying pre-emption

 4   does not occur when there is -- forget the word "new"

 5   for a moment -- when there is further information,

 6   information in addition to what the FDA was told,

 7   whether it's 1,000 years old or discovered yesterday;

 8   and if there is liability predicated on further

 9   information beyond what the FDA was told, then there is

10   not pre-emption.

11                 Is that a fair statement of your position?

12                 MR. FREDERICK:         That's fair, but let me just

13   make clear that our test would require the FDA to

14   consider and reject the specific basis on which the

15   State law --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           If that's a fair statement

17   then you have to retract your -- your earlier assertion

18   that whenever it's not safe it's misbranded.              I mean --

19                 MR. FREDERICK:         I'm not going to retract

20   that, Justice Scalia.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- which is it?   Whenever

22   it's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just

23   responded to Justice Souter?

24                 MR. FREDERICK:         The basis -- the basis of

25   the FDA's approval is on the basis of limited


                                        38

 1   information, which Congress has said for public safety

 2   reasons -- we are not doing a balancing here; we are

 3   doing this for public safety --

 4               And if the label is not adequate for public

 5   safety it is a misbranded drug.

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, but if -- if the

 7   so-called misbranding is determined to be misbranding,

 8   based upon information which was given to the FDA, as I

 9   understand your position, you would admit that there was

10   pre-emption.

11               MR. FREDERICK:          I -- I think there is

12   pre-emption, but that does not mean --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       So there --

14               MR. FREDERICK:          Maybe there is no --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:            In other words, there is

16   that one exception at least to the broad statement that

17   you gave in answer to Justice Scalia?

18               MR. FREDERICK:          Let me try to untangle it

19   this way.   The fact that there is pre-emption and you

20   cannot bring as State law failure-to-warn claim doesn't

21   mean that the drug isn't misbranded under the Federal

22   standard the FDA --

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the -- but the

24   misbranding is of no consequence to liability.

25               MR. FREDERICK:          Well, if --

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:            In other words, I think

 2   you're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption

 3   it may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery

 4   in a State tort suit.

 5              MR. FREDERICK:          That's correct.         The -- the

 6   point --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       So misbranding under

 8   those circumstances is a purely theoretical concept.

 9              MR. FREDERICK:          In that very hypothetical,

10   yes.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

12              MR. FREDERICK:          But the point is that the

13   failure is that the failure-to-warn claim tracks the

14   misbranding provision; and if you look at the jury

15   instructions in this case, the wording is very close to

16   the wording of the misbranding provision in terms of the

17   adequacy of the warning that must be provided.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Frederick --

19              MR. FREDERICK:          All State law is doing is

20   providing a remedy that is absent from Federal law.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Frederick, I'd like to

22   put the misbranding point to one side and just

23   concentrate on pre-emption.           And I understood you to

24   agree with Justice Alito that there is a hypothetical

25   case in which there would be pre-emption, and would you


                                      40
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   tell me what particular fact distinguishes your case

 2   from his hypothetical?

 3                MR. FREDERICK:          The fact is there was no

 4   consideration and rejection of a stronger IV push

 5   warning.    There was no consideration by the FDA of IV

 6   push as a means of administration distinct from other

 7   intravenous forms that would lead to a different kind of

 8   risk-benefit balancing.         So with the -- in the case

 9   where there would be pre-emption, FDA would be asked, we

10   -- we want to put a stronger warning as against this --

11   FDA says:   We don't think there is scientific evidence.

12   Do not put that warning on the label.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So now, your friends

14   on the other side said there was specific consideration

15   of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and

16   that that is laid forth in the labeling.                  So, as I

17   understood your answer to be, all we have to do is

18   simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA

19   considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to

20   general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we

21   determine that they did not, then they lose.

22                MR. FREDERICK:          And the Vermont Supreme

23   Court was quite emphatic about this, Mr. Chief Justice.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I don't know

25   if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it.                  I


                                        41

 1   mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm

 2   more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and

 3   they either address IV push separately or they don't.

 4              MR. FREDERICK:             And you search in the joint

 5   appendix in vain for communications between Wyeth and

 6   FDA communicating about the particular risks of IV push.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                What -- can you turn to

 8   the references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made?

 9   They said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely

10   from IV drip bags.

11              MR. FREDERICK:             I will acknowledge that the

12   references in some instances suggest IV push.              There is

13   no doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of

14   intravenous administration, but our point is a starker

15   one, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test

16   of deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push

17   versus IV drip.   And it's that point that is crucial,

18   because the catastrophic risks of IV push are so

19   dramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety

20   determination to allow this drug with its risks when

21   there are corresponding benefits that create exactly the

22   same kind of treatment of care for the patient.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, is your argument that

24   they couldn't have considered these comparative risks,

25   because if they had, they would have come out


                                         42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   differently; because they didn't come out differently,

 2   we have to infer that they didn't consider it?

 3              MR. FREDERICK:          It's two things:      One, they

 4   didn't consider it and that's clearly --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, I --

 6              MR. FREDERICK:          Second,

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Apart from your analysis

 8   that they couldn't have or they would have come out

 9   differently, how did we know that they didn't consider

10   it?

11              MR. FREDERICK:          There are communications

12   that went back and forth between the company.             These are

13   set out in the joint appendix.             They make no reference

14   to IV push risks as distinct from --

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And do these -- when you

16   say "communications," do you mean starting with the

17   original application for approval of the label?

18              MR. FREDERICK:          The original application

19   actually is not known.      It wasn't in Wyeth's files.

20   This drug was approved in 1955.             We don't know where the

21   original label was, Justice Souter.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            So, you are saying all the

23   correspondence that we do know about, that is extant,

24   fails to mention comparative risk.

25              MR. FREDERICK:          That's correct.      And --


                                      43

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But the label doesn't.     I

 2   mean, the label ask discusses the high risk from IV push

 3   and sets forth particular cautions for that -- for that

 4   specific means of administration.

 5              MR. FREDERICK:           It does not, Justice Scalia.

 6   The label says -- it's talking about intravenous

 7   administration.   It does not distinguish between IV drip

 8   and IV push.   And Dr. Matthew testified at trial that,

 9   based on the label, he would not have been able to make

10   a treatment determination to distinguish between the

11   two, and that had he had that information, he clearly

12   would have given this drug to Diana Levine through the

13   intravenous drip method.         The label simply didn't --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If we conclude that new

15   information is the criterion for deciding this case, if

16   we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset

17   allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if

18   there's new information, then the label has to be

19   changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this

20   verdict be sustained?

21              MR. FREDERICK:           Yes, I think it can be

22   sustained on the basis of --

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And the Vermont court's

24   opinion?

25              MR. FREDERICK:           I don't think that the

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Vermont Supreme Court's opinion totally, because it does

 2   go into the area that you're talking about, Justice

 3   Kennedy, but if I could refer the Court to trial record

 4   testimony, which is set out in the joint appendix and

 5   more elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes

 6   clear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these

 7   comparative risks.      It should have had a basis for

 8   changing its label or proposing to FDA a different

 9   label, and that would be sufficient to satisfy the

10   Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care.

11   And we think the judgment on that basis could be

12   sustained.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this:      When did

14   the duty on the part of Wyeth to have a different label

15   arise, in your view?

16                MR. FREDERICK:           I think it probably arose in

17   the early '70s when a -- when there was a published --

18   or there was an incident --

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Did it arise before or

20   after submitting the original drug application?

21                MR. FREDERICK:           A strong argument can be

22   made that it would have been before the 1970s

23   application when they were reformatting.                  These are old

24   drugs.   We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would

25   have suggested that the original label determination in


                                         45

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the

 2   1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old

 3   drug to comply with new standards, it should have known

 4   and it certainly should have known by the 1990s when

 5   several amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan,

 6   which were in Wyeth's files.              The people who analyzed

 7   these records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew

 8   or should have known by the 1990s.                   And that was clear

 9   by the testimony of experts that -- that showed the

10   comparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the

11   basis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that

12   were nonpublished.      They appeared to have been reported

13   to FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the

14   synthesis, to connect the dots between these very

15   terrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to

16   bring about a labeling change or a modification that

17   would have saved lives.          And that is a failure on the

18   part of the manufacturer not to comply with its

19   standards of due care and with the regulations which

20   require health risk information to be the basis of

21   modifications to the labeling.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Does that boil down to a

23   claim that there was new information that was available

24   between the original approval and the time of the

25   lawsuit?

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. FREDERICK:         Well, by "original

 2   approval," do you mean 1955 or do you mean in 1998 and

 3   2000?

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Either one.        But is your

 5   theory really a theory based on new information or new

 6   judgment about old information?

 7                MR. FREDERICK:         It would be on the basis, I

 8   think, of both.   I think we would be able to establish

 9   that there was a justification on the basis of

10   information before the reformatted labeling took place,

11   and that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the

12   basis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred

13   with Phenergan in 1965.

14                And the -- the important point here is that

15   on the basis of new information, if you are going to

16   conclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I

17   would urge you to consider two things:                  One is that the

18   burden of showing absence of new information is going to

19   fall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a

20   pre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued

21   in the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is

22   permitted.   So, if there is information in the drug

23   manufacturer's files that would be relevant to a

24   determination of the breach of duty by the drug

25   manufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done


                                       47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   before discovery can be done, there would be no way to

 2   get that information.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, to put the burden on

 4   the manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10

 5   States have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption

 6   and inconsistent also with the instructions the jury

 7   received in this case, that you can consider the FDA

 8   label.   So, I think, to me, what you say there is not

 9   borne out by what happened in this case or by those

10   other States' --

11               MR. FREDERICK:          Well, let me -- let me

12   address that question because your question goes to the

13   regulatory compliance defense and that is not a

14   pre-emption defense.      It is a defense based on State law

15   that the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because

16   it complied with the applicable regulations.                    In that --

17   under that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is

18   going to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments

19   to the trial court about whether or not that compliance

20   negated or did not negate negligence.                    But pre-emption

21   is a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at

22   the outset of the lawsuit before information is

23   obtained.   And notably, before 2000, FDA did not have

24   subpoena power of drug manufacturers.                    It did not have

25   the power to force labeling changes.                    It didn't even

 1   have the power to force drug manufacturers to make

 2   post-marketing studies.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The --the part I'm trying

 4   to figure out is this:         Suppose it was before trial.                   I

 5   don't care, before or after.              The plaintiff comes in

 6   with a claim.     All right.         Manufacturer:             That's

 7   pre-empted.     The claim is that you should have told the

 8   FDA and added something to your label.

 9   Manufacturer:     That's preempted.              Plaintiff:        Well, you

10   haven't read this reg here.              The reg here which has been

11   in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add

12   something.     I mean you can go and add something to show

13   a contra indication, and that's the end of it.

14                 Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess,

15   without the horrible things happening that Justice

16   Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know.

17   But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new

18   information.    I take it that's in 1982.                     That's the

19   first time that happened.

20                 Now, if I'm right about that, what happens

21   when no one says a word about that?                       Of course, if the

22   manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe

23   the plaintiff would have said:                And it was new.           It was

24   new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word.                       Are you

25   following what I'm saying?

 1                 MR. FREDERICK: I'm not totally, Justice

 2   Breyer, I confess, but let me try to address it this

 3   way.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean, I'm wondering still

 5   what happens.    I believe what happened here is that in

 6   the argument in the lower courts, in the trial court,

 7   nobody said anything about the FDA's claim that the

 8   information necessary to just go ahead and change the

 9   label had to be new.       Am I right about that?

10                 MR. FREDERICK:         You are absolutely right

11   about that.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So what I'm trying to

13   figure out -- and I don't know if "burden of proof" is

14   the right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who

15   wins?   If they had said a word about it, you need new

16   information, maybe the manufacturer -- the plaintiff

17   could have shown that the manufacturer had new

18   information.

19                 MR. FREDERICK: I think the duty is always

20   going to be on the manufacturer, Justice Breyer.                The

21   regulations at 314.80(b) establish that the -- that the

22   manufacturer has the responsibility to do post-

23   marketing analysis and post-marketing surveys to

24   determine the continuing safety of its drugs.             If the

25   manufacturer doesn't do that, it isn't complying with

 1   the Federal regulations which have an ongoing duty on

 2   them.

 3               And so in the case where there is silence, I

 4   would respectfully submit the manufacturer is not

 5   complying with its regulatory duty to ensure that there

 6   is current information about all of the side- effect

 7   risks of its drugs.

 8               Thank you.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

10   Mr. Waxman, you have three minutes remaining.

11               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

12                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13               MR. WAXMAN:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14           I want to make -- I do want to go to -- make a

15   preliminary point about all the talk about misbranding

16   here.   The statute has two criminal prohibitions.               One

17   is misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive

18   penalty.   If the FDA subsequently finds that something

19   is false or misleading, it CAN come after you for

20   misbranding.   But this case involves the criminal

21   prohibition against distributing drugs for which there

22   is not an approved, effective application.                And that's

23   what's at stake here.

24               Now, the notion that there was any -- any

25   misunderstanding in the trial court about whether there


                                       51
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was new information or whether there was -- there were

 2   incidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't

 3   evaluate the risk, is just flat wrong.                      The plaintiff

 4   tried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew

 5   about this risk.     Wyeth knew about this risk for

 6   decades.

 7                 That is what is so wrong.                    That is why he

 8   stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question.

 9   You decide this question.            And there was never, ever a

10   suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there

11   have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single

12   adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every

13   analysis that it did to the FDA's attention.

14                 And what the record does show is that after

15   -- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug

16   application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the

17   Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug

18   Application, that did have more extensive, stronger

19   warnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are

20   all in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug

21   applications, each one asking for more language, more

22   warnings, about direct IV injection.                      It's not called

23   "push."     It's IV injection versus drip, which is a

24   gravity method.                  And, in fact, Mr. Frederick

25   says:     Well, you know, in this case there could have


                                         52
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't

 2   really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it

 3   didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate

 4   something that the FDA-labeling required.

 5                 That is exactly the opposite of what the

 6   trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing.

 7   What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it

 8   didn't say:     Do not use by intravenous administration.

 9                 With respect to whether or not the warning

10   -- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987

11   and is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it

12   an original, but there is a typewritten version that

13   actually has the text in the type size that one can

14   actually read.     At the summary-judgment stage that the

15   pre-emption issue was decided -- may I finish my answer?

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Sure.

17                 MR. WAXMAN:        Summary judgment was decided at

18   the -- pre-emption was decided at summary judgment

19   before trial.    So there was no evidence about what was

20   new or wasn't new.      In Ms. Levine's motion for summary

21   judgment, she uses the word "new" information about

22   labeling change.     And, with respect to the proposed 1987

23   language, the '88 change that we asked for, she said --

24   and I'm reading from page 24 of her motion for summary

25   judgment -- "In 1988, Wyeth drafted changes to the


                                         53

 1   warning which advised that the use of a free-flowing IV

 2   would ensure adequate dilution and reduce the risk of

 3   arterial injectia.      Although not strong enough, this

 4   improved the labeling instruction; if followed, would

 5   have prevented the inadvertent administration of

 6   Phenergan into an artery for the reasons described."

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

 8   The case is submitted.

 9              (Whereupon, the case was submitted.)
