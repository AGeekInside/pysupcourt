 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota.

 5              Mr. Butler.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. BUTLER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              In this case, the Minnesota Supreme Court

11   held that this Court had prevented it from deciding for

12   itself which State prisoners can go into Minnesota State

13   courts to raise Federal constitutional challenges to

14   their conviction.    This is incorrect.

15              A State court is free to fashion -- the

16   State courts are free to fashion their own jurisprudence

17   as to who may raise a Federal constitutional question in

18   State court in the context that if you hear State courts

19   and State legislatures can make their own policy

20   decisions about the costs and benefits of allowing State

21   prisoners to challenge their otherwise final convictions

22   based on new rules of Federal constitutional criminal --

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I propose if the

24   State of Minnesota really cared about this, it could

25   have its own confrontation rule.                Does it have a


                                         3

 1   confrontation rule?

 2              MR. BUTLER:           The State constitution, Justice

 3   Kennedy, has a confrontation clause.                      Its jurisprudence

 4   on the confrontation clause, its own, is identical to

 5   this Court's jurisprudence.               So, yes, theoretically, a

 6   Petitioner could always go in and make a State court

 7   challenge to his State court conviction.                      The question

 8   --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:                That means the State isn't

10   necessarily tied in knots.            It has the option to do

11   substantively what it chooses.

12              MR. BUTLER:           The question in this case, Your

13   Honor, I think, is that whether -- is the question of

14   whether it has to.      Yes, a State prisoner can make a

15   State court challenge to his conviction.                     The question

16   is, does he have to?        In this case, Mr. Danforth

17   challenges his conviction under the Federal

18   Constitution.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, page 2 of your reply

20   brief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State,

21   and you say the State is wrong if there is a decision

22   either way on the confrontation clause and it's

23   questionable under Federal law, we can review it.                     I can

24   concede that's right, but that doesn't get you home.

25   That's the problem.

 1              MR. BUTLER:        Well --

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That is the problem.

 3   You're now creating a regime in which State courts are

 4   reaching questions that we said ought not to be reached

 5   for final convictions.

 6              MR. BUTLER:        Your Honor --

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And that was the basis on

 8   which we decided Crawford.

 9              MR. BUTLER:        Your Honor, it's simply a

10   regime under which the State court, as it can in any

11   number of other contexts, can choose to consider the

12   merits of a litigant's claim.            The Federal question --

13   the Federal question here is -- well, there are two.                    In

14   this case, it's whether Federal law prevents the State

15   court from hearing it, but the substantive Federal

16   question is whether Mr. Danforth's conviction violates

17   the confrontation clause.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And you think that our

19   holding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going

20   to let you out of jail?

21              MR. BUTLER:        I think --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You think that's really

23   what we said in Teague, that even though your

24   constitutional rights were violated, we're going to

25   foreclose the remedy of habeas corpus?                 I -- I find it


                                       5

 1   difficult to believe that that -- you know, any

 2   responsible court could make such a determination.

 3               MR. BUTLER:          Your Honor, what the Teague

 4   Court did was set up a procedural and a prudential limit

 5   on a defense available for the State in the particular

 6   form of habeas corpus.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               That issue is not a

 8   necessary part of your case at all, but you don't have

 9   to suggest that you could depart.                  You could do less

10   than Teague.     For example, Griffith.                   You can accept

11   that as a given because it doesn't touch your case.

12   Isn't that so?

13                  MR. BUTLER:         That's correct, Your Honor.

14   Griffith sets forth, as we see it, the minimum

15   requirements of Federal law, that a new rule must be

16   applied to all cases that were pending when the new rule

17   is announced.     That's what the Federal Constitution

18   requires.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, Federal rules

20   don't have minimums and maximums.                  They have a rule.

21   And as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State

22   rule under the State constitution that goes further.                       It

23   seems to me that the States' determination to apply

24   Crawford retroactively must be based on a disagreement

25   with this Court's Teague analysis, which refers back to


                                          6

 1   the substantive elements of Crawford.                     So, in other

 2   words, the disagreement at bottom is a disagreement

 3   about how to read the substantive requirements of

 4   Crawford.

 5                 MR. BUTLER:        Respectfully, Mr. Chief

 6   Justice, I don't think that's necessarily true.                     I think

 7   the disagreement, if there is one, is with this Court's

 8   policy decision in Teague to -- that the Court announced

 9   in Teague as to whether to allow such challenges.

10   There's no disagreement as to the substance of Crawford

11   or to the substance of the Sixth Amendment.                    Nobody has

12   ever reached that --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, how do you --

14   I understand your point.           Teague has both elements to

15   it.     But if you're applying Teague, there are certain

16   exceptions that are based on exactly what the underlying

17   right is, what the Crawford right is.                     Is it a watershed

18   rule?     Is it something else?           And the court makes a

19   determination as a matter of Federal law on those

20   points.     And what you're arguing for is discretion in

21   the State to disagree with those substantive

22   determinations.

23                 MR. BUTLER:        What we're arguing for,

24   Mr. Chief Justice, is discretion in the State to

25   disagree with the general policy rule that a court will

 1   not consider a new rule when considering the validity of

 2   a conviction on, in Teague's case, habeas or on

 3   collateral review.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:                It's a general policy

 5   rule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a

 6   good example, have affected this Court's initial

 7   determination to strike off in a new direction.                  We did

 8   so knowing that there's a possibility that we wouldn't

 9   upset final convictions.

10              MR. BUTLER:           Well --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:                And I think it is --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:                -- to that effect.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:                Is it not a substantive

14   determination of Federal law when you say that this

15   constitutional change that we're making in this case or

16   that we have made in a past case is not retroactive?

17   That means there was no constitutional violation in the

18   past prior to the announcement of this case, and what

19   the State -- what you want the State court to be able to

20   say is yes, there is a Federal constitutional violation

21   for which we're going to give a remedy in habeas.

22              MR. BUTLER:           I think, Justice Scalia and

23   Justice Kennedy, if I could address your points in turn,

24   on Justice Scalia's question about whether there was or

25   was not a constitutional violation, if the Court is

 1   really holding that there was -- that something -- that

 2   there was no constitutional violation at the time

 3   Petitioner's conviction became final or at the time

 4   Mr. Bockting's conviction became final in the habeas

 5   case, then what the Court is really holding is that

 6   Crawford didn't just interpret the confrontation clause;

 7   it somehow changed the confrontation clause, that the

 8   confrontation clause meant -- that the confrontation

 9   clause said one thing at one point and now says

10   something else.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think that's exactly what

12   Crawford means, and I think that's exactly what

13   happened.   That's what it means, whether it's a new

14   rule.   What does a new rule mean?               It means it didn't

15   used to be the rule, but it is the rule after this case.

16               Now, you can argue, and there are many

17   originalists who would agree with you, that there

18   shouldn't be such a thing as a new rule, but once you've

19   -- once you've agreed that there can be new rules, if

20   this Court says this is a new rule, we acknowledge it

21   wasn't the rule before, but it's new, it will not have

22   retroactive effect, it seems to me that the State would

23   be contradicting that ruling by saying oh, in our view

24   the law used to be exactly what you say it newly is.

25               MR. BUTLER:        But the question, Your Honor --


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But your basic position is

 2   that we should not be making new law.                   We should be --

 3   we might have misinterpreted the law over the years,

 4   but, basically, this Court has no power to change the

 5   text of the Constitution or its meaning.                   I guess

 6   Justice Scalia's position is we have all that power in

 7   the world.

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           My position is we have

10   asserted all that power in the world.

11                (Laughter.)

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But there is -- there is

13   -- it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply

14   it from this day forward.          Crawford is retroactive at

15   least for cases that are not yet final.                  When they were

16   on trial, Crawford wasn't there, but maybe somewhere

17   toward the end of the appellate process, lo and behold,

18   they can take advantage of it.

19                So it's a question of where you want to cut

20   it off.   And at one time, didn't this Court cut it off

21   in a different place?

22                MR. BUTLER:       Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did.

23   In fact, for centuries everything this Court did was

24   always retroactive, as the Court knows.

25                And then we got the Linkletter balancing


                                       10

 1   test, and then later on we got Griffith and Teague, and

 2   the Court has refined, usually through the scope of

 3   Federal habeas corpus --

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:             And during the period

 5   between Linkletter and Griffith, did the State -- if the

 6   Supreme Court said that a decision was not retroactive,

 7   did State supreme courts feel free to apply it

 8   retroactively?

 9              MR. BUTLER:           It -- there -- there doesn't

10   seem to be any case law on that point, Your Honor, that

11   I'm aware of.    State courts usually, as they do today,

12   usually followed this Court's retroactivity decision.

13   But it is unclear whether they thought they had to or

14   whether they just chose to.              The question --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Can a State -- can

16   they pick -- can a State pick and choose?                   Can it say

17   that we are going to allow Crawford claims to be applied

18   retroactively, but other claims, we're not going to?

19              MR. BUTLER:           I think, when it -- if you

20   consider, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Teague rule is a

21   procedural rule about who gets to make what claims, then

22   I think the answer to your question is yes.                   The State

23   court could say --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, and if you

25   think that the Teague rule is an assessment of the

 1   substantive -- part of the substantive constitutional

 2   interpretation, an assessment about what the impact of

 3   Crawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they

 4   couldn't, right?

 5               MR. BUTLER:        Well, it depends on the impact

 6   in what -- in what setting, Your Honor.                 It -- the --

 7   the Teague rule -- and Teague, itself, and every case

 8   this Court has ever -- in which this Court has ever

 9   considered Teague, has come from one procedural posture:

10   Federal habeas corpus review of State court convictions.

11               It is over that posture that this Court

12   exercises both supervisory power and control to

13   interpret the various Federal habeas statutes.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, even -- even outside

15   of the habeas context, we -- we decided a case, Hudson

16   v. Walker, one or two terms ago.               It was a no-knock

17   case.   We said that, even if there is a no-knock

18   violation, the exclusionary rule does not apply.                This

19   would be too costly an extension of the exclusionary

20   rule and would bring the -- would make the Fourth

21   Amendment a disruptive force.

22               Under your view, I take it, the State, even

23   in -- in its trial proceedings subject to direct review,

24   could disagree with that and take a Federal concept,

25   no-knock, and then apply the exclusionary rule, thereby


                                       12

 1   forcing us to make the -- to draw the very lines that we

 2   said we ought not to draw in Hudson.

 3                MR. BUTLER:       No, Your Honor.

 4                First of all, what Hudson -- the Hudson case

 5   asked was whether exclusion of evidence was required

 6   under the Fourth Amendment when the violation of the

 7   Fourth Amendment was a no-knock violation.

 8                The word "required" appears throughout the

 9   opinion in Hudson, and the answer was no, it doesn't.

10   The Fourth Amendment doesn't require exclusion of

11   evidence.

12                But there was no suggestion in -- in Hudson

13   that the State court could not then say, here is a

14   Fourth Amendment violation.            We need to come up with

15   what the remedy is.      The Constitution doesn't require us

16   to suppress the evidence, so we are -- we either choose

17   not to --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but you agree with

19   me, then, that under your position, the State could

20   apply an exclusionary rule.

21                MR. BUTLER:       Yes, Your Honor, it could under

22   State law.   And if --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Based on the

24   distinction between right and remedy, a distinction that

25   is -- that in countless areas of the law we -- we have

 1   said is -- is an ephemeral one?

 2               MR. BUTLER:          Well, the -- that is not based

 3   on that distinction.        That is one way to look at it,

 4   Mr. Chief Justice, that in -- in the Hudson context, it

 5   is definitely a question of right and remedy.

 6               There's no question in Hudson that the

 7   defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.              The

 8   question is what remedy is required by the Constitution.

 9               Here, Mr. Danforth wants the Minnesota State

10   Court to consider whether his constitutional rights were

11   violated.   It did not hold that they were not.             It held

12   that it could not consider the merits of his claim

13   because of Teague.

14               And in other settings this Court, in its

15   other limitations on the availability of habeas corpus,

16   has described these prudential rules like Teague as

17   gateway claims.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Butler, let me -- this

19   is a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come

20   up in a -- in a direct appeal to the State Supreme

21   Court.   Is it your position that in a direct appeal, the

22   State can determine to be retroactive constitutional

23   rights that we have said are not retroactive, on direct

24   appeal, now, not habeas?

25               MR. BUTLER:          As long, Justice Scalia, as the

 1   State acknowledges that it is using State law to do so,

 2   that it is -- that it is not mismanaging this Court's

 3   retroactivity jurisprudence.            In other words, as long as

 4   it doesn't think, well, we -- we must do this.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            If it bases its decision on

 6   the Federal Constitution, and we have said that this

 7   Federal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what --

 8   what do they say on a direct appeal?

 9               MR. BUTLER:        On a -- on a direct --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And my next question is

11   going to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us,

12   what do we do?

13               MR. BUTLER:        It would -- it would depend on

14   the facts of the case, Your Honor.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I'm -- I'm confused on

16   this one, because I thought it was part of our

17   retroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply

18   that new rule while the case is still in the pipeline,

19   while it is on direct appeal, not that they -- well,

20   they just may, but they absolutely must apply it

21   retroactively.   I thought that's what Griffith said.

22               MR. BUTLER:        That is, Your Honor, what

23   Griffith says, and that's -- that's what -- that's --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            My case was not in the

25   pipeline.   The prosecution began after our new decision.

 1   Okay?   And it comes up to the State Supreme Court.                    Can

 2   the State Supreme Court, despite the fact that we've

 3   said the decision is not retroactive, make it

 4   retroactive?   And your answer is yes?

 5               MR. BUTLER:         My answer is --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Habeas or not?

 7               MR. BUTLER:         My answer, Your Honor, is that

 8   if the -- the --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              If it comes up after --

10   if the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of

11   course, the decision has to apply.

12               MR. BUTLER:         Yes, I think that's correct,

13   Justice Ginsburg.    The decision would apply.                If the

14   prosecution starts after this Court announces a new rule

15   and then says that it is not retroactive -- when you

16   announce that it is not retroactive, it is not

17   retroactive to cases that are already final.

18               If the case hasn't even begun yet, then, of

19   course -- then, yes, then the new rule would apply.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Does your -- does

21   your approach apply to legislative enactment's as well?

22   Let's say Congress passes a law and it provides as

23   particular remedy, and it says this remedy shall not be

24   retroactive but only apply in new cases.

25               Can the State say well, we think it ought to

 1   apply to old cases, pending cases on habeas, or

 2   whatever, and so we are going to apply this

 3   retroactively, even though Congress said it's only

 4   prospective?

 5                 MR. BUTLER:       I think that's a -- that's a

 6   somewhat different question, Your Honor, and it would --

 7   it would depend on if -- if Congress passed a law that

 8   said no State court shall apply retroactively something

 9   or other --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, no.   They just

11   say here's a new remedy, maybe a glance and exclusionary

12   remedy in cases where we have held one isn't required --

13   can the State allow that retroactively, even though

14   Congress -- a Federal remedy, even though Congress has

15   said this Federal remedy is only prospective?

16                 MR. BUTLER:       In the past, Your -- I think --

17   I think the short answer to your question, Mr. Chief

18   Justice, is yes.    And I think the reason it can is

19   because, if you look at, for example -- if this is a

20   question of remedy, then I -- then the State courts have

21   all the power to grant more remedies, to grant more

22   expansive --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, your reliance

24   on this ancient distinction between right and remedy --

25   I mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's

 1   retroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you

 2   have.

 3                MR. BUTLER:        If, Your Honor -- think about

 4   the -- the tax cases, for example, American Trucking and

 5   McKesson, the case -- the companion case.                  In both of

 6   those cases, especially McKesson, the Court held that

 7   where there has been a violation of somebody's

 8   constitutional rights and the -- and the State owes that

 9   person some sort of a remedy, then the State can give

10   whatever remedy the minimum requirements of the Federal

11   Constitution or Federal law are, but can also go

12   further.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Sure, as a matter of

14   State law.

15                MR. BUTLER:        Yes.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But here you are

17   arguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law.

18   There is no issue -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you

19   can have a State confrontation clause and do whatever

20   you want with it.    But you are relying on the Federal

21   provision.

22                MR. BUTLER:        What -- what we are relying on

23   -- we are relying, Mr. Chief Justice, on the substance

24   of the Sixth Amendment, yes.             That is the substantive

25   claim Mr. Danforth makes.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No.     But you are also

 2   relying, as I understand it, on State common law, in

 3   effect.     And you are saying, that so long as the State

 4   common law does not give less by way of remedy and

 5   relief than the Federal decision requires, the State is

 6   free, as a matter of State remedial common law, to do

 7   more.     That's your point, isn't it?

 8                 MR. BUTLER:        That is absolutely my point,

 9   Justice Souter.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            You are saying that,

11   ultimately, the State's choice in this case rests upon a

12   choice of State common law about procedure leading to

13   remedy.

14                 MR. BUTLER:        It is not even just State

15   common law, Justice Souter.              It is state statutory law.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.   No.   I would

17   have thought the very least Teague is, is Federal common

18   lawful.     In other words, this is the Federal law of

19   remedies.     I think it is more than that.                 I think it is

20   substantive constitutional -- substantive Federal

21   constitutional law.       But it's at least Federal common

22   law, and doesn't Federal common law preempt State common

23   law.

24                 MR. BUTLER:        Only, Mr. Chief Justice, if the

25   Federal interest is so strong as to outweigh all of the

 1   State court interests.       And when it comes to the

 2   remedial question of does this person have a right to go

 3   to State court and challenge his conviction, that is

 4   quintessentially the matter of State law.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That always assumes that

 6   that's a remedial question, and that the question is not

 7   was the Constitution violated at the time this act

 8   occurred.   That -- if that's the question, then you

 9   acknowledge that the State can't change the situation.

10               MR. BUTLER:        That's true, Justice Scalia.

11   That if this Court -- if Teague is a rule that says what

12   the Constitution was at a particular time, then it is

13   much harder for us, we would probably have to make a

14   State law claim.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But if you can say -- it

16   is a little odd that the State executive can say, yes,

17   as far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what

18   was always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive

19   enough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to

20   raise Teague.   It would be an anomaly, would it not,

21   that the executive of the State is not bound by Teague,

22   but the courts are?

23               MR. BUTLER:        That's correct, Justice

24   Ginsburg.   And that's -- the waiver doctrine about

25   Teague shows why Teague is not a decision about what the

 1   law was.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I assume that the State

 3   executive can do that with respect to any Federal law

 4   that it's authorized to implement, simply choose not to,

 5   couldn't it?   That's prosecutorial discretion.

 6              MR. BUTLER:         No, Justice Scalia,

 7   respectfully, I don't think that's true.                If the law at

 8   the time of Mr. Danforth's conviction became final said

 9   there's no confrontation violation, and we go to State

10   court or Federal habeas court, for that matter, and the

11   State chooses to say we don't want to apply Teague,

12   we'll take him on on his Crawford claim.                That, under a

13   view that the law has changed, that allows the State

14   executive branch through waiver or even worse, through

15   procedural default, inaction, to change the substance of

16   Federal law.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You want us to write an

18   opinion which begins with the sentence, "This Court has

19   no interest in the extent to which its constitutional

20   decisions upset final judgments"?

21              MR. BUTLER:         No, Justice Kennedy, I don't

22   think that's what the opinion should start with.                I

23   don't necessarily think that that's true.               I don't know

24   that there's no interest in much of anything in this

25   case.

 1               When you weigh and balance the interests,

 2   however, the interests of the State courts in

 3   controlling access to their courthouse doors, in

 4   reviewing that their own judgments -- I mean, Teague

 5   gets back to a comity decision.              Whatever Teague is is

 6   based almost not exclusively but primarily on comity and

 7   respect for State courts.          Federal courts are not --

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:          If Crawford had been a

 9   decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court, is it clear

10   what retroactivity rule they would have applied?

11               MR. BUTLER:        No, Justice Alito, it's not.

12   The State court has used in the past the Linkletter

13   balancing test.   It's also used something akin to

14   Teague.   And then in this case, they held for Federal

15   rules they have to use Teague.

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Butler, if as you say

17   Teague is, in effect, a comity rule, then what is your

18   answer, in effect, to Justice Scalia's point that we

19   make a decision when we come down with a substantive

20   legal judgment about the Constitution, we make a

21   decision as to whether the rule is retroactive or not?

22   And he says that if you look at Teague as simply, in

23   effect, a comity decision, that's inconsistent with the

24   determination that we have made, because if you say

25   okay, we as a State will apply it earlier than the Feds

 1   say we have to, you, in effect, are changing the

 2   substantive determination that we have made, that the

 3   decision is not retroactive.

 4               What is the retroactivity analysis that

 5   underlies your comity analysis of Teague?

 6               MR. BUTLER:          The retroactivity analysis,

 7   Your Honor, when this Court makes a decision is that, as

 8   Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, Griffith.                       The Court

 9   says when it makes a new rule, when it announces what it

10   believes to be a new rule, that it knows that it will

11   apply to a certain group of cases.

12               It doesn't know -- it can't know anything

13   more than that, because the Court doesn't exercise

14   control over other courts --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Alright, but let's be more

16   specific.   What does it know about retroactive

17   application under Griffith?

18               MR. BUTLER:          That it will apply.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:              And it will apply to some

20   cases that depend upon facts and have eventuated from

21   trials that are --

22               MR. BUTLER:          -- that are already finished.

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Right.           So that there's is

24   going to be some retroactivity?

25               MR. BUTLER:          Yes, absolutely.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And if there is going to be

 2   some retroactivity, then I take it your position has got

 3   to be and is our substantive decisions are not so much

 4   retroactive or non-retroactive, but retroactively

 5   applied, to some extent, and not retroactively applied

 6   to others, and a State is free to apply it more

 7   retroactively than ours.         Is that the nutshell?

 8              MR. BUTLER:         That is the gravamen of our

 9   argument, Justice Souter.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:             So your answer to Justice

11   Scalia is, I take it, not that the decision is

12   retroactive or not, but there is a decision about the

13   degree to which applications will be retroactive or not?

14   That is what underlies your case?

15              MR. BUTLER:         That's correct, Your Honor.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Then do you think the State

17   is free to decide how and when and whether it will,

18   quote, apply?   I mean, simply to separate the law from

19   the application of the law seems to me no answer at all.

20              Is there any other area where you say well,

21   yes, there was a Supreme Court decision; but whether to

22   apply that decision is up to the State?

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             You're overlooking what I

24   understand to be the basic distinction you're drawing.

 1   think there is a basic distinction between rights and

 2   remedies.

 3                And you're holding -- I understand your

 4   position to be that the remedy may not be retroactive,

 5   even though the decision itself can assume that there

 6   would have been a violation from the beginning of the

 7   Constitution today we may have misinterpreted before.

 8   But if there is a violation of the right, then there's a

 9   decision about what kind of remedy shall be imposed.

10                And you can say we will not impose a remedy

11   for past wrongs, even though we must impose them in the

12   future and we can let other states decide whether to

13   post a remedy or not.       And that's totally consistent

14   with the holding that the violation is always

15   retroactive, but the remedy may not be.

16                MR. BUTLER:        I think that's correct, Justice

17   Stevens.    When you talk about remedy --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- it is the other

19   way around which makes it problematic.                   You are going to

20   say the remedy is retroactive even if there's no right.

21   You're going to say where we have decided that there is

22   no remedy and, therefore, if you have a right, it's -- I

23   don't know what you get out of it -- you want to say,

24   no, there is a remedy.

25                MR. BUTLER:        What I want to say, Mr. Chief

 1   Justice, is that if there is a violation of the test of

 2   the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause, this Court

 3   decides what remedies are required, what remedies for

 4   certain people and perhaps for other people what

 5   remedies are not required.            Justice Harlan in Mackey

 6   called it the body responsible for defining the scope of

 7   the -- what he called the writ, in other places, the

 8   adjudicatory process.

 9                 In this case it's State post-conviction

10   review.     It is that body that decides whether there

11   shall be either a remedy, you want to call it a remedy

12   for the violation, you want to call it who decides

13   whether the decision shall be applied retroactively, as

14   opposed to whether it is retroactive.                     It is the

15   group -- it is whoever is controlling the adjudicatory

16   process.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's subject to the

18   floor, that the floor that this Court sets, it must be

19   retroactive to a certain extent.

20                 MR. BUTLER:        That's correct, Justice

21   Ginsburg.     Subject to the floor, it is then up to the

22   governing body to decide how much protection to give.

23   And that gets back to Justice Stevens's point -- the

24   States can always choose to give either -- you can call

25   it a greater remedy, you can call it a larger

 1   retroactive application, as long as the substance of

 2   Federal law doesn't change, then it is a State question.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It is the same as the

 4   question of whether to apply the exclusionary rule.

 5                 MR. BUTLER:        It is.

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            That was a remedial

 7   decision.     Everybody agreed the knock and announce

 8   business was a violation.            The only question was on

 9   remedy.     And there are lots of rights that -- for which

10   there's no remedy.      Look at all our implied cause of

11   action cases, you will find many, many examples of that.

12                 MR. BUTLER:        In habeas corpus as well,

13   Justice Stevens.     If you file your habeas petition one

14   day late, no remedy.        If you don't preserve the issue in

15   the trial court, no remedy.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you have to

17   argue, and this is why I think the distinction has been

18   rejected in so many other areas of the law, you have to

19   argue that the remedy question is totally separate from

20   an analysis of the right.            Because otherwise, you are

21   saying the State courts have the right to disagree with

22   our determination of what the Federal right is.                   If you

23   think the remedy, the question of remedy draws some

24   substance from what the right is, which I would have

25   thought is obviously the case, then it seems to me

 1   you're asserting a power on the basis of the State court

 2   to overturn our Federal law determinations.

 3              MR. BUTLER:           We are not asserting, Mr. Chief

 4   Justice, that the State court has the ability to

 5   disagree with this Court's interpretation of the Federal

 6   Constitution.

 7              What we are asserting is that the State

 8   courts and the State legislatures have the ability to

 9   decide who can come into State court and what claims the

10   State court can listen to.

11              And I want to -- before I -- my time, I

12   wanted to address -- Justice Kennedy had a concern

13   earlier about knowing the scope of the application of a

14   right when you announce a substantive decision.

15              And the answer to that, I believe, is that

16   the court -- not only does it already know it's going to

17   go -- it will apply to anything pending on direct

18   review, but that -- that -- that question is much more

19   complicated than it seems.            Different States have

20   different time lines for when something is pending on

21   direct review.     How long it takes an appeal to pass

22   through the State court process?                 What requirements of

23   the defendant are there?

24              In Minnesota it takes about 15 months to run

25   a direct appeal.     And so a defendant can sit there for


                                         28

 1   15 months and know that he's probably going to get the

 2   benefit of any decision this Court announces.                  In

 3   another State it might take two years.                  In another State

 4   it might take six months.          There's different groups of

 5   defendants -- even under the Griffith standard, we

 6   already don't have the sort of uniformity that the

 7   Respondent thinks is so -- thinks is so important in

 8   this area.

 9                There's always -- things are always left to

10   the matter of State courts to -- to decide --                 to have

11   their own procedural rules and decide how best to use

12   their adjudicatory processes, and all this Court can do

13   is announce the best Federal rules it thinks the

14   Constitution supports, have some idea of what the

15   minimum requirements of those rules are going to be; and

16   then it is up to the State courts to decide what other

17   remedies to give for the violations that -- if this

18   Court holds something is a violation, then it is up to

19   the State courts to decide as a minimum who it will

20   apply to.

21                If there are no further questions, I'll

22   reserve my time.

24   you, Mr. Butler.

 1                ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK C. DIAMOND

 2                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 3                MR. DIAMOND:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 4   please the Court:

 5                Federal law controls the retroactivity or

 6   non-retroactivity of new constitutional rulings.                       This

 7   Court determines the constitutional requirements --

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask you, just at the

 9   outset, when you use the term retroactivity, are you

10   saying there was no violation of the Constitution before

11   the decision, or there just is no remedy for it?

12                MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor, I think in this --

13   this Court has made it clear in the retroactivity area

14   that retroactivity is a question of the substantive

15   constitutional standard that will applies to a specific

16   defendant.    I think the Court's cases from Payne,

17   Griffith, Yates --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:             -- one of the cases where

19   the line is drawn when the expiration of the direct

20   review has passed.      Is it your view that at that

21   particular point in time a constitutional violation

22   either exists or it does not exist?                       It's not a remedy

23   question?

24                MR. DIAMOND:          That's correct, Your Honor.                I

25   don't believe this is a matter of remedy.                       This Court,

 1   for example, in Reynoldsville Casket wrote that Teague

 2   itself is not a limitation on remedy.                  What it is, is a

 3   limitation on the principle of retroactivity itself.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is part of that because of

 5   what's involved in expectations?              That's the Smith case,

 6   where we said the determination of whether a

 7   constitutional decision is retroactive Is every bit as

 8   much a question of Federal law as the decision of the

 9   substantive right itself.         We said that in Smith.

10              MR. DIAMOND:         Yes, Your Honor, and the point

11   is that the substantive rights and retroactivity are not

12   two different things.

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And here the

14   expectation -- in Smith it was the expectation of people

15   in the private sector.      Here the expectation is one of

16   finality of judgments.

17              MR. DIAMOND:         Exactly, Your Honor.

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then how do you -- how do

19   you reconcile that answer with the point that your

20   brother made just before he sat down, and that is,

21   taking standard Griffith analysis, the application of a

22   so-called new rule is going to vary depending on how

23   long it takes a person on direct appeal to get through

24   the State court system?

25              And it seems to me that that is inconsistent


                                      31
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   with your view that there has got to be one rule with

 2   respect to the date of application as a matter of

 3   substantive Federal law, because we know for a fact

 4   that, depending how long it takes to get through the

 5   State appellate system on direct review, the new rule

 6   may be applied and it may not be applied.

 7                 MR. DIAMOND:        Your Honor, two points:          First

 8   of all, I think Griffith is very clear, that finality is

 9   that point.    Griffith is very clear, and it defines

10   finality as that point when the direct appellate process

11   has run, and this Court -- and the opportunity to

12   petition this Court for review is over.                  Secondly, Banks

13   II, a retroactivity case from this Court, says that it's

14   up to the Federal courts to define finality.                  Remember

15   in Banks II there was a question of whether the

16   Pennsylvania courts passing on waiver requirements

17   somehow destroyed the finality of --

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I understand your -- your

19   point about finality, and finality has a well-known

20   operative effect.    But one operative effect when the

21   Federal courts have defined finality and have said it is

22   not final until -- a case is not final until direct

23   review is over -- one consequence of that is that a

24   substantive Federal rule will be applied to an

25   individual in one State whose crime and whose trial


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   procedure is different in time from that of a defendant

 2   in another State.

 3              So that the consequence is that the

 4   substantive rule will apply to some people who acted on

 5   date X and it will not apply to some people who acted on

 6   date X; and that, it seems to me, is inconsistent with

 7   your answer to Justice Stevens's question.

 8              MR. DIAMOND:           Your Honor, given the varied

 9   proceedings at the State level, that -- that is

10   inevitable no matter what time this Court --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:              And if it is inevitable, I

12   don't see how you can answer Justice Stevens's question

13   the way you did.

14              MR. DIAMOND:           Your Honor, the point in

15   Griffith is that in terms of uniformity, this is -- in

16   terms of providing similarly situated people, the best

17   the Court can do in this area is to cut -- to make the

18   point at finality --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:              And the finality point in

20   effect establishes a way of calculating the application

21   of a rule in any given State in any given case, but it

22   will not result in the uniform application of the rule.

23   Isn't that correct?

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes, that's correct.   You

25   have to say that's correct.

 1               (Laughter.)

 2               MR. DIAMOND:         And --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But I think you can also

 4   explain that the reason it's correct is the Court

 5   probably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a

 6   new rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and

 7   this rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by

 8   individuals from now on.         But then, you know, Justice

 9   Harlan says my goodness, you're going to give relief to

10   this individual and not give relief to other individuals

11   who are making the same claim and already have cases

12   pending?   You have to treat them equally.                 So we will

13   make an equitable exception for that.

14               But basically, the existence of that

15   exception does not prove that the Court was not

16   purporting to make a substantive rule.                  There's an

17   exception to the application of that substantive rule

18   for pending cases, which is totally understandable.

19               MR. DIAMOND:         Which, Your Honor, is Griffith

20   and is defined by Federal law.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can you give me an example

22   of a case in which this Court candidly said, we're

23   announcing a new rule which was not the law before?

24   Aren't we always interpreting what we thought the intent

25   of the framers was from the beginning, even though we


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   may have gotten it before?          What is your best example of

 2   a new rule, in the sense it's a different rule of law as

 3   opposed to a different remedy?              See, all these equitable

 4   considerations go to the remedy.               But the notion we can

 5   make up a new rule of law at will strikes me as a very

 6   dramatic departure from what I understand the rule of

 7   law to require.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm really glad to hear

 9   that.

10              (Laughter.)

11              MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor, I think the

12   point -- this isn't Blackstone -- Blackstone is not the

13   only view here.   The point is that finality is -- is not

14   a competing concern, but the point --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Finality is a condition

16   for fashioning the right remedy.               There's no doubt.

17   Everything you say is necessary for treating litigants

18   in a -- in a fair manner.          But that all goes to remedy,

19   not to the violation.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Don't we call it a new

21   rule in Teague?

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- expectations as being

23   questions of remedy?

24              MR. DIAMOND:          Excuse me, Your Honor.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It seems to me that your

 1   -- your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier

 2   should be that there is uniformity.                     Some States are

 3   fast, some are slow, but in the end there is a final

 4   judgment which is a settled expectation, and the

 5   substance of the law honors settled expectations, which

 6   is finality.

 7              MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor -- and that point

 8   is -- the point of finality is a recognized point of

 9   what is necessary for the integrity of judicial

10   decision-making.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             That's sort of like

12   defining order as random order, isn't it?

13              MR. DIAMOND:          I disagree, Your Honor.             I

14   think that as Justice Harlan said in the -- in the

15   Williams and Mackey dissents, there is -- a decision

16   that is always subject to revision is really the

17   functional equivalent of no decision at all.                    It's what

18   makes judicial decisions judicial.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And -- and the concern is a

20   concern not so much.

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And the concern is not so

22   much a concern not so much for the defendant here but

23   for the States, isn't it?          We don't want -- we think

24   there is -- there is an important value implicit in

25   habeas, and one of those values is that there be a limit

 1   to the degree to which we are going to upset the settled

 2   expectations of the States.            Isn't that right?

 3                MR. DIAMOND:        Your Honor, the State's

 4   interest here can be vindicated by the State by applying

 5   State law.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's not the point.    I

 7   thought that Teague was driven not by some abstract

 8   notion about finality, but the intrusion on State

 9   decision-making.   Here was State that had conducted an

10   entire process that appeared to be in line with what the

11   Federal law then appeared to be.               And then the State is

12   told by some Federal habeas court, State, you've got to

13   do it all over again, because you didn't -- you didn't

14   predict that we were going to interpret the Constitution

15   differently.   I thought that the really motivating idea

16   of Teague was it addressed the Federal forum and said,

17   Federal forum, don't step on the States' toes, don't

18   make them redo trials that have long since been over.

19                MR. DIAMOND:        Your Honor, I'm here

20   representing the State of Minnesota, and the intrusion

21   that I'm concerned about in this case is a State court

22   judge adopting some Federal optional -- sort of Federal

23   requirement, and applying it as opposed to using State

24   law that can be reviewed and overturned and for which

25   that State court judge is accountable to the citizenry

 1   of the State.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I must say I have

 3   serious problems with your position in that regard.

 4                If you were not to prevail in this case

 5   and -- or, pardon me, if the Petitioner were to prevail

 6   in this case, and there were a ruling on what Crawford

 7   means, or doesn't mean, we could review it.                   I think the

 8   Petitioner is absolutely right on that point.

 9                MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I think that it's

10   difficult.    If you look at, for example, the recent case

11   in Minnesota, Krasky, dealing with essentially the same

12   evidence that's at issue in this case, if the State was

13   adopting Krasky as some State standard, then this Court

14   wouldn't be in a position to review it.                   If it's

15   adopting Krasky as a -- as the Federal standard, then

16   the question is, how is it that the State is adopting

17   something as a matter of the Federal Constitution that

18   is not a Federal constitutional requirement?

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            The question I have is, to

20   go back, you said two separate things.                   One is you say

21   the question here is a matter of Federal law.                   I'll give

22   you that.    It's a matter of Federal law.

23                But the question is, what's the content of

24   the Federal law?    Does the Federal law say to the States

25   -- State, in a collateral review proceeding, you want to


                                        38

 1   apply Crawford retroactively to people whose convictions

 2   were long ago, do it, we don't care?

 3               And a lot of Teague says that should be the

 4   Federal rule, if it's called a Federal rule.

 5               But then you said a different thing, in

 6   answer to Justice Stevens.          The different thing was but

 7   the substantive rule of Crawford only takes effect as of

 8   the day of Crawford and into the future.

 9               Now, on that position, or take any other

10   date you want as one year earlier or whatever you're

11   going to pick there, if you're right about that, you

12   win.

13               But how could you be right about what I call

14   there a metaphysical point?            Because on the metaphysics,

15   as Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people

16   who have three identical trials each one year before

17   Crawford.   The first person is called Crawford, and he

18   wins.

19               The second person is called Smith, and he's

20   delayed forever in the appeals process.

21               And the third person is called Jones, and he

22   get a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of

23   Crawford.

24               Now we know that the first two Crawford

25   applies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford


                                       39
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was the law at the time of the first two trials, why

 2   wasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in

 3   respect to the third person whose trial was held at

 4   precisely the same time?

 5               MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, the point I think

 6   is that this is a point that Griffith makes, that when

 7   your conviction becomes final, that your stake -- if I

 8   can call it that -- in changes in the law come to a

 9   close.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            I agree with that.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You are saying

12   metaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new

13   constitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done

14   so, and Teague is full of references to new rules.             "We

15   therefore hold that implicit in the retroactivity

16   approach we adopt today is the principle that habeas

17   corpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new

18   constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those

19   rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants."

20               The opinion is full of new rules.

21               So -- so, you know, we have violated

22   metaphysics already.      Having violated it, in adopting

23   new constitutional rules, why should it be any surprise

24   that we also violated it in the application of those

25   rules?   There should be no surprise at all.            Don't get

 1   hung up on metaphysics, Mr. Turner.

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            In Crawford itself, it

 3   seems there was quite a bit of attention given to

 4   history long before the original interpretation of the

 5   clause.    I guess that was unnecessary because we were

 6   making up new rules.       Is that the --

 7                (Laughter.)

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            You've adopted Justice

 9   Scalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you

10   whether -- whether -- whether there isn't just a simpler

11   explanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza,

12   Immanuel Kant, or even Aristotle.                 And the simpler

13   explanation would be simply what Justice Stevens started

14   with, that Teague is about remedies, and that we assume

15   that the law was the law at the time of Crawford's

16   trial, at the time of Smith's trial, and at the time of

17   Jones' trial.

18                But Jones is knocked out because he went to

19   habeas.    And that's what Teague is about.               Habeas.   And,

20   therefore, if the State wants to apply Crawford

21   retroactively, let everybody out of jail, that's their

22   problem.    Or their virtue.         That's up to them.

23                That's where Justice Stevens started, and

24   that's what I would like to hear an answer to.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You wouldn't want to say


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the

 2   position of saying what we are telling people in these

 3   Teague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated,

 4   but we don't want to hear about it.                    I mean that's the

 5   alternative, to acknowledge that the Constitution is

 6   violated in all of these Teague cases, some of them

 7   being capital cases, and we nonetheless say well, too

 8   bad, it's on habeas.

 9              I'd like to think that's not what we're

10   doing, that what we're saying is, this is a new

11   constitutional rule, there was no constitutional

12   violation before, and that's why we're letting it stand.

13              MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I think you're

15   handling these questions very well.

16              (Laughter.)

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That was not a question

18   addressed to you, Mr. Diamond.

19              MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I think that, in

20   terms of Teague as a remedial limitation, first of all,

21   I don't think this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence

22   at all supports that notion.

23              I also think, for example, while certainly

24   not directly at issue in the habeas area, in construing

25   habeas, this Court said that Teague was not so much


                                      42
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   about a standard of review as it was about the standard

 2   that applies itself.     And so I think it's very difficult

 3   to square the notion of Teague as a remedial limitation

 4   with this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence.

 5              It's also difficult to square it with the

 6   explicit rejection of that notion in American Trucking

 7   and in Harper and Reynoldsville Casket.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You do recognize, though,

 9   that one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why

10   we changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for

11   State courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy

12   hand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do.

13              It seems a little ironic then if you take an

14   opinion that was driven by the Feds staying out of the

15   State courts' territory to say oh, no, we're going to

16   tell you that it's not -- we control when we want to.

17              MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, certainly that was

18   one of the things that was going on in Teague.           But,

19   respectfully, I think the question -- it's every bit as

20   intrusive on the State process when a State court judge

21   applies a new Federal rule to overturn a conviction, as

22   it is when a Federal court judge does the same thing.

23              In other words, those comity concerns apply

24   regardless of forum.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Isn't what you are saying


                                      43
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is that the concern in Teague was not only with State

 2   court processes, but with settled expectations of those

 3   who are involved in the criminal system, particularly

 4   victims who are entitled at some point to rely on a

 5   conviction being final?

 6                MR. DIAMOND:        Yes, Your Honor.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           We don't usually think of

 8   just of settled expectations as being questions of

 9   remedy.   We consider those as being questions of

10   substance.

11                MR. DIAMOND:        Your Honor, I think if you

12   look at Justice Harlan's writing in Teague about the

13   post-conviction -- what should be the rule for

14   post-conviction, you see he lays out very eloquently

15   what those concerns are in terms of finality and

16   uniformity in the post-conviction arena.                And what I'm

17   saying is that those concerns -- certainly comity is a

18   concern; but those other concerns in terms of finality

19   and allocation of judicial scarce criminal justice

20   resources and what kind of a trial are you going to have

21   11 years after the fact, is it going to be more fair

22   than the trial that occurred in the first place, all of

23   those -- apply.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- State executives can

25   upset all those expectations.             The State executive says


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   I want this -- the issue -- the substantive issue in

 2   this case settled, so I'm not going to raise Teague.

 3   And so Crawford is going to be retroactive because I say

 4   so.   It is a bit of an anomaly that the prosecutor has

 5   that power but not the State court itself.

 6               MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, first of all, I

 7   think the State court is in a business -- is in a

 8   different role in terms of enforcing the constitutional

 9   rights in that situation.          In fact, as it relates to the

10   constitutional right, it is difficult to see what State

11   interest a judge should be vindicating at that point.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It is also difficult to

13   see what Federal interest is vindicated when the State

14   says we know we have to respect this -- call it what you

15   want -- new precedent in cases still in the pipeline,

16   and we don't have to if the case has reached a final

17   judgment.   But "not required to" doesn't say "can't,

18   even if you want to."

19               MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, that brings me

20   back to the point where I started, which is that the

21   Constitution doesn't -- remember, we're using the

22   Federal Constitution here as authority to do something

23   that, for example, in this case the Minnesota Court

24   would be otherwise unable to do.

25               This defendant never raised the State law


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   claim.   Under -- never had -- this defendant never

 2   raised his State confrontation rights.                   So in this

 3   proceeding, the Minnesota Court would bar him from

 4   raising his confrontation --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             Let me take the other point

 6   here, which is Justice Scalia's, which I think I

 7   understand now.    Imagine that the Crawford begins to

 8   take effect as of the day of decision.                   No law like

 9   Crawford before.   But for practical reasons and reasons

10   having to do with courts, we let certain people take

11   advantage of it.   We let person A take advantage of it,

12   Mr. Crawford.   We let person B take advantage of it, who

13   is on direct appeal.       We don't let people in habeas take

14   advantage of it.

15               Why don't we let the State take advantage of

16   it in its collateral proceedings if the State wants to,

17   for reasons of federalism, for reasons they can do what

18   they want, for reasons if it is going to be the law in

19   the future any way?

20               MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor, my point is that

21   the State can take -- the State can do that as a matter

22   of State law.   The problem is with allowing the State to

23   extend the Federal standards here, is that the Federal

24   standards under Teague and under Griffith, but mainly

25   Griffith and Wharton together in this case, defines what


                                        46

 1   the constitutional requirement -- what constitutional

 2   standard this --

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:               May I ask another sort of

 4   basic question?     The Teague rule is a Federal rule --

 5   the Teague ruling.      What is your understanding of the

 6   source of that rule?        Is it the Court's power to

 7   announce, make Federal common law?                   Or is it a

 8   constitutionally mandated rule?

 9              I will give you one other decision, cover it

10   all at once.

11              And if it were not a judge-made rule, and

12   rather, it was a statute and it goes beyond regulating

13   Federal habeas corpus proceedings and effects State

14   court proceedings, what provision in the Constitution

15   would have given Congress the authority to enact such a

16   statute?

17              MR. DIAMOND:            Your Honor, let me --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Interpreting it the way

19   you interpret it.

20              MR. DIAMOND:            Let me try the first question,

21   and then we will see where we go.                  I think the source

22   of -- the authority for Teague is, frankly, the same

23   source for authority as it is for Griffith, and as the

24   same source of authority as in Griffith.                  Griffith talks

25   about -- the best I can do for that is Griffith talks


                                         47

 1   about it being grounded on basic norms of constitutional

 2   adjudication and the integrity of the judicial decision

 3   making.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Which qualifies for the

 5   Federal system.    Where is the authority to regulate the

 6   State system come from?

 7               MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor, I disagree in

 8   terms of that that all applies only in the Federal

 9   system.   If you look at, for example, the civil cases,

10   American Trucking, Reynoldsville, and Harper, they

11   talked about that same basic norms of constitutional

12   adjudication applying in the State forum as well.

13               I'm sorry.        There was a second part to your

14   question which was in terms of Congress being able to

15   amend or modify Teague in some fashion?

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:             No.      Where would Congress

17   get the authority to require State courts to follow the

18   rule, the interpretation of Teague that you're advancing

19   in this Court, that they may not go beyond the decisions

20   of this Court?    What under the Federal Constitution

21   authorizes the Federal government, either judges or

22   Congress, to tell State courts that they cannot do what

23   your opponent argues they should able to do?

24               MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor, I don't believe

25   that that's what's going on in the Federal habeas


                                        48

 1   statute.   I think this Court has said that --

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I agree when you are

 3   talking about what Federal court can do -- administering

 4   a Federal habeas corpus.           I have no problem.       I'm asking

 5   where does the Federal authority to tell State courts

 6   they cannot do what your opponent says they should be

 7   free to do?

 8                 MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I guess my source

 9   of confusion with your question is I don't understand

10   Teague is a rule from Congress.                I understand Teague is

11   a rule of this Court in terms -- describing what the

12   Constitution -- what constitutional standard applies to

13   what defendant.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            In Federal habeas corpus

15   proceedings, yes.

16                 MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, that's where the

17   point of agreement is.         I think Teague does many things,

18   but one of the things Teague does -- and, frankly, not

19   just Teague, the whole retroactivity jurisprudence of

20   this Court, Griffith and Teague together set up a

21   coherent whole.     Griffith treats finality.             Teague

22   post-finality.    And the process of this Court saying,

23   you this defendant enjoy this substantive Federal right,

24   you this defendant enjoy this substantive Federal right

25   that was active at the time your conviction became

 1   final --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:             The protection of this

 3   Court.    What -- why can't they provide more protection?

 4   What Federal rule prevents that?

 5                MR. DIAMOND:          Your Honor, I think what --

 6   the problem with it is in the constitutional design

 7   itself.    In terms of the Constitution provides

 8   requirements.    You don't have to get into Teague.

 9   Griffith and Wharton together, Wharton saying Teague

10   exceptions don't apply to Crawford, those two cases

11   together basically say the State's requirement to

12   provide this new constitutional rule ended when this

13   defendant's conviction became final.

14                At that point, that is the constitutional

15   requirement.    The constitutional design then is that

16   States are not free as a matter of Federal authority to

17   exceed that requirement.           They may not rely on Federal

18   authority to do that.        Just the same -- they can

19   certainly do it as a matter of their own authority.                But

20   the Constitution, for example, this defendant having

21   waived his State claims, having not raised them, the

22   Constitution doesn't allow the State of Minnesota --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Suppose it is a knock and

24   announce violation.       They don't want to apply an

25   exclusionary rule.      Can they apply a remedy that will

 1   fire any officer who does this?              Or will they say, no,

 2   you can't do that, because it goes beyond what the

 3   Federal Constitution requires?

 4               MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I think that if

 5   that remedy is grounded in State laws, the State of

 6   Minnesota could certainly do that.                 But I don't think

 7   they can rely on the Federal Constitution to fire any

 8   officer who does that.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could a -- could a State

10   say:   We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment,

11   is out.   Stone v. Powell says when it's -- when you

12   go through the direct process, that's the end of your

13   raising a search-and-seizure claim.

14               Could a State say:              Well, we know the Fourth

15   Amendment is binding on us under the Federal

16   Constitution, but we think that we should extend the

17   Fourth Amendment, right, not only to cases on direct

18   review but to collateral review as well?

19               Federal habeas courts can't do it, but could

20   States?

21               MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I think the answer

22   to that is probably yes, and the reason is different,

23   though.   The reason is the States -- we're not changing

24   the rights that the person is entitled to.

25               What we are -- what you're changing -- that

 1   is -- that is the remedy-and-right question again.              And

 2   -- and what I'm saying is that what Teague -- Griffith

 3   and Lorton together say that this person's

 4   constitutional right, the right that he had, was fixed

 5   when his conviction became final, as opposed to the case

 6   where you -- that you're postulating, which is the

 7   question of, yes, the State's going to recognize the

 8   Fourth Amendment right in its post-conviction -- does

 9   the right -- the content of the right, itself, is not

10   changed in that instance.

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Diamond, let me ask you

12   a question.    Let me ask you a question which is totally

13   off the point of the Federal Constitution, I guess.

14   That is, if Minnesota really wants the rule that you

15   want it to have, its legislature can provide that that

16   will be the rule, can't it?

17                 The Minnesota legislature can pass a statute

18   saying nobody gets more than Teague allows.

19                 MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I don't think the

20   Minnesota legislature could -- could go into the

21   pre-finality area.      In other words, the Minnesota

22   legislature --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Can the Minnesota

24   legislature say:     Look, the -- the Supreme Court of the

25   United States has -- has come down with some rules.              We

 1   won't characterize them as minimums or anything else.

 2   We'll just say it's a set of rules.                    It's called Teague,

 3   and Teague is going to be the law for the application of

 4   Federal rights in Minnesota State courts.                    Is -- can the

 5   Minnesota legislature do that?

 6              MR. DIAMOND:         Your Honor, I think, in that

 7   instance, the Minnesota legislature -- I see my time is

 8   up, but I think in that instance the Minnesota

 9   legislature is -- is providing the minimum that the

10   Constitution requires.      So the answer to --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            So the answer is yes.

12              MR. DIAMOND:         -- that is yes.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

15   Mr. Diamond.

16              Mr. Butler, you have a minute remaining.

17              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER

18                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19              MR. BUTLER:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20              Two quick points in my -- in my one minute:

21              On finality, the State court can weigh the

22   costs and benefits of upsetting the finality of its own

23   conviction, convictions rendered in State court and

24   appeals rendered in State court.

25              It can decide, as several States have, that


                                      53
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the interests in full adjudication of constitutional

 2   claims outweigh the interest in finality.

 3                 The question in Teague was whether the

 4   Federal court could decide that for the States, and the

 5   answer is no.    But the States can decide that for

 6   themselves.

 7                 On Justice Souter's point about what -- or

 8   somebody's point about what the source of authority was,

 9   Mr. Diamond said it was basic norms of constitutional

10   adjudication, and that is the phrase used in Griffith.

11                 That phrase is a minimum.                  The basic norms

12   of constitutional adjudication require the following:

13   They require application of new rules to pending cases,

14   even though the conduct had already -- had already

15   happened.

16                 They don't require anything more than that,

17   and we're not here asking the Court to hold that they

18   do.   We're simply asking the Court -- I see my time is

19   up.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why don't you finish

21   your sentence.

22                 MR. BUTLER:       We are simply asking the Court

23   to hold that if the State wishes to go beyond the

24   minimum, they are free to do so.

25                 Thank you.
