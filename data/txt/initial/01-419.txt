 5   Wrecker Service, Inc.

 7                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


 8                        ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 9             MR. SUTTON:              Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.                     May


10   it please the Court:


11             The question presented in this case is whether


12   Congress in 1994 divested the States of their traditional


13   authority to delegate police powers over local safety


14   matters to their political subdivisions.                            It would be no


15   small matter for Congress to impose such a restriction on


16   the States, and we submit they did no such thing in this


17   instance. 


18             In making that point, it may be helpful to look


19   at the text of the statute, which is reprinted in full in


20   the appendix to our brief, the blue brief.                              And page A-2


21   of that appendix specifically repeats the language of


22   (c)(2)(A), the operative provision at issue here. 


23             And our first point, as a matter of the language


24   of the statute, is that Congress specifically said that


25   the preemption provision, quote, "shall not restrict the


                                                    3

                                         Alderson Reporting Company
                   1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   safety regulatory authority of a State."


 2              Now, prior to 1994, Ohio, the State of Ohio, had


 3   exercised regulatory authority in this area by delegating


 4   its power specifically over tow truck regulations to local


 5   political subdivisions.             It's very difficult for us to


 6   understand how the court of appeals interpretation does


 7   not in fact, quote, "restrict the safety regulatory


 8   authority of a State."            That's --


 9              QUESTION:         Well, I think the argument on the


10   other side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1)


11   does say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no


12   interstate agency.         It talks about a political subdivision


13   so that when you come down to the section you've just


14   quoted, and it only says State, there's perhaps a fair


15   inference that only a State and not a political


16   subdivision is included. 


17              MR. SUTTON:          Yes, Your Honor.               And the normal


18   Russello argument is that a litigant like myself is trying


19   to read into another provision a term that is specifically


20   mentioned elsewhere in the statute.                      Here the suggestion


21   is that we're trying to read the term, political


22   subdivision, into (c)(2)(A).                That's not what we're trying


23   to do. 


24              What we're saying is the traditional safety


25   regulatory authority of a State was preserved by (c)(2)(A)


                                                 4

                                      Alderson Reporting Company
                1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   and traditionally States, including Ohio, had specifically


 2   exercised that authority by delegating it in some


 3   instances to State executive branch agencies and in other


 4   instances, specifically here, to political subdivisions.


 5             QUESTION:         Would your argument be the same if


 6   the State had not made a specific delegation?                            Did it make


 7   a specific delegation with respect to tow trucks?


 8             MR. SUTTON:          Actually it did, although it's --


 9   it's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate


10   all motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted


11   tow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like


12   Columbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances.                                So, in


13   fact, in this case it would be specific, although I


14   wouldn't say our argument rests on that point.                             Many


15   States like Ohio are home rule States, which in their


16   constitutions give general grants to political


17   subdivisions to have powers of local self-government.                                So,


18   in this case, I -- I would say it's a little easier


19   because there was something specific as to tow trucks, but


20   I wouldn't say that our argument rests on that point.


21             QUESTION:         Mr. Sutton, would -- would you look a


22   little further down in, in the provision set forth in the


23   appendix to your brief?            Look on page A-3.                You were


24   reading from (c)(2)(A) --


25             MR. SUTTON:          Yes, Your Honor.

               1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1               QUESTION:         -- in which it says, shall not


 2   restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.                               And


 3   you say that includes, you know, political subdivisions of


 4   a State.


 5               MR. SUTTON:          No.      That it includes the right to


 6   delegate political subdivisions.


 7               QUESTION:         All right.           Okay.       Just read two --


 8   two lines later, (2)(C) where it says, does not apply.


 9               MR. SUTTON:          Right. 


10               QUESTION:         Again, it uses the same -- shall not


11   restrict, does not apply to the authority of a State, or a


12   political subdivision of a State, to enact or enforce a


13   law, regulation, or other provision.                       Why in that


14   provision does it say does not apply to a State or a


15   political subdivision?             Because you're telling us, when


16   you say State, it includes whatever authority the State


17   has to delegate to a political subdivision.


18               MR. SUTTON:          We're not saying --


19               QUESTION:         You wouldn't have --


20               MR. SUTTON:          We're not --


21               QUESTION:         -- you wouldn't have needed that


22   language there.


23               MR. SUTTON:          We're not saying States are


24   political subdivisions.              We're simply saying the


25   preservation of a State, deregulatory authority of a State


                                                  6

 1   includes the power to delegate. 


 2              But as to (c)(2)(C), keep in mind that was a


 3   1995 amendment.       That was not part of the original


 4   legislation.     So, the suggestion would be that


 5   Congress's --


 6              QUESTION:         Well --


 7              MR. SUTTON:          -- style in 1995 modified the 1994


 8   act.   And no one is arguing --


 9              QUESTION:         I think we always look at an act in


10   toto and -- and don't try to piece it apart as to what was


11   enacted when.     It seems to me we have to make sense of


12   this statute as a whole.


13              MR. SUTTON:          That's -- that's true, Your Honor. 


14   But I -- in O'Gilve, the Court said specifically that a


15   later act cannot modify the terms of an earlier act.


16              But let me -- I think there's another answer


17   that --


18              QUESTION:         It doesn't modify it, but it -- it


19   can give clear indication of what -- of what it meant. 
 I

20   mean, you're assuming that it modifies it.


21              MR. SUTTON:          Right.          Well, Your Honor, the --


22   the thing that I think may be helpful in thinking about


23   (c)(2)(C) and the other mentions of political subdivision


24   throughout 14501 is they're all in the context of --


25   context of the enact or enforce language, which is exactly


                                                 7

                                      Alderson Reporting Company
                1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   how (c)(1) reads.          (c)(1) says these political bodies may


 2   not enact or enforce these particular laws.                             That, of


 3   course, is not the way (c)(2)(A) or, for that matter,


 4   (a)(2) -- (a)(2) does exactly the same thing.                               It


 5   preserves the safety regulatory authority of the State


 6   over these various other provisions elsewhere identified


 7   in title 49.


 8                When it comes to (c)(2)(C), it's dealing with a


 9   topic specifically mentioned in (c)(1), prices.                                And it


10   follows the exact same structure of(c)(1), not


11   surprisingly, because it's dealing with a topic that is


12   covered in (c)(1).


13                (c)(2)(A) --


14                QUESTION:         Mr. Sutton, are you making the


15   distinction there between the safety regulations which


16   would be covered under (c)(2) and the economic regulation


17   which would be the main prohibition?


18                MR. SUTTON:          Exactly, Your Honor.                  And there was


19   a division of authority, going back to 1966, where the old


20   ICC had regulated all of the economic issues over motor


21   carriers, and the Department of Transportation had


22   regulated all the safety issues.                     And what happens in 1994


23   is they're simply deregulating.                     The ICC is deregulating


24   this area.     They wanted to make sure, as this Court said


25   in Morales, that States wouldn't undo that particular


                                                   8

                  1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   deregulatory effort.          But at the same time, as (c)(2)(A)


 2   and (a)(2) makes clear, they wanted to preserve the


 3   provisions of a separate part of title 49 dealing with


 4   safety issues, something that DOT, a separate agency, had


 5   always regulated.       And I hope, Justice Scalia, this will


 6   help in getting to your -- your point.


 7             QUESTION:         There's a --


 8             MR. SUTTON:          Oh, I'm sorry. 


 9             QUESTION:         There's a question I think that still


10   would be left open even if you prevail; that is, whether


11   these regulations are appropriately characterized as


12   economic or safety.         You say they're all safety. 


13             MR. SUTTON:          Absolutely. 


14             QUESTION:         But that hasn't been adjudicated yet.


15             MR. SUTTON:          Absolutely.            And -- and if -- if


16   the court of appeals decision would reverse, it would


17   certainly be within the rights of respondents to go back


18   to the Sixth Circuit and say, as to some of these


19   provisions of the Columbus code, they are not in fact


20   safety ordinances or safety provisions, and therefore they


21   could be regulated as a price, route, or service. 


22             But there's another, I think, important point


23   that responds to this issue of the mention of political


24   subdivisions elsewhere in 14501.                  I think there is general


25   agreement in the case that as to (c)(2)(A), all of the


                                                9

               1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   other words, every single other word in (c)(2)(A)


 2   including, for example, the definition of the term safety,


 3   is defined not from 1994 on by looking at the difference


 4   of -- between safety and price, routes, or services


 5   mentioned in (c)(1) -- in other words, you would not


 6   define safety after 1994 based on its contextual


 7   comparison to prices --


 8             QUESTION:         Where -- where exactly is (c)(2)(A)?


 9             MR. SUTTON:          Excuse me, Your Honor.                    It's on


10    A-2 of our appendix, and it's -- it's labeled motor


11   carriers of property.          Excuse me.           I should have made that


12   more clear.


13             The point I was trying to make is that these


14   other terms in (c)(2)(A) I think all would agree would be


15   defined by other provisions in title 49.                        For example, the


16   word safety would be defined by the provisions in chapter


17   311 of title 49, which is a large -- a large section of


18   the code dealing with safety provisions.                        It would not be


19   within the States' rights after 1994 to suddenly start


20   reinventing new definitions of safety, new definitions of


21   hazardous materials routing restrictions or size and


22   weight routing restrictions.               We would be stuck with all


23   of those definitions, including notably those preemption


24   provisions.    We think it would be a rather odd


25   interpretation of (c)(2)(A) to say that, yes, you


                                               10

               1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   determine the meaning of all of these preserved matters by


 2   reference to other parts of title 49, but you do not do so


 3   when it comes to what the meaning of safety regulatory


 4   authority of a State is.


 5              And when you look at those other provisions of


 6   title 49, it's quite clear that Congress contemplated in


 7   all of them -- routing restrictions, safety -- that States


 8   could delegate their power to local subdivisions.                                  That's


 9   not only in some of the statutory provisions, but it's in


10   the regulations. 


11              QUESTION:         Well, but it's not defined.                          It


12   doesn't -- there's not a definition that says, State


13   includes political subdivision of a State.


14              MR. SUTTON:          That's not our argument, Your


15   Honor.   We're not saying a State --


16              QUESTION:         I understand it's not your argument. 


17              MR. SUTTON:          We're not saying --


18              QUESTION:         It would be a stronger argument if


19   that were your argument.             That -- that's my point. 


20              (Laughter.) 


21              MR. SUTTON:          I -- I disagree, Your Honor.                            We're


22   not saying that -- Congress -- let me put it this way. 


23   Congress has no right to empower a city.                         Congress can't


24   create a city.      They can't give it a power.                       That's a


25   power the States have.            It made perfect sense in (c)(2)(A)

 2   because it's the State legislature's job to determine what


 3   other political bodies, if any, regulate in that area.


 4             QUESTION:         Well, in that connection, I was going


 5   to ask could this -- suppose that you do not prevail in


 6   this case and we accept the respondents' interpretation. 


 7   Could the State then every year have a cleanup statute in


 8   which it says the State hereby adopts -- or authorizes


 9   cities that are no less than X number of persons, no


10   greater than Y number of persons, obviously referring to


11   the City of Columbus, that -- that the State then allows


12   specifically Columbus to regulate, that it have an


13   ordinance and it just tracks the whole ordinance?


14             MR. SUTTON:          Absolutely, Your Honor.                     And that


15   we think --


16             QUESTION:         So, then we're not arguing about very


17   much in your view. 


18             MR. SUTTON:          Well, Your Honor, that would strike


19   me as an extraordinary hoop for Congress to ask the States


20   to step through.       We're not aware of a single statute that


21   this Court has ever construed to mean that State


22   legislatures alone, but not their political subdivisions,


23   can regulate a particular area.                  I'm not aware of a single


24   statute where that's ever happened. 


25             QUESTION:         There's a -- there's a problem with

 2   you give me an example of a safety regulation that a city


 3   might want to have that wouldn't have a negative impact or


 4   some impact on routes? 


 5             MR. SUTTON:          Right.          Excuse me?         The last word?


 6             QUESTION:         On routes. 


 7             MR. SUTTON:          Right.          The -- and I think the


 8   respondents' point is or suggestion is that it would be


 9   quite natural for Congress to say, as to routing


10   restrictions, we want uniform laws.                     We want them to be


11   the same throughout the State, and we don't want to bother


12   with municipalities establishing different regulations for


13   a routing restriction.           Well, the -- the whole point of a


14   routing restriction is to account for differences within


15   the topography or geography of the States.


16             QUESTION:         Yes, but I mean, there's a long


17   history in the ICC of trying to create, say, dynamite


18   truck routes.     Well, you can imagine what something like


19   that does once you start talking about it within the city. 


20   And -- and every neighborhood in sight says, send it


21   somewhere else.      So, it's not illogical that people who


22   are worried about creating uniformity of routes would say,


23   keep the cities out of this.               It's -- it's a nightmare.


24             And -- and -- but I have no reason to know


25   whether this is so or not.              And so I ask you, is there any

 2   of routing nightmare when you talk about cities?


 3             MR. SUTTON:          Well, hazardous -- I -- I don't


 4   think the general rule has been that either the Federal


 5   Government or the States have been concerned about heavily


 6   populated regions deciding, for example, to route


 7   hazardous materials around their beltway as opposed to


 8   through the middle.         Everyone thinks that's a good idea,


 9   and the cities generally, including Columbus, have been


10   left in control of that kind of decision, which is


11   something obviously one doesn't need to worry about --


12             QUESTION:         But I'm looking for specifically --


13             MR. SUTTON:          In a size and weight situation, of


14   course, you're going to situations where bridges or


15   particular roads in, you know, densely populated areas


16   require different rules than in rural regions of a State


17   where, for example, the roads are bigger and even if


18   they're not bigger, they're not as near to either


19   businesses or heavily populated areas.


20             QUESTION:         How about a restriction that on a


21   particular residential street that's, nonetheless, an


22   arterial highway, no trucks over 10 tons?


23             MR. SUTTON:          Could -- could a -- a -- the


24   question, first of all, would be whether that relates to


25   interstate commerce, and if it relates to interstate


                                               14

 1   commerce -- that is, commerce between States -- then the


 2   Department of Transportation is -- is going to very


 3   heavily regulate that particular route restriction and --


 4   and has authority to preempt it, even as a matter of


 5   regulation.   If it's purely intrastate, traditionally


 6   that's been something that Congress or the agencies hardly


 7   regulated at all, and to the extent they regulated them,


 8   it was only when there was Federal funding.                          But for the


 9   most part, the regime has been that a locality makes that


10   decision through a delegation of power from their State


11   legislature. 


12             QUESTION:         Mr. Sutton, can I ask you, do you


13   regard -- just assume the -- assume the other side is


14   right on their interpretation.                 Would that mean that a


15   city could not fix speed limits in neighborhoods?                                Speed


16   limit is a safety regulation, isn't it? 


17             MR. SUTTON:          It is, Your Honor, but title 49 --


18   I think it's 31147 -- specifically says that traffic laws


19   -- I think a speeding limit would fall under that --


20             QUESTION:         It would be a traffic law?


21             MR. SUTTON:          -- is something that the Department


22   of Transportation does not regulate and neither does


23   Congress, which to me is one more indicator that you


24   don't, after 1994, start having free-form debates about


25   what safety means.

 4   speed limit rules?


 5                MR. SUTTON:          On what ground?               I mean, it would


 6   have to be a price, route, or service for there to be


 7   preemption.


 8                QUESTION:         No.     I mean, if -- if you read the


 9   (c)(2)(A) --

12   can -- are -- preserve the right to -- to regulate

15                QUESTION:         -- it seems to me that would preempt


16   a local government's right to fix a 15-mile limit in a


17   school zone. 


18                MR. SUTTON:          I understand what you're saying. 
 I

19   think the position they would take -- and maybe they could


20   clarify this -- is that if it's not a price, route, or


21   service, you ignore (c)(2)(A), and you simply go to the


22   rest of title 49.          But I'm not -- I don't know the answer

 2   legislative acts, are being preempted in this case.                               Let's


 3   ignore the State of Ohio.              New York.          The State of New


 4   York says as to populations with more than 1 million


 5   people, the cities in -- those populations can enact tow


 6   truck ordinances.        This interpretation that the court of


 7   appeals embraced preempts that State law.                          There's no --


 8   strictly speaking, there's no such thing as a city law


 9   divorced from a State law.               The city power comes from the


10   States and there's just no such thing.                        And we think, as


11   the lack of parallelism between (c)(1) and (c)(2)


12   indicates, all they were doing was preserving that


13   traditional safety regulatory authority of a State.

18                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


19                    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


20          AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


21              MR. STEWART:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


22   please the Court:


23              The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a


24   State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to


25   encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate


                                                17

 1   its powers to political subdivisions.                      That view is


 2   supported by the larger statutory context in which the


 3   phrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act. 


 4             As Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court


 5   has frequently recognized, one integral component of the


 6   State's ability to regulate within its borders is to


 7   delegate as much or as little power as it wishes to


 8   subordinate political units. 


 9             QUESTION:         We understand all that, of course. 


10   And -- and in isolation, that phrase most naturally would


11   -- would mean safety regulatory authority of a State,


12   including, of course, its ability to delegate it to


13   municipalities. 


14             But what is sticking in our craw is the fact


15   that elsewhere in the statute, the language is very


16   careful to distinguish between the authority of a State,


17   on the one hand, and the -- and the separate authority of


18   political subdivisions of the State.                     Now, what -- what is


19   your explanation for those other separations?


20             MR. STEWART:           I guess there are about three


21   responses we would make. 


22             The first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is


23   not a case in which the other provisions are identical but


24   for the inclusion of the word political subdivision.                             For


25   instance, in subsection (c)(2)(C), which is at the -- the


                                               18

 1   top of A-3 of the --


 2             QUESTION:             Right. 


 3             MR. STEWART:               -- petitioners' brief, it refers


 4   to the authority of a State or a political subdivision of


 5   a State to enact or enforce a law.                        Now, even though


 6   delegating power to municipalities is an integral feature


 7   of the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be


 8   less than clear that when a municipality enacted or


 9   enforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not


10   necessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced


11   that law. 


12             And so, if the provision left out political


13   subdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does


14   not apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce


15   a law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress -- whether


16   it was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose


17   to eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express


18   reference to political subdivision. 


19             But the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A)


20   is simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and


21   that, as you say, would most naturally be construed to


22   encompass the authority to delegate power to


23   municipalities. 


24             The second point is that based on the country's


25   traditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for


                                                   19

 2   amount of power that should be delegated to subordinate


 3   political units.


 4              QUESTION:            Has there been any -- what's the


 5   closest case respondents could cite to show a contrary


 6   practice? 


 7              MR. STEWART:              I believe the respondents have


 8   cited a couple of court of appeals cases which have


 9   held --


10              QUESTION:            From this Court?


11              MR. STEWART:              None from this Court.                   The -- the


12   respondents have not cited any case in which this Court


13   has held that any Federal statute had the effect of


14   divesting a State of its authority to delegate power to


15   political subdivisions. 


16              QUESTION:            Well, there are many Federal statutes


17   that -- that make grants to municipalities for various


18   functions and don't make it to the State.                             This is a --


19   certainly the Federal Government interfering in the


20   relationship between the State and its municipalities. 


21   And the State has no -- no ability to veto whether the


22   municipality is going to accept those funds or not.                                  And


23   there's -- there's been a lot of controversy within the


24   States between the municipalities and the State government


25   as to -- as to what money should be accepted and so forth.

 1   It seems to me that has exactly the same effect as what


 2   you're talking about here.              The Federal Government has,


 3   indeed, indeed, intervened in the relationship between the


 4   State and its -- and its political subdivisions.


 5             MR. STEWART:           We cited the Lee Deadwood case in


 6   our brief as support for the proposition that Congress


 7   would constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal


 8   law without preempting State law if it chose.                            Our only


 9   point is it would be sufficiently unusual that we would


10   expect Congress to address the matter fairly directly.


11             QUESTION:         Mr. Stewart, would you be able to


12   give us any examples of municipal safety regulations that


13   are preempted by this section as it's been interpreted


14   below?


15             MR. STEWART:           We -- I think that as it's been


16   interpreted --


17             QUESTION:         As a practical matter?


18             MR. STEWART:           As it's been interpreted below, I


19   believe the types of regulations that have been held


20   preempted are -- are fairly similar to the City of


21   Columbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which


22   the vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure


23   proficiency in the operation of the vehicle.                           And those

 1                QUESTION:         So, we're really talking about


 2   licensing schemes. 


 3                Is this anything that the State couldn't


 4   undertake to do itself with its State driver's license and


 5   so forth?


 6                MR. STEWART:           I -- I think that the licensing


 7   scheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate


 8   that to municipalities, it -- in truth I think this is


 9   something that could fairly realistically be accomplished


10   at the State level. 


11                Now, with respect to some of the other matters


12   that are specified in (c)(2)(A), for instance, route


13   controls based on size and weight or hazardous nature of


14   the cargo, because the determination at issue is whether a


15   particular vehicle or a particular cargo is suitable for a


16   particular stretch of road, those are the sorts of things


17   that can't realistically be expected to be done in their


18   entirety at the State level.                  And therefore, it would be a


19   particular disruption of the State's processes --


20                QUESTION:         Mr. Stewart, before your time goes


21   out, will you give us your third point too?                             You gave us


22   the first two. 


23                MR. STEWART:           The third point is that to the


24   extent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and


25   the Court wants to interpret it by reference to other


                                                  22

 1   relevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine


 2   the larger statutory context.                  That is, (c)(2)(A) is not


 3   limited to safety.        It specifies these other matters, and


 4   as Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are


 5   covered in detail in different provisions of title 49.                           In


 6   general, those other provisions of title 49 contain their


 7   own preemption provisions.              They explain at -- at great


 8   length what States can and can't do.                     At least in the area


 9   of safety, State law is specifically defined to include


10   the law of the local governmental unit, and so the -- the


11   safety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically


12   contemplates municipal safety regulation.                         And it would be


13   odd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has


14   superseded that carefully developed statutory framework.


15             And to put this in larger historical context, to


16   follow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the


17   Federal level there was division of regulatory authority


18   between the ICC which did economic regulation and the


19   Department of Transportation which did safety regulation.


20   And it's no coincidence that State law as to economic


21   matters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC


22   saw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually


23   eliminated altogether.           This was part of a larger program


24   of deregulating the economics of commercial trucking. 


25   But --

 1              QUESTION:         Who -- who administers this statute? 


 2   Is there a Federal agency that -- that can be said to be


 3   administering this -- this statute?


 4              MR. STEWART:           There -- there is no Federal


 5   agency entrusted with the administration of this


 6   particular statute.          The Department of Transportation


 7   administers the related provisions of title 49 that are


 8   specifically addressed to these matters, and their


 9   implementation of their responsibilities under those


10   provisions would be affected by this Court's decision in


11   this case because if there is no municipal safety


12   regulation at all, that would obviously have an impact on


13   their administration of the scheme for determining when


14   municipal regulation is and is not permitted.                             But they


15   are not specifically entrusted with authority over this


16   scheme.


17              So -- so to return to the point about the


18   division of responsibilities, Congress eliminated the ICC,


19   eliminated Federal economic regulation of commercial


20   trucking, and at the same time it preempted State law in


21   order to ensure that the States didn't undo the Federal


22   deregulatory efforts.           But there's been no Federal


23   deregulation in matters of trucking safety.                           The prior


24   provisions of title 49 remain on the books.


25              There's no expression of congressional


                                                24

 1   discontent with the manner in which power in those areas


 2   has been divided between the Federal, State, and local


 3   governments.      To the contrary, the conference report


 4   accompanying the 1994 act refers specifically to those


 5   preexisting provisions and expresses the intent that their


 6   administration continue unchanged.


 7               QUESTION:         May I ask this question on the


 8   division of responsibility?                 Is it your view -- your


 9   understanding that the cities would not be able in their


10   licensing scheme to regulate the rates that the truckers


11   charge? 


12               MR. STEWART:           That's correct. 


13               If there are no further questions, I have


14   nothing further. 


15               QUESTION:         To what extent, Mr. Stewart, does the


16   Department of Transportation -- you said there's no


17   administrator of the statute, but they do have authority


18   under the motor safety -- motor carrier safety assistance


19   program that seems to be relevant. 


20               MR. STEWART:           The motor carrier safety


21   assistance program, and they also have authority under


22   other provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be


23   preempted State and local laws -- State and local safety


24   laws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce. 


25   Again, those are not provisions of this particular

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY


 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


 8              QUESTION:         Mr. Cordray, I hope you'll tell us


 9   the practical effects of the decision below.


10              MR. CORDRAY:           The practical effect of the


11   decision below, as you uncovered it in your questioning


12   earlier, is that Federal law preempts municipalities and


13   other local governments from imposing their own individual


14   licensing schemes upon motor carriers of property and that


15   is --


16              QUESTION:         Well, it also speaks to routes or


17   weight limitations.          Are there situations where the city


18   or town is particularly aware of traffic problems within


19   the city or a weak bridge or something and that its


20   limitations are needed? 


21              MR. CORDRAY:           Size and weight limitations, as


22   the other matters addressed in (c)(2)(A), would be


23   regulated at the State level, not at the local level under


24   the proper reading of this statute.                      And the reason is


25   that Congress did not want to open up the trucking


                                                26

 2   which is deregulate it nationwide and create an unfettered


 3   free market for trucking and transportation services. 


 4             QUESTION:         So that if a city says no trucks


 5   through the park with the public playground between


 6   certain hours, that has to be the -- the State?                             That's


 7   the only one that could do that? 


 8             MR. CORDRAY:            That could be done at the State


 9   level and it could be done either by going to the State


10   legislature, as you suggested, or it could be done by


11   setting up a very simple administrative scheme at the


12   State level where you would go to the State department --


13             QUESTION:         Well, why would --


14             QUESTION:         Well, most cities I've been in had --


15             QUESTION:         -- why would Congress choose to -- to


16   regulate in that way, say we want the State to do it but


17   not the locality? 


18             MR. CORDRAY:            Specifically because they were


19   trying to deregulate this market nationwide.                           To leave in


20   place every municipality with the option to license


21   different motor carriers of property is not only --


22             QUESTION:         No.     I'm not talking about licensing. 


23   I'm talking about the -- the example of, say, that no


24   trucks over 10 tons on this particular road. 


25             MR. CORDRAY:            Again, I think that petitioners

 1   agree and all the courts have agreed that every subsection


 2   of (c)(2)(A) has to be read together, and to the extent


 3   municipal authority is being preempted in one respect,


 4   it's being preempted in all.               And the reason is that


 5   Congress was recognizing that schemes directed


 6   specifically to motor carriers of property at the local


 7   level simply incorporated too much regulation that would


 8   interfere with and impede a free market for transportation


 9   services and motor carriers --


10             QUESTION:         May I ask a similar question? 


11   Supposing that there's a heavy rain storm in a city or


12   something and it becomes unsafe to use a certain street if


13   the truck is over a certain size.                   Could -- the police


14   would not be permitted to divert the traffic around that


15   particular flooded area, I suppose. 


16             MR. CORDRAY:            Certainly they could.                  This goes


17   to your question you asked earlier which is whether


18   traffic laws, ordinary, general traffic laws, would be


19   preempted under our --


20             QUESTION:         No.     This is for safety reasons.


21             MR. CORDRAY:            -- statute --


22             QUESTION:         They figure it's -- it's dangerous


23   because the thing is too deep and the trucks have to over-


24   set -- overturn or something like that.

 1   would be diverting --


 2             QUESTION:         It would be preempted, I guess. 


 3             MR. CORDRAY:           They would be -- no.                  They would


 4   be diverting presumably all traffic that's heavy enough to


 5   create a safety problem. 


 6             QUESTION:         Supposing -- truck size traffic, yes.


 7             MR. CORDRAY:           Yes, but -- but it's not directed


 8   simply to motor carriers of property.                      It's directed to


 9   all trucks, all oversize vehicles.                    It could be private


10   vehicles, RVs that people use to take vacations, whatever


11   it might be.    That would be permissible. 


12             And traffic laws, I want to stress, are not


13   preempted by this statute.              This statute is not limitless. 


14   As this Court has --


15             QUESTION:         Well, then what about the -- the


16   answer that you gave earlier to the question that the


17   Chief Justice and I had?            No -- no trucks through the


18   playground or -- or through a residential neighborhood at


19   a certain time.      I thought you said that would be


20   preempted, but now you're saying it applies only if


21   they're motor carriers of property?


22             MR. CORDRAY:           Let me step back.                If the


23   ordinance related to all oversize vehicles -- that would


24   be a general traffic regulation -- that would be


25   permissible.    And I'll -- and I'll get to that in a


                                               29

 1   moment, why traffic laws are not preempted by the statute. 


 2   They -- they are not related to price, route, or service


 3   of motor carriers of property.


 4               If it was directed specifically to a type of


 5   motor carrier of property, as this licensing scheme is --


 6   it applies directly, specifically, and only to tow trucks


 7   -- that would be a different matter.                       Municipalities are


 8   not permitted to do that, and Congress specifically wanted


 9   to do that because although there was a tradition of lots


10   of regulation at the State and local level, Congress was


11   making a policy decision, as it's free to do, to say that


12   all of that is impeding a free market for transportation


13   services and motor carriers that's affecting broad


14   segments of the American economy.                     We want to bring down


15   costs, rid us of these inefficiencies --


16               QUESTION:         I understand that, but I'm at the


17   same question that I think everyone has asked.                               In my mind


18   -- and I might be misremembering -- there are lots of


19   streets -- there used to be in San Francisco and you'd see


20   a sign, and it would say, no trucks over 3-and-a-half


21   tons.    And it seems to me in Boston I can think of seeing


22   signs.    I thought maybe they said, no trucks over such and


23   such.    Maybe they just say no vehicle over such and such. 


24   And my impression is that in many cities there are many


25   such streets, and which streets there are is a matter for


                                                 30

 1   the municipality to decide.                  And it's a shifting pattern,


 2   and typically it's in residential areas.                           And there's lots


 3   of local regulation of that kind.                      That's my impression.


 4                And I want to know, on your reading of this


 5   statute, does this change when I'm thinking of those signs


 6   on one street after another?                  Does that all change because


 7   they're preempted, and now each neighborhood has to go to


 8   Sacramento, if they're in California, and convince the --


 9   the legislature?          I'd be very surprised if that is so,


10   that Congress changed so well established a municipal


11   pattern of behavior without saying anything about it.                               And


12   therefore, I think everyone is driving at the same


13   question.     I understand about all the licensing stuff, but


14   I want to know the answer to that question. 


15                MR. CORDRAY:           All right.           Again, it's not what's


16   specifically at issue in this case, but I understand the


17   Court wants the answer to the hypothetical.                             Absolutely.


18                QUESTION:         It has nothing to do with this case. 


19   I'm saying when your -- accept the fact that if I accept


20   your position in this case --


21                MR. CORDRAY:           Yes. 


22                QUESTION:         -- at the moment I'm thinking all


23   this traditional regulation of what street you can use if


24   you're a truck is being wiped out.                       I mean, that's


25   relevant.

 1              MR. CORDRAY:              It could be dealt with either of


 2   two ways, Your Honor.              Either it could be regarded as a


 3   general traffic law, like a one-way street, like a speed


 4   limit, and the like, in which case we believe that it


 5   would not come within the preemption clause ex ante


 6   because it has to have a connection with or reference to


 7   motor carriers of property to come within the terms of


 8   this preemption clause --


 9              QUESTION:            Motor carriers of property or just


10   motor carriers? 


11              MR. CORDRAY:              Motor carriers of property which


12   is what --


13              QUESTION:            In other words, if they -- if they


14   don't say on the street motor carriers of property cannot


15   use this, then it's not preempted. 


16              MR. CORDRAY:              Then it is a general traffic


17   regulation no different from where the speed limit says 55

20              QUESTION:            Well, does the term, motor carriers


21   of property -- does that mean motor carriers of property


22   for hire or any motor carrier that is carrying property?


23              MR. CORDRAY:              Well, it would be those who come


24   within the terms of this specific preemption clause.

 1   Which does it mean? 


 2                MR. CORDRAY:           Yes.      I -- I believe that this


 3   statute is referring to for hire carriers of -- motor


 4   carriers of property.


 5                QUESTION:         So -- so, if a State were to say all


 6   prices of all trucks in this State have to be $50 -- all


 7   trucks -- and they don't say motor carriers of property,


 8   that's not preempted. 


 9                MR. CORDRAY:           No, that is not correct because


10   it's specifically referenced --


11                QUESTION:         Of course, it's not correct.                          And


12   similarly, if they say on a street, no truck can use this


13   street --


14                MR. CORDRAY:           Yes. 


15                QUESTION:         -- and they don't say motor carriers


16   of property, it's the same. 


17                MR. CORDRAY:           The reason is -- no.                  The reason


18   is that specifically references price.                          There are lots of


19   laws that in -- tangentially will affect routes.                                    All


20   right?   A one-way street law, for example, has to be


21   obeyed by trucks, just as it is by cars.                           That's not


22   within this preemption clause.                    So, that's one way to


23   address it.      All right.           And -- and that would be true of


24   all general traffic laws, just as it's true of all general


25   tort laws, general tax laws.

 2   on page A-2, (c)(1), the general rule.                       It has at the very


 3   end of it the phrase, with respect to the transportation


 4   of property.


 5             MR. CORDRAY:           Right. 


 6             QUESTION:         Where are you reading from?


 7             QUESTION:         I'm reading on page A-2, (c)(1), the


 8   general rule from which (c)(2) is -- is an exception.                             And


 9   the general rule is, except as provided, blah, blah, blah,


10   blah, no State, political subdivision shall enact any


11   provision having the force and effect of law related to a


12   price, route, or service of any motor carrier.                             And then


13   there's a lot of other language.                  And then at the very


14   end, with respect to the transportation of property.                             Does


15   that phrase at the end go all the way back to related to a


16   price, route, or service with respect to the


17   transportation of property?


18             MR. CORDRAY:           I believe it does, Your Honor, and


19   it's just -- it's just --


20             QUESTION:         Well, that would make it a very


21   narrow provision then, wouldn't it, that -- that we're


22   excluding the -- the municipalities from?


23             MR. CORDRAY:           I believe it is.

 3               QUESTION:         But you're -- you're asking -- you're


 4   asking us to -- to have a very careful grammatically


 5   correct reading of the act, and in your answer that --


 6   that you've just given to Justice Scalia, transportation


 7   of property is preceded by an or.                     It seems to me the


 8   first clause is quite independent, related to a price,


 9   route, or service of any motor carrier.                         That's it.


10               MR. CORDRAY:           With --


11               QUESTION:         So, I'm not sure the qualification


12   you urge on us, in order to mitigate the effects of this


13   holding works.


14               QUESTION:         Well, I don't know what it would go


15   to if it didn't go to that.                 It can't go to the stuff


16   after the or.      Or any motor -- motor private carrier,


17   broker or freight forwarder with respect to the


18   transportation of -- what is a -- what is a motor private


19   carrier with respect to the transportation of -- of


20   property?    It has no meaning unless you read it all the


21   way back up to price, route, or service with respect to


22   the transportation --


23               MR. CORDRAY:           And the title of the provision is


24   motor carriers of property.                 That's specifically what


25   they're dealing with, as distinguished from motor carriers

 3             QUESTION:         It's not the best statute, is it?


 4             MR. CORDRAY:           I beg your pardon? 


 5             QUESTION:         It's not the best statute. 


 6             (Laughter.) 


 7             MR. CORDRAY:           It's -- it's clear enough with


 8   respect to the things we care about here, which is that --


 9             QUESTION:         Well, but I don't think it is.


10             MR. CORDRAY:           -- Congress very carefully


11   attempted to distinguish between a State and a political


12   subdivision of a State.            And it did so repeatedly in the


13   statute for the specific purpose of drawing a distinction


14   between them.    And the only way --


15             QUESTION:         There's not a word of legislative


16   history I take it --


17             QUESTION:         If you read (c)(1) as narrowly as


18   you're suggesting, you don't even need the exemption


19   because it only relates to law, regulation, or other


20   provision related to price, route, or service.                             So -- and


21   it doesn't even reach safety. 


22             MR. CORDRAY:           No, that's not true, Your Honor. 


23   And this case is a good example of it.                       They are


24   attempting to impose a licensing scheme with respect to


25   tow trucks and could do it with respect to any motor


                                               36

 1   carrier of property, parcel delivery service, or the like. 


 2   And their -- their rationale for doing so apparently is


 3   safety.    But in fact, that is exactly what is preempted by


 4   this statute and by this clause. 


 5               QUESTION:         But, Mr. Cordray, that's open.                        Mr.


 6   Sutton said that that question whether these regulations


 7   are genuine safety regulations or, on the other hand,


 8   economic is not determined by this case.                          Here the


 9   question is whatever is safety, may the State delegate


10   that authority to the municipalities.


11               I did want to get your response to a question


12   Justice Kennedy asked Mr. -- and it was answered for you


13   by Mr. Sutton.       Suppose the State says, okay, we do


14   business by dealing with municipalities.                          So, we will


15   simply take the municipal regulation of Toledo and the


16   municipal regulation of Columbus, and we'll put it all


17   together in one package.              It will say, State regulation of


18   safety, and -- and we'll preserve everything.                              Would that


19   be permissible under your reading of this Federal statute?


20               MR. CORDRAY:           Yes, it would, Your Honor.                      It


21   would.    If the State is doing the regulating or enacting


22   the law, under this statute, the way it reads and the --


23   the way it was designed, that would be permissible, even


24   if it's nonuniform.           If we wanted to make it uniform, we'd


25   have to go to the legislature and try to get that package


                                                 37

 2   transportation which also could do this through an


 3   administrative scheme. 


 4              QUESTION:         So, it's strictly a question of form


 5   that we're dealing with, that States, you can delegate to


 6   your cities, as you always have, just say, cities, what do


 7   you want and we'll give it to you by enacting a State law.


 8              MR. CORDRAY:           No.      It's not simply a matter of


 9   form because Congress made a judgment that if there were


10   50 different States imposing their own schemes, that would


11   be less impediments and -- and tangle of restrictions


12   impeding a free market than if 39,000 municipalities and


13   local governments around the country were free on their


14   own to do what they wished, and that that -- that was in


15   fact very much undercutting the desire to get to a free


16   market in transportation services. 


17              But I also want to go back to your comment and


18   your question earlier.            This statute does not itself


19   distinguish between economic regulation that's preempted


20   on the one hand and safety regulation that's not on the


21   other.   The phrasing of the statute is much broader.                             It


22   is related to price, route, and services of a motor


23   carrier of property.           That may not only be economic


24   regulation.    And so the notion that that's the divide and


25   we can simply remand, the lower court can sort it out, I


                                                38

 1   believe is not correct. 


 2              Now, as we've seen here, the fact that the --


 3   the statute is broad does not mean it's all encompassing. 


 4   I mean, I could see an argument that truck -- trucking


 5   companies no longer now have to pay corporate tax because


 6   that affects their price.              But that's a general provision. 


 7   As this Court has said in construing ERISA and needs to be


 8   imported here in the Dillingham case and the like, there


 9   has to be a connection with or reference to the specific


10   item at issue.      Here motor carriers of property.                              And


11   that's what we have with this licensing scheme here which


12   is directed specifically at tow trucks and will have a


13   very direct relation and -- and effect on their prices and


14   services. 


15              I also want to mention the problem of surplusage


16   because it's not been mentioned on the other side, and


17   it's very important here.              What possible reason would


18   Congress have had for including in the statute what


19   obviously is a key phrase?               It shows up seven times in the


20   course of the single statute.                   Political subdivision of a


21   State.   Why would that be included at all if the authority


22   of a State is to be read, as petitioners would have it, to


23   always include within it the authority of a political


24   subdivision.


25              QUESTION:         Their -- their answer is that -- that


                                                39

 1   when you speak of the regulatory authority of a State,


 2   that naturally connotes the authority to -- to delegate


 3   that to -- to municipalities.                  But when you speak of the


 4   authority of a State to enact or enforce a law, that --


 5   that much less naturally includes the authority of a


 6   municipality to enact or enforce a law so that -- and all


 7   of those other references are in connection with that


 8   phrase, to enact or enforce a law.                    Are they not?


 9             MR. CORDRAY:           Two reasons why that does not


10   work, Your Honor.       They agreed that the subsections of


11   (c)(2)(A) have to be read in parallel and the second one


12   with respect to size and weight and the like.                            It doesn't


13   say anything about regulatory authority.                        It just says


14   authority of a State. 


15             Second, in the preemption clause itself --


16             QUESTION:         Wait, wait.           I --I missed that. 


17             MR. CORDRAY:           Well, regulatory authority is the


18   phrase used in the first subclause --


19             QUESTION:         Right.


20             MR. CORDRAY:           -- of (c)(2)(A) related to safety.


21             QUESTION:         Yes. 


22             MR. CORDRAY:           But they're not talking about


23   authority to regulate.           They're just talking about


24   authority of a State with respect to the size and weight,


25   hazardous cargo, and then with respect to insurance.                             And


                                               40

 1   insurance is an excellent example I'll get to in a moment.


 2               But also in the preemption clause itself,


 3   (c)(1), it refers to the authority of a State to enact or


 4   enforce a law or regulation.                 That is regulatory


 5   authority, and it distinguishes it full stop from the


 6   authority of a political subdivision of a State to do the


 7   same thing.     What?       Enact or enforce a regulation.                         So,


 8   the regulatory authority is being discussed specifically


 9   in the preemption clause itself.


10               That's the fallacy of starting the analysis here


11   by jumping all the way to (c)(2)(A) and wrenching that


12   text out of context and divorcing it from the preemption


13   clause that it's meant to be a savings subordinate to. 


14   But the preemption clause itself --


15               QUESTION:         No, but (c)(1) uses may enact or


16   enforce just as -- as (c)(2)(C) does, whereas (c)(2)(A)


17   does not.     The to enact or enforce language applies in


18   every subsection except the one that we're arguing about.


19               MR. CORDRAY:           That's correct, which is a telling


20   point.   In every subsection, Congress went out of its way


21   to add political subdivision of a State.                          I've still not


22   heard a single sensible explanation for why they would


23   bother to do that. 


24               QUESTION:         Well, if -- but if you didn't add the


25   political subdivision in those States and if you had a


                                                 41

 1   home rule State, then a local government could -- would


 2   not be affected by it. 


 3                MR. CORDRAY:            No, not correct because their


 4   notion is that State includes delegating to its local


 5   government as a delegated power from the State.                                 They want


 6   to read the two as being encompassed within one another.


 7                QUESTION:          When you described the regulatory --


 8   regulatory authority in gross as you do in (2)(A), then it


 9   would apply to the authority to delegate.                             But when you're


10   talking about authority to enact or enforce, then you have


11   to identify the entities that do the enacting and the


12   enforcing.      It seems to me that's a perfectly logical


13   distinction. 


14                MR. CORDRAY:            Well, I don't believe it is, Your


15   Honor.   And again, there's nothing about regulatory


16   authority that is unique in this statute because (c)(2)(A)


17   does refer to regulatory authority with respect to safety,


18   but it doesn't refer to regulatory authority with


19   respect --


20                QUESTION:          Well, don't you agree that if you


21   didn't have all the other subdivisions in here, that would


22   be the normal reading of regulatory authority, which would


23   include the authority to delegate?


24                MR. CORDRAY:            I would agree that if (c)(2)(A)


25   alone were the statute --

 2              MR. CORDRAY:            -- that would be a sensible


 3   reading.   But if you -- that -- that's taking it out of a


 4   context where Congress specifically is dealing with a


 5   State and a political subdivision regularly in the statute


 6   and then in one instance a special kind --


 7              QUESTION:         Yes, but in one -- but in one


 8   provision, they say regulatory authority, which has a


 9   plain meaning that you'd be -- brings a result you


10   disagree with.      In the other they consistently use


11   authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact


12   or enforce. 


13              MR. CORDRAY:            But it doesn't --


14              QUESTION:         If you don't refer to political


15   subdivision, it just wouldn't include it. 


16              MR. CORDRAY:            It doesn't have a plain meaning. 


17   It doesn't really have any meaning because in the


18   preemption clause itself, they're referring to the


19   authority of a State to regulate, and they're separately


20   referring to the authority of --


21              QUESTION:         No.     It says a State or a political


22   subdivision may not enact or enforce.                       That's the language


23   of the preemption clause.


24              MR. CORDRAY:            Correct.        That's right.             Enact or


25   enforce what?     A regulation, which is the same thing as to


                                                43

 2             QUESTION:          (c)(2)(A) at the bottom of page A-2


 3   in the same sentence uses this shall not restrict the


 4   safety regulatory a State -- authority of a State with


 5   respect -- or the authority of a State.                        They don't use


 6   the adjective regulatory even in the second clause.


 7             MR. CORDRAY:            That was my point.                 I was trying


 8   to make it earlier.          I -- I didn't make it as clearly as


 9   you just did.     But that's exactly --


10             QUESTION:          Well, obviously, I -- I missed it, so


11   say it again. 


12             (Laughter.)

14   Trying to give some special meaning --


15             QUESTION:          Where?        What -- what section are you


16   talking about?


17             MR. CORDRAY:            We're talking about (c)(2)(A).


18             QUESTION:          At the bottom of page A-2. 


19             MR. CORDRAY:            This is a point I tried to make


20   earlier and I did not make it as clearly as the Chief


21   Justice just did. 


22             QUESTION:          I didn't get it. 


23             MR. CORDRAY:            But they're attempting to give


24   some special meaning to the phrase safety regulatory


25   authority, but by their own argument, that can't follow

 2   provisions the same way.               And the second subclause there

 4                QUESTION:         The authority of a State.


 5                MR. CORDRAY:           -- to the authority of a State,


 6   nothing about safety, nothing about regulatory, and has to


 7   be read in the same fashion. 


 8                I would also point out that the third subclause


 9   there, which relates to insurance requirements, they would


10   be saying that municipalities are free to impose their own


11   insurance requirements upon motor carriers of property. 


12   So, FedEx, UPS in different municipalities would have to


13   meet different insurance requirements.                          They'd have to do


14   different kinds of filings and have very different kinds


15   of --


16                QUESTION:         You're too fast for me.                    Where is the


17   insurance requirement? 


18                QUESTION:         At the very end of that provision.


19                MR. CORDRAY:           It's the third subclause in


20   (2)(A).


21                QUESTION:         (2)(A).


22                QUESTION:         Oh, in -- in (2)(A), okay.


23                MR. CORDRAY:           And that is completely at odds


24   with the statute because in 14504, which this Court is


25   going to take up in a case called Yellow Freight next

 1   term, it says specifically there -- Congress said even 50


 2   registrations by motor carriers of property in different


 3   States for insurance purposes is too many for our taste. 


 4   We think there should only be one, and they said the


 5   single State --


 6              QUESTION:         Well, what about the middle one? 


 7   What about the middle one?               It says, the authority of a


 8   State to impose highway limitations.


 9              MR. CORDRAY:           Yes.


10              QUESTION:         Now, I can't figure out, for the life


11   of me, how -- why Congress would have wanted to say the


12   State can impose limitations on the use of highways, but


13   the city cannot impose limitations on the use of streets.


14   But your reading would lead to that.


15              MR. CORDRAY:           That would be one respect, Your


16   Honor, in which either -- if it was a general traffic


17   regulation, then it would not be preempted at all.                                Or if


18   it were preempted, it would have to be done at the State


19   level and it could be done by the --


20              QUESTION:         I thought part of your argument was


21   also that streets are not highways, and I'm surprised you


22   didn't make that point when we were talking about the --


23   you know, no trucks on a school street or something like


24   that.   Isn't the term highways arguably different from --


25   from local residential neighborhood streets?

 1                MR. CORDRAY:           Arguably it could be, but I


 2   believe for purposes of title 49, it's a defined term to


 3   include streets.          But our point there was that it's


 4   perfectly sensible for Congress to say that the States


 5   shall deal with these issues, but not the municipality.


 6                QUESTION:         And you found not a word -- am I


 7   right?     There is not a word in the history of this --


 8   although there was some human being who wrote these words,


 9   there is not a word in any document, hearing, report,


10   debate that casts any light on this one way or the other.


11                MR. CORDRAY:           One way or the other.                   But again,


12   traffic regulations --


13                QUESTION:         Is that right?

 2                QUESTION:         I guess we'll have to use the


 3   statute. 


 4                (Laughter.) 


 5                QUESTION:         Mr. Cordray, is there -- is there an


 6   example -- any other example of a Federal statute -- I


 7   mean, it is unusual to say, States, you can no longer


 8   decide how your authority is going to be exercised.                                 An


 9   ordinary mode of a State exercising its authority is to


10   delegate it to localities.                 Apart from this statute, is


11   there any other Federal statute that says, State, you may


12   do it but you may not delegate it to a regional or local


13   or municipal unit?


14                MR. CORDRAY:           There are two responses to that


15   question.     The first is the example that was already given


16   which is when the Federal Government puts a grant to a


17   municipality full stop and doesn't allow the State to


18   control the use of that grant, that's an example like


19   this.


20                But the other point I would make is throughout


21   its history, Congress has --


22                QUESTION:         Well, that's a State -- that's --


23   that's --


24                MR. CORDRAY:           May I --


25                QUESTION:         -- Congress giving money to a

 1   municipality.    I asked an instance in which Congress says,


 2   State, you may do it but you, State, may not delegate.


 3             MR. CORDRAY:           I know of none, but this is a new


 4   departure for Congress.            They have always taken free


 5   markets and sought to regulate them.                     Here they're taking


 6   a market they had regulated and the States and localities


 7   had regulated and they're now trying to deregulate it.


 8   That's a new development and it calls for new measures. 


 9   And the measure here was to try to clear away all this


10   underbrush of -- of State and local restriction --


11             QUESTION:         Since it was -- since you say it's


12   singular and this is new, wouldn't you expect Congress to


13   make a clear statement that the State may not delegate


14   this authority because --


15             MR. CORDRAY:           Congress did make a clear


16   statement by including the term, political subdivision,


17   whenever it wanted political subdivisions to either have


18   authority or be restricted in that authority, and then


19   specifically speaking only to States here.                          There could


20   not be a clearer statement of that.                     Why else ever use the


21   term, political subdivision?               That is unexplained.


22             QUESTION:         And the State may not delegate this


23   authority to a political subdivision.                      Just as simple as


24   that, to negate what has been the assumption all along.


25             MR. CORDRAY:           They could have used the term


                                               49

 1   State everywhere alone and then said, State but not


 2   political subdivision, here.               Or they could this term,


 3   State and political subdivision, everywhere and omit the


 4   term, political subdivision, here.                    Those are the same


 5   meaning and they're the same purpose. 


 6             And again, canons of construction have been


 7   denigrated in this case, but they have to do with the


 8   natural and ordinary reading of statutes.                         The baseline


 9   that Congress uses to draft laws in some confidence that


10   the executive branch and the courts will interpret them as


11   Congress meant them, and that's exactly what's --


12             QUESTION:         The executive branch.                   Now, you -- I


13   know you have said, and I quite agree, that the Department


14   of Transportation has no supervisory authority, it has no


15   Chevron deference.        But doesn't it deserve some respect


16   from the courts simply because it has familiarity with the


17   area of motor carrier regulation that the courts don't? 


18             MR. CORDRAY:           That's a -- that's a statement I


19   couldn't disagree with more strongly.                      The Solicitor


20   General here has conceded they have no authority to


21   administer this statute.            The notion that you have a --


22             QUESTION:         They've not conceded the Department


23   of Transportation -- you -- deserves no respect. 


24             MR. CORDRAY:           The -- the notion that a


25   deregulatory statute that took governmental entities out

 2   umpiring by the Federal agency, in terms of the scope of


 3   preemption, which is an issue this Court has always said


 4   is for the courts to determine --


 5                QUESTION:         I didn't say umpiring.                   I said its


 6   views on the proper construction of this statute.                                   What


 7   weight, if any, should this Court give to the Department


 8   of Transportation's view, this is what the statute means? 


 9   Not as an umpire, not as a referee.


10                MR. CORDRAY:           Their construction is to leave


11   them as an umpire.           But I would say certainly not Chevron


12   deference.     At most some sort of Skidmore respect, but


13   that's only entitled where there's some sort of reason to


14   think that before they got to their litigation position


15   here, which has migrated in the course of this case -- it


16   started off as an argument about repeal by implication. 


17   It's now turned into argument about sort of reading


18   statutes together to import them into this statute -- is


19   entitled to really, I think, no respect here because it is


20   not persuasive.         They have not analyzed the statute in


21   detail --


22                QUESTION:         Well, if -- if you lose, you know --


23                MR. CORDRAY:           -- in any of their prior --

 2               (Laughter.) 


 3               MR. CORDRAY:           I wouldn't disagree with that,


 4   Your Honor.     But again --


 5               QUESTION:         Mr. Cordray, what -- what about the


 6   point made that if -- if you accept your interpretation,


 7   municipalities not only would not be able to enact


 8   regulations themselves, they would not be able to enforce


 9   regulations adopted by the -- by the State, which would be


10   a great inconvenience, that the only enforcement can be by


11   the State police and not by local -- local police.


12               MR. CORDRAY:           We agree, but that's not what this


13   preemption clause is about or any preemption clause is


14   ever about.     When they say enact or enforce here, they


15   don't use it in the terms of making law and executing the


16   law.    They use it in the -- in the sense of enacting new


17   law or applying -- or enforcing and applying preexisting


18   law.


19               And the point of this preemption clause is to


20   say that municipalities do not have the authority to act


21   in this realm by imposing their own public policies.                               It's


22   a matter of either new law or preexisting law.                               That's the


23   structure of many of these preemption statutes the Court


24   has dealt with.


25               QUESTION:         If we think this statute is -- that


                                                 52

 1   there are arguments either way for interpreting it,


 2   shouldn't we pay heed to the petitioners' point that it's


 3   a very serious matter for the Congress of the United


 4   States to tell States how they should govern themselves?


 5                MR. CORDRAY:           We think the language of the


 6   statute is clear here, Your Honor.                       They explicitly


 7   extinguished the power of the municipality --


 8                QUESTION:         Let's -- let's say we -- we disagree


 9   with that.     Is -- is that not -- let's say we find the


10   statute in -- in equipoise, or the arguments.                               Should we


11   not give force to the argument petitioner makes that the


12   States should be presumed to have the authority to


13   determine how best to govern themselves?


14                MR. CORDRAY:           No.      There's no substantive Tenth


15   Amendment issue here.             There's no commandeering of States


16   or local governments to enact some sort of program.                                 This


17   is the same as the Court in Wolens where they said this


18   statute must be read to say the State cannot legislate in


19   this area, but they can enforce contracts through their


20   courts.   There's no Tenth Amendment problem with that. 


21   That's Congress exercising its power under the Supremacy


22   Clause, anything in the laws or constitution of the States


23   notwithstanding.


24                And as the Solicitor General said in the brief


25   in the Mortier case, the notion that when Congress decided


                                                  53

                                        Alderson Reporting Company
                  1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   that there could be State regulation but they had to


 2   preempt local regulation, that they would somehow have to


 3   be forced to preempt State regulation as well, simply


 4   turns the Tenth Amendment on its head.                        So, we don't think


 5   that there's any -- any serious constitutional issue here.


 6              QUESTION:         It seems to me your argument boils


 7   down to the point that there are 10 provisions in the


 8   statute.   Nine of them are perfectly clear.                          The tenth


 9   says the same thing, but we're not going to read it the


10   way it seems to read because it's not as clear as the


11   other nine. 


12              MR. CORDRAY:           No, that's not what it boils down.


13              QUESTION:         That's about all it amounts to.


14              MR. CORDRAY:           It boils down to the fact that


15   Congress deliberately inserted a phrase here, political


16   subdivision of a State, so that it can preempt --


17              QUESTION:         In the -- in the nine, right.


18              MR. CORDRAY:           And -- and it --


19              QUESTION:         If you just read the one all by


20   itself, it's perfectly clear too. 


21              MR. CORDRAY:           Well, it's -- it is clear, I


22   believe, because it's clear because they said a State


23   cannot -- a political subdivision cannot --


24              QUESTION:         But the only reason --


25              MR. CORDRAY:           -- and they state the authority of


                                                54

 2                QUESTION:         The only support you have is they're


 3   not as detailed and specific in the one in question as


 4   they are in the other nine.


 5                MR. CORDRAY:           No.      I think it is equally


 6   detailed and specific.              And -- and there's no rationale


 7   for Congress legislating in this way or drafting this


 8   language or enacting it unless they intended to make a


 9   difference.      That's -- that's the whole purpose of


10   including that language. 


11                QUESTION:         Your support is the context of the


12   statute, which --


13                MR. CORDRAY:           No.      Text and context.                Text and


14   context.     That's correct. 


15                QUESTION:         Thank you, Mr. Cordray. 


16                Mr. Sutton, you have 4 minutes remaining.


17                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


18                       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


19                MR. SUTTON:          I'd like to respond to a few of the


20   points --


21                QUESTION:         Mr. Sutton, could you ask one --


22   answer one factual question for me?                        Your -- your             brother


23   made the argument that in -- in reading (c)(2)(A), he went


24   to the last clause and said on your theory every political


25   subdivision could enact its own financial responsibility


                                                  55

 1   and insurance laws and so on.


 2              MR. SUTTON:          Yes. 


 3              QUESTION:         And that would be a crazy scheme.                    My


 4   -- my question is, is there in fact any history of


 5   municipalities enacting these kinds of statutes so that


 6   it's something that might have been in Congress's mind?


 7              MR. SUTTON:          No, Your Honor, not in -- in the


 8   insurance area.       But there's a -- I think a better answer


 9   to that concern, and the better answer is, our point is


10   that (c)(2)(A) incorporates all of these preexisting


11   preemption provisions.            They are preemption provisions in


12   other parts of title 49, whether it's insurance, safety,


13   size and weight routing, or hazardous material routing.


14              So, the problem with Justice O'Connor's point of


15   practical consequences -- in reversing the Sixth Circuit,


16   there is no gap here.           Why?       Because for 60 years,


17   Congress and the Department of Transportation have been


18   regulating these very areas, both with respect to State


19   laws and city laws, to the extent they've been enacted. 


20   So, the multiplicity of insurance regulations is a false


21   concern.   I mean, the -- Congress has already indicated in


22   31138 and 39 what the rules are there.                        The Department of


23   Transportation has implemented regulations that do get


24   Chevron deference, and they lay out what the rules are.


25              QUESTION:         The same problem, you didn't, is --


                                                56

 1   to me anyway, is -- is (3)(A).                    Do you see what I'm


 2   thinking?    I mean, the same human being at the same time


 3   wrote the words in -- in (c)(2)(A) and he used the word


 4   State, and at precisely the same time, he wrote the second


 5   exception, which is (3)(A) --


 6               MR. SUTTON:          Right. 


 7               QUESTION:         -- and he put in political


 8   subdivision.      And what I cannot get over is I don't see


 9   how a single human being on the same day at the same time


10   could write two exceptions, use the word "State" in one


11   and use the word "political subdivision" in the other,


12   without meaning a difference. 


13               MR. SUTTON:          Right.          Your Honor, look -- compare


14   (3)(A) to (c)(1).         They follow the exact same enact or


15   enforce language.         (c)(2)(A) does not use the enact or


16   enforce language. 


17               QUESTION:         That's the answer. 


18               MR. SUTTON:          That's the answer, number one.


19               Number two, remember, (c)(3) is for the benefit


20   of motor carriers.          They want to make sure they could have


21   these rules, whether city or State, apply to them on a


22   city-by-city not State-by-State basis. 


23               Now, the -- the regulatory purpose, Your Honor


24   -- the landmark legislation in this area was the 1980 law


25   that deregulated interstate commerce.                        Everyone agrees


                                                 57

 1   that did not divest cities of authority. 


 2             The 1994 law at issue here was about intrastate


 3   commerce, primarily to put FedEx and UPS on a level


 4   playing field, and suddenly respondents are saying that


 5   deregulated -- regulatory purpose required the divestment


 6   of local authority? 


 7             QUESTION:             Well, what's -- what's Congress's


 8   authority to regulate intrastate commerce?


 9             MR. SUTTON:              It's at its outer edges, and that


10   to me is what is so odd about this particular


11   interpretation.          They're saying in the intrastate area,


12   you could divest States of their authority to delegate,


13   but they've not done it in the interstate area?                                 I mean,


14   how absurd is that?             It's -- it's got it exactly


15   backwards.


16             Now, the practical consequences -- I want to go


17   back to again -- of their interpretation.                             (c)(2)(A),


18   they've agreed, has to be construed the same way


19   throughout, and there are countless -- as we indicated in


20   our opening brief, every State in the country has


21   delegations to cities that have size and weight controls,


22   size and weight rules that would be eliminated by this


23   particular construction. 


24             Thank you. 


25             CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:                        Thank you, Mr. Sutton.
