 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We will hear

 5   Graham v. Florida.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN S. GOWDY

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. GOWDY:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Sentencing an adolescent to life without any

12   possibility of parole condemns him to die in prison and

13   rejects any hope that he will change for the better.

14   This sentence, like the death penalty, cruelly ignores

15   the inherent qualities of youth and the differences

16   between adolescents and adults.            At --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Are you urging that in

18   all cases, including homicide cases?                Or are you drawing

19   the line at homicide?

20               MR. GOWDY:      We are -- we are drawing the

21   line, Your Honor, at -- at non-homicide cases because we

22   recognize under the Eighth Amendment that we must look

23   at societal consensus, and society has said that murder

24   is different and has said that in the sentencing

25   practices, as demonstrated by the fact that outside of


                                      3

 1   Florida judges and juries have imposed this sentence on

 2   just 30 non-homicide offenders in just 6 States.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thirty-eight States

 4   allow this sentence, though, don't they?

 5                MR. GOWDY:     Thirty --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thirty-eight, 39.     I

 7   know you have a little dispute, but the vast majority of

 8   States allow the imposition of this sentence.

 9                MR. GOWDY:     The vast majority allow it and

10   they have for some time, and we believe that the fact

11   that it has been allowed for so long and imposed so

12   rarely, as the States themselves have admitted, is -- is

13   strong evidence of societal consensus.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:          You're making a --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I would have thought

16   that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the

17   gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances

18   of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely.

19                MR. GOWDY:     Your Honor, I would -- I would

20   disagree.   I would -- if -- if there's 30 -- 31 States

21   that have allowed it and have never imposed it, in -- in

22   our judgment, that -- that's evidence that it's very

23   unusual, and you couple that --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:          No sentence can be -- can

25   be imposed rarely?

 1                  MR. GOWDY:     No, Your Honor, it has to ­-

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         When a sentence is imposed

 3   rarely, it becomes unconstitutional?

 4                  MR. GOWDY:     No, Your Honor.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's not your position?

 6   What --

 7                  MR. GOWDY:     Our position is that you are

 8   looking at two things.        One, is it cruel?            It's cruel

 9   because life without parole is unique, is particularly

10   cruel to adolescents because it -- it gives up on the

11   adolescent and determines that he is forever unfit to

12   live in civil society.

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         It doesn't make it crueler

14   to him.     I don't see why it's any crueler to an

15   adolescent than it is to -- what -- where do you draw

16   the line?     At 21?

17                  MR. GOWDY:     We draw the line at 18, the same

18   line that the Court drew in Roper.                  And it's cruel

19   because of the inherent -- the inherent qualities of

20   youth.

21                  JUSTICE ALITO:          And you are making a per se

22   argument, no?     You can imagine someone who is a month

23   short of his 18th birthday, and you are saying that, no

24   matter what this person does, commits the most horrible

25   series of non-homicide offenses that you can imagine, a

 1   whole series of brutal rapes, assaults that render

 2   the -- the victim paraplegic but not dead, no matter

 3   what, the person is sentenced shows no remorse

 4   whatsoever, the worst case you can possibly imagine,

 5   cannot -- that person must at some point be made

 6   eligible for parole.      That's your argument?

 7                MR. GOWDY:    Your Honor, that's -- that's

 8   correct.   The life -- yes.         A life with parole sentence

 9   would be constitutional, and that may mean that person

10   you describe still spends his entire life in prison, but

11   life with parole gives some hope to the adolescent who

12   has an inherent capacity to change.              It gives him some

13   hope that later in time he may be released.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:         If we agree with you --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:         And so if it's --

16                JUSTICE ALITO:         If we agree with you, at

17   what point must the parole consideration be given?

18   There is a suggestion in your brief that maybe the

19   Colorado statute, which says that a person can get

20   parole consideration after 40 years, would be

21   constitutional.   Is that your position?

22                MR. GOWDY:    Your Honor, our position is that

23   it should be left up to the States to decide.              We think

24   that the -- the Colorado provision would probably be

25   constitutional.   We will have to see what different


                                     6

 1   States do.    I mean, but -- but, yes, even that long

 2   amount of time would give at least some hope to the

 3   adolescent offender.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What about -- what

 5   if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole

 6   system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of

 7   20 applicants?

 8                 MR. GOWDY:    I think all that would have to

 9   be required, Your Honor -- I think that would be

10   sufficient.   All that would have to be required is a

11   meaningful opportunity to the adolescent offender to

12   demonstrate that he has in fact changed, reformed, and

13   is now fit to live in society.           It -- that's all.

14   That's all we are asking for.

15                 We are not asking that it be automatic right

16   to get back out.    If Terrance Graham or Joe Sullivan --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It seems to me that

18   your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite

19   rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life

20   without parole.    But if you concede that it's all right

21   to have a sentence of 50 years and then a consideration

22   where 1 out of 20 people are granted parole, I think it

23   suggests that the line you would draw is -- is pretty

24   artificial -- or certainly suggests that the next case

25   we will get is somebody with life with parole after

 1   50 years.

 2               MR. GOWDY:     Your Honor, first, I'm -- I'm

 3   not conceding that with 50.         The question was asked

 4   about 40.   But I understand --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Are you saying there

 6   is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a

 7   distinction between 40 and 50 in that case?

 8               MR. GOWDY:     Your Honor, I'm saying that this

 9   sentence that we are here today before is unequivocally,

10   unmistakably a condemnation that you will never be

11   released from prison, and so this sentence clearly falls

12   on the line of being cruel because it tells an

13   adolescent, for an adolescent mistake, you can never

14   live in civil society.

15               There will be other sentences that people

16   will argue are the equivalent of this sentence, and --

17   and people may argue that with a 50-year sentence.               But

18   this sentence here is unequivocal, and there is no

19   question that it's cruel because of -- of the fact that

20   it rejects any hope that the adolescent can be changed.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is it a fact that --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm interested in -- in

23   two different things and you can address them during the

24   course of your argument.      One is the assumption of the

25   argument seems to be that there are in place parole --

 1   throughout all the States -- parole systems which are

 2   effective, which are operating, and that they have the

 3   capacity to make accurate judgments about

 4   rehabilitation.    What can I read -- what -- what studies

 5   do you have to -- that -- that comment on that?

 6               Secondly, unrelated, at some point I think

 7   you ought to talk about the procedural bar, which is

 8   something you go over very, very, very -- let's see --

 9   that's Sullivan.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's the other case.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Pardon me.   That's

12   Sullivan, yes.

13               MR. GOWDY:      With leave, I will let

14   Mr. Stevenson answer about the procedural bar.

15               But on the first question, Your Honor, I

16   would point you to the amicus brief filed by the various

17   correctional officers that talk about the types of

18   programs that can be done.           I think that that has -- is

19   very thorough and -- and would answer it far better than

20   I can in a couple minutes up here.

21               But, yes, to answer short, we -- we believe

22   that -- that the parole systems in place can be

23   effective to do this, and in all seven States where

24   there are currently non-homicide juvenile offenders,

25   they all have functioning parole systems.

 1               Even Florida has it.           Even though it -- it

 2   abolished parole in 1983, Florida still has 6,000

 3   parole-eligible inmates and last year they heard over --

 4   they made over 1,700 parole determinations.            So the --

 5   the administrative burden to the State of adding these

 6   ­-

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:        But Florida has abolished

 8   parole, has it not, going forward?

 9               MR. GOWDY:     Going forward, it has abolished

10   parole --

11               JUSTICE ALITO:        So eventually, if things are

12   allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board

13   will go out of business.

14               MR. GOWDY:     And Florida could choose to make

15   that sentence and instead impose a sentence, as its

16   prosecutor recommended here, a 30-year determinant

17   sentence, if Florida doesn't want to reinstitute parole.

18   We are not saying it has to do parole.            That's just one

19   of several constitutional options.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What -- what would you do

21   if there were a crime spree and there were different

22   jurisdictions?   One jurisdiction imposes for 35 years,

23   the next jurisdiction for another 35 years, to be served

24   consecutively.

25               MR. GOWDY:     Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I

 1   think that the -- that you would get into the question

 2   about whether that sentence is the equivalent of life

 3   without parole, and there could be an argument made that

 4   if you -- obviously, if you sentence someone to 150,

 5   200 years, there's no conceivable hope of ever release,

 6   150 years without parole.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So the second jurisdiction

 8   has the obligation, but not the first?            Is that the way

 9   it works?

10                MR. GOWDY:     I would think that the -- if you

11   had that -- I would think that the -- that the judge

12   making that sentence would have to take that into

13   consideration, that this sentence is going to -- based

14   on all adolescent conduct -- it has to be all adolescent

15   conduct, not if some of the conduct is post-juvenile.

16   But, yes, I would think that the -- that the second

17   sentencing judge would need to take that into

18   consideration.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:        So he -- he could sentence

20   up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of

21   the person in prison?      That -- that would be okay?

22                MR. GOWDY:     I -- I wouldn't say that would

23   be okay, Your Honor.      I think that --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, what's he supposed to

25   do?   How many years can he give --

 1                MR. GOWDY:    I think --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- consecutive?

 3                MR. GOWDY:    I think there has to be some --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:        There obviously does.        What

 5   do you propose?   I propose, you know, 1 year before

 6   his life expectancy.

 7                MR. GOWDY:    Your -- Your Honor, I think that

 8   would be coming so close to the -- the constitutional

 9   line, it would be -- it would be difficult to see that

10   as constitutional, but -- but --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Oh, 1 year before life is

12   also unconstitutional?

13                MR. GOWDY:    Your Honor, I'm --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Two years before life?

15                MR. GOWDY:    Your -- Your Honor, there would

16   definitely be a -- a difficult line to draw at that

17   case.   Life without parole, though, is unequivocal.              And

18   even that sentence that you are describing, there is

19   some difference between it and life without parole,

20   because only life without parole makes the unequivocal

21   assessment that the adolescent cannot be returned to

22   civil society.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We have -- you are

24   arguing for a categorical rule.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Your friend on the

 2   other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always

 3   permissible.     But we have a precedent that suggests in

 4   -- in an individual case, you assess the proportionality

 5   of the sentence to the crime.

 6                  Now, we know from Roper that death is

 7   different, and we know from Roper that juveniles are

 8   different.     Wouldn't it make sense to incorporate the

 9   consideration of the juvenile status into the

10   proportionality review?        So that if you do have a case

11   where it's the 17-year-old who is 1 week shy of his

12   18th birthday and it is the most grievous crime

13   spree you can imagine, you can determine that in that

14   case life without parole may not be disproportionate.

15                  But if it's -- and I know you would argue

16   that these are the facts here -- if it's a less grievous

17   crime and there is, for example, a younger defendant

18   involved, then in that case maybe it is

19   disproportionate.

20                  Why -- why doesn't that seem more sensitive?

21   And it avoids all of the line-drawing problems we have

22   been discussing.

23                  MR. GOWDY:    Well, two things:            First, Your

24   Honor, Roper states, and the science -- states it based

25   on the science, that at that age we cannot make a


                                      13

 1   determination about whether or not the adolescent will

 2   or will not reform.     Even an expert psychologist,

 3   psychiatrist cannot do it.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, I understand.

 5   But I don't think they'll say that we can't make that

 6   determination at 17 years 51 months, but we can make

 7   that determination at 18 years 1 month.

 8                MR. GOWDY:      Well, anywhere you draw the

 9   line, Your Honor, you're going to come up with an

10   example where you are 1 day before or 1 day after, and

11   the Court in Roper struggled with where to draw the line

12   between maturity and immaturity, and it concluded,

13   rightly so, to draw the line at 18 based on both the

14   science and the legislative determinations.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But that is because,

16   as they told us, death is different.                 And you do -- once

17   you decide that, you do have to draw a line somewhere.

18   I'm just wondering why we have to go all the way in with

19   you or all the way with your opponent when our precedent

20   allows us to consider an issue of this sort on a case

21   by-case basis.

22                MR. GOWDY:      I think it's because adolescents

23   are different.   Adolescents are different in that we

24   can't tell at this age whether they are going to reform

25   or not.   And all we are proposing is that an adolescent


                                      14

 1   not necessarily be released, but that he be given a

 2   later opportunity.    And it boils -- it just comes down

 3   to adolescents are different, Your Honor, and the

 4   determination can't be made at age 17 even for the most

 5   heinous crimes that are committed.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Is there any difference

 7   in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than

 8   otherwise?   I think you suggested in -- in your brief

 9   that educational and vocational training is not given to

10   people who are in for life without parole because they

11   will never be out on the street so they don't need to be

12   transitioned back.

13                MR. GOWDY:     If I understand your question,

14   would it be different if those type of programs are made

15   available to life-without- --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           My question is, first,

17   you say that they are not available.

18                MR. GOWDY:     Yes.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Is that -- that's so?

20                MR. GOWDY:     Yes, that is generally true.

21   And the -- and the very website that the State of

22   Florida cites makes a point of saying that the programs

23   are for the purpose of reentry into society, and so

24   those are obviously the opposite of what life

25   without parole is.    You are never going to reenter

 1   society.     And it's generally true that those programs

 2   are not available to offenders who get life without

 3   parole, and that's what makes the sentence so

 4   particularly cruel, to give up on a kid at that point in

 5   his life.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So what are the terms of

 7   incarceration?     They just stay in their cells and ­-

 8                 MR. GOWDY:     Well, Your Honor, I think it

 9   varies obviously by facility by facility.             But the

10   sentence means you are going to stay in your cell and

11   die there.    You are going to stay in your cell for 60 or

12   70 years, whenever you reach your natural death, and die

13   there.

14                 You know, they -- they do have some limited

15   freedoms, as the State of Florida has pointed out, the

16   same types of freedoms that people on death row have.

17   But ultimately both sentences mean that you are going to

18   die in a State-controlled institution.             And they are

19   very hopeless --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't think -- the same

21   kind of freedom that people on death row have?             I --

23   in their brief, Your Honor, that you have the right to

24   exercise your religion, you have the -- you have the

 3   don't think death row inmates are.

 5   everything varies facility by facility, but it's --

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, I doubt whether this

 7   varies.   I -- I don't know of any principle where if you

 8   are in for life, you are in solitary.

 9                  MR. GOWDY:    Well, I'm not -- I'm not -- you

10   are correct.     I'm not suggesting they are in solitary

11   confinement.     But they are locked up for the rest of

12   their life, and they're not allowed to rejoin civil

13   society even if, as some of the former juvenile

14   offenders who filed a brief in this case, can

15   demonstrate that they have become model citizens.

19   permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take

20   into account the particular circumstances of the

22   you are advocating, which would deprive the State of

25   short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve

 2                Some of the actual cases that -- in which

 3   this sentence has been imposed in Florida involve

 4   factual situations that are so horrible that I couldn't

 5   have imagined them if I hadn't actually seen them.

 6   Raping an 8-year-old girl and burying her alive.                 Are

 7   you familiar with that case?

 8                MR. GOWDY:      I am not familiar with that

 9   particular case.     No.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:         Raping a woman in front of

11   her 12-year-old son and then forcing the son to engage

12   in sexual conduct with the mother.                 Are you familiar

13   with that case?

14                MR. GOWDY:      Yes, Your Honor, I am familiar

15   with that case.

16                Your Honor, the reason, first of all, the

17   Court has said and said so clearly in Kennedy that

18   murder is different.       In the Kennedy decision, you also

19   said:   Horrible facts, someone who raped their

20   stepdaughter.     But yet this Court drew a line and

21   exempted from capital punishment adult defendants who

22   commit horrible crimes.

23                But to get to the core of your question as

24   to why not do it on a case-by-case basis, because you

25   can only make the determination about the adolescent

 1   later in life.    And I -- we would agree that there

 2   should be a case-by-case determination as to -- as to

 3   whether or not that offender should spend his whole life

 4   in prison, but we say it needs to happen later, once he

 5   has matured, once he's reached past adulthood, because

 6   when you're --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:          You assume -- doesn't your

 8   argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is

 9   deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this

10   person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no

11   longer a problem, we should let this person out.          But

12   that isn't the only purpose of punishment that we've

13   acknowledged.    One of the purposes is retribution,

14   punishment for just perfectly horrible actions.          And I

15   don't know why that value of retribution diminishes to

16   the point of zero when it's a person who's, you know,

17   17 years 9 months old.

18               MR. GOWDY:      We are not suggesting that it

19   goes to the point of zero.         We're not -- and we concede

20   the State has a right to -- to exact retribution from

21   the juvenile offender.      And in this case, 30 years would

22   have been a lot of retribution for Terrance Graham, both

23   --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Most States didn't -- don't

 1               MR. GOWDY:    Well, Your Honor, we -- but a

 2   Juvenile is -- not only does he have an inherent

 3   capacity to grow; he is less culpable.           And so to exact

 4   the most -- for a non-homicide crime whether you are

 5   adult or juvenile, this is the most severe punishment

 6   you can receive, and to exact that most severe

 7   punishment for a less culpable offender that the Court

 8   has recognized is a less culpable offender doesn't -- is

 9   too much retribution.    We are not saying the State can't

10   exercise retribution, but that life without parole is --

11   is too much for those types of crimes.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Gowdy, can I ask this

13   question?

14               MR. GOWDY:    Yes, Justice.

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:           If your client in this

16   case had been processed in the juvenile system instead

17   of the adult system, what would the maximum penalty he

18   could have received been?

19               MR. GOWDY:    He would have had to have been

20   released when he was 22 years.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:           So the choice is between

22   that short a term and an indefinite term?

23               MR. GOWDY:    No, no, Your Honor.         We -- we

24   concede that the State of Florida may continue to

25   prosecute juveniles in adult court and that makes sense

 1   in order to get a term of years that is longer than you

 2   can get in juvenile court.        And in this case, if the

 3   judge had gone along with the prosecutor's

 4   recommendation, it would have meant a 30-year sentence

 5   for my client, which would have been far longer than he

 6   could have gotten in the juvenile court.               Worse --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The logic in Roper

 8   was very straightforward.       It says, "Death is reserved

 9   for the worst of the worst."            I think that was the

10     quote.   We know that juveniles are not the worst of

11   the worst, for the reasons you have articulated, that

12   they are not fully developed, don't have moral sense to

13   the same extent as an adult.            But life without parole is

14   not reserved for the worst of the worst, and so it seems

15   to me that the logic of our precedent suggests that you

16   can't necessarily rely on the juvenile status to exempt

17   them from a penalty that is not reserved for the worst

18   of the worst, but perhaps it makes sense to consider in

19   a particular instance whether the penalty is

20   disproportionate, given the juvenile's characteristics

21   that you suggest.

22               MR. GOWDY:     Well, I guess we will come back

23   to the point that I think life with parole would be a

24   long sentence, and I don't -- I don't see how you can do

25   it on a case-by-case basis at age 17.              You can certainly

 3   disproportionality review generally in Florida and

 4   particularly for juvenile offenders?

 5                  MR. GOWDY:    There is no -- no.             Under

 6   Florida law, there is no basis to challenge a sentence

 7   as being excessive or disproportionate as long as it's

 8   at the statutory maximum.

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, there wasn't

10   prior to our death penalty jurisprudence, either.                   And I

11   thought we reviewed proportionality as a matter of

 4   that in Florida.

 6   whether you'd have to create a -- a procedure that does

 7   not exist in Florida for proportionality review.

 8                MR. GOWDY:    Well, there would -- it would

 9   have to be strictly Federal law.            It would have to be a

10   procedure on a -- if you do this case-by-case

11   suggestion, it would -- it would have to be strictly

12   based on Federal constitutional law, because --

 1   Graham have gotten this sentence and that the only State

 2   that has actually imposed it for a first-time armed

 3   burglary is Florida.      And it --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But there is a problem

 5   with that argument in this case, because the sentencing

 6   judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as

 7   a recidivist, not as a first-time offender.           He said --

 8   Graham got a very light sentence, just 12 months in

 9   detention and then 3 years' probation, and the judge

10   said:   Now, you better toe the line or else you could be

11   put away for a long time.

12                And then he committed -- it really was ­-

13   the sentence was for the later activities, even though

14   they weren't proved beyond a reasonable doubt.           I think

15   that Graham admitted to a couple of -- to more armed

16   robberies.   Isn't that so?

17                MR. GOWDY:    He -- he admitted to the police,

18   and I don't want to get too much into the facts, but

19   that -- but even if Your Honor concedes that he was

20   convicted of all those crimes, which he was not

21   convicted of, but the judge, as you say, correctly

22   relied upon for this sentence, then we only have two

23   States that we know of that have imposed life without

24   parole for a recidivist robbery or burglary crime, and

25   that's California and Florida.

 1               And we -- we've set forth that argument to

 2   give the Court that option, but we believe our primary

 3   argument, the categorical rule, is more logical because

 4   of the fact that you can't do a case-by-case

 5   determination of an adolescent at the time -- based on

 6   his juvenile offense.    And maybe, in these horrible

 7   crimes --

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But you haven't answered

 9   Justice Alito's point, which is:          What's the difference

10   a month before he's 18 and a month after?          What

11   makes us more capable at the 18th birthday to --

12               MR. GOWDY:    Well, you --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- to affirm a judgment

14   that someone can't be -- can't be -- can't be

15   rehabilitated?

16               MR. GOWDY:    There is not much difference,

17   Your Honor, but the line has to be drawn somewhere.          And

18   society, as this Court recognized in Roper, has

19   generally drawn that line at 18 --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well --

21               MR. GOWDY: -- as between the --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:        A line has to be drawn

23   somewhere only if we accept your approach that there has

24   to be a categorical exemption.         A line does not have to

25   be drawn somewhere if you adopt the approach of, case by

 1   case, decide whether this is proportional, given how old

 2   the individual was, given the nature of the crimes, and

 3   all of the other factors.        You don't have to draw a line

 4   then, and that's the attraction of that approach.

 5               MR. GOWDY:      You -- I -- I think that the --

 6   -- based on -- I would just ask to conclude and then I

 7   will sit down.

 8               Based on the -- on what scientists have told

 9   us, the categorical approach is the most logical

10   approach because we can't tell which adolescents are

15               ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR

16                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17               MR. MAKAR:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19               The categorical rule that Petitioner seeks

20   here would undermine what Florida and other States have

21   adopted in terms of juvenile justice.               And in

22   particular, it would go against three major trends, that

23   being strong punishment for serious violent crimes by

24   juveniles; second trend, transfer laws allowing

25   juveniles to be treated as adults; those laws have been

 1   enacted in the last 15 years --

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Did that --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I didn't -- I didn't hear

 4   the second.

 5                  MR. GOWDY:    I'm sorry.

 6                  The three trends are:           The strong punishment

 7   for juveniles that States have enacted over the last 15-

 8   20 years; the various transfer and waiver laws that

 9   States have enacted over the last 10, 15, 20 years

10   allowing juveniles to be transferred into adult court;

11   and then finally, what is really at issue is parole.

12   Parole has been eliminated in many States.               Fifteen

13   States have totally eliminated it in the last 10, 15

14   years.     So what they are seeking is a categorical rule

15   that goes against the national consensus and the

16   national trend.

17                  The concession here was that Graham's

18   sentence could be even up to life as long as there is

19   the possibility of parole.          We believe that's very

20   telling.     In their brief, they point out that Graham

21   could have been sentenced to something just short of his

22   actuarial life.     His actuarial life is around 64 years

23   old, which means just about a 46-year sentence.

24                  And the standard that we suggest here is

25   that there cannot be any categorical rule, for the

 1   reasons Justice Alito pointed out.                We have --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but you are

 3   arguing for a categorical rule of your own.                You are

 4   saying that under a -- under -- juveniles under the age

 5   of 18, what, it's never -- it can be never determinative

 6   that they are juvenile in setting the sentence as a

 7   matter of Federal law?

 8                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we do

 9   agree in Florida and other States as well that age does

10   matter, and we ask that there be three things that the

11   Court look at.

12                 First, look at the legislative structure.

13   Florida structure doesn't -- Florida structure is a very

14   balanced, thoughtful approach, in waiving children into

15   the adult court only when it's a violent crime and only

16   under certain -- when certain ages are in play.                 Look at

17   the age.    It does play a role.           The judicial discretion

18   plays a role.    The trial judge --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this:       Is there

20   a minimum age when a juvenile can be transferred to --

21   to adult procedures?

22                 MR. MAKAR:    It's a three-tiered system,

23   Justice Stevens.    And let me --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, I'm just interested

25   in one.    Is there a minimum?


                                     28

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1                MR. MAKAR:    Yes.         The way in which --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is that an arbitrary line,

 3   or how do you -- how do we know it shouldn't be higher

 4   or lower than the line?

 5                MR. MAKAR:    Well, the legislature has set

 6   the line at 14-15 for certain crimes and 16-17 for

 7   others.   And then for indictment, where it goes to a

 8   grand jury, there is no age limitation.               That has been

 9   on our books for the better part of 50, 60 years,

10   allowing indictment -- allowing the grand jury to make a

11   decision about whether the particular juvenile shall be

12   brought into the adult court.            So --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But then the -- what

14   is your objection to an approach that when you are

15   dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that

16   your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of

17   Federal law consider the juvenile status of the

18   defendant before that sentence is imposed?

19                MR. MAKAR:    Well --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              In other words, not

21   a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes

22   a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can

23   never make a difference?

24                MR. MAKAR:    Well, sure.           And as I say,

25   there's the three factors I would ask the Court to look

 1   at.

 2                First, the structure that we have here in

 3   Florida, which many States have, that deal with the age.

 4   Age does matter.     Ninety-nine out of 100 juvenile

 5   offenders in our system do not go into adult court, and

 6   an even smaller percentage of that ultimately get into

 7   the adult sanctions.

 8                The trial judges in Florida, unless --

 9   unless it's a very violent crime, have some discretion

10   to sentence as to age.       If you look at the transcript

11   here in the joint appendix, the trial judge here

12   struggled with this, struggled with age, and said:

13   Juvenile sanctions are inappropriate; youthful offenders

14   -- youthful offender sanctions are inappropriate; I'm

15   going to sentence you to -- to adult.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Yes, but could I interrupt

17   with one question?     Isn't it correct that the age is

18   relevant on whether or not to transfer the person to the

19   adult system, but once he's in the adult system, age is

20   entirely immaterial?

21                MR. MAKAR:      That's not accurate, Justice

22   Stevens.   Under the statute 985.226, 227, and 225, we

23   have a system in which the grounds are set for when

24   juveniles can be either mandatorily or discretionarily

25   brought into the adult system.


                                      30

                                    Official


 1                  And then under the statute 985, the

 2   punishment is graduated.        In other words, for the lower

 3   offenses, the juvenile sanctions must be considered and

 4   the youthful offender sanctions must be considered.

 5   It's only in certain limited instances, like indictment,

 6   where it's a life offense, where the juvenile has been

 7   indicted for life, that the trial judge is forced to do

 8   adult sanctions.

 9                  In this case, Graham was under the

10   discretionary direct -- direct file, meaning that the

11   prosecutor had discretion whether to bring the case or

12   not.   He brought it into the adult system.             Graham

13   accepted being processed as an adult.              He was put on

14   probation, and then --

15                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           I still don't understand.

16   Just to make sure I get the point correct:              After the

17   decision has been made to have them prosecuted in the

18   adult system, at that -- after that decision has been

19   made, is the age of the defendant a relevant factor in

20   sentencing?

21                  MR. MAKAR:    The age -- they get a

22   presentence report.     The age is woven in --

23                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           I understand, but

24   statutorily?     As a matter --

25                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, the statute doesn't

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   specifically say the trial judge --

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           The answer is no.     It's --

 3   under the statutes, it's totally irrelevant after he has

 4   been transferred to the adult stage.                Is that correct?

 5                 MR. MAKAR:    Not exactly, because the range

 6   of remedies the trial judge can impose is based upon

 7   what method by which the juvenile was transferred or

 8   waived into the adult court.             In Graham's case, he was

 9   allowed to have juvenile and youthful offender sanctions

10   considered because of his age.             I mean, that's the way

11   --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        You mean the trial judge

13   under Florida law does not have discretion to choose a

14   lower sentence because of the -- of tender years of the

15   defendant?

16                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, absolutely, the trial

17   judge does.   And you can see the trial judge here

18   grappling with that.

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But the statute doesn't

20   draw any distinctions once he is in -- in the adult --

21                 MR. MAKAR:    I guess the answer to your

22   question is there is no specific statute that says the

23   trial judge shall consider age specifically.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And -- and

25   there's -- well, I guess that answers my question.                He

 1   is not required to as a matter of Federal law.                He can

 2   say:   I am not considering the fact that this is a

 3   juvenile because I think his crime should be treated as

 4   an adult crime.

 5                MR. MAKAR:     No -- I mean, certainly not

 6   under any Federal constitutional principle I am aware

 7   of.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, that's what we

 9   are arguing about.

10                MR. MAKAR:     Right, right.           Well, certainly

11   here, I mean, what we would say, assuming there is no

12   categorical rule and the Court decides to go into the

13   proportionality balance here, we think that certainly

14   Graham's offense certainly is off the scales and would

15   be grossly -- probably be -- it would be --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That's -- that's one of

17   the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might

18   think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the

19   prosecutor had a different judgment of it.               And Florida

20   doesn't have any kind of proportionality review, doesn't

21   have any review -- appellate review of the sentences.

22                MR. MAKAR:     Well --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           This judge, I think,

24   surprised everyone in the courtroom with the -- with the

25   sentence.   Certainly it was far beyond what the


                                     33

 1   prosecutor recommended.

 2                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, the prosecutor recommended

 3   30 years, that's correct, and the judge here entered

 4   life.     As I say, that translates into -- essentially a

 5   46-year actuarial life sentence.             That was within the

 6   trial judge's discretion, and particularly given the

 7   seriousness of the offenses that Graham committed.                We

 8   are talking about violence.

 9                  And violence does matter.           This Court has

10   said -- and certainly in oral argument in Solem and

11   others, the -- violence versus non-violent acts plays a

12   major role in sentencing, and it should play a major

13   role as well when it comes to juveniles.

14                  I don't read Roper to say that it takes off

15   the table lengthy sentences for violent crimes by

16   juveniles.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel --

18                  MR. MAKAR:    Yes.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Do you think

20   that it categorically violates the Eighth Amendment for

21   a 10-year-old to be sentenced to life without parole?

22                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, the answer to that is it

23   certainly raises a concern about the age.              Age does

24   matter.     And as the age goes down, it does.

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So once it matters, the

 1   question for me is -- help me draw the line -- if 10 is

 2   in my judgment too early, why isn't 14, 16, or 18?

 3   Meaning why should a -- someone below the age of 14 be

 4   sentenced to life without parole?             That's the -- that's

 5   the Sullivan case --

 6                  MR. MAKAR:    Right.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- but it begs the

 8   question, which is age is -- matters a lot.             And so,

 9   take on your adversary's argument that it matters a lot

10   because this is a less culpable person.

11                  MR. MAKAR:    Sure.        It matters -- I think it

12   does matter and it certainly matters from a legislative

13   perspective, from a judicial perspective, and from an

14   Eighth Amendment perspective.

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        What about historical

16   perspective?     I mean, you might appeal to the fact that

17   at common law, which was in effect when the Cruel and

18   Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted, 12 years was --

19   was viewed as the year when a -- when a person reaches

20   the age of reason.     And -- and the death penalty could

21   not be inflicted on anyone --

22                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, certainly that historical

23   perspective has --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- and all felonies were

25   the death penalty.

 1                MR. MAKAR:     Sure.        And it has importance.

 2   To some extent, the States have displaced the common law

 3   with their juvenile justice systems.               And we -- as I

 4   say, I believe Florida's is -- is very balanced.

 5                Going back to your question, Justice

 6   Sotomayor, I think that the way age plays a role is that

 7   we -- in our system in Florida, we have no one under the

 8   age of 13.   And that's sort of provides us --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You have no one?      What

11                MR. MAKAR:     I'm sorry.            No -- no one in our

12   system is under the age of 13 with life without parole.

13   You know, there are very --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Is that because judges

15   haven't chosen to impose it or because your legal system

16   doesn't permit it?

17                MR. MAKAR:     No, the legal system permits it.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          How young could the

20   youngest person in Florida be to be prosecuted as an

21   adult and be eligible for life --

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So a 5-year-old could be

 2   put away for life?

 3                  MR. MAKAR:    That is theoretically.            We would

 4   hope that the system would not allow that to occur.                     And

 5   that that would be certainly violative of the --

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              In -- in your

 7   earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's question, you

 8   said age certainly matters.           As -- as a -- as a matter

 9   of what law?

10                  In other words, I understood your submission

11   to be that there was nothing in Federal law that

12   requires different consideration of age.                 So when you

13   say age matters, why?

14                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, we suggest that it may

15   matter in a particular case, and when you get to the

16   gross disproportionality --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Under the authority

18   of what law?     Age matters in a particular case because

19   of --

20                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, I -- I -- I think our --

21   country's traditions recognize it --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Because of the

23   Eighth Amendment?

24                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, I believe it could be

25   certainly a part of the Eighth Amendment analysis.                  I

 1   think just -- certainly age matters in the legislative

 2   branch, judicial branch, executive branch.               It matters

 3   that we look at the age and make considerations about it

 4   when Florida has made those considered judgments.

 5                What we are saying is that if the Court

 6   decides to go down the path that's perhaps fraught with

 7   more line-drawing than one can imagine and decides that

 8   age will be a part of the proportionality, it creates

 9   serious problems.   But here --

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm sorry.   Why is

11   that?   If you go down on a case-by-case basis, there are

12   no line-drawing problems.       You just simply say age has

13   to be considered as a matter of the Eighth Amendment.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:        And then we apply a

15   totality of the circumstances test --

16                MR. MAKAR:    Well -- well --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- which means whatever

18   seems -- seems like a good idea.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, we apply the

20   proportionality review that we articulated in Harmelin,

21   and Solem and Ewing.

22                MR. MAKAR:    Well, of course --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It's already there.

 2   They are out in the tail of the distribution in terms of

 3   seriousness of the offense.         So it would be the same

 4   result in either case.     I think perhaps --

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You are not seriously

 6   suggesting that the crimes at issue here are comparable

 7   to a rape or a permanent infliction of serious

 8   disability or any of those other very violent crimes

 9   that are close to homicide that Justice Alito spoke

10   about?   There is a quantitative and qualitative

11   difference between those, isn't there?

12                MR. MAKAR:    There is, but the legislatures

13   make the judgment about how they are going to punish

14   those.   And in Florida, we have --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, if we -- if we

16   have already said that you can't impose death on an

17   adult who hasn't committed a homicide, an intentional

18   death, and so for an adult the most serious sentence

19   that we can give them is life without parole, why should

20   that same sentence be given to a juvenile who we have

21   recognized as being less capable than an adult?          And why

22   should we permit it for a crime that's not comparable to

23   a homicide and/or something akin in seriousness to that?

24                MR. MAKAR:    Because it is still a very

25   serious, violent crime.      We are talking about weapons

 1   and guns and people's lives at risk.               And the

 2   legislature has made the judgment in Florida and other

 3   States to say that that type of crime --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But isn't it true -- and

 5   I think one of my colleagues already questioned you --

 6   that the prosecutor didn't think that this merited life

 7   without parole.     Didn't the parole supervisor say that

 8   this young man, Mr. Graham, was compliant with other

 9   conditions of his probation?              He went to school.    He did

10   other things.     It does suggest some hope for him.

11               MR. MAKAR:       Well, I think the prosecutor

12   certainly offered up to 30 years.              And the trial judge

13   who, as you can tell from the transcript, was familiar

14   that there were these home invasions going on around our

15   county, that there had been a task force established,

16   and so forth, the -- the trial judge was aware of that

17   and the seriousness of it.          In one instance, one of

18   Graham's codefendants actually killed someone as a part

19   of a home invasion.     These were serious problems

20   afflicting our community in Jacksonville.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do we know why the

22   co-perpetrators got so -- their sentences were

23   dramatically lower.     Do we know why that was so?

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes.

 2                 MR. MAKAR:    The home invasion -- there was

 3   an 11-year sentence for the codefendant.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes.

 5                 MR. MAKAR:    He helped -- helped and

 6   testified and basically assisted the prosecution, so I

 7   believe he got a lower sentence.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Because he assisted the

 9   prosecutor.

10                 MR. MAKAR:    Right.       The third one is in

11   jail, life without parole on a murder charge, life

12   without parole on the same charge Graham has for another

13   home invasion, and then has the other serious sentences.

14   So he -- for his home invasions, he is -- he is life

15   without prison --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I didn't think he --

17                 MR. MAKAR:    I mean, life without parole.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          For this very offense,

19   this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other

20   than Graham had gotten life without parole.

21                 MR. MAKAR:    Well -- well, Graham got life

22   without parole, and it relates back to his armed

23   burglary with assault and battery.                He got the life

24   sentence under that charge, which is then all part and

25   parcel of the violation-of-probation hearing.                There

 1   were these secondary -- these second incidences of home

 2   invasions where Meigo Bailey was the codefendant who got

 3   life for murder and also for armed burglary as a part of

 4   one of the home invasions.          So they -- you know, they

 5   got serious punishment.        This is a serious punishment

 6   that was meted out to them.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Did he -- how do you

 8   answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the

 9   immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a

10   teenager at the point of sentencing?               That it's only

11   after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has

12   this person overcome those youthful disabilities?

13   That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't

14   accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the --

15   your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make

16   a judgment until years later to see how that person has

17   -- has done.

18                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, Justice Ginsburg, we

19   respect that, and certainly in Roper that was the

20   linchpin to the decision.         Here we are in a different

21   context that deals with these -- these terms of years,

22   and there -- there's no constitutional right to parole.

23   And certainly that is a purely legislative decision to

24   be made, and States have said we are not going to have

25   parole.

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        I suppose you could say the

 2   same thing of -- of adults, of somebody over 18.             You

 3   really can't tell how redeemable this individual is

 4   until he is in prison for some time; and, therefore, you

 5   should not give anybody life without parole.             They --

 6   they may all be savable.        So we should defer -- defer.

 7   We shouldn't have any non-parole sentences.             Everybody

 8   should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that

 9   -- that many jurisdictions used to take.             Wasn't that so

10   --

11                  MR. MAKAR:    True.

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- when there was parole

13   for everybody?

14                  MR. MAKAR:    And it --- and it goes to the

15   core of the State's sovereignty to decide what laws to

16   enact.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But Florida does -- and

18   every State -- recognize the difference between an adult

19   and a minor.     And you have to make the line.          We have it

20   at 18.   But think of the teenager can't drink, can't

21   drive, can't marry.     There are so many limitations on

22   children just because they are children.

23                  MR. MAKAR:    And, Justice Ginsburg, we ask

24   that the same respect for our juvenile justice system be

25   given to those laws enacted in Florida that protect the

 1   -- the juveniles.     It is the legislature on the ground

 2   there and seeing what's going on in our State that makes

 3   these decisions about who can drive, who gets the right

 4   to have a tattoo, or who gets --

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But they don't make it on

 6   a case-by-case basis.       They say no juvenile can drink --

 7   no juvenile.

 8                  MR. MAKAR:    That's true but at the same --

 9   by the same token, the juvenile justice system in

10   Florida -- and keep in mind we had a juvenile justice

11   division -- department established in 1994 because of

12   the severe problems as we outlined in our brief -- that

13   Florida has a -- has committed resources and -- and

14   programs and so forth to the juvenile justice system.

15   So given all of that, that what the Court -- I am sorry

16   -- what the State has done as -- as to age, that's why

17   we say that it matters.

18                  What we are concerned about is that to

19   pursue the categorical rule that they seek, the Court

20   would have to, of course, abandon the various firewalls

21   that would stand between terms of years and also the

22   death penalty.

23                  But, in addition, if the Court decides to go

24   down the proportionality route, my concern is the five

25   principles in the Harmelin concurrence about the States


                                      44

 1   having the ability to have diverse juvenile justice

 2   programs and not have the -- sort of a lawnmower coming

 3   through and making them all uniform.              The Harmelin

 4   concurrence, Justice Kennedy, talked about the deference

 5   in structuring these.      And there's going to be

 6   differences.    Some States are going to have the most

 7   harsh laws.    The Eighth Amendment doesn't dictate any

 8   particular penological theory.             There's great -- and it

 9   -- it would turn the Eighth Amendment analysis on its

10   head to first allow this diversity among the States and

11   allow strong medicine for certain types of violent

12   crimes and then to kind of compare them and say, well,

13   gosh, Florida is unusual; it's different; and that

14   shouldn't be the case whatsoever.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If we look just at

16   deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference

17   in life and life without -- life with parole and life

18   without parole is just not a factor in deterrence.               I --

19   I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other,

20   but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for

21   that intuition.

22                 Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is

23   concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume

24   that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's

25   interest in keeping the accused, the ­- the

 1   defendant in custody for the rest of his life if he has

 2   been rehabilitated and is no longer a real danger?

 3   What's the State's interest?

 4                MR. MAKAR:    Well --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And you could say

 6   retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case

 7   basis deciding when there should be retribution.

 8                MR. MAKAR:    Well, I think certainly the

 9   State of Florida's interest as among other States is

10   first of all to punish.      Certainly I think deterrence

11   plays a role.   We recognize that deterrence may have

12   less impact on some juveniles, but it doesn't have -- it

13   doesn't have zero impact.       It does have some impact --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it seems to me the

15   deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume

16   rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation.

17                MR. MAKAR:    Well, but the deterrence goes to

18   those who would commit the same act.               Rather than

19   deterring this particular individual, it goes to others

20   who --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought the question

22   is:   Will the difference between life with parole and

23   life without parole deter anybody?               I mean any -- that

24   -- that's what we are talking about.               And I don't think

25   you really were urging that that difference will deter

 2   violent crime, then I will have life without parole.

 4   empiricism on this at all to say, you know, what -- does

 5   it really matter or not.        I think that as a matter of on

 6   the street people do talk about these things.              I mean,

 7   would they --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I guess there's also no

 9   empiricism on whether the committed juvenile feels a lot

10   better knowing that he will get out when he is 75 years

11   old than he would feel knowing that he was there for

12   life.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do we have empirical

15   studies about how much that improves the spirits of the

16   committed juvenile?

17               MR. MAKAR:       I -- I have seen none, and it --

 2   you are familiar discuss the rate of -- the difference

 3   between the danger of recidivism of a young offender and

 4   one who is, say, 40 or 50 years old?

 5                MR. MAKAR:      I -- I don't have that at my

 6   grasp, but --

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But it seems to me sort of

 8   -- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the

 9   same sort of point.     It seems to me that the older

10   people are less likely to be recidivists than the

11   younger ones, but is -- is there any empirical evidence

12   that says that's an incorrect or correct judgment?

13                MR. MAKAR:      Well, in terms of recidivism, I

14   think, number one, violence matters.                 I think there are

15   studies -- I can't quite put my finger on -- that

16   says that the violent offenders tend to recidivate more

17   than the non-violent.       And that as one ages -- I think

18   Judge Posner has written a book called "Aging and Old

19   Age" that talks about -- in one of its chapters about

20   how age matters, and that crime rates go down as -- as

21   the population ages.      So I mean there are those sorts of

22   things out there that --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, along those

24   lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus

25   briefs.   Do you have a study about what age cohort is

 1   responsible for most violent crime?

 2                 MR. MAKAR:     There are -- there are studies

 3   everywhere, and I have looked at many of them, and it

 4   appears that it certainly increases from age 13, and it

 5   goes up to 14.    And it keeps going up until about 16,

 6   17, and 18.    It peaks.     It depends on the crime, and it

 7   depends upon what jurisdiction, and so forth.                But it

 8   tends to peak in the early 20s, the late teens or early

 9   20s.   So that's -- that's -- I think that's typical.

10                 One thing I would point out that I haven't

11   had a chance to say:       The empirical question in this

12   case, I think, is very important because they are asking

13   that a constitutional rule be established on studies

14   that have just been generated literally over this summer

15   and have not been subject to meaningful review.

16                 We have a concern with that.              We think that

17   the definitional questions that they have raised, you

18   know, about the offenses and what is life -- is life --

19   the studies tend to focus on life.                But what is life?

20   Well, in Florida we have some juveniles who are serving

21   prison terms that have 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-year sentences,

22   but they are not included within that study.

23                 We also have in this case, for example,

24   Graham, he had a -- let's say that the judge decided to

25   give him 30 years for the main offense and 15 for the


                                     49

 1   second and made them consecutive.          That's 45 years.

 2   Graham's actuarial life --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, we are not sure that

 4   those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because

 5   your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not

 6   willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence

 7   amounts to life without parole.         Maybe a 70-year

 8   sentence does.

 9               MR. MAKAR:    Well, they've conceded, in their

10   brief, that what this all boils down to is that if

11   Graham wins and he gets to go back and be resentenced,

12   that either the Florida legislature has to pass a law to

13   reinstitute parole for this category of offenders, or

14   the trial judge could say, okay, the actuarial table

15   says you are going to live to be 64.2, we're going to --

16   I'm going to sentence you to something less --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought that there was

18   a parole system still functioning, so -- although it

19   will be phased out over time, but for people who

20   were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think

21   the suggestion was that that system would take care of

22   the handful of people, not more than that, that this

23   decision would involve.

24               MR. MAKAR:    There is still a parole board.

25   Its functions have been minimized greatly.          It has not


                                   50

 1   been applicable to anyone since 1983.             It would take a

 2   legislative act or perhaps even an executive act of some

 3   sort to reinstitute that board and to take account of

 4   these cases.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you tell us just a

 6   little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the

 7   policies with respect to rehabilitation programs?             If

 8   they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they

 9   don't need rehabilitation programs or that they might

10   need them more.

11                 Had the rehabilitation programs been

12   increased or decreased since the phasing out of parole?

13   Or is it about the same?       Or are they -- are they

14   non-existent?

15                 MR. MAKAR:    No, no.         They are in existence.

16   I cannot specifically answer that, Justice Kennedy,

17   because I don't know all the different programs that are

18   available.    There's the various programs that deal with

19   drug offenses and alcoholism and so forth.

20                 And there -- there are certain educational

21   programs.    For example, when Graham was in the county

22   jail -- that was the county versus the State -- he was

23   able to go to school.

24                 I don't believe there is anywhere near sort

25   of the total absence and deprivation, sort of a Weems

 1   case, sort of we put you in a cell and you rot there for

 2   the rest of your life, at all in our system.                   There's

 3   all these various rights that we pointed out in our

 4   brief that are -- enable -- they are able to have

 5   familial relationships.       They can have the Maslow's

 6   hierarchy.    I mean, they -- physiological needs and

 7   emotional needs and so forth are still available to be

 8   met in prison.

 9                So I can't give you specific programs,

10   Justice Kennedy, but in Florida's system, they do

11   exist.

12                If there's no further questions --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

14   Mr. Makar.

15                Mr. Gowdy, you have 4 minutes remaining.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Why does a juvenile have a

17   constitutional right to hope, but an adult does not?

19                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20                MR. GOWDY:     Because the juvenile is

21   different than an adult.       A juvenile is less culpable.

22   He's -- we know over time he will change and -- and

23   potentially reform, as opposed to an adult.                Once you

24   are fully formed, you are more culpable and you don't

25   have that same inherent capacity to change.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          But do you know anybody who

 2   is willing to say that, as a categorical matter, that --

 3   you know, the 18th birthday is the magical date for

 4   every single person?

 5               MR. GOWDY:       No, Your Honor, and nobody was

 6   willing to say that in Roper, but, yet, the Court still

 7   drew the line at 18 for the death penalty in Roper.

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:          Because the Court, up to

 9   this point, has said that death is different, and the

10   rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are

11   entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in --

12   in all other cases.

13               MR. GOWDY:       We are not -- we were not --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          If we -- you know, if we

15   abandon that, then one of two things has to happen,

16   either the rules for noncapital cases have to change

17   dramatically, or the rules for capital cases have to

18   change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact.

19               MR. GOWDY:       Well, I -- first, we -- we are

20   not asking that the procedural rules in the intricate

21   individualized death penalty sentencing scheme be

22   transported or moved over to the noncapital cases.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          I know you are not

24   asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this,

25   logically, is going?      If death is not different, then


                                      53

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   there should be uniform rules across the board.

 2               MR. GOWDY:    Absolutely not, Your Honor,

 3   because those rules make no sense when you are talking

 4   about adolescents, who are different, because those --

 5   which a Court recognized in Roper, that those rules

 6   can't be applied to adolescents because we -- you can't,

 7   as a sentencer, predict the future.

 8               And so, though death is different, it's not

 9   different in any critical respects here because the

10   punishment, life without parole, just like death, says

11   that the offender is forever irredeemable, is forever

12   unfit to live in society, and must die in prison.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:       Why does it say that?   Why

14   doesn't it just say that, in this particular case, what

15   this individual has done is so bad that, even if this

16   person can be rehabilitated and would not present a

17   danger to -- to society at age 60 or 70, that this

18   person is -- should be sentenced to life without parole?

19   That's -- that's what it means for an adult offender.

20               MR. GOWDY:    Your -- Your Honor, I think the

21   only difference here is -- between life without parole

22   and life with parole, is that there will be a

23   determination later, at age 30 or 40 or sometime

24   thereafter, as to whether that is the right sentence.

25               And the -- the parole official, just like


                                   54

 1   the judge, can consider the offense as the offender, as

 2   a juvenile.    We're just saying that you can't make that

 3   complete determination at such a young age, and --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One reason States --

 5                 MR. GOWDY:    -- and you will have a more

 6   accurate determination later.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One reason States

 8   and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in --

 9   in recent decades was, with depressing regularity,

10   prisoners released on parole committed crimes again.

11                 And I'm just -- is there any empirical

12   evidence that tells us how often people, say, from 17 --

13   17-year-olds, when released, commit crimes again, as

14   opposed to 18- to 20-year-olds?

15                 MR. GOWDY:    Your Honor, as my brother noted,

16   I think that the evidence shows that, as people get

17   older, they are less likely to recommit crimes.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But isn't that -- I

19   remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the

20   cutoff, there's sort of a magic age at some point,

21   where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically

22   don't engage in violent activity.

23                 MR. GOWDY:    It -- it decreases over time,

24   undoubtedly, and that's -- that supports, I think, our

25   argument here, that the -- that Terrance Graham, at age


                                     55
