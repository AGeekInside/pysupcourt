 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MS. WILLIAMS:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The factfinding at issue in this case is

11   significantly different than the factfinding at issue in

12   this Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases, in which the

13   Court struck down changes in sentencing practice that

14   had the effect of removing factfinding from the province

15   of the jury.   In those cases, the change in practice

16   meant that a defendant could be convicted by the jury

17   for one offense and then, based on nonjury factfinding,

18   the defendant could be sentenced for what appeared to be

19   an aggravated, more serious offense without the jury

20   having made all the factual determinations necessary for

21   that more serious offense.

22              That doesn't happen in this case.                  In this

23   case, the jury convicted Mr. Ice of six counts, and the

24   sentence imposed on each of those six convictions

25   satisfies the Apprendi rule.             There's no additional jury


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   factfinding that alters -- or nonjury factfinding,

 2   excuse me, that alters a specific sentence for one of

 3   the convictions.    Instead, what the factfinding in this

 4   case does is to significantly restrain the judge's

 5   ability to decide how to administer those multiple

 6   sentences for the multiple convictions.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, but it -- it, by

 8   reason of the unusual law at issue here -- -I think it's

 9   unusual, I don't -- I'm unaware of any other State that

10   has one -- the sentences -- the defendant has an

11   entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently

12   unless a certain additional fact exists and that

13   additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than

14   by the jury.    So that if you take seriously what -- what

15   we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which

16   has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the

17   defendant is entitled must be found by the jury -- if

18   you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't

19   apply here.

20                 MS. WILLIAMS:         Justice Scalia, first on the

21   point in terms of how unique this statute is, there are

22   other States that have similar requirements, that there

23   is initial a presumption that multiple sentences will be

24   concurrent unless there is additional nonjury

25   factfinding that authorizes the judge to impose


                                         4

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   consecutive sentences.        So it's not entirely --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How many others?   Do you

 3   know?

 4                 MS. WILLIAMS:         It's difficult actually to

 5   come up with an exact count, and the numbers vary when

 6   you look at how other courts have sort of combined

 7   cases, but perhaps as many as 13, but as different

 8   States have sort of changed their practice some of those

 9   have fallen away.    It's clear that there's at least a

10   minority of States that have this kind of limitation on

11   what is otherwise inherent or a discretionary authority

12   of the judge to decide how to administer these multiple

13   sentences.

14                 The difference is that what this Court has

15   been addressing in the Apprendi line of cases has always

16   been a specific sentence imposed on a specific

17   conviction.    And what Oregon Supreme Court did was to

18   expand that to say that, in addition to the statutory

19   maximum that this Court described in Blakely, there is

20   in effect a second statutory maximum that you must

21   consider when there are multiple sentences being imposed

22   for multiple convictions, and that's the total period of

23   incarceration that the defendant will serve with and

24   without the additional factfinding.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You know, this fact can --


                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   can turn out to be the most significant fact for the

 2   defendant.    I mean, it could lengthen his sentence

 3   enormously.    It's more important than many of the other

 4   facts that we leave to the jury.

 5                 MS. WILLIAMS:         Yes, Your Honor, and in this

 6   case, for example, the additional factfinding extends

 7   the whole duration of the -- of Mr. Ice's period of

 8   incarceration from 90 months to 340 months.               But what is

 9   significant is that, as this Court said in Blakely, the

10   Sixth Amendment is a reservation of jury power; it's not

11   a limitation on judicial power.               And I would submit it's

12   not a limitation on legislative power, except to the

13   extent that that exercise of power removed something

14   from the province of the jury.               Historically, it's

15   undisputed that the judge made this decision about how

16   multiple sentences would be administered.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you could say the same

18   about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth

19   Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power

20   where at least there is an entitlement by law to a

21   certain lower sentence.         And there we said you can't

22   leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that

23   trigger that law exist or not.

24                 MS. WILLIAMS:         I think what's important is

25   the foundation for that holding and the foundation for


                                         6

 1   the Apprendi rule.      It wasn't simply that factfinding in

 2   general that exposes the defendant to a harsher

 3   punishment is something that should -- would be better

 4   served by having it done by the jury.                     It was that,

 5   because of the changes in sentencing practices, because

 6   States and Congress have been taking what traditionally

 7   had been elements of an offense and relabeling them as

 8   something else, as sentencing factors, that the jury was

 9   no longer finding what traditionally it would have found

10   for each conviction.        It was no longer finding what

11   would have been each element of an offense.

12              So what the rule does is it provides a

13   bright-line way of testing what is the functional

14   equivalent of an element for a specific offense that

15   would have been within the province of the jury and

16   therefore that can't be removed without violating the

17   Sixth Amendment.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:               The rule --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               The rule does bear on

20   culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the

21   definition of an offense or a more serious offense.

22              MS. WILLIAMS:             Yes, Your Honor.

23              And I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed

24   this case as in terms of -- that it may have simply been

25   happenstance that the Court was looking only at single


                                          7

 1   convictions and single sentences being imposed on those.

 2   But I think that takes away the analysis that the court

 3   used in reaching the conclusions that it reached.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I don't understand why

 5   this happenstance is required to do it under the

 6   statute.   I didn't quite understand that.

 7               MS. WILLIAMS:            Well --

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              You said it's only

 9   happenstance.   He has to do it under the statute if he

10   makes the finding.

11               MS. WILLIAMS:            No, what I'm trying to say is

12   that I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed the fact

13   that so far in this Court's cases you had only been

14   dealing with a single offense and a single sentence, as

15   -- as not foreclosing the possibility that there would

16   be a different statutory maximum when you have multiple

17   sentences being imposed for multiple convictions.              And

18   so the supreme court, I think, treated it -- what I was

19   saying was it simply is happenstance that that had been

20   the -- the nature of the cases that this Court has

21   decided, but then drew from this Court's decision and

22   from discussion about punishment a broader meaning that

23   somehow the jury must be involved in any factual

24   determination that relates to the overall quantum of

25   punishment for multiple sentences being imposed.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:                Well, didn't we furnish the

 2   premise for that broader reasoning?                       Because we pointed

 3   out that the traditional role of the jury was standing

 4   in effect as the buffer between the power of the State

 5   and the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi

 6   cases was that the concept of elements was being

 7   manipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood

 8   in that -- in effect, that buffer position.

 9              And I guess the question here would be, is

10   there -- is there room for -- in effect, for

11   manipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing

12   scheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme,

13   so that the jury in effect loses control over the

14   length, the ultimate length of time that an individual

15   is going to serve?      What is your response to that?

16              MS. WILLIAMS:             That the jury does not lose

17   anything that the jury historically had within its --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:                No, but isn't the problem

19   with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia

20   raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same

21   argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline,

22   but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear

23   on the new law an old concept.                And this is a change in

24   the law, to be sure.        I agree with you, historically.

25   The judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at


                                          9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   all, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted

 2   to, subject to some kind of a rule of reason.

 3                 But we've got to apply the Apprendi concept

 4   and the concern of the jury trial right to this new

 5   situation.    So I don't think it's an answer to say,

 6   well, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.

 7                 MS. WILLIAMS:         But there's something

 8   different here in terms of looking back on history and

 9   what we have presently, compared to when you are looking

10   at the offense-specific sentence associated with a

11   specific conviction, because the changes in practice

12   there had the effect of taking away the ability to find

13   an element or something that was the equivalent of an

14   element, of removing that from the jury.                 And,

15   historically, that is clearly what the jury's job was:

16   To stand in as a buffer between the defendant and the

17   government.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So I gather from your

19   argument that you would -- you would be taking the other

20   side and you would be saying that it has to go to the

21   jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to

22   concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was

23   added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed

24   with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not

25   run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?

 2               MS. WILLIAMS:           I think --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             There it's attached to a

 4   particular crime.    Do you really think that we should

 5   have a different result in that case from this one?

 6               MS. WILLIAMS:           No, Your Honor, I don't,

 7   although I think that makes it a more difficult

 8   situation to try to analyze, because there it is -- it

 9   is focused on a specific sentence for a specific

10   offense.   But what is different is it still goes to not

11   adding to the penalty for that sentence, but adding to

12   how you are going to administer multiple sentences.

13               And the history here is very different.

14   Because what we have is, even though there wasn't a

15   statute when the Framers would have looked at this

16   issue, the issue did exist.             Judges did make the

17   determination about how multiple sentences would be

18   administered.   And what they would have considered would

19   have been a wide array of facts and without really

20   limitation other than --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You could say the same

22   thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up

23   to them and they considered a wide array of facts.               So

24   what?   We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by

25   law and say they can't do more than this, once you do


                                        11
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that, that fact has to be found by the jury.           And that's

 2   what's going on here.

 3              MS. WILLIAMS:          But I think what's different

 4   is that the history at issue and underlying Apprendi

 5   actually wasn't that the judge could simply make nonjury

 6   factfinding and expand the sentence beyond what the

 7   sentence was that was associated with the jury's

 8   verdict; that, in fact, that was the problem.          Because

 9   once there was additional factfinding that permitted the

10   judge to add to the penalty, that that had changed by

11   taking something away from what the jury's role was.

12                                 And so here we don't have that

13   same sort of situation.       I think that -- that that was

14   exactly the argument this Court has rejected in those

15   cases of -- of -- where Faith and others have attempted

16   to suggest that historically judges were able to do this

17   and so it shouldn't matter now that we have changes.

18   But the Court rejected those arguments to say that, no,

19   because the sentencing practices have taken something

20   away from the jury, that is why we have the Sixth

21   Amendment violation.

22                                 So if in this circumstance we

23   -- we have constrained judicial power -- and clearly

24   that's what this statute does, is it tells the judge

25   that, instead of being able to make this determination


                                      12

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   based on this wide array of factual considerations, the

 2   judge now is limited in what the judge must consider to

 3   -- to then exercise discretion in administering these

 4   sentences.                              But all of that is

 5   legislative restraint of judicial power without touching

 6   in any way on the jury's historic role in -- in how to

 7   deal with these multiple --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           Am I right in -- I just

 9   want to get the facts right.            Am I right, you did this

10   historical research, and if you start with Apprendi we

11   can go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you

12   haven't found a single case ever where it was a jury

13   rather than a judge that made this question of how you

14   put together sentences for two separate crimes committed

15   on the same occasion?      Is that right, or is it an

16   overstatement?

17                MS. WILLIAMS:         It is an overstatement only

18   in the sense that I did not go back as far as --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:           I didn't say how far you

20   went back.   I said as far as you went back.

21                MS. WILLIAMS:         As far as I went --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           I don't know what

23   Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see

25   Constitution.

 1                MS. WILLIAMS:           Yes, Your Honor.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             And at the time of the

 3   writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us

 4   feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the

 5   judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total

 6   sentence where the person had committed two crimes on

 7   the same occasion.

 8                MS. WILLIAMS:           Yes, exactly.        And that

 9   difference in terms of the history of showing that this

10   was a judicial determination, that -- and now that the

11   factfinding --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:             But you could say the same

13   in Apprendi.    It was a judicial determination how much

14   of a sentence you were going to get from ten years to

15   life.    It wasn't up to the jury.               It was up to the

16   judge.

17                MS. WILLIAMS:           But where --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             And yet when you constrain

19   the judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than

20   20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a

21   gun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be

22   left to the judge.      It's a matter of law, and the facts

23   must be found by the jury.            And I don't see any

24   difference here.     I mean in both cases it was

25   traditionally done by judges.

 1              MS. WILLIAMS:          But what this Court focused

 2   on with the Apprendi rule is that, although judges made

 3   decisions about sentencing within a range of possible

 4   sentences, what judges could not do was to find

 5   additional facts that were the functional equivalent of

 6   an element of a greater offense.              And that's what was

 7   happening with those new sentencing --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But we defined in effect

 9   what was the functional element of the greater offense

10   in terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the

11   judge to increase the sentence beyond the range that

12   would have been -- that would have established the

13   maximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?

14              MS. WILLIAMS:          Correct.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            All right.       And aren't we

16   in exactly the same position here?                Because the

17   defendant here can correctly say:               I cannot be sentenced

18   to the more onerous -- under a more onerous scheme of

19   consecutive sentencing unless some fact is found which

20   has not been found by the jury in coming to verdicts of

21   guilty in any of these crimes; a further fact must be

22   found to expose me to the heavier penalty.

23              And that is exactly the same as the

24   situation in Apprendi with one possible exception; and

25   that is, do you accept, as I thought you did, the


                                      15
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   proposition that consecutive sentencing is the heavier

 2   penalty or is a more onerous sentencing alternative.                        If

 3   you accept that, I don't see how you would escape the

 4   analogy with Apprendi.

 5              MS. WILLIAMS:             Your Honor, I do not accept

 6   that it is a -- an enhanced penalty for any of the

 7   specific convictions.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Everybody agrees.

 9              MS. WILLIAMS:             And it would be --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:               If you had a choice between

11   two concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences,

12   you know which one you are going to choose.                     So we -- we

13   know what is the heavier sentence or the heavier

14   sentencing option.

15              MS. WILLIAMS:             It does have certainly a

16   harsher effect on the defendant than serving each of the

17   sentences beginning at the same time.                     But I think the

18   same could be said in terms of mandatory minimum

19   sentences and the factfinding required for those.

20              We obviously have cases where a defendant

21   facing a mandatory minimum sentence is going to be

22   confronted with a harsher sentence than he would face

23   without that additional factor.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But the mandatory minimum

25   is at least within the range of sentencing possibilities

 1   that the judge could impose anyway without any further

 2   factfinding by the jury.

 3                MS. WILLIAMS:         And depending on how you view

 4   this in terms of if you are looking at it with an

 5   offense-specific frame, each sentence imposed for each

 6   of the six convictions is also within the range of what

 7   the judge can impose.      This additional piece of when

 8   those sentences begin does not take away from the jury's

 9   role.   It does limit what the judge could otherwise have

10   done, and it does that limitation by requiring

11   factfinding.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:           What about the -- what

13   about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having

14   him tried as an adult?       What about probation?          What

15   about alternative drug programs?               What about diversion?

16   I mean, I can think of five or six where there might be

17   a factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation

18   where the total amount of punishment is greater rather

19   than less.

20                MS. WILLIAMS:         Yes, Your Honor, and we are

21   now litigating some of those very questions in light of

22   the Oregon Supreme Court decision about what is the

23   scope when you look beyond the specific sentence imposed

24   for a specific conviction and look at this greater

25   quantum of punishment --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's a lot easier to limit

 2   it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a

 3   particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the

 4   whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles

 5   that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome

 6   if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to

 7   sentences.

 8                MS. WILLIAMS:         Although, Your Honor, some of

 9   these Douse-Greene decisions that are made again by

10   nonjury factfinding do affect what the defendant's

11   period of incarceration is going to be.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:           And doesn't the sentencing

13   -- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include

14   restitution, to include what is the equivalent of

15   probation?   I mean, there is a broad definition of the

16   word "sentence" in the law which includes some of the

17   things that I mentioned, though not all.

18                MS. WILLIAMS:         Yes, Your Honor, and the same

19   is true for Oregon, that the sentence imposed and if you

20   -- the -- the judgments are set out in the joint

21   appendix in this case, that set out each of the

22   sentences imposed for each of the six convictions, and

23   you will see that there are a number of things in

24   addition to the term of incarceration that are a part of

25   that sentence being imposed.

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you a question

 2   that may seem totally irrelevant?                  Do you think our

 3   decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania was correctly

 4   decided?

 5                 MS. WILLIAMS:          I --

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It seems to me under your

 7   reasoning in your case you might say that case was

 8   wrong.     And I think it was wrong.               I will be perfectly

 9   candid and say so.      I think it was a very important

10   decision.

11                 MS. WILLIAMS:          No, Your Honor, I don't think

12   that it is necessary to say that that decision is wrong

13   to be consistent with the position I am asserting here

14   or the decision in Harris, because there the Court made

15   a distinction between what the jury traditionally would

16   have been -- been doing and determined that that jury

17   role was limited to deciding facts that increased only

18   the -- the maximum penalty that the defendants faced.

19   And so factfinding tied to imposing a mandatory minimum

20   sentence is different.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, I understand.     But it

22   seems to me it is -- in the old common law tradition,

23   following sort of the reasoning in the case you relied

24   on, McMillan really should have come out the other way,

25   because the jury normally would be finding the facts


                                         19
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that would allow the minimum -- the maximum to go up or

 2   the minimum.   I forget which it was.

 3              MS. WILLIAMS:           And -- and what I have done

 4   is to start with the proposition that we have in place

 5   the Apprendi rule as it has been construed in McMillan

 6   and in Harris, but that this is a -- a very different

 7   extension of that rule beyond anything that this Court

 8   has addressed in these cases.

 9              And it's an extension that doesn't have the

10   same historic support that the Apprendi rule has.                 So I

11   don't think that this Court needs to -- certainly this

12   Court doesn't need to consider what impact this would

13   have except for, I think, in accepting the Oregon

14   Supreme Court holding.       That to me does raise questions

15   about the ongoing validity of McMillan and Harris.                 And

16   -- and again, there are ways that you could certainly

17   distinguish that and retain those.                 But what it does is

18   to focus more on the jury as factfinder instead of

19   focusing on what the jury's historic role was and the

20   Sixth Amendment as a reservation of the power that the

21   jury has, not somehow giving the jury additional power

22   beyond what it has whenever factfinding is involved that

23   is -- is related to a defendant's aggregate punishment.

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And, of course, it's part

25   of your position that historically sentences were always


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   consecutive, if you go way back.

 2                MS. WILLIAMS:         But, Your Honor, in the older

 3   cases we actually do find that they were -- there was

 4   discretion for the judge to have the sentences be served

 5   concurrently.   It was viewed as in some ways not giving

 6   full effect to the jury's verdict of finding the

 7   defendant guilty for multiple offenses, which

 8   consecutive sentencing did give full effect to that

 9   verdict.

10                And so it was in the nature really of a

11   mitigation that the judge could do to lessen the

12   severity of the punishment based on certain facts that

13   the judge would consider and then in simply exercising

14   the judge's discretion.

15                But what is important here, I think, is that

16   it was clearly something for the judge to decide.           Once

17   there were the multiple convictions, the jury's role was

18   at an end, and it was then up to the judge to make the

19   determination about how to administer those multiple

20   sentences.   And so long as we are not changing the

21   jury's role in establishing that sentence for each of

22   the -- the six convictions in this case, then we have

23   not removed from the jury anything that would have been

24   incorporated within the Sixth Amendment.

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           What happens with

 1   sentences from multiple States?                You commit the crime in

 2   State A; you flee.      You are then tried and found guilty

 3   of a second crime in State B.               I -- I -- let's assume

 4   that the judge in State B has considerable discretion as

 5   to whether or not he intends to impose a sentence in B

 6   or send back to A, and that he knows that A is going to

 7   be concurrent.

 8              Under the theory of the case that's

 9   advocated by the Respondents, do you think that a jury

10   trial or some sort of finding would be required?

11              MS. WILLIAMS:             I think that if the -- the

12   law required the sentences be concurrent unless

13   additional factfindings were made, then under the -- the

14   rule announced by the Oregon Supreme Court and advocated

15   by Respondent that question would have to then go to the

16   jury even if it arises in -- basically in separate

17   proceedings.

18              So as you are sentencing in that separate,

19   second proceeding, it would still be a jury question of

20   whether those facts were -- were there that would allow

21   the judge to impose a consecutive sentence.

22              The Oregon statute treats that a little bit

23   differently.   It appears to give the judge discretion

24   when there is a previously imposed judgment.               Other

25   States do it differently, though, and do require

 1   factfinding even in those circumstances when there has

 2   been a judgment imposed in an entirely separate

 4   time.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST G. LANNET

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 9                 MR. LANNET:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 This case presents yet another application

12   of the bright-line rule from Apprendi.                    Oregon law

13   entitles a criminal defendant to a concurrent sentence

14   for each offense unless certain facts are found.                       Here

15   for three offenses a judge found those facts and imposed

16   a greater penalty of a consecutive sentence.                    That

17   violated defendant's -- or the Sixth Amendment's jury-

18   trial guarantee that the judge's authority to impose

19   criminal punishment must be limited by the facts solely

20   found by the jury.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Lannet, there --

22   there is one significant difference, I think, between --

23   the-- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State

24   labels something a "sentencing factor" or an "element."

25   Every one of those questions that goes into determining


                                         23

 1   the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury

 2   under Apprendi.

 3                 But when it comes to consecutive versus

 4   concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our

 5   main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are

 6   certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent.                   Or

 7   it leaves the total things to the discretion of the

 8   judge.

 9                 And if we are looking at it from the point

10   of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not

11   going to make it totally discretionary because we want

12   to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting

13   certain restraints on the judge.                So it seems -- what

14   seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment

15   is supposed to protect the defendant's right.                And here

16   the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more

17   of a right.    And he can say, that's unconstitutional,

18   but if you give me less of a right, it would be

19   perfectly constitutional.

20                 It's that enigma that I think is very

21   disturbing about this case.

22                 MR. LANNET:       Well, two points on that.         One

23   of them is that historically the jury trial -- the jury

24   found the verdict of guilt.             That, in itself, authorized

25   the potential penalty of a very significant consecutive

 1   sentence.

 2               Oregon has made a different policy choice

 3   here.   And, to understand the full backdrop of it,

 4   perhaps the context, that before this Oregon -- before

 5   it had this statutory system in place, it had very

 6   liberal rules regarding merger.              This was part of a

 7   series of enactments in which antimerger provisions were

 8   enacted so the defendant's criminal history would

 9   represent more accurately the number of convictions the

10   jury had found him guilty of.

11               Therefore, the defendants under -- in Oregon

12   law the defendant must receive a separate sentence for

13   each offense.   So the increased number of sentences gave

14   rise to the possibility of longer sentences through

15   consecutive sentencing.        Because in Oregon not only does

16   an offense give rise to a discrete sentence, but whether

17   the -- the sentence is concurrent or consecutive is an

18   aspect of punishment for that offense.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            In Oregon traditionally if

20   a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in

21   the house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that

22   would not be considered two crimes?

23               MR. LANNET:        At a certain point in time

24   there were judicial rules in place regarding merger that

25   may have resulted in the entry of one --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:             Can you cite me an Oregon

 2   case which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape

 3   is only guilty of one crime?

 4              MR. LANNET:         I would be happy to submit some

 5   in a memorandum.   I would need another day to do so.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Lannet, in -- in

 7   connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you

 8   think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute

 9   which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime

10   committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be

11   30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not

12   commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will

13   be 15 years?

14              Do you think if the -- if the statute were

15   framed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we

16   would leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been

17   used or not?

18              MR. LANNET:         I certainly it would raise an

19   issue about whether -- a different statutory

20   interpretation, of course, that if the State was merely

21   shifting a burden on a fact to the defendant to

22   disprove, I think that that would run into problems with

23   this Court's due process -- case law.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, regardless of who

25   proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the


                                       26

 1   judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent

 2   determination that he did not use a firearm could be

 3   left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?

 4               MR. LANNET:         I think it would be very likely

 5   if this Court looked at this State's interpretation of

 6   the statute and found that the -- that the judge had no

 7   authority to impose the greater sentence?

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't see a dime's worth

 9   of difference between that and Apprendi.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             How are you to prove these?

11   I am always curious as to the defense policy as to why.

12   Stricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time

13   figuring out why.    If you have an actual case and you

14   have to go to trial, are you prepared to put on all the

15   evidence that although you want to say that your client

16   did neither of these things, that if he did do them, in

17   fact they were just one thing and weren't separate

18   things?   I mean are you prepared to go into all that

19   detail in front of the jury?

20               MR. LANNET:         Well, again I think there would

21   be a question about whether that would be proper, if

22   that would be in fact shifting an element over to the

23   defendant to disprove.        I think that that would

24   create --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:             No, you are saying that the

 1   standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that

 2   it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to

 3   the jury.

 4                 MR. LANNET:       Yes, sure.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       So I wonder if you

 6   are prepared to put all those facts before the jury,

 7   say, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my

 8   defendant who did it.

 9                 MR. LANNET:       Well, actually, Your Honor, a

10   decision affirming the Oregon Supreme Court at this

11   point would have little impact in Oregon.                 In response

12   to Blakely, the Oregon legislature enacted a statutory

13   scheme that gave back that enhanced sentence -- gave a

14   procedure by which they go to the jury, and it's either

15   -- and in a bifurcated proceeding that's ---

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That way, you have to

17   have two --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Booker/Fanfan as well, as

19   adopted, right?    I mean that was what the dissenters in

20   Booker/Fanfan would have --

21                 MR. LANNET:       Yes.       Correct.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are you saying it would

23   have to be a bifurcated proceeding?

24                 MR. LANNET:       In many instances, just based

25   on --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Is there historic evidence

 2   that bifurcated proceedings were required before

 3   Apprendi?

 4               MR. LANNET:          No, but I think that this is

 5   just a development of changing legislative choices in

 6   identifying facts.      I think Apprendi articulated the

 7   functional path to determine the scope of a jury

 8   trial guarantee when the State attempts to relegate a

 9   fact to a judge rather than a jury.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Could I get back to

11   the question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi.                    Is it

12   -- is it your position that if the offense, based on all

13   facts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of

14   30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could

15   determine that if a firearm was not used in the offense,

16   you would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a

17   problem under Apprendi?

18               MR. LANNET:          In Apprendi I am not sure

19   that -- that -- I mean it's a question of whether all

20   the facts have been found by the -- by the jury

21   authorize the maximum punishment.                  So --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Then it does.   All

23   the facts authorize a punishment of 30 years.                   And if

24   it's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge.                      But

25   I would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't

 1   interpose a jury between the defendant and the State

 2   with respect to every element, but only those elements

 3   that increase the punishment.

 4               MR. LANNET:        Well, the potential penalty the

 5   defendant faces -- and I think that if the penalty of

 6   whether a gun is present or whether a gun is not

 7   present, assuming that that would be enacted by a

 8   legislature, I think that as long as -- I mean the core

 9   question in Apprendi has been is the judge imposing a

10   penalty within the range authorized by the jury verdict.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            The core question is is the

12   defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a

13   certain penalty if a particular fact is found.

14               MR. LANNET:        Yes, sir.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And the answer would be,

16   yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't

17   use a gun to get a lesser penalty.                 And once you bring

18   in the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it

19   means that it has to be found by the jury.

20               MR. LANNET:        Yes, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            And in addition, it must be

22   true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay

23   restitution if the facts show that there was no money

24   taken.   And you needn't, by the way, convict the person.

25   You can convict him without finding that.

 1                So the same would be true of restitution.

 2   We would have another jury to decide restitution,

 3   another thing that has never been done; is that right?

 4                MR. LANNET:       Well, if only because the

 5   legislative scheme in place doesn't give the court

 6   authority to impose restitutions based solely on the

 7   jury's verdict.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, couldn't impose

 9   restitution without making a finding as to how much

10   money was taken.   So I don't -- I don't -- I can't

11   imagine the legislature --

12                MR. LANNET:       The Oregon appellate court

13   doesn't --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       The Federal

15   courts have not and I guess the same rule would apply.

16   Or what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug --

17   again, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with

18   another jury being impanelled to try the question of

19   whether there was a car; is that right?

20                MR. LANNET:       If -- if it was a fact that was

21   necessary for the punishment, I think that follows

22   within the rule of Apprendi.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:           It's a punishment.

24                MR. LANNET:       Although in Apprendi there was

25   a concern about elements being shifted from --

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            Maybe not.       Maybe it would

 2   just be an in rem proceeding.             What about the -- what

 3   about the proceeding -- what about the determination

 4   that a person who is going to trial goes to an adult

 5   court rather than a juvenile court, the difference being

 6   the extent of the punishment?             You are not entitled

 7   to -- a complete defense to the punishments that they

 8   could impose.   Do you see where I am going?

 9               MR. LANNET:        I believe --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm not sure which of these

11   things would actual follow from your rule and which

12   wouldn't.

13               MR. LANNET:        I think legislatively that the

14   general statutes would set the maximum penalty as being

15   punished as an adult and the juvenile system would be a

16   different type of system.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            But they will say no one

18   can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system

19   unless the person is indeed a juvenile.                 Who makes that

20   factual finding?

21               MR. LANNET:        Well, Your Honor, the bright-

22   line rule of Apprendi as it applies in the sentencing in

23   this case is a question of what the judge can impose in

24   a proceeding that was initiated --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            If we are going to depart

 1   from what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind

 2   of case and we do accept Apprendi as something different

 3   from what they did apply, does that require us to depart

 4   as well in all these other cases which have the kinds of

 5   differences that you have listened to?

 6                 MR. LANNET:        I believe that this Court

 7   already has.    For instance, in Greene, under common

 8   law a defendant who committed a capital offense was

 9   subject to the death penalty and it was only upon -- and

10   the trial court would get to exercise discretion whether

11   to impose it.     The Arizona legislature identified those

12   facts and said, we are not trying to shift elements to

13   the jury, these were never questions for the jury, but

14   rather we are only merely trying to guide the court's

15   discretion.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you a rather

17   broad question?

18                 MR. LANNET:        Yes, sir.

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            In Apprendi the opinions

20   were rather lengthy and discussed precedents at great

21   length.   Justice Thomas's opinion was quite scholarly

22   and I discussed a lot of old cases.                       If this case that

23   we have today had arisen before Apprendi was decided,

24   what case would you have supporting your position?

25                 MR. LANNET:        I believe I would have Jones v.

 1   the United States and I think that it would be --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I didn't hear that.

 3              MR. LANNET:        Jones, where the --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Jones --

 5              MR. LANNET:        Jones v. the United States,

 6   where this Court interpreted this as a matter of

 7   constitutional balance.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:            What if it had arisen

 9   before Jones?

10              MR. LANNET:        Then I think that it would --

11   that this Court, if it engaged in the historical

12   analysis it did and see that, yes --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And then the historical

14   analysis was to prove citation to what cases?

15              MR. LANNET:        I believe the cases that were

16   cited -- I don't think --

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:            All the cases in Apprendi

18   dealt with elements of the crime and that sort of thing.

19              MR. LANNET:        Yes.       But this Court looked at

20   that practice and decided that what was not at issue was

21   the legislative identified elements as being found by

22   the jury, rather the underlying concern, the core

23   concern, the position that this Court thought that the

24   framers wanted to enshrine in the Sixth Amendment is

25   that the judge's authority to punish is both created and

 1   limited by the factual findings of a jury.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What if under the

 3   law the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a

 4   determination of where the defendant should be sent,

 5   which facility, based on determination of which one has

 6   the most room.   Is that a determination that has to be

 7   made by the jury?

 8               MR. LANNET:         I believe that that -- that can

 9   be distinguished, because it was would be a

10   determination not based on punishment and not to impose

11   a punishment on defendant.           However, if --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Even if one was, you

13   know, the most horrendous prison in history and the

14   other was one of -- a country club?

15               MR. LANNET:         No, I believe this Court has

16   repeatedly stated in -- in downstream like decisions

17   after convictions that whenever someone was convicted of

18   an offense and sentenced to incarceration by executive

19   agency, you are subject to the policies of that agency

20   and there may be certain due process.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Yes, but here in my

22   hypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the

23   sentence.   It's just like you've got to, you know, make

24   restitution, you are not eligible for parole, you are

25   going to this place rather than that place.

 1              MR. LANNET:        Well, this Court has identified

 2   a bright line rule that it's not the particular of the

 3   fact whether it would be something that would be

 4   historically found by the jury, but rather a fact that

 5   functions to increase punishment.               I think I have

 6   trouble with the hypothetical saying that the

 7   different -- the different classification is sent to a

 8   different institution is intended as a punishment and

 9   not within the operations of the -- of the incarceration

10   institution overall.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Lannet, if we agree

12   with your position and let's say you are engaged by the

13   Oregon legislature and they say to you:                We don't want

14   to make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what

15   can we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying

16   to achieve, that is to say encourage as the main

17   rule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the

18   judge's discretion but we want to rein in that

19   discretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences

20   going from one judge to another?

21              They want -- they want to say, yeah, we

22   wanted this to be discretionary with the judge, but we

23   want to install certain controls so that the trial

24   judges will be operating more or less uniformly.                 How

25   could they do that constitutionally?

 1                 MR. LANNET:        I think they could do as they

 2   are doing in what this Court has decided is juries are

 3   finding those facts, and that a trial court does not

 4   have to impose a consecutive sentence.                    Rather --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The juries are find --

 6   that's what is going on now, the juries are part of this

 7   trial of guilt?

 8                 MR. LANNET:        If ordering the bifurcated

 9   proceeding much the way the aggravating factors under

10   Oregon's guidelines assumes everything handles in the

11   wake of --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which is it?      Do they do

13   it in the guilt trial or leave that up to the judge?

14                 MR. LANNET:        It falls into the condition of

15   what is defined as offense-related or offender-related

16   factors.     I think that these would come in as offense

17   related and probably be in the main trial.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Where -- where a defense

19   attorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.

20                 MR. LANNET:        Well, this Court has observed

21   repeatedly that -- that the right to a jury trial is one

22   that can be waived, and so the defendants have the

23   opportunity to not exercise those rights.                   This is just

24   that -- it's a right for the defendant but it's a

 1   being the jury role in our system.                It -- it both

 2   authorizes, gives the arbiter authority to impose

 3   punishment and also sets the maximum.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if the -- what

 5   if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent

 6   unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior

 7   federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive

 8   to the federal sentence?

 9              MR. LANNET:        Well, if that was -- if the

10   Almendarez-Torres prior conviction exception is a Sixth

11   Amendment issue, which the Court has stated that it is,

12   then I believe that there would not be required a jury

13   finding, much like if the legislature identified facts

14   that would be reflected in the jury's verdict, or

15   reverted back to the common law rule which gave the

16   trial court authority to impose consecutive sentences

17   merely on the basis of if there was a conviction.                 I

18   think that the facts identified by the Oregon

19   legislature here are quite different than what would

20   qualify as the Almendarez-Torres exception.               That

21   exception -- the basis that it has if we rationalize

22   consistence with the rule is that a fact of a prior

23   conviction has already been established in accordance

24   with the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.               These are

25   facts about the offense for which a consecutive sentence


                                      38

 1   is contemplated.   So, these are facts about the event

 2   that is being litigated at that moment.                 And the Oregon

 3   legislature has predicated the greater penalty of a

 4   consecutive sentence on those facts, and precedence

 5   instructs that when the legislature does so, the

 6   defendant has a right to have a jury find that fact

 7   beyond a unreasonable doubt before the State can rely it

 8   on and impose that greater penalty.

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Mr. Lannet, one of the --

10   or perhaps the driving force behind Apprendi was the

11   fear of abuse by a combination of the charging power and

12   the sentencing power.      What abuse do you see if -- if

13   you lose this case?     What potential abuse?

14                MR. LANNET:       Well, I think that it would

15   send a message to legislatures that they can enact

16   statutory schemes that have -- that allow for many

17   instances where consecutive sentences are authorized

18   based on the facts and that those facts do not implicate

19   a Apprendi role, and therefore is a --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:           That it would --

21                MR. LANNET:       Yes.       I'm sorry.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, I didn't mean to

23   interrupt.

24                MR. LANNET:       To set maximum punishment based

25   on consecutiveness rather than, as they were doing under

 1   the guideline system, by allowing a range and requiring

 2   facts to exceed that range.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:             They -- they would do by

 4   consecutive sentencing the same sort of thing that they

 5   were trying to do or some legislatures, Congress was

 6   trying to do by the sentencing factors?

 7                MR. LANNET:         I believe there's at least a

 8   great possibility of that, yes.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Is there any room for

10   harmless error here?        I mean, it seems to me patently

11   obvious that both of the statutory conditions were fully

12   satisfied.     It was within -- put it within the

13   discretion of the judge.

14                MR. LANNET:         Well, I think this Court should

15   not find those errors harmless beyond a reasonable doubt

16   for several reasons:        First, the State has the burden of

17   proof that it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and

18   has not attempted to do before the Oregon courts, the

19   appellate courts; it has not done so before this Court.

20   I think the Oregon Supreme Court necessarily concluded

21   that this --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:             I mean, is there any doubt

23   that he wanted to commit an offense twice?

24                MR. LANNET:         I think that praises an issue

25   of statutory interpretation.              I think that that is one

 1   of the issues --

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But statutory

 3   interpretation questions aren't for the jury.

 4              MR. LANNET:          You are right, Your Honor, but

 5   they are the ones for the Oregon Supreme Court in this

 6   instance, and the Oregon Supreme Court narrowly

 7   concluded that the findings of the jury found -- did not

 8   establish the factual predicate to impose consecutive

 9   sentences; however, they did not go into a comprehensive

10   analysis of what precisely those facts are, and in fact

11   the State -- the Petitioner here is actively litigating

12   the meaning of the statutory provisions at this point.

13   So it really is unclear what precisely are the facts

14   meant by this -- by the statutory terms.

15              I think it would put this Court in a

16   position to interpret the State statute in the first

17   instance, and disagree with the Oregon Supreme Court's

18   implicit conclusion, because it's under a State

19   constitutional requirement and also this Court's

20   requirement that it cannot reverse a lower court unless

21   it concludes that an error is harmless beyond a

22   reasonable doubt.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It held as far as the

24   State constitution went, this is fine.                   It's only the

25   Federal Constitution that stops the legislature from


                                        41

 1   doing this.

 2                 MR. LANNET:        Yes, I would acknowledge that

 3   there is no analysis in the written decision, and that

 4   is part of the problem because it didn't identify the

 5   particular facts and conduct a harmless error analysis

 6   for the benefit of this Court.

 7                 However, the court heard this case with a --

 8   in a consolidated argument with State v. Gray, in which

 9   it did address the State's harmless error argument and

10   recognized that, in Washington v. Recuenco, this Court

11   had said that a -- is subject to harmless error

12   analysis.

13                 So, I think necessary in the Oregon Supreme

14   Court reversing the lower court's decision is that

15   conclusion that this error was not harmless beyond a

16   reasonable doubt.     And subsequent to this case, the

17   Oregon Supreme Court decided State versus Hagburn -- and

18   I have a citation for that, if you like.                  It's -- and

19   that is identified -- it addresses the State's harmless

20   error question.     The citation is 345 Or. 161, and that's

21   regional reporter 190 P.3d 1209.                 And in that case we

22   had sexual offenses arising out of the same general

23   factual scenario, where a young victim testified that

24   she was abused in two different rooms on two different

25   days, and the Oregon Supreme Court said there is no

 1   factual default in our consecutive sentencing system

 2   that let -- the jury was not decided that this occurred

 3   during the same criminal episode or during a separate

 4   criminal episode.    And in light of the vague testimony

 5   by the victim, they could not conclude that a jury would

 6   have found that.

 7              So I believe that the -- that to the extent

 8   that the Oregon court has analyzed the statute, that I

 9   think that it would -- it backs up the conclusion that

10   it found this not to be harmless beyond a reasonable

11   doubt.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               One way of -- if you are

13   right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon

14   legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to

15   the judge's discretion.         However, before the judge makes

16   a sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of

17   the following factors.        That would be okay?

18              MR. LANNET:          I believe so, if that kind of

19   statutory provision was interpreted like you are

20   suggesting, that the court has authority based solely on

21   the jury's verdict and is merely exercising its

22   discretion and there is no requisite factfinding or the

23   -- even the requirement to find a fact to impose a

24   consecutive sentence, then I think it wouldn't praise an

25   Apprendi issue.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           No entitlement to a lesser

 2   sentence?

 3                 MR. LANNET:       No entitlement to a lesser

 4   sentence, Your Honor.       Thank you.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if it's subject

 6   to judicial review for judicial review for abuse of

 7   discretion?

 8                 MR. LANNET:       I believe so.              I think that

 9   this Court has --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That doesn't give

11   you an entitlement to that, to the exercise of

12   discretion that isn't abused?

13                 MR. LANNET:       Not an entitlement that is

14   based solely on the facts found by the jury's verdict.

15   I don't believe it would.

16                 Ultimately, this case was just an

17   application of the Apprendi rule.                 The State asked this

18   Court to replace that bright-line functional rule with

19   some yet unidentified criteria for identifying

20   constitutionally protected elements.                     It hasn't really

21   offered this Court with any suggestion of what those

22   constitutionally protected elements are except to say

23   that that fact at issue in this statute are not those.

24   At a minimum the State asks for an exception to the

25   Apprendi rule based on historical reasoning about an

 1   allegation that this was only meant to control the

 2   discretion of the sentencing court and it didn't shift

 3   any elements.   And that kind of argument was explicitly

 4   rejected in Blakely, Booker, and Cunningham.                      The Oregon

 5   Legislature authorized consecutive sentence as greater

 6   penalty only for offenses committed under certain

 7   factual circumstances.         Those facts, not the jury -- not

 8   found by the jury -- increase the defendant's penalty

 9   from 7-1/2 years to over 28 years.

10              Affirming the decision below would adhere

11   the bright-line rule in Apprendi and it would preserve

12   the jury's role in finding each fact that authorizes the

13   maximum punishment.       Thank you.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:               Counsel, don't -- well, the

15   case that I mentioned on my account.                      I'm thinking about

16   it -- it's not going to make any difference.

17              MR. LANNET:           Thank you very much.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Ms. Williams.     You

19   have four minutes.

22              MS. WILLIAMS:             Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23              What the State is advocating for here is not

24   an abandonment or a modification of the Apprendi rule,

25   but a limitation of the Apprendi rule to the cases in

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   which this -- the circumstances in which this Court has

 2   applied it so far.      The Apprendi rule has been applied

 3   as a bright-line test for deciding when a sentence for a

 4   specific condition has satisfied the Sixth Amendment.

 5   And the way it operates is the rule itself tells us what

 6   are the necessary facts that the jury must find, and so

 7   there doesn't need to be a new rule to determine what

 8   are those constitutionally protected facts.                 The

 9   Apprendi rule does that for us by saying that any fact

10   that exposes a defendant in a particular conviction and

11   sentence to a greater penalty based on -- that -- based

12   on a fact that the jury has not found, is the functional

13   equivalent of an element if we had looked historically

14   at what the jury's role was.              And so, therefore, that

15   additional factfinding, if it exposes the defendant to a

16   -- a longer penalty, a greater penalty for a specific

17   conviction, it must be found by the jury.                 And that is

18   how the Court has applied the rule to this point.

19               So all we are asking is that the Court

20   clarify that that is the full scope of the Apprendi

21   rule.   And the reason for that is again, going back to

22   what this Court said in Blakely, that the Sixth

23   Amendment is only a reservation of jury power.                 And here

24   what we have here is something that is entirely a

25   judicial determination -- that historically has always


                                         46
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   been a judicial determination -- and the only overlay we

 2   now have is a legislative effort to regulate that

 3   judicial authority through the mechanism of requiring

 4   factfinding.

 5              It's something that the legislature often

 6   does, is to try to regulate judicial discretion by

 7   requiring factfinding and by limiting the kinds of facts

 8   the judge may consider.        And that's what is being done

 9   in this case without removing anything from the purview

10   of the jury.   And so we would ask that this Court

11   reverse the Oregon Supreme Court.                Thank you.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.
