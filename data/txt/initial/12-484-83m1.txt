 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Our last case of the

 4   year is 12-484, University of Texas Southwestern Medical

 5   Center v. Nassar.

 6                 Mr. Joseffer?

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL L. JOSEFFER

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. JOSEFFER:           Good morning, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 This Court's decision in Gross does most of

12   the work in this case and the plain language of the 1991

13   amendments to Title VII do the rest.

14                 Under Gross, Nassar must prove that

15   retaliation was the but-for cause of the challenged

16   employment action unless Congress has specifically

17   relieved him of that burden by authorizing a mixed

18   motive claim.

19                 In -- in the 1991 amendments, however,

20   Congress authorized mixed motive treatment only for

21   Title VII claims that challenge -- that challenge

22   discrimination based on membership in a protected class,

23   not for retaliation claims.               And for that reason, a

24   Title VII retaliation claim must prove but-for

25   causation.

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In the -- in the AIDS

 2   discrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference

 3   between the discrimination claim itself and the

 4   retaliation.     They'd both be governed by the same

 5   standard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination

 6   area, the but-for causation?                Or am I wrong about that?

 7                  MR. JOSEFFER:          Yeah.         Well, the Age Act does

 8   not permit any mixed motive claims.

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Yes.

10                  MR. JOSEFFER:          So for this purpose in the

11   Age Act, everything is but-for, that's correct.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But your argument is that

13   in Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard

14   Congress wants to have for the discrimination claim,

15   you're going to have a different standard for

16   retaliation.     So, in these statutes, I thought these two

17   traveled together, whatever the standard is for

18   discrimination is the same for retaliation.

19                  MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, that -- I mean, to some

20   extent within Title VII, that is the question in the

21   case, but what we have here is an amendment within Title

22   VII, it is first in Title VII where it's set forth

23   discrimination based on class and discrimination based

24   on retaliation as separate types of discrimination, and

25   this provision treats them differently.                    It specifically

                                         4

 1   limits -

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, I guess the question,

 3   Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination

 4   statute in which one can say that there's a different

 5   standard for proving retaliation than there is for

 6   proving substantive discrimination?                    Because as I sort

 7   of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the

 8   standard is, the standard is the same for both, and

 9   there's no statute in which the two have been divorced.

10                Am I wrong about that?

11                MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, I mean -- the reason I

12   ask the question -- I would agree in the sense that if

13   what we're talking about is but-for versus mixed motive,

14   right?   It's -- it's but-for everywhere except for

15   within the meaning of this one amendment.                    Congress

16   clearly intended to make an exception here to the normal

17   but-for, so the question is to the scope of it.

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'll try again.         Is there

19   any other statute in which we have a different standard

20   of causation for a retaliation claim than we do for a

21   substantive discrimination claim?

22                MR. JOSEFFER:          No, because it's but-for

23   everywhere except for this one amendment.

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, is there -- I mean,

25   it's but-for everywhere.          Is there even any time at

                                       5

 1   which whatever the standard that applied, you know,

 2   pre-Gross, is there ever a moment and is there ever a

 3   statute in the history of antidiscrimination laws where

 4   there has been a divorce, a different standard for

 5   retaliation than for substantive discrimination?

 6               MR. JOSEFFER:          Not -- I can't point to

 7   anything specific because what we had, right, was -

 8   there was -- I can't point to anything specific on that.

 9   Up until the statute, the whole point of Gross, right,

10   is that the statute carves out a narrow exception from

11   but-for and -

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:            All I'm saying, you know,

13   Gross was a couple of years ago.                 It said but-for covers

14   the -- the ABA and outside Title VII.                 You know, we've

15   had a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964.                 We've

16   had a lot of different standards applying to those

17   discrimination statutes since 1964.

18               And you're coming in here and asking for the

19   first time in all of those many decades that we should

20   divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive

21   discrimination claim and make them follow two different

22   standards; is that correct?

23               MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, I mean, yes and no, in

24   the sense that if we're talking about but-for versus

25   mixed, right, yes, that's a creature of this specific

                                      6

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   statute we're talking about.             If we're talking about

 2   other aspects of retaliation and other types of

 3   discrimination, there are differences in the statutes.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:            Did this court ever hold

 5   that a Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation

 6   claims?

 7               MR. JOSEFFER:          No.       And the -- I mean, the

 8   backdrop here, which is the whole point of Gross, right,

 9   is that as of Price Waterhouse, we had, you know, a

10   somewhat confusing and murky alignment of opinions,

11   that -- and I think everyone agrees with this -

12   interpreted only at Section 2a, the discrimination based

13   on class provision.

14               Then, two years later, Congress came in with

15   this amendment to specifically identify what it wanted

16   to do about mixed motive.          And Gross says that except

17   for when Congress has specifically called for this mixed

18   motive treatment, it's but-for is the holding of Gross.

19   And when we look to this provision -- I mean, there are

20   different ways of looking at it, but one would be to say

21   that I'm not aware of any statute that has a specific

22   retaliation provision where this Court has construed

23   discrimination based on class generally to encompass

24   retaliation, because that would make the retaliation

25   provision here in 3a absolutely surplusage.               It would

                                      7

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   make the other statutory cross-references to 3a

 2   surplusage, because you'd be taking the specific

 3   retaliation provision within Title VII and subsuming it

 4   within a general treatment of discrimination based on -

 5   on class, race, and so forth.

 6                And this basic structure of these provisions

 7   of Title VII is that when Congress wants to refer to all

 8   Title VII discrimination claims, it will refer as it did

 9   in subsection 2n to a claim of employment

10   discrimination, generally; it will refer as it did also

11   in section 2 to an unlawful employment practice, which

12   would cover the waterfront, but when it wants to cover a

13   specific subset, it refers to retaliation as spelled out

14   in 3(a), or to discrimination based on membership in one

15   of the five protected classes.

16                And here -

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm sorry, I somehow

18   lost what you were saying.             Isn't the law, and our

19   presumption in Jackson, that when we talk about

20   discrimination on the basis of race that it includes

21   retaliation generally?

22                MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, the reason -- well,

23   what Jackson says of course and Title VII is vastly

24   different.   And the -

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, different because

                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it was the beginning of this sort of endeavor of

 2   creating a statute.

 3               MR. JOSEFFER:            Well, the distinction that

 4   Jackson draws and also that Gomez-Perez draws expressly

 5   in distinguishing this type of situation is if -- if you

 6   have a broad general prohibition on discrimination or

 7   discrimination based on race, without more -- without

 8   more specificity, the Court will presume that that would

 9   include retaliation.

10               But when you have a statute, like this one,

11   that specifically singles that -- specifically describes

12   in detail the different types of prohibited

13   discrimination, including specifically retaliation, this

14   Court has never overridden that specific statutory text

15   to put one of those specifically broken-out types of

16   discrimination into another more general one, such as

17   discrimination based on race, which is why -

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 I'm -- I'm not sure what

19   difference it makes.

20               MR. JOSEFFER:            Well, because otherwise, you

21   are taking the -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Other than in the

23   outcome you want here.

24               MR. JOSEFFER:            As a matter -- well, as a

25   matter of statutory interpretation, right, which then

                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   drives the outcome, the difference is that if -- if you

 2   treat a specific retaliation reference or provision as

 3   being subsumed within a more general one, a

 4   discrimination based on race, for example, you are

 5   treating the specific retaliation reference to be

 6   surplusage, to have no effect and to not need to be

 7   there, and you're treating the other statutory

 8   cross-references to it as also being surplusages, which

 9   is why, when Congress does speaks more directly this

10   Court's never overridden, never said that it will take a

11   specific retaliation provision and treat it like it's

12   not there and toss it and -- based on race, for example.

13                And that's why -- I mean, that's why those

14   general cases they cite, those are our cases, because

15   Jackson specifically says that Title VII is vastly

16   different for this very reason.

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean,

18   Title VII is written before any of these cases come

19   along.   So Title VII is written and it says we have an

20   anti- -- you know, a substantive antidiscrimination

21   provision, and we have a retaliation provision.                    And

22   then the Court starts issuing cases.                    And it says, by

23   the way, you actually don't need both.                    One will do the

24   job for you, because one includes the other.

25                And that's in Sullivan.                   And that's in

                                      10

 1   Jackson.     And that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am

 2   missing a few.     Three, four, five times, the Court says

 3   this.

 4                  So then in 1991 Congress comes back and it

 5   says, we want to make some amendments, what do we have

 6   to do?     Do we have to amend both, the anti -- the

 7   substantive provision and the retaliation provision?

 8   Well, no, we have been told five times that as long as

 9   we say one it means both.             And so that's what Congress

10   does in 1991.

11                  MR. JOSEFFER:          There are a couple -- if you

12   just look at 1991, there are a few reasons that we know

13   from the '91 that doesn't work.                   One is at almost at the

14   same time in 1991 Congress enacted the Americans With

15   Disabilities Act, where it again separately broke out

16   discrimination based on disability and retaliation,

17   treated them separately.            So Congress hadn't forgotten

18   that it was treating them differently.

19                  Also, in this very provision, the Civil

20   Rights Act of 1991, Congress specifically

21   cross-referenced both the part of Title VII that

22   contains the general provision and the part of VII,

23   Section 3, that contains retaliation.                    So it's

24   specifically dealing with these separate provisions,

25   acknowledging that it has in fact presumptively at least

                                        11

 1   has read them and understands the distinction.              I mean,

 2   I think we presume it anyhow, but we know it from the

 3   actual statutory text of the '91 -- 1991 Act.              And

 4   then -

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, it seems that the

 6   overall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions

 7   of this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted

 8   Title VII properly.

 9               And am I right that what they put about

10   motivating factor, a motivating factor, that is more

11   plaintiff-friendly than the -- than the standard that

12   the Court declared in -- in Price Waterhouse?

13               MR. JOSEFFER:          For -- for those cases

14   that -- that the motivating factor provision governs,

15   it's more plaintiff-friendly, yes.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So it's -- it's really

17   odd to think that in wanting to go beyond what we did in

18   Price Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an entirely

19   different standard for -- for retaliation.

20               MR. JOSEFFER:          That was basically the same

21   argument that this Court rejected in Gross, in -- in

22   that Gross involved an absolutely identical statutory

23   provision, that was lifted in fact, deliberately lifted

24   verbatim, from Title VII to be put into the Age Act.

25   And what this Court held, basically, it was that, look:

 1   Whatever Congress's overall purpose or general purpose

 2   behind the 1991 act as a whole, right, what we have to

 3   do is look at what it actually did, what lines it

 4   actually drew in any given situation.                    And here -

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Let's look at what they

 6   actually did.    If we look at this (m) section, it says,

 7   "except as otherwise provided in this subchapter."                      I

 8   take it that would include retaliation as well, in the

 9   subchapter.

10                 MR. JOSEFFER:          Yes.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- "an unlawful

12   employment practice is established."                    And then when we

13   go over to the retaliation provision, it says, "it shall

14   be an unlawful employment practice."

15                 So why doesn't that suggest that the -- "an

16   employment practice" under the retaliation provision is

17   the same as "an employment practice" under this -

18                 MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, the -- under Title VII,

19   there are basically three different ways to establish an

20   unlawful employment practice.

21                 One is the general provision for

22   discrimination because of membership in a class.                      One is

23   because of retaliation.          And this is another one.              So

24   this defines basically a third way of establishing

25   whether an employment practice is unlawful.                    And what it

                                       13

 1   says is that any employment practice that is motivated

 2   by one of the five listed factors is an unlawful

 3   employment practice.        So this is why it all keeps coming

 4   back to do those five factors, those five motivations,

 5   do they or do they not include retaliation?                  We agree

 6   with the Government that that's what it all comes down

 7   to.

 8                  And as to that question, I mean, there was

 9   discussion earlier today about the weight of authority.

10   I mean, nine courts of appeals have squarely addressed

11   this.    They've all agreed with us because Title VII's

12   text and structure are so clear, that Title VII -- and

13   that was the basis for the distinction of Title VII in

14   Gomez-Perez.     Excuse me.         Gomez-Perez distinguished the

15   identical provisions of the Age Act, made the same

16   point.    Jackson again was vastly different for this

17   reason -

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I can't understand you very

19   well.    Could you -- maybe you have to lift up your mike,

20   or maybe you have to speak more slowly.                  But I'm having

21   an awful time following you.

22                  MR. JOSEFFER:          I apologize, Your Honor.

23                  I was just saying the basic point is that,

24   as Jackson and Gomez-Perez indicated, the specific

25   controls the general.         And when Congress breaks out

                                        14

 1   retaliation, that's a different subset of discrimination

 2   that's not been subsumed within discrimination based on

 3   class.

 4               Otherwise, you are reading out the

 5   retaliation provisions and making them surplusage, which

 6   is why all of the many courts of appeals that looked at

 7   this unanimously agreed with us.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The EEOC didn't.

 9               MR. JOSEFFER:          Right.             Well, this Court has

10   already disagreed with the EEOC.                 The EEOC has two

11   footnotes and informal guidance that say that under the

12   1991 amendments retaliation claims can be proven under a

13   mixed motive theory for any of the statutes that the

14   EEOC administers, which is clearly contrary to Gross.

15               And that informal guidance does not

16   contain -- what it contains basically is, you know,

17   policy analysis of why they would like that to be the

18   result, but no textual analysis whatsoever.                     There's -

19   so the guidance in one doesn't get deference because

20   it's contrary to the plain text of the statute, as

21   numerous courts of appeals have recognized.

22               And two, in terms of its power to persuade,

23   I mean, this Court has already rejected it and even as

24   applied to Title VII retaliation, you know, courts of

25   appeals have unanimously rejected it as well because

                                     15

 1   there is just policy there, there's no textual analysis.

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:            As of 1991 -- well,

 3   Gomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right?

 4                  MR. JOSEFFER:          Yes, the other's before.

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:            So as of 1991, was there any

 6   case, any decision of this Court other than Sullivan,

 7   that could have possibly led Congress to a conclusion

 8   that the general prohibition against discrimination

 9   included a prohibition of retaliation?

10                  MR. JOSEFFER:          I think you are right about

11   the timing.     And Sullivan was so general that -- I don't

12   know that the law was a whole lot different in 1991 than

13   it had been in '64 on this.

14                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in

15   CBOCS, we said that because of Sullivan alone, just

16   because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to

17   exclude explicit language about retaliation.                        In other

18   words, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear.

19                  Now, Justice Alito was right.                     After that,

20   it goes on.     We have done it many more times after 1991.

21   But we have said that Sullivan itself made the point

22   clear that you did not need explicit language about

23   retaliation.

24                  MR. JOSEFFER:          Right.             But the -- and the

25   main point is the one I was making earlier, that in 1991

                                        16

 1   itself, Congress was continuing to distinguish between

 2   retaliation and discrimination based on class, and in

 3   provisions of this Act and also in the almost

 4   simultaneously enacted Americans With Disabilities Act.

 5                But there has been another provision in the

 6   Disabilities Act that treats retaliation and

 7   discrimination based on -- on disability is

 8   significantly different in terms of the remedies that

 9   are available for the two.               So even at the same time,

10   Congress has elsewhere also been distinguishing between

11   the two.

12                JUSTICE KAGAN:              I mean, here's what you're

13   ask -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question -

14   but here's what you're asking us to accept,

15   Mr. Joseffer.     Congress comes along in 1991 in a world

16   in which there has -- there have never been separate

17   standards for retaliation and substantive

18   discrimination.

19                Congress is trying to codify and make even

20   stronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right?               They -

21   you know, they say, basically, we like Price Waterhouse,

22   but it's kind of confused and the court was kind of

23   fractured.   We're going to really put it into place

24   legislatively.

25                They do that, they follow the -- essentially

                                        17

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the drafting manuals that we have given them in

 2   Sullivan.   And you're saying, well, no.                   What they

 3   really meant was that retaliation would have a different

 4   standard and, indeed, retaliation would have a standard

 5   that the dissenting justices suggested in Price

 6   Waterhouse, notwithstanding what Congress was clearly

 7   intending to do was codify the majority -- the

 8   plurality-plus position.

 9                MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, what -- Gross rejected

10   a fair amount of that reasoning, right?                    I mean, the

11   point is that Price Waterhouse -- you could say that in

12   Price Waterhouse, there is no reason to think that there

13   should be mixed-motive claims, right?

14                Now, Congress shortly thereafter came in

15   with the '91 amendments to say, okay.                    We'll have mixed

16   motive claims in this one category.                    Gross says that's a

17   relatively narrow category.             We're going to assume

18   Congress does not want them anywhere else, even though,

19   you know, discrimination under the Age Act or under

20   Title VII, you could ask why should it be different.

21   Well, because Congress decided it would be.

22                Here -

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, Gross is talking about

24   outside of Title VII.       And -- and whatever might be said

25   of Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is

                                      18

 1   specifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price

 2   Waterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative

 3   drafting instructions, and with the backdrop of never

 4   distinguishing between retaliation and

 5   antidiscrimination, you know, how do you get to where

 6   you want to be?     This would be, like -- talk about

 7   elephants in mouse holes or talk about -- you know, we

 8   can take up all our cliches, the dog that didn't bark.

 9   You know, Congress doesn't do things like this without

10   saying something.

11               MR. JOSEFFER:             Well, first off, it did.

12   Because in this statute, as in others, it distinguishes

13   between discrimination based on membership in a class

14   and retaliation, but it wants to cover all of it, it

15   uses a more general phrase.               When it wants to cover one

16   of them, it says one.         Here it said one.

17               But beyond that, again, in terms of the

18   backdrop though -- I mean, the -- the whole point of

19   Gross is that you -- you stick to the plain language of

20   '91, and that's -- that's where mixed motive treatment

21   is permitted, and also where there's a -- there's a

22   negative inference elsewhere that is so strong that as

23   you said, it applies even in other statutes.               Well, if

24   that negative inference applies in other statutes, it

25   would sure apply within the same statute that -- that

                                        19

 1   this provision exists in and is amending.

 2               Also, there are significant differences

 3   between discrimination based on class and retaliation

 4   that Congress could -- didn't have to -- but could

 5   certainly reasonably choose to follow.                 One is that

 6   retaliation is -- well, excuse me.

 7               The primary evil Congress was after here,

 8   right, was discrimination based on race, sex, religion,

 9   and so forth.   Retaliation is an important derivative

10   prophylactic provision to help enforce the primary

11   right, but Congress could reasonably conclude that the

12   significant cons with mixed motive treatment did not

13   justify extending it to the secondary right.                 Also -

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Where do you see that

15   anywhere in the legislative history?

16               MR. JOSEFFER:           The only thing you'll find in

17   the legislative history, the only thing you'll find

18   that's specific to this, is that Congress was aware of

19   retaliation, including aware of Title VII's retaliation

20   provision, and it amended legislation to incorporate

21   that provision when it wanted to.

22               You're not going to find anything else in

23   there.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Well, but it -- it calls

25   it the same thing it calls the substantive

                                      20

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   discrimination charge, an un -- it's a -- an unfair

 2   employment practice.        I mean, I don't understand how

 3   you -- where you get to your policy point -

 4                  MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, the -

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- from the fact that it

 6   calls it the same thing on both substantive.

 7                  MR. JOSEFFER:          No, my -- my point is this.

 8   This Court explained, for example, in Burlington

 9   Northern, the two -- the two are both prohibited types

10   of discrimination, generally, under but-for standard,

11   but they are different, which is why we have different

12   labels and different names for the two categories.

13   And -- and Congress could reasonably choose to give

14   greater protection to the primary right and not the

15   secondary one considering the negative.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Calls it both identical

17   things, an unlawful employment practice.

18                  MR. JOSEFFER:          Yes.        And textually, but it

19   then describes seven different unlawful employment

20   practices.     Discrimination based on the five classes and

21   discrimination based on the two types of protected

22   conduct.     This provision then applies to the five

23   practices and leaves out the two types of protected

24   conduct, which is why, textually speaking, and there's

25   no contrary legislative history, Congress meant to apply

                                        21

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this to some, but not all types of unlawful conduct -

 2   of unlawful -- of employment practices.

 3               And the reason that that's perfectly

 4   rational is three things.          First, as I mentioned, this

 5   is the secondary of them.          Second, it sweeps -- by its

 6   nature, retaliation sweeps so much broader, well outside

 7   of the traditional workplace.              While Congress was

 8   thinking about jettisoning traditional burdens of proof

 9   and relieving a plaintiff of the -- of the traditional

10   burden of proving its own case, they could certainly

11   balk at doing that in a much broader setting.

12               And third, the potential for meritless and

13   abusive suits is particularly pronounced in a

14   retaliation context, because any employee at all can opt

15   into a retaliation claim by making a -- a charge of -- a

16   relevant charge, knowing that -- you know, potentially

17   knowing that, yeah, the writing's on the wall, probably

18   I'm going to get fired.        And if you then flip the burden

19   so the plaintiff doesn't have prove its own claim, the

20   plaintiff can point to the timing of his own complaint,

21   the inevitable employment action would have happened

22   anyway, and the proximity, then, is probably going to

23   get the plaintiff past summary judgment.

24               Now, what you're then looking at is an

25   expensive and unpredictable trial, most defendants will

                                     22

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   be forced to settle even meritless claims.

 2                And the EEOC's own statistics show that,

 3   one, retaliation claims have become all the rage.                They

 4   are the -- the leading type of claims being raised these

 5   days.   And, two, the EEOC's reasonable cause

 6   determination show that only 5 percent of them have even

 7   reasonable cause to support them, which is not an

 8   especially high standard.

 9                So when we're talking about a potential

10   massive amount and growing amount of mostly meritless

11   but expensive litigation to defend, it's perfectly

12   reasonable for Congress to decide, well, within the

13   scope of what Price Waterhouse was exactly dealing

14   with -- to get back -- to get back to Justice Kagan's

15   point -- we'll have -- we'll allow some mixed motive

16   treatment there, but that'll be it now, because -

17   because there are other issues with retaliation that

18   caused -- caused Congress to reasonably do exactly what

19   it so clearly did in statutory text.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But that policy argument

21   just says Jackson's wrong.

22                MR. JOSEFFER:          No, not at all.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               It just doesn't make

24   any -- much sense to me that in 1991, when they were

25   thinking about Price Waterhouse burdens, that somehow

                                      23

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they thought that it should now apply that burden

 2   differently to retaliation.

 3                 MR. JOSEFFER:          It -- it was -- the same

 4   argument was rejected in Gross, right?                       Because in

 5   Gross, you had another absolutely identical provision

 6   to -- to the -- to the two Title VII provisions at issue

 7   here.    And this Court held that, no, what Congress was

 8   doing in 1991 was specifically authorizing mixed motive

 9   treatment when it wanted and otherwise casting what this

10   Court called the strongest possible inference that there

11   would be no other mixed motive treatment.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is -- is this a violation

13   of Title VII?    I don't know the answer.                     Smith works for

14   Jones.    Jones' whole job is to supervise Smith and be

15   certain that Smith, a well-known racist, has kept his

16   racism under control.        He didn't.                 Smith -- they fired

17   someone -- Smith did -- did some terrible thing and got

18   rid of somebody for racist reasons.                       He tells his boss.

19   His boss knows it.     His boss does nothing about it.                       All

20   right?

21                 Is the boss violating Section VII?                     He -- he

22   had no reason for doing nothing about it.                       He himself

23   wasn't a racist.     It was just his job.                    But he didn't.

24   Is he -- is he violated Section VII?

25                 MR. JOSEFFER:          If I understand the hypo

 1   right, there's no question that the immediate supervisor

 2   and the employer -

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:            The immediate supervisor

 4   does.

 5                  MR. JOSEFFER:          But-for, but-for causation.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.     Now -

 7                  MR. JOSEFFER:          So it's just a supervisory

 8   hypo question?

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, yes, yes.    Okay.    So

10   there what we have is somebody is guilty under

11   Section VII.     Even though that individual did not

12   himself discriminate on the basis of race, it was

13   circumstances where the subordinate discriminated on the

14   basis of race.     All right?            And yet the -- there's no

15   doubt that m applies to that.                 M applies to that, I

16   imagine, unless you're going to start distinguishing

17   within Title VII, are you going to say m doesn't apply

18   to that.

19                  My question's going to be, if m applies to

20   that, then why doesn't it also apply here?                 Because you

21   see here, what you have is -- it's at one removed.                   It

22   is the individual who is retaliating been retaliated

23   against.   That individual did not discriminate on the

24   basis of race, nor did the individual in Farr read into

25   it, but the whole thing is based on race.

                                        25

 1                And if sometimes under Section VII

 2   simpliciter, people are guilty although the race

 3   motive -- the race involvement is one level down.                    Why

 4   wouldn't you -- that perhaps is too complicated a

 5   question, and if you only have five minutes left, so I

 6   will take your answer as being, "Judge, you better think

 7   this out on your own."

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                MR. JOSEFFER:          No, no, no.           No, no.

10   Hopefully, I'm keeping up with you.                    If not, just tell

11   me.

12                It seems to me that there were basically two

13   different parts to that.          One is, in terms of your main

14   hypo, your first hypo, I don't know that 2(m) even comes

15   into play because it sounds to me like the intermediate

16   supervisor is clearly liable under 2(a) under a but-for

17   theory.   And then you just get into a vicarious

18   liability question.     I don't think 2(a) gets into that.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            I would say you are better

20   off keeping your time.

21                MR. JOSEFFER:          I was going to say under 2(m)

22   though, I think the overriding point here is that if I

23   have two thoughts in my head, a bad one, but then I go

24   ahead and treat the person the same way I would have

25   anyhow, then I have done what under Title VII, generally

                                      26

 1   understood, I am supposed to do, which is I treat

 2   everyone equally regardless of the bad thought in my

 3   head.

 4                And at that point -- and that's why mixed

 5   motive claims really threaten to take the statute from

 6   one that ensures equal treatment to one that goes into,

 7   you know, thought control.

 8                Beyond that, I will take the advice and save

 9   my time for rebuttal.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Thank you, counsel.

11                Mr. Lauten.

12                ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. LAUTEN

13                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14                MR. LAUTEN:          Mr. Chief Justice, may it

15   please the Court:

16                It does not make any sense at all for

17   Congress to have created two causation standards under

18   the same statute in 1991 without saying anything about

19   it at all.   There are three good reasons why Congress

20   had not to amend e-3(a) in 1991.

21                The first is in 1964, that is when e-3(a)

22   was originally drafted.           It was part of the original

23   bill.   5 years later, in 1969 in Sullivan v. Little

24   Hunting Park, this Court held that 42 U.S.C. 1982

25   included retaliation.         So in 1981, Congress knew that

                                        27

 1   retaliation was encompassed within discrimination.

 2                  Point number 2 -

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why did they -- why did

 4   they include it in a separate section?                   If they knew

 5   that, why did they have a separate section on

 6   retaliation?

 7                  MR. LAUTEN:        Well, when Congress added e-2

 8   in, Justice Scalia, it supplemented the Act.                   It created

 9   a new provision altogether.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I understand that.      Why did

11   they do it if they knew it was already included?

12                  MR. LAUTEN:        Well, they didn't have to amend

13   e-3(a) because there were policy -- the Burlington

14   Northern case, for example, where this Court held that

15   retaliation is considerably broader, that provision,

16   where the Court held that retaliation in Burlington

17   actually went beyond conditions in the workplace.                   That

18   was the second reason.

19                  And the third reason is, imagine if they had

20   amended e-3(a) or if they had deleted or repealed it.

21   We would be here saying, well, why did they do that if

22   they had already knew in Sullivan since 1964, why would

23   they amend the Act?

24                  E-2(m) on its text applies to e-3(a).

25   Congress could have very well put an e-2(m) under this

                                        28

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   section.     It could have very well put an e-2(m), an

 2   individual's race, color, religion, sex, national

 3   origin.     But what it did is it said a complaining party

 4   must demonstrate, and then it lists those things.                      And

 5   then it says "for any employment practice."

 6                  E-3(a) specifically defines retaliation as

 7   an unlawful employment practice.                    So the text of e-2(m),

 8   which, again, was a new provision altogether -- Congress

 9   did not go in and amend e-2(a) through e-2(d) as it

10   easily could have done, but it created a new provision.

11                  The motivating factor -

12                  JUSTICE ALITO:            I take you back to your

13   opening statement that there is no reason why Congress

14   might have wanted to have a different standard for

15   substantive discrimination and retaliation.

16                  Would you disagree with the proposition that

17   the motivating factor analysis creates special problems

18   in the retaliation -- in the retaliation context?

19                  MR. LAUTEN:        Not at all, Your Honor, and

20   this is the reason, and this Court needs to keep this in

21   mind.     Motivating factor causation is not going away no

22   matter what this Court holds today.                      It's in e-2(m), it

23   is going to apply to substantive discrimination.                      With

24   respect to how it's submitted -

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, I know it's not going

                                        29

 1   to go away.     Let me give you this example, this

 2   hypothetical.     An employee thinks that he is about to be

 3   fired.     And let's -- let's suppose that the employer

 4   really has a good, nondiscriminatory reason for firing

 5   the employee.     On the eve of that the employee makes a

 6   spurious charge of discrimination and does it in a way

 7   to maximize the embarrassment to the employer.

 8                  Then the employer formally makes the

 9   decision to terminate the employee.                      And what the

10   employer says at that time is, we were going to fire so

11   and so anyway for all these other reasons, but now

12   because he has done this and really embarrassed us

13   publicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire

14   him.     Now, how does that work out under the motivating

15   factor analysis?

16                  MR. LAUTEN:        Very easily, because in that

17   situation the employer wouldn't even have to prove the

18   affirmative defense because the employee wouldn't be

19   able to prove a violation of the Act because it was a

20   spurious claim.     That's point number 1.                   Point number -

21                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Is that correct?         Can't

22   you -- can't you succeed on a retaliation claim if your

23   underlying substantive claim is invalid.

24                  MR. LAUTEN:        You cannot prevail on a

25   retaliation claim under e-2(m) without proving first a

                                        30

 1   violation of the Act, and that is the distinction

 2   Congress made in e-2(m) for Price Waterhouse, whereas

 3   Price Waterhouse held there was no violation as long as

 4   the affirmative defense was proven.                      What Congress did

 5   in 1991 was say once you prove a motivating factor and a

 6   violation of the Act, only then do you get to the

 7   affirmative defense.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, I really don't

 9   understand -- I didn't understand the law to be that.

10   You mean if an employee files a discrimination claim,

11   and then is fired -- let's assume there is no other

12   reason except retaliation; he's fired for filing that

13   claim -- he has to prove not only that he was fired in

14   retaliation for filing, but also that his claim was

15   valid?    Is that what you are saying the law is?

16                  MR. LAUTEN:        No, no, no, I'm not saying

17   that.    I'm not saying that.

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought that's what you

19   were saying.     I thought that's what Justice Alito's

20   question asked.

21                  MR. LAUTEN:        No.       What I'm saying is that

22   that -- and you can look at the jury instructions in

23   this case -- you would have to prove that the employer

24   acted in part to retaliate, and -- for the protected

25   activity.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            In his hypothetical, he

 2   did.    Justifiable retaliation, as far as I am concerned.

 3   I mean, the employer files a frivolous claim to

 4   embarrass the employer.          He can't erase that from his

 5   mind.    That's one of the reasons he fired this guy.               And

 6   you say:    Ooh, if that's one of the reasons, no matter

 7   how frivolous or anything else, he's liable under the

 8   law.

 9                 MR. LAUTEN:        Well, here's -- here's our

10   position, Justice Scalia.            Our position, number one, is

11   the Court doesn't even get to that issue because the

12   statute applies.    If e-2(m) applies, then motivating

13   factor causation applies.            If it doesn't apply, if the

14   Court rejects our statutory argument, then by default we

15   are under the Price Waterhouse framework and motivating

16   factor causation should apply.

17                 But to the policy question, Justice Alito -

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand that.

19   Do you understand that?

20                 MR. LAUTEN:        Substantive discrimination, the

21   teeth of the Act, relies on employees being able to

22   cooperate and be witnesses, that they have the guts to

23   come forward.    If you take that protection away, you are

24   taking the teeth out of Title VII.

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, no, I understand that.

                                       32

 1   And it's not a policy question.                It's a question of

 2   interpreting the statute.          But I understood your lead

 3   argument in favor of a particular interpretation of the

 4   statute to be it can't mean what the Petitioner wants it

 5   to mean, what the Petitioner says it means, because that

 6   would make no sense.

 7               And the point of my question was to explore

 8   the possibility that there might be a very good reason

 9   why Congress would want a different causation standard

10   for substantive discrimination and retaliation.

11               MR. LAUTEN:        There is nothing in the

12   legislative history in 1991 that supports that.                     In

13   fact, I would argue the contrary.                     When Congress passed

14   Section 101 in 1991, which is 42 U.S.C. 1981, in that

15   provision where it overruled Patterson v. McLean and the

16   Court held that retaliation was encompassed within the

17   substantive discrimination provision, which is what the

18   Court held in CBOCS v. Humphries, in the House bill that

19   accompanied the Act it said that Congress intended for

20   retaliation to apply to Section 101, but it's not in the

21   section at all that became 101 that was in CBOCS.

22               In Gomez-Perez v. Potter, as you well know,

23   this Court held the absence of retaliation provision

24   under the Federal sector provision did not undermine the

25   argument that retaliation was included, even though

                                     33

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Congress had a separate anti-retaliation provision in

 2   the private sector.      And there was a very good argument

 3   in the court of appeals, as you well know, that, hey, if

 4   Congress wanted an anti-retaliation provision, why

 5   wouldn't they have done so, they did it on the private

 6   part.

 7                 And there were arguments the other way, that

 8   there was already a civil service remedy in place.                        And

 9   this Court rejected that argument, relied on Sullivan,

10   Jackson v. Birmingham, and those trilogy of cases -

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Over a powerful

12   dissent.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I would just like to get to

14   what I think is one of their arguments and I'm having

15   some -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right?

16   And they say, read m.        M says race is a motivating

17   factor in an unfair employment situation.

18                 Now, we look to what the unfair employment

19   situation is at the beginning unfair employment

20   practice.    It is to dismiss a person because of race,

21   all right?    So obviously, it applies.                    Now we look to

22   the definition that we're at issue in here.                      It

23   says it's an unfair labor practice to dismiss a person

24   because of retaliation.          Now, retaliation for what?                 For

25   race, that's true.     But we're -- we couldn't care less

                                       34

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   about whether that race is part or a little bit or it's

 2   all -- it could even be totally unjustified.                       What we're

 3   interested in is the retaliation.                       So they say, you see,

 4   the words of (m) do not speak about race.                       They speak

 5   about retaliation.     They speak about race.                    So, whatever

 6   the policy reasons are, you can't do it any more than if

 7   you have a statute that refers to carrots and you try to

 8   put in a beet.    You just can't do it.

 9               Now, that's the answer -- I -- I would like

10   to hear an answer.

11               MR. LAUTEN:          Yes, sir, Your Honor.               I think

12   the point is that -- that complaining about race is race

13   discrimination.    The Court held that in Sullivan.

14   Complaining about gender discrimination is -- it's

15   gender discrimination, Jackson v. Birmingham.

16   Complaining about -

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              So you have to say

18   retribution for race is race.

19               MR. LAUTEN:          Retribution?

20               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes.

21               MR. LAUTEN:          Yes.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:              Now -- now, what I was

23   looking for, perhaps without success, is some other

24   example that has nothing to do with retribution, but

25   where that's clearly so.           That's why the example came

                                       35

 1   into my mind that it is possible that you could, under

 2   the basic unfair employment section, find a person

 3   liable of race discrimination even though that person

 4   himself was not motivated by race, but perhaps had an

 5   obligation to report a race discrimination, which he

 6   failed to do because he wanted to go to the racetrack.

 7   You see?

 8               I'm looking for some other -- is there any

 9   other example in the history of these statutes where

10   we've said, you, Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, you are guilty

11   of race discrimination, even though that's because of

12   your responsibilities, because of what you did or didn't

13   do, it's not because you yourself held the motive, but

14   you -- you'd attribute the motive to them for reasons to

15   do with the statute.

16               Is there -- does that ring any bell at all?

17               MR. LAUTEN:        If -- if I understand your

18   question, what I would default to are the three or four

19   cases that I mentioned:        Sullivan,

20   Jackson v. Birmingham, CBOCS v. Humphries,

21   Gomez-Perez v. Potter, where this Court has consistently

22   held that complaining about discrimination is

23   intentional discrimination.            And I want to bring up -

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, I have looked -

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But -- but not under this

 1   statute.     What I'm concerned about is the text of this

 2   statute, which simply destroys your argument that

 3   there's no difference between retaliation and race

 4   discrimination.

 5                  Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(A) limits remedies

 6   where a defendant acted -- and this is a quote from the

 7   statute -- "for any reason other than discrimination

 8   on -- on account of race, color, religion, sex, or

 9   national origin, or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)

10   of this title."

11                  It -- it separates out 2000e-3(a),

12   retaliation, from the other aspects of race, color,

13   religion, sex, or national origin discrimination.

14                  MR. LAUTEN:        Justice Scalia, that's

15   incorrect, and this is why.               This is -- this is exactly

16   my point.     5(g)(2)(A), the text of that, that was

17   drafted by the 1964 Congress.                 That was a part of the

18   original bill.     5 years after that text came through,

19   this Court held in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that

20   retaliation encompasses discrimination.

21                  So why in 1991 would Congress go amend

22   5(g)(2)(A) from 1964, when it already knew.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Sir, the statute says what

24   it says.     It doesn't matter when Congress put it in

25   there.     The statute has to be read as a whole.              And if

                                        37

 1   you read it as a whole, this provision clearly separates

 2   out retaliation from race discrimination.

 3                MR. LAUTEN:        That -- that -

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Period.          I mean, it

 5   doesn't -- I don't have to psychoanalyze Congress and

 6   say did they really mean it, blah, blah, blah.                        It's

 7   there in the statute.       They didn't take it out.                   The

 8   statute still makes a clear distinction between the two.

 9                MR. LAUTEN:        Justice Scalia, respectfully,

10   that argument is directly contrary to

11   CBOCS v. Humphries, and it's directly contrary to

12   Gomez-Perez, where this Court held that Congress is

13   charged with knowing what this Court is deciding prior

14   to acting.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But it would have

16   been so easy.   There -- it's -- it's a set, race, color,

17   religion, sex or national origin.

18                And why would they leave it out?

19                MR. LAUTEN:        Why would they leave 5(g)(2)(A)

20   out?

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Why would they leave

22   "or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)"?

23                MR. LAUTEN:        Well, here's my response to

24   that.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I know your argument

                                      38

 1   is well, look, the Court's already said well, that's -

 2   that's included, but they've got two provisions fairly

 3   close to each other, and I don't know, if they're

 4   running through the usual list, why they wouldn't have

 5   just run through a list as it appeared in (g)(2)(A).

 6                MR. LAUTEN:          Well, this is really important.

 7   The word "retaliation" is nowhere in Title VII at all.

 8   That's point number 1.          Point number 2 is, if --

 9   Congress could have specifically put in there an

10   individual's race, color, religion, sex or national

11   origin, and clearly, that would have been anchored to

12   e-2(a) to e-2(d).

13                Instead, it created a different provision

14   altogether, e-2(m), and specifically said a complaining

15   party demonstrates, and it didn't say under this

16   section, and it defines any unlawful employment

17   practice.   Any.

18                And then if you look at e-3(a), it

19   specifically defines what we refer to as retaliation,

20   albeit Title VII doesn't use that word, as an unlawful

21   employment practice.

22                Now, I want to make this really clear,

23   because the Government is not making this -- this

24   argument.   If you reject our statutory argument, if you

25   reject that argument, and you find that e-2(m) does not

                                        39

 1   govern e-3(a), although we strongly urge the Court to -

 2   to embrace that argument, as the Solicitor General has

 3   done as well, but if you reject that argument by

 4   default, we're under Price Waterhouse -- juries have

 5   been instructed since jury trials started in 1991 under

 6   a Price Waterhouse framework in retaliation cases.

 7                 And this argument about unwarranted

 8   retaliation claims, this is the way we've been doing it

 9   since 1991.    This isn't something new.                   Juries have been

10   instructed this way since '91.                 So this idea about

11   creating new jurisprudence, this is a huge step

12   backwards from the framework we've been working under.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But your alternate

14   argument would -- would involve two standards, the one

15   that Congress provided for substantive discrimination,

16   the -- the improvement on -- on Price Waterhouse, and

17   then for retaliation, Price Waterhouse.

18                 MR. LAUTEN:        Just -

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And I started this -

20   this argument by asking, is there -- in the realm of

21   anti-discrimination law, is there any example where you

22   have the -- the substantive charge governed by one

23   standard and retaliation by another?

24                 MR. LAUTEN:        No, ma'am.             And -- and you

25   brought up a great point.            I am aware -- true to Justice

                                       40

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Kagan's point earlier -- I am aware of nowhere in

 2   American history of Congress ever creating two causation

 3   standards for retaliation and discrimination, especially

 4   under the same statute.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It might be a good idea,

 6   though, and -- and if so, Congress can do it, right?

 7                  MR. LAUTEN:        Well, that's -

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, the issue is

 9   whether this statute does it or not.                     The fact that

10   nobody has ever done it before, what difference does

11   that make?

12                  MR. LAUTEN:        Well, I think the Court has to

13   interpret the Act, but going back to Judge Ginsburg's -

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Do -- do you agree with

15   the Government's position that the limited affirmative

16   defense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say,

17   limited damages when there's multiple or mixed motives

18   would also apply to retaliation cases?

19                  MR. LAUTEN:        Absolutely.            If -- if this

20   Court embraces our argument, 5(g)(2)(B) would apply to

21   retaliation.     But I want to -- this is really important.

22   Judge Ginsburg brought up a great point.                     Justice

23   Ginsburg.    If you do the fallback to Price Waterhouse,

24   it doesn't create two causation standards.                     The juries

25   are going to be instructed the same way.

                                        41

 1                The only thing that's going to happen is if

 2   they prove the affirmative defense, it's a complete bar.

 3   Whereas, if you're under the e-2(m) amendment, it goes

 4   to the remedy, but that is an issue at the time of

 5   judgment.

 6                So no, there -- there won't be two causation

 7   standards under Title VII.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:             Price Waterhouse is a little

 9   different from subsection (m) though, isn't it?              You

10   have to have proof of -- you have to have direct

11   evidence of a substantial -- direct and substantial

12   evidence before you get into Price Waterhouse, right?

13   You don't need that under subsection (m).

14                MR. LAUTEN:         I don't have -- I don't have an

15   answer for that.   The answer is, I do not know.

16                My -- my belief is that e-2(m) and

17   5(g)(2)(B) -- the distinction e-2(m) makes is that it

18   makes it a violation of the Act to prove an illegal

19   motive, whereas in Price Waterhouse, you haven't

20   violated the Act at all until the affirmative defense is

21   disproved.

22                So that that is the distinction with e-2(m).

23   5(g)(2)(B) just goes to the remedy, whereas the

24   affirmative defense of Price Waterhouse was a complete

25   bar.   So my point is, is that even if the Court by

                                       42

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   default finds that e-2(m) does not apply, you are not

 2   exchanging or creating two standards.

 3                  All that is going to happen is that if the

 4   affirmative defense is prevailed upon under the default

 5   Price Waterhouse standard, it's a complete bar, whereas

 6   5(g)(2)(B) limits the remedies.                   That's the

 7   only distinction.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Isn't it the case that

 9   Justice O'Connor's opinion in Price Waterhouse required

10   direct evidence and substantial evidence before there

11   was a shift in the burden of proof.

12                  MR. LAUTEN:        I think judge -- I think

13   Justice O'Connor in her concurrence did say direct

14   evidence under Price Waterhouse, albeit six judges

15   agreed in 1989 that motivating factor causation applies.

16                  The -- I guess the last point that I want to

17   make is this Court really needs to consider this record

18   on its face.     Dr. Nassar, after going through months of

19   discrimination, finally reports that he's leaving.                       In

20   this record, Dr. Fitz admitted to Dr. Keiser.

21   Dr. Keiser, a white Baptist supervisor to Dr. Nassar,

22   goes and -- and reports it.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

24                  MR. LAUTEN:        Sorry.          Thank you for your

 2              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,

 3               FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 4                     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 5                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              Mr. Chief Justice, and

 6   may it please the Court:

 7                 I want to start, Justice Alito, with your

 8   question as to why it would make sense or why it might

 9   make sense for Congress to adopt a different causation

10   standard with respect to substantive discrimination on

11   the one hand and retaliation on the other.

12                 And what that question reveals is what,

13   Justice Kagan, you had mentioned.                       There is not a single

14   statute that Petitioner can point to and not a single

15   statute that I am aware of where Congress has ever

16   expressly adopted two different causation standards with

17   respect to intentional discrimination under the same

18   statute.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But I thought -- I thought

20   the thrust of Justice Alito's question was that

21   retaliation claims are -- are now quite common, and they

22   can almost be used as a defensive mechanism, as a

23   defense when you know you are about to be hired.                       And if

24   that's true, shouldn't we be very careful about the

25   causation standard?

                                       44

 1               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And on that -

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And so -- so that -- that

 3   was the thrust of -- of his question.

 4               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And -- and I want to

 5   address that because I don't think that's quite right.

 6   You can't just scream "Discrimination" when you're, you

 7   know, when the writing is on the wall and you know

 8   you're going to get fired.

 9               As this Court recognized in Clark County,

10   the courts of appeals have uniformly in opposition cases

11   required there to be a reasonable good faith belief that

12   the discrimination actually occurred.                   So if we are

13   talking about truly frivolous claims, I know I am going

14   to get fired, you know, I might as well say my boss is,

15   you know, sexually harassing me, that's not going to

16   happen; those cases are going to be weeded out.

17               The other point I would make -

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Where are they -

19   where are they going to be weeded out?                   On summary

20   judgment or on -- after trial?

21               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              At summary judgment.          And

22   they are weeded out at summary judgment.                   In cases -

23   there needs to be a protected activity, and it is not a

24   protected activity if your claim of discrimination -

25   you don't have a reasonable belief in that claim.

                                     45

 1   Again, you can't just scream "Discrimination" as they

 2   are kicking you out the door.

 3                 The other point I would -

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:            That's -- that's a fair

 5   point, but it's, like, if we change it a little bit so

 6   that it's -- it's not frivolous, but it is clearly

 7   groundless once its examined, then you still have the

 8   problem.

 9                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And then I don't think

10   it's as severe of a problem as Your Honor is suggesting,

11   for a couple of different reasons.                      Number one, if you

12   are positing a situation where there is clear evidence

13   that the employer would have made the same decision

14   regardless, that is a defense that is available to the

15   employer and there is no reason they couldn't seek

16   partial summary judgment with respect to that.                         That

17   severely limits the remedies that are available.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.          I don't

19   understand.    Say again?

20                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              In circumstances where

21   the employer would have made the same decision -

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

23                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              -- even without the

24   improper motive -

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.

                                       46

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:               -- that is a defense

 2   under (g)(2)(B), and it's something that the employer

 3   could certainly raise under partial summary judgment

 4   that would severely limit the remedies available.

 5                 The other point I would is it does still

 6   needs to be a motivating factor.                    It needs to actually

 7   play a role in the employment decision, and so that is

 8   the standard.     And it's a standard that, you know, that

 9   Congress has adopted clearly with respect to substantive

10   discrimination claims.

11                 And if I could turn now to the language of

12   the statute because that is our primary argument.                       If

13   you look at the language -

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Just before you do

15   that -

16                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:               Sure.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     -- because I

18   understood we are talking about what possible reason

19   there could be for drawing this distinction.                       It seems

20   to me that the protection against discrimination -

21   race, color, religion, sex -- that sets forth the basic

22   principle of -- of fair and equal treatment.

23                 The anti-retaliation provision is more

24   functional.     The way you protect against that

25   discrimination is you make sure people don't retaliate

                                        47

 1   when they complain about it.                Now that seems to me to be

 2   an order of -- of hierarchy, removed from the basic

 3   principle.     So perhaps you would have a different

 4   standard of causation when you deal with that.

 5                  MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And I don't think it is,

 6   for the reasons that this Court talked about in

 7   Burlington Northern and in Thompson and in Crawford.

 8   And what the Court said in those cases is that the two

 9   are linked together.        You do need to have robust

10   retaliation protections in order to ensure that that

11   primary purpose, that discrimination, is outside of the

12   workplace.     And so if employees are worried or afraid to

13   come forward and report discrimination, the

14   discrimination is going to persist.                       It's not going to

15   be remedied.

16                  And so the two are linked together and it

17   makes sense to have the same -

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    That -- I think that

19   was my point, that they are linked together but they are

20   at different levels.        I mean, the -- you protect against

21   retaliation so that the protection against race, color,

22   national origin can be vindicated.

23                  MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And I -- I agree with

24   Your Honor.     I think you -- that is the reason you

25   protect against retaliation.                And in order to have

                                        48

 1   sufficient protections so that interest can be

 2   vindicated, individual employees need to feel

 3   comfortable coming forward.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:            The problem is -

 5                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And you have a -

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:            The problem is this:       It's

 7   one thing to say, and it's a good thing to say to

 8   employers:   When you are making employment decisions,

 9   you take race out of your mind, take gender out of your

10   mind, take national origin out of your mind.                  It's not

11   something you can even think about.

12                But when you are talking about retaliation,

13   when you are talking about an employer who has been,

14   perhaps publicly, charged with discrimination and the

15   employer knows that the charge is not a good charge,

16   it's pretty -- it's very, very difficult to say to that

17   employer and very difficult for the employer to say:

18   I'm going to take this completely out of my mind.

19                I'm not even going to think about the fact

20   that I am -- have been wrongfully charged with

21   discrimination.   Isn't that a real difference?

22                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              I don't think it is and I

23   think it's significant if we are talking about

24   distinguishing between retaliation --                  It's significant

25   that Congress in a number of whistleblower statutes, so

                                      49

 1   specifically retaliation statutes, has adopted a

 2   contributing factor, a motivating factor standard, and

 3   in fact has adopted a same-decision defense where you

 4   need clear and convincing evidence.                    So I think

 5   Congress's judgment is that that distinction is not one

 6   that should be made, that it is -

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you talk about

 8   Congress as though it's a continuing body out there, the

 9   same people, and would the same people that did this do

10   that.   They are not the same people.                   I don't know what

11   Congress it was that passed this particular act versus

12   other antidiscrimination acts.                Some of them may have

13   been Democratic Congresses and others may have been

14   Republican Congresses.

15                To -- to assume that there is one Congress

16   out there that -- that has to operate logically in all

17   these areas, it seems to me unrealistic.                    And -- and the

18   best thing we can be guided by is simply the text that

19   Congress adopted, however the makeup of that Congress

20   happened to be.

21                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              And thank you,

22   Justice Scalia.   I am actually happy to turn to the

23   text.   I think it's important to look at the language of

24   Subsection (m) and it's on page 15a of our brief.                    And

25   if you follow that language, it starts off very plainly

                                      50

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   saying as "Except as otherwise provided in Subchapter

 2   (m), unlawful employment practice is established."                     This

 3   is a means of proving an unlawful employment practice.

 4                 And we know when you look at 3a, which is on

 5   page 17a of our brief, that retaliation is an unlawful

 6   employment practice.       Congress used that phrase

 7   "unlawful employment practice" in Subsection (m).                     It's

 8   an unadorned phrase.       It didn't limit it.                It didn't say

 9   "under this section"; it didn't say "under Section

10   2000e-2(a).    It said "unlawful employment practice."

11                 And if you continue on:                   "When the

12   complaining party demonstrates that race, color,

13   religion, sex or national origin was a motivating

14   factor."

15                 And we know under this Court's cases under

16   Gomez-Perez, under CBOCS, under Jackson and Sullivan

17   that race is a motivating factor in an employment

18   decision that is based on retaliation when you've

19   complained about race discrimination.

20                 And so the language of (m), the plain

21   language, clearly encompasses the retaliation claims in

22   Title VII.    And so the only argument, I believe, that

23   Petitioner is making is that there are things elsewhere

24   in the statute that might make you think otherwise here.

25   And we would argue that none of them -

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but under -- under

 2   that analysis, you don't need the final clause on page

 3   17a of your brief of 3, "because he has opposed."                  Race

 4   is enough.

 5                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:              I think that defines what

 6   the protected activity is.             I don't think it is any

 7   different than in Jackson or Gomez-Perez.               In those

 8   cases, it was a general discrimination provision, but

 9   once retaliation claims are recognized, there -- there

10   still actually needs to be protected activity.               There

11   has to be opposition, there has to be participation of

12   some sort.   And so I don't think it's any different in

13   that respect.

14                Justice Scalia, you were talking about

15   g-2(a), and if I could just take a moment on that,

16   because that is one of the arguments that Petitioner is

17   making.   My colleague made the point that it was adopted

18   by the 1964 Congress; it was adopted before Sullivan.

19   And so if I could focus on the 1991 Congress that

20   enacted both subsection (m) and subsection g-2(b), that

21   Congress was acting in light of Sullivan.               And we know

22   it was legislating with full knowledge of Sullivan,

23   because that's exactly what this Court said in CBOCS.

24                CBOCS involved Section 101, rather, of the

25   1991 Act; this involves Section 107 of the 1991 Act.

                                      52

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                So we know that when Congress was writing

 2   (m) and when it was writing g-2(b), it knew, because of

 3   Sullivan, that it didn't need extra words.                It didn't

 4   need redundant words.        It didn't have to say under

 5   Section 2000e-2 and Section 2000e-3; it could simply say

 6   exactly what it said in (m), and that would do the

 7   trick.   And it's a common rule of statutory

 8   interpretation that you don't add extra words if you

 9   don't need them.   And so what Congress did in (m) is it

10   adopted exactly what words it needed to effectuate its

11   purpose, which is to have one causation standard, a

12   motivating factor standard available with respect to all

13   intentional discrimination claims -

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             But the maxim that you

15   don't add words where you don't need them doesn't -

16   doesn't help your case.          It hurts your case, because in

17   the other provision that was carried over from the prior

18   law, you -- you were making a nullity of the -- the

19   addition after referring to discrimination on the basis

20   of race, of, you know, retaliation.

21                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:               Your Honor, may I?   To

22   answer that question, it's important -- what happened in

23   1991, Congress didn't add that language, it didn't amend

24   that language; it simply didn't delete it.                And I think

25   it's completely reasonable when Congress is faced with a

                                       53

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   choice of deleting language that had been there for

 2   25 years that wasn't a problem, it's just at worst was

 3   redundant, chose to leave it in place lest any negative

 4   inference arise from the deletion, and simply legislate

 5   in subsection (m), in g-2(b), based on the new

 6   understanding that the Court adopted in Sullivan.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Thank you, counsel.

 8                Mr. Joseffer, you have three minutes

 9   remaining.

10            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL L. JOSEFFER

11                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                MR. JOSEFFER:          Thank you.             This case seems

13   to boil down to two very simple legislative drafting

14   rules or interpretive principles.                      The first is, from

15   Gross, we know that Congress doesn't relieve the

16   plaintiff of the traditional burden of proof unless it

17   specifically indicates so.             And so then we talk to

18   subsection (m) where the relevant bases are the litany

19   of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin.

20                So the second interpretive principle is,

21   then, does that litany here encompass, you know,

22   complaining about unlawful conduct and participating in

23   an investigation, which are the protected conduct for

24   purposes of retaliation.          That principle comes straight

25   out of Jackson and Gomez-Perez, that when Congress

                                      54

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   broadly refers to discrimination on the basis of race in

 2   the statute without greater specificity, the Court will

 3   read retaliation in.

 4               When Congress breaks it out, the surplusage

 5   canon -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, I really

 6   didn't understand why they were talking about that -

 7   and also the general canon is the same canon, which is,

 8   put differently, is that specific provisions, you know,

 9   control over general ones, they're not subsumed within

10   them.

11               That tells us that when Congress is speaking

12   more specifically, it's speaking more specifically.

13   Here, that tells Congress very clearly how to amend

14   these statutes when it wishes to, which it does all the

15   time, and how the courts -- and how lower courts should

16   construe them.

17               In addition, Title VII, as a whole, is

18   especially clear, because the same subsection 2 within

19   Title VII, when it wants to refer to all types of

20   employment discrimination, it will say "a claim of

21   employment discrimination."            And by the way, the 1991

22   Congress put that provision in there.                 So this Congress

23   knew how to say "any claim of employment

24   discrimination," as it did so in subsection (n), which

25   comes right after this one.

                                     55

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               Congress will also say "an unlawful

 2   employment practice" when it's referring to all of them,

 3   but when it wants to specifically refer to one subset or

 4   another, it does so.     That's a clear, logical, coherent

 5   reading of the statute as a whole that every court of

 6   appeals to consider the question has adopted.

 7               They're asking you to read various statutory

 8   provisions to be surplusage, and there's simply no

 9   reason to do so, especially because, looking just at

10   1991, Congress at that point was not saying, oh, in

11   light of Jackson, we can now just speak more generally.

12   Because it, specifically in 1991, cross-referenced the

13   anti-retaliation provision of Title VII when it wanted

14   to, and it specifically used broader phrases like "a

15   claim of employment discrimination" when it wanted to.

16               And especially since the whole point of

17   Gross, or much of the point of Gross was to replace a -

18   a totally unworkable and confusing regime with something

19   that is clear and straightforward, you've done that.

20   And the question now is whether to retreat back into a

21   jurisprudential morass where, within the very same

22   statute, the drafting rules this Court has otherwise

23   articulated, no longer apply.

24               The final point I'd make is that, yeah,

25   there's this question about are -- are we treating, you

                                     56

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   know, retaliation and -- and substantive discrimination

 2   differently within one statute, and the answer is, well,

 3   yes, as Congress did.      The other way of looking at it is

 4   they want to treat retaliation differently in this

 5   statute than it's treated in every other statute.                    You

 6   can -- you can point to similar anomalies across the

 7   board, the reason being that Congress has chosen to have

 8   two different sections within this area.                    And -

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

10               The case is submitted.
