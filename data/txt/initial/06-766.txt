 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first today in Case 06-766, New York State Board of

 5   Elections v. Torres.

 6                 Mr. Olson.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON.

 8                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE

 9                     BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.

10                 MR. OLSON:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                 For 10 years, New York relied on political

13   party primaries to nominate general election candidates

14   for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged

15   qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive,

16   and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial

17   candidates.

18                 So the legislature substituted an indirect

19   party primary system at which delegates are elected who,

20   in turn, select general election candidates at political

21   party conventions.

22                 The Second Circuit concluded that the

23   delegate convention statutes enabled political parties

24   to exercise too much influence at the expense of the

25   insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and


                                          3

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional

 2   and reinstated the discredited primary process.

 3                 The issue in this case is whether the

 4   delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional

 5   because it allows party leaders to defeat the

 6   aspirations of party insurgents.

 7                 States have broad, as this case has

 8   repeatedly held -- broad constitutional latitude to

 9   prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections,

10   particularly elections for State office.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Just focus on, if you

12   would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates.

13                 Now, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical

14   case -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that

15   ballot.    You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30

16   days.     Would there be a constitutional issue raised by

17   that situation?

18                 MR. OLSON:       Well, in the first place, as you

19   know, Justice Kennedy, that -- that is not the case

20   here.     It takes 500 signatures --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            A hypothetical case.

22                 MR. OLSON:       If it were an impossible burden

23   to get on the ballot, I still don't think that First

24   Amendment associational rights would be involved.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What about Kusper, the


                                          4

 1   Kusper case?

 2               MR. OLSON:         I don't think the Kusper case

 3   goes that far, Justice Kennedy.                I think that, as the

 4   cases of this Court --

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I think we have made it

 6   very clear that if you're going to use a primary system,

 7   you can't have such burdensome registration requirements

 8   that the primary system is not, to all intents and

 9   purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who

10   wish to participate.

11               MR. OLSON:         I think that the other factor

12   that is involved here is that, provided that there is

13   reasonable access to the general election, which is

14   another factor in this case, then the constitutional

15   rights to associate are satisfied.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So you think that in

17   Kusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a

18   general election, you can structure and stifle the

19   primary any way --

20               MR. OLSON:         Well, I think that --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I'm just looking at the

22   principle here, and it may be that you'll say that

23   there's no burden here, et cetera.                   But I just want to

24   know:   Isn't there a constitutional principle that we

25   are entitled and we must look at the fairness of the


                                          5

 1   primary system insofar as participation of the voters?

 2               MR. OLSON:         I think that the case that maybe

 3   best answers that is the Munro case, in which the State

 4   of Washington's practice -- and there was a different

 5   practice of the State of Washington before this Court

 6   earlier this week.      But at that point in time the

 7   process was that there was an open blanket primary,

 8   which was not held unconstitutional at that point, where

 9   the major candidates -- the one and two positions of the

10   major candidates of each of the political parties would

11   get on the ballot, and then the Socialist Party was

12   complaining because it took 1 percent of the votes of

13   the primary process to get on the general election

14   ballot.

15               This Court held that that -- that that was

16   not an impossible burden, and that -- the principle from

17   that case and the other cases, the American political --

18   American Party of Texas v. White and so forth, the

19   Court's jurisprudence has held that, as long as there is

20   reasonable access for a candidate or a political party

21   to the general election process, then it does not have

22   to be provided in that level in the primary.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Is it right to

24   regard the election of delegates here as a primary

25   election?

 1                 My understanding, of course, is that that

 2   simply elects -- it doesn't get you on the ballot.                  It

 3   elects delegates who then exercise the choice.               Do you

 4   think our primary election cases are transferable to

 5   this situation?

 6                 MR. OLSON:       Well, I think there are two

 7   answers to that.     Your primary election cases talk in

 8   terms of, the ones that have been mentioned in the

 9   briefs here, talk particularly in terms of protection

10   under the Equal Protection Clause.

11                 This is --       it's called a primary, but it's

12   an election of delegates by party members that -- and

13   then, when those delegates get together, they go to the

14   convention.     So I'm not sure that the nomenclature makes

15   so much difference as this is a process that the State

16   has allowed the party to implement to choose its

17   leadership.     The Court has repeatedly held that there is

18   no point in the process --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             The State has not allowed

20   it.     The State has required it, no?

21                 MR. OLSON:       Yes, the State requires it, but

22   it --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Although if we -- if we

24   hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I

25   suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State


                                          7

 1   merely to allow it, wouldn't it?                So that this manner of

 2   selecting judges in any other State, if it has been

 3   voluntarily adopted by the party, would be

 4   unconstitutional?

 5                MR. OLSON:       That's the principle that the

 6   Respondents in the Second Circuit advance.                  It would

 7   strike down the conventions, because conventions are, by

 8   definition, selections of individuals to represent the

 9   broader constituency at a subsequent --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Just to make it clear, is

11   it your position that, with reference to this election

12   for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it

13   chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on

14   the ballot as a proposed delegate?

15                MR. OLSON:       I think, Justice Kennedy, as

16   long as the system in the State provides a reasonable

17   access to candidates and political parties to the

18   election process, that there is not a First Amendment

19   right with respect to the primary process or the

20   preliminary process, which in this case includes both

21   the so-called delegate selection primary --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:             What if --      what if it were

23   the parties that objected to this and not some

24   individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in

25   the party?   What if the parties said, we don't want to

 1   select our candidates this way?              Is it clear that the

 2   State could impose it upon them?

 3               MR. OLSON:       It's clear the State has the

 4   right, and this Court has said so in the American Party

 5   of Texas v. White, that the State can require either a

 6   primary election or a convention.                The Court

 7   specifically addressed that.            In fact, what the Court

 8   said:   It is too plain for argument that a State may

 9   insist that intraparty competition be settled by primary

10   or convention.   That's the holding of that Court --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That convention --

12   conventions can come in all sizes and shapes.                The

13   argument here is that this system shuts out

14   rank-and-file party members and gives the total control

15   to the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the

16   primary or selection of delegates, but it's really a

17   sham because nobody is going to run for that except the

18   party faithful, someone picked by the party boss.

19                    So the argument on the other side is

20   that this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to

21   the party leaders choose the candidates.

22               MR. OLSON:       Well, what this Court has said

23   in the California Republican Party v. Jones case, a cite

24   quoting the Eu case, the Eu case that the Court had

25   decided before, is that the political party has the


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   right to select its leadership, to select its nominating

 2   process, to select its candidates, and to exclude

 3   members.   So, Justice Ginsburg, the party has the right,

 4   even arbitrarily, as long as the Fourteenth Amendment is

 5   not violated in an election context, to exclude members

 6   of its party.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, the State can

 8   restrict that right if it wants to.                      The State can

 9   require the party to select its candidates by -- by

10   primary.

11                 MR. OLSON:      By primary or -- or by

12   convention.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Or by convention.

14                 MR. OLSON:      Right.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But if the State wants to

16   do it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by

17   smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to

18   say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.

19                 MR. OLSON:      It can, Justice Scalia, but the

20   State must respect the rights of the political parties

21   in determining who their leaders and candidates must be.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, but that -- but

23   that's not the issue here.           The State and the party are

24   in agreement.

25                 MR. OLSON:      Yes.       Yes.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The State is not trying to

 2   coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't

 3   want to do.

 4                 MR. OLSON:      Yes, I totally agree with you.

 5   But I'm answering hypothetical questions with respect to

 6   something else.    What this Court has said, that this

 7   Court vigorously protects the special place the First

 8   Amendment reserves for the protection by which a party,

 9   political party, selects a standard-bearer.                Selecting a

10   candidate is selecting the person that will communicate

11   the party's interests --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So the party is -- you're

13   identifying the party with the party leader because the

14   argument comes down to this is not the rank and file

15   that's making this election; this is the party leader;

16   and the party might like that or the leadership might

17   like that, but the rank and file might not, and the

18   argument is that they have rights of association, too.

19                 MR. OLSON:      Well, they have rights of

20   association, but they have -- they have associated in a

21   political party which has elected leadership which makes

22   decisions, Justice Ginsburg.

23                 They do not have a right to belong to the

24   Democratic Party or the Republican Party.                The rank and

25   file, so forth -- the definition of "insurgent," which

 1   is at the other side of the table here, are people that

 2   are rebelling against the duly elected leadership of the

 3   political party.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But if there is a

 5   State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that

 6   the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to

 7   participation in that primary.               I think that's a given,

 8   it seems to me.    Now, tell me if I'm wrong --

 9              MR. OLSON:         I may be --

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And then we can argue

11   about whether the burden is too great here, which it may

12   not be.

13              MR. OLSON:         Let me say, Justice Kennedy,

14   that I may be wrong in terms of what this Court's

15   decisions stand for with respect to ultimately allowing,

16   as far as associational rights are concerned,

17   individuals and parties access to the total electorate.

18   But even if your premise is correct that there must be

19   an open access in a reasonable way to either the -- to

20   both the primary and the general election, then this

21   process is reasonable.        It's not unreasonably difficult

22   for a person to participate.

23              Let me say -- let me enumerate the ways.               An

24   individual, a rank-and-file member, can campaign and

25   vote for delegates.      An individual might become a

 1   delegate himself by -- or herself, by getting 500 names

 2   on a signature, and that's far below what this Court has

 3   indicated before was -- was an acceptable level of

 4   requirement of access to the ballot.                      An individual can

 5   attempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade

 6   the delegates, can -- the individual can form or switch

 7   parties.

 8                 In this case the Respondent Lopez Torres,

 9   actually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the

10   general election for supreme court justice of the

11   Working Families Party, and she did that without giving

12   up her registration and membership in the Democratic

13   Party.     She was in that election and she lost.

14   Finally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to

15   secure the nomination of that political party, she could

16   run in the general election.              There's access to -- it

17   takes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent

18   body in the general election.

19                 So there is way after way after way for

20   individuals in New York to participate in the election

21   process.

22                 So in answer to your question,

23   Justice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of

24   the principle with respect to access to both the primary

25   and the general election is -- is the law of this Court,

 1   then that access exists here.

 2              But I come back to the point that political

 3   parties have the greatest possible latitude -- yes,

 4   Justice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain

 5   restrictions with respect to how the nominee of the

 6   party gets selected.     But the Court has also said that

 7   when the party is in that process, its powers and rights

 8   and First Amendment freedoms to elect the

 9   standard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at

10   their apogee, because the person selected as a

11   candidate, whether that person might be the most

12   favorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected

13   leadership of the political party might decide, well,

14   that person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court

15   justice even --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Have we -- have we imposed

17   any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely

18   upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State?

19   That is to say, have we held that the Constitution

20   itself imposes certain restrictions?

21              MR. OLSON:       Except in the context of

22   analyzing what State requirements have been?

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.      I want a case where

24   the State did not impose the restriction and it was up

25   to us to decide whether the State could do that or not,


                                      14

 1   but rather the State said the party can do whatever it

 2   wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself

 3   chose under no compulsion from the State --

 4                MR. OLSON:      Aside --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- on the basis of some

 6   constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection

 7   Clause --

 8                MR. OLSON:      Yes.       The only cases --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- or the Thirteenth

10   amendment.

11                MR. OLSON:      The only cases that I would

12   submit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would

13   be Equal Protection Clause cases, because the --

14   these -- the political party is a group of people that

15   decide to form together because of common beliefs.            In

16   the -- that is the maximum freedom that we allow for

17   associations.

18                With all the business about smoke-filled

19   rooms and things like that, people have the right to

20   decide, make decisions --

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you think a political

22   party could say, you can't vote in our primary unless

23   you've been a member of our party for 4 years?

24                MR. OLSON:      Yes, Justice Kennedy.       I -- I

25   don't -- in an association --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            This would be a

 2   State-mandated party primary for --

 3                MR. OLSON:       Well, a party might --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- election --

 5                MR. OLSON:       A party would -- there's two

 6   questions there.    If the party wants to have a 4-year

 7   requirement before you can be a part of that

 8   association, I can't understand what the First Amendment

 9   associational right would be.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, what about --

11                MR. OLSON:       If the State imposed that, the

12   party could say, well, that's unreasonable; we want to

13   open --    in fact, the Court decided this by saying that

14   the --- the party who wanted to could allow independents

15   to vote.

16                If I might, Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve

17   --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Didn't Justice Kennedy

19   asked if the Kusper case was correctly decided?

20                MR. OLSON:       Well, I'm not -- I think I tried

21   to answer that the best I could by saying that I think

22   the import of the cases, without getting into the

23   specifics of that, are that if you have a reasonable

24   access by individuals or political parties to the

25   electoral process, that satisfies the Constitution.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 2   Mr. Olson.

 3                 Mr. Rossman.

 4                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. ROSSMAN

 5                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK COUNTY

 6                 DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE ET AL.

 7                 MR. ROSSMAN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9                 I'd like to begin by responding to

10   Justice Kennedy's question regarding the election of

11   delegates and fairness for voters.                   There are two

12   responses:     In this case that I have -- this case, there

13   was conceded below that the requirement for delegates of

14   getting only 500 signatures was no barrier at all.

15                 And secondly, I would say that in

16   considering that question, Justice Kennedy, the

17   important thing is to consider what is the intended role

18   that the State gives to the participants in this

19   process?     And what the role here is that individual

20   voters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates

21   who are to represent their interests at the convention.

22   As Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to

23   pull a lever for the delegate that shares their values

24   and their preferences, their right of suffrage is

25   satisfied.


                                         17
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              What they do not have, what Respondents and

 2   what the lower courts would like to have exist but

 3   doesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution,

 4   is the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote

 5   directly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and

 6   that's the difference between a delegate-based

 7   convention and a primary.

 8              If we agree, and I think the Court would

 9   agree, that there is no right to a primary -- that's

10   something, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there

11   is no constitutional right to a primary -- then there is

12   no State requirement that there be a direct opportunity

13   for association between voter and candidate at the

14   nomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and

15   constitutional for that association to be between voter

16   and delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally-

17   elected delegates to advance their interest in the

18   convention process.

19              That's the difference between a convention

20   and a primary.   We think it's a critical one here.               So

21   the cases --

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In practice, how many

23   people other than the slate selected by the party

24   leaders run in New York for this delegate position?

25              MR. ROSSMAN:          In New York City, the evidence


                                       18
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   below was that approximately 12 to 13 percent of

 2   delegate slates are contested.             What we suggest is that

 3   the availability of a contest is the key.              It's not the

 4   frequency of the contest, because there's also evidence

 5   in the record that for open primaries for civil court,

 6   which is the closest parallel, that those are only

 7   contested 28 percent of the time.

 8              So the fact that an election is not

 9   contested, that there may be voter apathy out there,

10   that there may be party unity that causes people to

11   rally behind the parties and their leadership, is not a

12   constitutional problem.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:            The theory of this, I take

14   it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention

15   delegates, and those convention delegates choose the

16   official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party.             So that

17   nominee goes on to the final ballot.

18              MR. ROSSMAN:         Correct.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, what then of the fact

20   that the convention delegates when they meet won't let

21   people who would like the position of the judge appear

22   before them?

23              MR. ROSSMAN:         Well, that is not the general

24   case in the State of New York.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:            It's not?


                                      19
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. ROSSMAN:         But even if it is, the

 2   important thing is not that individual candidates appear

 3   to politic before the delegates, it's that delegates

 4   have the freedom under the statute to vote for whatever

 5   candidate they like.      There's evidence that there's

 6   legislative intent that, in fact, candidates not appear

 7   at the convention because it would be unseemly for them

 8   to do so.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well then, how are the

10   delegates to find out the qualifications?               In other

11   words, if that's the intent of this statute, then you

12   have a statute that's designed on the one hand to have

13   convention delegates who will choose, and on the other

14   hand to prevent the convention delegates from finding

15   out the qualifications of the different applicants, in

16   which case it would seem to be a statute that would give

17   the actual power of selection to the leader or the

18   chairman -- I forget the title -- of the Democratic

19   Party.   And I don't know about the constitutionality of

20   that or not.   In other words, go ahead.

21               MR. ROSSMAN:         Let me respond to the most

22   difficult part of your question first, which is the

23   constitutionality of the party leader selecting a

24   candidate we think is not troublesome at all.               In fact,

25   there are many instances in New York and in other States


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   where the political leaders, through their structure, do

 2   pick the candidates, for example in the case of vacancy

 3   election, which this Court upheld as constitutional in

 4   the Rodriquez case.

 5                But the question that I think that you're

 6   asking is, is there some denial of voter or delegate

 7   education, and does that pose a constitutional problem?

 8   We have here a bare statutory framework and the

 9   statutory framework does not in any way, shape, or form

10   preclude the ability of delegates to become educated

11   about the candidates.      Within that bare statutory

12   framework.   The parties themselves, through what we

13   contend is core associational activity protected by the

14   First Amendment, participate in their own way of

15   choosing in educating delegates and in putting forth the

16   candidacies of judicial -- potential judicial nominees.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I suppose that the

18   State can make the judgment that it's more likely that

19   the delegates would be informed about the qualifications

20   of candidates for judgeship than voters?

21                MR. ROSSMAN:        In fact, we think that is the

22   very judgment that the State has made here.                 And when,

23   as Mr. Olson said, when it went from a primary to a

24   convention process, the idea behind it in part was that

25   the delegates could be more educated, would be expected


                                       21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to be more educated than rank-and-file voters would be

 2   about judges.    And the evidence in this case is that

 3   rank-and-file voters are not educated hardly at all

 4   about the judge candidates that they select.                    So we

 5   think this is clearly a legislative sensible policy

 6   choice to put the selection process in the hands of

 7   those who have the motivation and the opportunity to

 8   become more educated about those that they're selecting.

 9               Now, one thing that needs to be recalled in

10   this process is, of course, it is not merely a State-run

11   election.   As -- as the Court observed in Jones, it is a

12   party affair, too.      So there are core First Amendment

13   rights of the parties themselves that attach.

14               And the question -- I think in response to

15   Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there's

16   confusion between the party leaders and the parties, it

17   is our reading of the Eu, Tashjian and Jones cases that

18   the Court has recognized that parties have a structure

19   and have the core constitutional right to create their

20   own structure, and their leadership can make choices for

21   the parties.    So they can choose to endorse candidates,

22   for example.    They can choose to associate or not

23   associate with particular individuals.                    And that's a

24   choice that's made here by duly elected leaders of the

25   parties.


                                         22

 1                 And if there's a problem with that, the

 2   remedy for that problem is in the political arena.                The

 3   remedy is for the rank-and-file voters to vote their

 4   party leaders out when they come up for election if they

 5   adopt a process that they don't like or they think

 6   squelches the input of the rank-and-file members.

 7                 So the reason that -- the reason why that's

 8   not happening here, we believe, could be attributable to

 9   one of two things.      It could be attributable to apathy,

10   which the Constitution does not have a prerogative to

11   stamp out, or it could be attributable to party unity

12   and the fact that leaders are sensitive to who will be

13   best to advance the interests of their rank-and-file

14   members.     But we don't think there's a constitutional

15   problem with that.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But if the autonomy of

17   the party and, let's say, the leader is the

18   justification for this, the party -- how -- how

19   autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you

20   want to be more democratic about how you choose your

21   candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this

22   system on you?

23                 MR. ROSSMAN:         Well, the only system that New

24   York is forcing is a bare framework for representative

25   democracy.     It's a convention.             It's no different than

 1   --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, the parties are not

 3   protesting in this case, are they?

 4               MR. ROSSMAN:          Absolutely not.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:             If and when that situation

 6   arises, I suppose we can -- we can decide it.                  But it's

 7   not here.   The parties are totally happy with this and

 8   would do it on their own.

 9               MR. ROSSMAN:          We absolutely agree.          The

10   parties intervened from the outset of this case, both

11   major parties, because they share the view that the

12   system is better than a primary would be, and they

13   believe that their right --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             In fact, it is probably

15   likely the parties got this system adopted by the New

16   York legislature.

17               MR. ROSSMAN:          Well, however the legislative

18   process has unfolded, in 1921, multiple times since, and

19   to the present when the legislature filed an amicus

20   brief with the Second Circuit, the legislature has

21   clearly been in support of this.                And we think it's

22   within -- it's a core State power, it's a sensible

23   legislative choice that they have made.                  It' ss within

24   the contours of American Party of Texas v. White, which

25   recognized, as Justice Scalia observed moments ago, that

 1   the State can choose to have primaries or conventions.

 2                 Where the State has chosen to have

 3   conventions, party rights attach to that.                     And the one

 4   thing that the lower court did that we urge the Court to

 5   consider to be quite inappropriate was to apply strict

 6   scrutiny to what is routine core party associational

 7   activity.     Leaders developing candidacies, recommending

 8   candidates, endorsing candidates, and fielding delegates

 9   who they think are loyal to the interests of the party,

10   that doesn't deserve strict scrutiny.                     At worst, we

11   think there's no burden here to the rank-and-file voters

12   to force them to participate in the party's own

13   convention.    But even if there were some burden, at

14   worst, we think that there are countervailing rights

15   here.   And where there are countervailing rights the

16   Court should prefer to the legislative expertise here,

17   and the expertise -- thank you, Your Honor.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

21                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK A.O. SCHWARZ, JR.

22                           ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

23                 MR. SCHWARZ:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24   please the Court:

 1   confirmed in great detail by the Second Circuit, found

 2   that there were severe burdens placed upon insurgents

 3   and placed upon party members who wished to band

 4   together to support a candidate.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What about the burden on a

 6   single delegate wanting to be on the ballot?                     I think

 7   that requires 500 votes, and there was no specific

 8   finding that that was burden, was there?                     Or am

 9   incorrect?

10                MR. SCHWARZ:        Two --there was no specific

11   finding that was a burden, you're correct.                     I have two

12   additional points to make.

13                First, if you look at John Dunne's amicus

14   brief, John Dunne was a Republican leader in the State

15   of New York.   He was chairman of the judiciary committee

16   for many years in the State Senate.                     And he on page 19

17   of his brief describes how it was impossible even for

18   him to get admitted as a delegate, and it wasn't

19   worthwhile to try and be a lone gadfly.

20                Secondly, the courts analyzed the burden in

21   terms of the difficulty of assembling and running a

22   slate of delegates, a slate that cut across the various

23   assembly districts, and the court found --

24                JUSTICE ALITO:         Assuming that the plaintiffs

25   have associational rights at stake here, isn't this a


                                       26

 1   case where there's a conflict between two associational

 2   -- two sets of rights of association?                    You have the

 3   party hierarchy who wants to, in your own words, fence

 4   out the insurgents.      That's a right not to associate.

 5   And then you have the insurgents who want to be fenced

 6   in?

 7                 MR. SCHWARZ:        Well, the --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Isn't that different from

 9   the cases that you rely on?

10                 MR. SCHWARZ:        I -- I think not, Your Honor,

11   because I think if you think about the question of do

12   the party leaders have the right to stifle the voices of

13   ordinary members, one should conclude no, and it's very

14   different from your decision in Jones.

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But that's charged language:

16   They have the right to stifle.

17                 MR. SCHWARZ:        Okay.

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:         The insurgents, do they not

19   -- does not the right of association include the right

20   not to associate?

21                 MR. SCHWARZ:        I think, Your Honor, the right

22   of association does not include the right to use an

23   election system imposed by the State which makes it

24   impossible.    That's where the burden comes from.                 It's

25   because the State has imposed this system on every


                                        27

 1   party.   So I do not think there is a countervailing

 2   right on the other side.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What are your -- what are

 4   you best cases for that proposition?

 5               MR. SCHWARZ:         In the -- I would say in the

 6   first place I'd have to start out by saying there's not

 7   the case on all fours like this.               The -- then I would

 8   say that's quite clear why that would be, because

 9   there's no system like this in the United States and

10   never has been.

11               The -- I guess I would say after that point,

12   that the cases -- first, there are principles in your

13   cases.   There's a principle being worried about the

14   effect of State laws serving to entrench power.              That's

15   a theme that runs through all your cases.

16               Secondly, there is in your cases the --

17   many, many cases that hold what's important is to make a

18   realistic assessment of how a statute actually works.

19               Now, having said those two points by way

20   of -- three points by way of preliminary, first, there's

21   nothing on all fours and really you wouldn't expect it,

22   then what are cases that I think are -- that bite in our

23   favor?   Well, there are principles in the cases.

24               I would start with Storer and Storer says in

25   assessing severe burden what you want to look at is the


                                       28
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- is the realistic effect of whether people have gotten

 2   on the ballot.    And Storer says if you find that happens

 3   rarely, while it's not conclusive, it's the -- it's

 4   indicative that there is a severe burden.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But Storer --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Isn't that a general

 7   election case?

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's a general election

 9   case, isn't it?

10                 MR. SCHWARZ:        Well, but the principles of

11   whether the election, general election cases and the

12   primary cases should apply, it seems to me are the same

13   principles.    The root principles that apply are the same

14   ones.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, let me ask you

16   about that.

17                 MR. SCHWARZ:        Please.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Let's suppose the

19   State doesn't think that direct voter election of judges

20   is a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some

21   insulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning

22   and raising money and all that; yet, at the same time

23   they want some participation by the voters in the

24   process.   Is there any way they can achieve that

25   objective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by


                                        29

 1   the voters but by a convention, and yet have some role

 2   by the voters?

 3               MR. SCHWARZ:         There absolutely is, Your

 4   Honor.   We do not claim here that any convention is

 5   inappropriate.   Conventions are appropriate.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, I'm just asking

 7   is there a way to have a convention with some role by

 8   the voters or the party --

 9               MR. SCHWARZ:         Yes, Your Honor, as long as

10   that convention does not set up severe barriers to

11   people competing; and I would say even if you look at

12   the Board of Elections' own --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, doesn't that

14   seem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for

15   voters, it can have a pure convention, that they're

16   penalized if they have some role for voters?

17               MR. SCHWARZ:         I wouldn't put it as being

18   penalized, Your Honor.       I think it is the --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Being found

20   unconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty.

21               (Laughter.)

22               MR. SCHWARZ:         But it's what we seek and we

23   think the courts below appropriately granted, Your

24   Honor.   The -- but it's not penalizing the State for

25   doing something; it's saying if do you this, and if you


                                       30

 1   severely burden, as after an extensive fact-finding

 2   hearing the court held the statutes do, then you have to

 3   show that there's a compelling justification.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Schwarz -- I'm sorry,

 5   go ahead.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            The, the problem that I

 7   have in the analogy you are drawing on the application

 8   of your principle based on the general election cases is

 9   this:     There is concededly -- and you mentioned this

10   earlier -- there is concededly no unreasonable barrier

11   to somebody who wants to become a delegate.                  He's got to

12   get 500 signature, but that can be done.                  The burden

13   that I understand that your clients are complaining

14   about is the, in effect, the burden of influencing the

15   ultimate decision-maker to decide to nominate that

16   person.

17                 And that burden is -- is focused on two

18   points:    number one, the entrenched power of the

19   political bosses; and number two, the difficulty --

20   well, I guess three points -- the difficulty of

21   fielding, for a dissident to field a whole slate of

22   candidates who in effect, once elected, would make the

23   nomination desired; or, three, the capacity of the

24   intending or the aspiring candidate to influence the

25   delegates directly once they're selected, because the


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   time is short.

 2              And those aren't -- those aren't, it seems

 3   to me, complaints about access to the electoral process.

 4   They're complaints about the capacity to influence those

 5   who are elected, who make the ultimate decision.               And

 6   that's the difficulty I have in the analogy that you are

 7   drawing or the parallel that you are making between the

 8   direct election cases and your claim here.               Could you

 9   comment on that?

10              MR. SCHWARZ:           Yeah.       I guess I want to make

11   two comments.    First, it seems to me the principles that

12   are in your direct election cases, and also primary

13   cases like Kusper and the Panish v. Lubin or Lubin v.

14   Panish, where the Court took the language in your

15   Williams case about you ought to be worried if there are

16   multiple parties competing, clamoring for a place on the

17   ballot, and said, well, that should also apply -- this

18   Court said that should also apply in a primary context

19   where there are multiple people seeking to -- to attain

20   a nomination.

21              Now, should it matter because here the

22   primary or the election -- it's really an election but

23   the State happens to call it a primary -- should it

24   matter that that is in the preliminary stage, in the

25   nomination stage?


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              I would suggest it should not.

 2              Now, I think your --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But it's still the case

 4   that at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is

 5   that the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively

 6   politic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting

 7   selected; and I don't see that as a -- as a direct

 8   ballot access claim.

 9              Let me put the question in another way:

10   Your -- your friend on the other side, Mr. Rossman, in

11   response to a question, said that if this election of

12   the judicial candidate for the party were made directly

13   by the political bosses, whatever their titles are, the

14   ones who are supposedly in control here, he would not

15   see any constitutional objection to that.

16              What if New York had a system that provided

17   precisely for that?     The political bosses, as I

18   understand it, get elected every 2 years and the State

19   law would provide that those party bosses, whatever

20   their title is, would in fact select the candidate.

21   Would that be unconstitutional?

22              MR. SCHWARZ:         I think I would like to draw a

23   distinction between the law as I think you've described

24   it and a different law that Justice Scalia described.           I

25   think the law that Justice Scalia described would be


                                      33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   constitutional.     If what the State did is to say, you

 2   the party decide on what to do, I think the State is

 3   then not putting a thumb on the scale; the State is not

 4   interfering with the disputes within the party.

 5                 However, on the statute that I think you

 6   described, Justice Souter, where the State says, we

 7   decree that for every party the leader shall make the

 8   decision, I think that would be unconstitutional because

 9   the State has no business intervening in the --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the party isn't

11   objecting.

12                 MR. SCHWARZ:         Well, Your Honor, I think

13   that's --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            The party -- the party

15   likes it.

16                 MR. SCHWARZ:         I'm sure the party likes it.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And you are the -- the

18   claim here:    These people are not, as I understand it,

19   bringing a case on behalf of rights of the party.

20   They're bringing a case based on a premise of a

21   principle of participation, which is theirs.

22                 And that's why, it seems to me, that the

23   hypo that I posed is not significantly different,

24   provided the parties aren't objecting, in which we have

25   a different case.


                                         34

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              But it seems to me that my hypo is not

 2   significantly different from the one that gave rise to

 3   the question that Mr. Rossman answered.

 4              MR. SCHWARZ:           Well, the -- first, on the

 5   consent of the party leaders, which is really what we

 6   have here, of course they are -- they like the system

 7   because the State system entrenches them.

 8              And -- and this Court --

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, the Federal system in

10   practice entrenches United States Senators.

11              I'm -- I'm not sure that, in terms of

12   political participation on the part of an intending or

13   an aspiring judge that the system that I suggested in

14   the hypo, in which the party bosses select the nominee,

15   is for constitutional purposes significantly different

16   from the Federal system for -- for picking district

17   judges.

18              MR. SCHWARZ:           Well, because the Federal

19   system provides that there shall not be elections.                  Here

20   elections --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Sure.       And in my hypo the

22   only election is the election for the party boss.

23              MR. SCHWARZ:           Well, I would still suggest,

24   Your Honor, that, as we see the case that would be

25   unconstitutional.    But our case is much stronger than


                                        35
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that because, in any event, there is here an election

 2   for delegates.

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       But isn't your

 4   argument still that, because there is a limitation on

 5   the participation of the intending judicial candidate,

 6   there is ultimately a constitutional problem?

 7                 So let me pose a different question to you,

 8   and this one is not hypothetical.                  The nub of your case

 9   is that the political bosses in effect are controlling

10   the process because they tell the delegates who to vote

11   for.     Does your -- does the intending judicial nominee

12   whom you represent have any difficulty in getting to the

13   political bosses and saying:              I want you to consider me?

14                 MR. SCHWARZ:         Yes.       They would not listen to

15   her, and they said:       We won't listen to you in this

16   particular case; we won't listen to you because you

17   declined to hire an unqualified person as your law

18   clerk.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Sure.       They -- for

20   political reasons, they're saying:                   We don't like you.

21   There are -- there are a lot of people who go to United

22   States Senators, and the United States Senators say:

23   Scram; we don't -- we don't like you; your politics

24   aren't good enough for us.

25                 And so I'm not saying that -- that -- on my


                                         36

 1   hypo the person who lobbies the bosses directly is --is

 2   claiming a right to success.              I think they're claiming a

 3   right to have a chance to influence the process.                    And

 4   why don't they have the chance by going to the boss?

 5                 MR. SCHWARZ:         Well, Your Honor, let me try

 6   two things.     First, that never has worked.               And it -- it

 7   has to be -- at least using the Storer analysis of what

 8   actually happens, the fact that never in the history of

 9   New York, not in the Republican Party, not in the

10   Democratic Party, not in New York City, not in upstate,

11   never has someone who was opposed by the party boss been

12   able to become a judge.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And I don't know of

14   any enemy of a United States -- go ahead.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The person wouldn't be

16   opposed if he approached the boss and the boss said:

17   Yeah.   Boy, I really like you.               That person would

18   automatically not be a rebel.               He'd be part of the

19   establishment.

20                 (Laughter.)

21                 MR. SCHWARZ:         But the -- you know, this

22   isn't an issue that divides by ideology.                  It's --

23   really, the question here is if you have a statute that

24   makes it difficult for the voters to participate, to

25   have a voice.    That's really the question.               And if I

 1   could use something that the Board of Elections' brief

 2   conceded in both their reply and their opening brief,

 3   they said a person -- they said that party members who

 4   wanted to attempt to assemble a slate to try to

 5   influence the decision at the convention would be "well

 6   served" -- that's their exact words -- to assemble and

 7   run a slate.    But the district court and the circuit

 8   court found that it was impossible -- severely

 9   burdensome, actually impossible -- for that burden to be

10   met.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask you this

12   question, Mr. Schwarz.        Supposing that the statute did

13   not contain the delegate-selection process and instead,

14   said:   Delegates shall be selected by the county

15   chairman in each county and by the organization.                        Would

16   it then be unconstitutional?

17                 MR. SCHWARZ:        If it said delegates will be

18   selected --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           By party officials.

20                 MR. SCHWARZ:        I'm not sure about that.                I'm

21   not -- I think that -- I'm not sure.                     I think it's

22   different than Justice Souter's hypothetical.

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           I'm just saying just

24   eliminate this whole folderol about picking delegates

25   and say the county chairman shall pick the delegates,

 1   period.   I don't see why that would be unconstitutional.

 2               MR. SCHWARZ:         I'm not sure I have a position

 3   on that one way or the other.             What I do say, though, is

 4   this Court in your Minnesota Republican Party v. White

 5   decision said it makes -- and, you know, the question of

 6   whether judges should be elected or appointed is a

 7   controversial question.        But this Court in that decision

 8   said that if you're going to have an election -- and

 9   here we have elections for delegates -- if you're going

10   to have an election, you shouldn't structure that

11   election in a way that makes it in that case extremely

12   difficult or impossible or forbidden --

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Schwarz, you're

14   talking about the election of the judge or the election

15   of the delegate?   I think you're mixing two oranges and

16   apples there.

17               MR. SCHWARZ:         Well, the -- I do believe that

18   the election of the delegates raises the constitutional

19   questions about has the State put its thumb on the

20   scale, has the State done something that severely

21   burdens the voters.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It -- the evidence shows

23   the thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party

24   chairman picked the delegates.              And, therefore, it seems

25   to me, it presents the question of whether it would be

 1   unconstitutional to enact a statute that allows the

 2   party chairman to pick the delegates.

 3               MR. SCHWARZ:           I'm not sure, Your Honor.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, if you're not sure,

 5   it's difficult --

 6               JuSTICE KENNEDY:              If I could interrupt,

 7   Justice Breyer, for just a moment.                   But in the Minnesota

 8   case the thumb on the scale was to deprive the

 9   constituents of a First Amendment right.                      Smith v.

10   Allwright, it was a right not to be discriminated

11   against race.   Here what we're asking is:                     What is the

12   substantive right?

13               MR. SCHWARZ:           Well, I think here it is the

14   right not to be burdened, severely burdened, in an

15   election.   And that just runs through all your cases --

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:              No, but what you are

17   calling -- and correct me if I am wrong.                      Maybe I

18   misunderstand this.       I think what you are calling the

19   severe burden is the difficulty of assembling a whole

20   slate that can control the meeting or have a majority in

21   the ultimate meeting of that delegate, of those

22   delegates, and therefore actually select the candidate

23   who wants to put the slate together.                      And it's control

24   over result rather than the capacity of any individual

25   to get elected a delegate which I think you are

 1   objecting to.    Am I wrong?

 2               MR. SCHWARZ:          We have never said that

 3   there's a right to win.         We have only said there's a

 4   right to meaningfully participate.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yes, but when you say

 6   "meaningfully participate" you talk about putting -- and

 7   candidly talk about putting -- a slate of delegates

 8   together.

 9               If I put a slate of delegates together, it

10   is because once those delegates are selected they're

11   going to support me; and that's why it -- I think your

12   real argument is not that somebody has difficulty

13   becoming a candidate for a delegate or even getting

14   elected one.    The difficulty that you're claiming is

15   that it's hard for the intending judicial candidate to

16   assemble a large enough group of people to give that

17   candidate success once the delegates are elected.                  It's

18   a success argument that you are making, not an access

19   argument.

20               MR. SCHWARZ:          No.      It's a compete argument,

21   not an access argument.         And I do think the Constitution

22   should be read to say that if the State passes laws that

23   make it very hard for voters to band together or for

24   insurgent candidates to compete, then -- and it is a

25   severe burden, they have to justify it.                  And, by the

 1   way, they haven't sought in their papers to justify it.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Could a State decide it

 3   doesn't want candidates to have any part in this

 4   delegate-selection process?              It thinks it's unseemly to

 5   have would-be judges engage in that kind of activity.

 6   So it structures the system that says that they choose

 7   delegates for a convention, but we don't want those

 8   delegates to be the delegates of any particular

 9   candidate.     We want to insulate this process from

10   would-be candidate influence.               Would that be

11   unconstitutional?

12                MR. SCHWARZ:          The problem is that in the

13   real world the statutes work to entrench the power of

14   the party leaders and to prevent voters from, to use the

15   Board of Elections' reply brief, I think, on page 5, to

16   use -- or 17, to use -- the voters are not able to band

17   together to try and influence the results at the

18   conventions.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course not.     You're

20   really arguing against the whole purpose this scheme,

21   which is not to have judges popularly elected.                 And

22   you're saying no, we want them popularly elected.                    The

23   purpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people

24   elect delegates and have delegates use their good

25   judgments as to who -- as to who the best judge would

 1   be.   But you say, no, we want the people to have an

 2   input.     I mean, it's contrary to the whole purpose of

 3   the scheme.     Of course it works the way you say it does.

 4   It is designed to work that way.                 It's a basic judgment

 5   not to have judges popularly elected, and your objection

 6   amounts to saying no, judges ought to be popularly

 7   elected.

 8                 MR. SCHWARZ:         We -- we have no problem with

 9   the convention, but we don't think that the -- either

10   the insurgent candidate or the band of voters who wish

11   to support that person should be, by the State, fenced

12   out, severely burdened from attempting to --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But it's all right,

14   I take it, if they don't prevail?                  For example --

15                 MR. SCHWARZ:         Yes.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- the other side

17   says that your argument is -- is implicated whenever a

18   convention leads to a different nominee than the

19   primary.

20                 MR. SCHWARZ:         No, that's -- that's not --

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't think

22   there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that

23   the nominee is going to be someone other than the person

24   who would prevail in the primary election.

25                 MR. SCHWARZ:         There is nothing wrong with

 1   that, Your Honor.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So it's all right to

 3   fence them out to that extent?

 4              MR. SCHWARZ:            If you want -- if we want to

 5   call that fencing.      I don't call that fencing.               That's

 6   the -- if the convention is one that is put together

 7   without the State burdening the ability for people to

 8   get involved --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I take it, in

10   evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult

11   it is for someone to be elected a delegate.

12              MR. SCHWARZ:            I think you should also look

13   at the -- since the party leaders run slates and they

14   have no difficulty in running slates because -- for

15   various reasons that the courts found, I think you

16   should look at the question of slates as well as

17   individual delegates.        And in considering individual

18   delegates, I do think that Mr. Dunne's amicus brief

19   which describes, on his page 19, indicates that, you

20   know, it's -- it's a little unrealistic to think that

21   anybody other than --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, is that

23   because Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members

24   at the convention --

25              MR. SCHWARZ:            No, he wasn't --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   -- for whatever

 2   higher office --

 3               MR. SCHWARZ:           He wasn't trying to be a

 4   judge, Your Honor.      He -- he speaks about his desire to

 5   be a delegate and his being told that, you're not

 6   sufficiently reliable; we're not going to let you be a

 7   delegate.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What did he have to

 9   do to become on the ballot for delegate?

10               MR. SCHWARZ:           If he wanted to be a single

11   person running -- appearing as a gadfly --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   500 signatures,

13   right?

14               MR. SCHWARZ:           He needs the 500 signatures.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   If we don't think

16   that's a sufficient burden, do you lose?

17               MR. SCHWARZ:           I think we have a difficult

18   case, if you don't think that's sufficient burden.                     If

19   you think --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But the State -- the trial

21   court didn't find that that was a burden.

22               MR. SCHWARZ:           No, I -- I'm not -- I'm

23   agreeing with the Chief Justice that I think that, if

24   you thought that just running for one delegate slot was

25   sufficient to solve the problem of a State statute that

 1   was designed -- their words, their admission -- to

 2   entrench the power of the party leaders, I think that

 3   gives us a problem.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?      I mean I don't see

 5   how you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical?

 6   The reason I think you have to answer it is because the

 7   New York system is the system he described in the

 8   hypothetical, with a safety valve.

 9              MR. SCHWARZ:         The safety valve being?

10              JUSTICE BREYER:            The safety valve being that

11   the party leaders cannot just choose anybody.                I mean,

12   if it looks they're going to choose something really

13   nutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates

14   and something will happen.

15              MR. SCHWARZ:         Well --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:            So they have leeway, but

17   you can't go too far.

18              MR. SCHWARZ:         The record, Your Honor, and

19   this is an extensive record, shows that the party

20   leaders can choose and do choose people who are, to use

21   your word, who are --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:            You don't like that.

23   That's why I say you have to answer it.                If you feel

24   that that's so terrible, then you say no, the

25   Constitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain,

 1   wouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not

 2   better in the judgment of New York than a system where

 3   people raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run

 4   for office?

 5                 MR. SCHWARZ:         We -- no, we -- we have not

 6   said that there needs to be a primary.                    We haven't said

 7   that.   And sometimes our opponents leave the impression

 8   that we have said that.          We haven't said that.

 9                 You know, there are -- get rid of the

10   leaders --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's the -- that's the

12   remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was

13   -- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New

14   York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be

15   chosen by primary.

16                 MR. SCHWARZ:         Yes, the -- but the judge,

17   Your Honor -- the judge did two things in imposing that

18   remedy, three or four things actually:

19                 He said, first, I'm not going to

20   micromanage.    I think the statutes are unconstitutional.

21   I'm not going to get into all the details of fixing it

22   because the Legislature should do that and the Federal

23   courts shouldn't do that.

24                 Second, he relied on the fact that the

25   fall-back position in the State statutes is there is a


                                         47

 1   primary if there is no other system in place.

 2                 But, third and most important, he stayed his

 3   decision to give the Legislature time to address the

 4   question, and they were well on their way to addressing

 5   it when this Court gave us the opportunity to be here.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you agree it's

 7   not realistic that one way they would address it is by

 8   having an entirely appointed system?

 9                 MR. SCHWARZ:        No, they -- they're entitled

10   to do that.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I know they are

12   entitled to it.

13                 MR. SCHWARZ:        Well, the --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                As a practical

15   matter, is that a realistic option in New York?

16                 MR. SCHWARZ:        If you look at the amicus

17   briefs filed in our favor, the State bar, the City bar,

18   the Fund for the Modern Courts, the City of New York all

19   filed a brief in which they say, we think the right

20   solution is to have an appointive system, and they're

21   working to try to have that happen.                      And the governor

22   has put forward a bill for an appointive system.                      But,

 2                MR. SCHWARZ:          No, not --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I thought I read a

 4   representation somewhere in the briefs that it's

 5   unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an

 6   entirely appointive system.              So that the options, if

 7   you're successful, the options will either be direct

 8   election of judges or a pure convention with no role for

 9   the voters at all.

10                MR. SCHWARZ:          No, it could be a role for the

11   voters that does not burden them in the way this statute

12   burdens them.

13                And the -- that brief by the State bar and

14   the Bar of the Association of the City of New York and

15   the other groups who are strongly in favor of an

16   appointive system, say to this Court, this is the worst

17   of all worlds.   And it -- this system, as also the

18   amicus brief from the former judges who were responsible

19   for appellate judges responsible for administering the

20   New York State system, says that this system has

21   undermined judicial independence and undermined

22   confidence in the courts.

23                And that is -- you know -- that is clearly

24   correct --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              There's also one view, I

 1   think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst

 2   thing in the world would be to return us to the primary

 3   system this system was intended to replace.

 4              MR. SCHWARZ:         Yes, the -- actually the

 5   Feerick report, which found that the party leaders all

 6   over State however have always made the picks, they

 7   voiced a favoring amending the law.                    They -- they think

 8   the law needs to be amended.

 9              And Chief Judge Kaye, in her remarks after

10   the decisions came down and after the Feerick Commission

11   report came out, said the problems that had been

12   revealed in this case are pervasive both systemically

13   and geographically.

14              The Feerick Commission's view is that,

15   unless there's public financing, in which case they'd

16   favor some more involvement by the voters, is simply

17   amend the portions of the law that make it so burdensome

18   on competitors, on voters.

19              We're -- we're neutral.                     We just say this

20   law is unconstitutional.        And how it should be amended

21   is up to the Legislature, but that it should be amended

22   is -- there's a powerful case and, you know, I don't

23   know where I am on the time here, but I commend to you

24   the various amicus briefs that have come in on --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            They're all policy

 1   arguments about why this is a terrible statute.                  They're

 2   not necessarily constitutional arguments.

 3                 MR. SCHWARZ:        No, they also speak --

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           And that's a vast

 5   difference.

 6                 MR. SCHWARZ:        -- speak about the

 7   Constitution, and, indeed, it's not very often that you

 8   find, on a constitutional issue, both the Washington

 9   Legal Foundation and the ACLU coming in, as they have

10   come in, to assert that this is an unconstitutional

11   statute.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it's not often

13   you have both the Democratic Party and the Republican

14   Party --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- supporting it

17   either.

18                 MR. SCHWARZ:        Yes, but then I -- I think you

19   should look at the -- what you've said in -- not you,

20   but your predecessor said in Eu, about we've never held

21   that a political party's consent will cure a statute

22   that otherwise is violative and, there are other quotes

23   in Justice Scalia's Tashjian opinion and in -- in

24   several other cases to that effect.

 4              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 5              ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE

 6                  BOARD OF ELECTIONS ET AL.

 7              MR. OLSON:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 8              The Second Circuit reinstalled what the New

 9   York Legislature found to be a bad system, that it

10   discouraged qualified candidates and it encouraged this

11   unfortunate, unseemly race for money.

12              The Respondents just said that that is not

13   what they were interested in doing, but their prayer for

14   their relief, on page 35 of their complaint, calls for a

15   direct primary election for the Supreme Court.

16              With respect to the Kusper case,

17   Justice Kennedy, I gave that a little bit more thought.

18   That -- that case focused on the fact that the statute

19   was inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to

20   participate in a way that the party wanted that

21   individual to participate.         That long period of time

22   prevented both the individual and the association from

23   associating together, which is why --

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You say the State, your

25   mean the State statute?

 1               MR. OLSON:       Yes.       But -- and to the extent

 2   that it was -- it was -- part of that is answered by

 3   your Clingman case which just came relatively recently,

 4   where the party wanted independents to vote in the

 5   primary and the Supreme Court -- this Court said that

 6   the State had to let that happen.                With respect to time

 7   periods between when you had to identify yourself as a

 8   party member this court held in the Rosario case that a

 9   certain length of time is appropriate under the system.

10               With respect to Mr. Dunne, we've heard about

11   him.   He may have had a desire to be a delegate but he

12   never tried to get the 500 signatures.                  It says that

13   right on his -- on page 19 of his brief -- the brief

14   that my colleague was quoting.

15               With respect to the questions that I think

16   both Justice Stevens and Justice Souter were asking,

17   could the State lodge the candidate selection or the

18   delegate selection process in the party leaders, I can't

19   conceive of how that would be unconstitutional.

20               If the parties wanted to select the

21   delegates or select the candidates to be their standard

22   bearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the

23   right of an association to do; and would be perfectly

24   appropriate, provided that there was an access for

25   independents and --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're not saying the State

 2   could compel that?

 3                MR. OLSON:        No. No.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're saying that the

 5   State could permit it?

 6                MR. OLSON:        No.       But I think those

 7   hypothetical questions are could the State vest that

 8   authority.

 9                Finally I think it's important to say -- oh,

10   one more preliminary point.              It is competitive in New

11   York.   It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the

12   case of 90 percent of the congressional districts in

13   this country, which are said not to be competitive.                 But

14   in New York, six sitting judges testified in -- in -- in

15   the lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates

16   to, you know, to be candidates.                So that happens.

17                Between 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130,

18   nearly one fourth of the general elections in New York

19   were competitive.

20                Lopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25

21   votes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and

22   many of the districts in New York are not dominated by a

23   single party.

24                So the final point is it is important to

25   emphasize this is a -- a challenge on its face to the

 1   statute that simply creates a delegate election and it

 2   then creates a convention.            Neither of those provisions

 3   can possibly be constitutional, and so what the

 4   Respondents are complaining about is what party bosses

 5   do.

 6      But on page 38 of their brief, they state

 7   categorically that the constitutional offense is not the

 8   fact that party leaders act as one would expect in

 9   choosing nominees.

10   In other words, they act -- party leaders act like party

11   leaders and exercise their influence.                      They're not

12   saying that that's unconstitutional.                      What they're

13   saying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be

14   party leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways

15   which are not only permissible under the Constitution as

16   they knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is

17   somehow constitutional.          That simply is not consistent

18   with any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that

19   political parties must have the maximum opportunity to

20   select their leadership.

21   Thank you.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you Mr. Olson.
