 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. SANDERS:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              If a prosecutor's absolute immunity in

12   judicial proceedings means anything, it means that a

13   prosecutor may not be sued because a trial has ended in

14   a conviction, Yet that is exactly what happened in this

15   case.

16              Lower courts may not fashion exceptions to

17   the immunity this -- this Court provided in Imbler by

18   purporting to relocate a due process injury from the

19   trial to an earlier investigation.

20              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Your -- your case here is

21   a polite way of telling us we wasted our time in

22   Buckley v. Fitzsimmons.

23              MR. SANDERS:           Your Honor --

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I mean, we were just

25   spinning our wheels in that case?

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, I don't believe so

 2   at all.   I think that this case presents exactly the

 3   question that Buckley reserved, and that is whether the

 4   fabrication of evidence by a prosecutor in and of

 5   itself, without regard to its use in some way, states a

 6   constitutional cause of action.

 7               In this case, the use at trial, obviously,

 8   was absolutely immunized under Imbler and many of this

 9   other -- this Court's other precedents.                Despite

10   respondent's best efforts to argue that there was some

11   sort of due process violation caused by the fabrication

12   itself, without regard to its use in some way, there

13   simply is no support for that.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Does that mean that, even

15   if we were dealing with police officers who did what the

16   prosecutors were alleged to have done at the

17   investigation stage, no prosecutor, only police

18   investigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction

19   had occurred would mean that the police officers were

20   not liable, either?

21               MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, the fact that a

22   trial and conviction had occurred could mean that the

23   police officers were liable because of the due process

24   violation at the trial, but in footnote 5 of Buckley,

25   this Court was very clear and insisted that there is no


                                       4

 1   disjunction between observing that a prosecutor, like a

 2   police officer, has only qualified immunity during the

 3   investigation while, at the same time, insisting that

 4   that does not affect the fact that the prosecutor has

 5   absolute --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Take two cases.   One is

 7   Justice Ginsburg's case, a police officer fabricates the

 8   evidence, dupes the prosecuting attorney, or -- or

 9   doesn't fully disclose.         Case two, a prosecutor does the

10   same thing and gives it to a fellow prosecutor.

11                 Same -- should the analysis be precisely the

12   same?

13                 MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, it should be the

14   same if the prosecutor in the second case that you

15   hypothesize had nothing to do with the later

16   prosecution.    In other words, if we could view that

17   prosecutor simply as an ordinary citizen, simply as a

18   complaining witness, as analogous to a police officer,

19   So there's no argument in this case that simply, by

20   virtue of being a prosecutor, a prosecutor has absolute

21   immunity.

22                 The courts below wrongfully abrogated trial

23   immunity because trial is the only place where the

24   injury of conviction and subsequent incarceration could

25   have taken place.     Without reference to that specific


                                         5

 1   injury, there is simply no other injury.               The --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I'm not sure that I fully

 3   grasp your answer to my first question and to Justice

 4   Kennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that

 5   happened was alleged to have happened, but it was done

 6   by a police officer or a different prosecutor,

 7   nonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence

 8   was introduced, without any participation by the actual

 9   prosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction --

10   does the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors

11   that was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are

12   they -- are they no more liable, not because they have

13   absolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction

14   at which the evidence was used overtakes what liability

15   they might have had, absent the trial?

16              Is that your position?

17              MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, our position is --

18   I believe I would agree with you.               Our position is there

19   is no liability for the initial fabrication.               As the

20   United States explains in its brief, for a police

21   officer to be held liable in those circumstances, it

22   would need to be under some sort of malicious

23   prosecution theory that would depend on the actual

24   conviction and the use of the evidence at trial.

25              But the use of the evidence at trial is the

 1   injury itself, and that is exclusively a prosecutorial

 2   act, only a prosecutor could --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You're not answering the

 4   question clearly.     Are both the prosecutor, in Justice

 5   Ginsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable?

 6   Can't you answer that?         Yes or no.

 7               MR. SANDERS:          Yes.       This Court --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Good.      That's what I

 9   thought your answer was.

10               MR. SANDERS:          Yes.       The police officer --

11   likely, this Court has never -- never addressed the

12   issue.   The police officer would likely be liable

13   because the police officer would have no immunity for

14   the use of the evidence.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, she's more concerned

16   about the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be

17   treated just like a police officer?

18               MR. SANDERS:          If the prosecutor performed no

19   prosecutorial function, that's correct.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              In the case?

21               MR. SANDERS:          That's correct, Your Honor.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But only if the --

23   only if the evidence is presented at trial?

24               MR. SANDERS:          But only if the evidence is

25   presented at trial because that's the only way the


                                         7

 1   evidence can provide injury and so --

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So the -- so the law is

 3   the more deeply you're involved in the wrong, the more

 4   likely you are to be immune?           That's a strange

 5   proposition.

 6              MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, I think it's not

 7   the more deeply you are involved, it's whether you are

 8   in the unique position of a prosecutor to cause injury

 9   by use of the evidence at trial.              That is exclusively a

10   prosecutorial function.

11              The function test of -- of Buckley goes to

12   what function someone is performing, but only the

13   prosecutor can ever perform the function of actually

14   using the evidence.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it's strange to say

16   you can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the

17   trial, would have liability, but as long as the

18   prosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage

19   material over to himself, rather than to another

20   prosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.

21              MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, that is correct,

22   but I think the Court, more than 80 years ago, when it

23   summarily affirmed Yaselli v. Goff from the Second

24   Circuit, spoke to this question.

25              In that case, the Court said -- affirmed the

 1   Second Circuit in its view that, if a prosecutor

 2   cannot -- if a prosecutor has absolute immunity for

 3   acting maliciously at trial, that immunity cannot be

 4   circumvented --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No, but the -- the

 6   question is not at trial, nothing about trial.                 It's the

 7   pretrial conduct.

 8                MR. SANDERS:         The -- the odd thing about --

 9   if we are taking out reference to the trial itself, then

10   there simply can be no claim.              Respondents urge a new

11   freestanding right, separate and apart from the due

12   process trial right, yet at the same time --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you said that

14   there -- that there would be liability, as long as it

15   wasn't the same person involved in the investigation and

16   the trial.   Even though there had been a trial, you

17   say -- you answered Justice Scalia, that those people

18   separated from the trial would be liable, even though

19   there was a trial, and it's at issue.

20                MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, looking to the

21   common law, the rationale for that would be a form of

22   malicious prosecution, but as you observed in your

23   concurrence in Albright, asserting malicious prosecution

24   against a prosecutor would be anomalous because it's the

25   prosecutor who is exclusively responsible for causing


                                         9

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the kind of injury.

 2              If a police officer or a nonprosecuting

 3   prosecutor simply fabricates the evidence, as Chief

 4   Judge Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit said, there can

 5   be no cause of action.

 6              It is the exclusive function of a prosecutor

 7   in a case who uses the evidence who can cause the

 8   injury, and although --

 9              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But that makes no sense

10   because, if you go down that road, then what you're

11   saying is that neither the -- neither a police officer

12   or a different prosecutor who fabricated evidence could

13   be liable, either, because the only person who causes

14   the deprivation is the prosecutor who uses the false

15   evidence at trial.

16              MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, this Court has not

17   spoken to that question, but as you stated, that would

18   be the rationale of the restatement actually.              The

19   restatement says, if there is no deception of the

20   prosecutor, then it is the prosecutor's willful and free

21   will use of the evidence at trial.

22              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Now, the Second Circuit

23   in its decision, Judge Newman, looked at it and said

24   there are two causes to the injury here.              One is the

25   fabrication, joint tortfeasors.             There are two people


                                      10

 1   who can cause any injury and the prosecutor who actually

 2   puts the evidence in at trial.             That's how you hold

 3   police officers and different prosecutors liable because

 4   they are assisting in the violation that is occurring.

 5              MR. SANDERS:         Uh-hmm.

 6              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Why doesn't that theory

 7   fit the same prosecutor who commits two different acts?

 8              MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, I think --

 9              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              One commits the direct

10   violation, and the other act, the investigatory act,

11   contributes to it, leads to it as a joint activity with

12   it.

13              MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, I believe the

14   analysis is not that it -- because it leads to the

15   injury itself.   The tort of wrongful conviction based on

16   use of false evidence at trial has only one element

17   under this Court's precedents in Pyle and Mooney and

18   Hysler and Rochin.    That element is the prosecutor's use

19   of the evidence at trial.         But simply because that act

20   is absolutely immune is not to say that someone else

21   who's responsible for --

22              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              You're confusing -- the

23   constitutional injury is the deprivation of liberty.

24   That's the injury.

25              MR. SANDERS:         That's correct.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             What causes that injury

 2   is not an element of the crime.               It is -- the question

 3   is have you proven the violation, have you proven the

 4   injury.

 5                MR. SANDERS:        Well --

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So why does the use

 7   define the scope of the injury?

 8                MR. SANDERS:        Because that is the way a

 9   prosecutor would be held liable.                The cause of action

10   against a prosecutor, even though he would be absolutely

11   immune, would be the prosecutor's knowing or even

12   unknowing use of the false evidence at trial.                  But in

13   this case, Respondents ask for a free-standing due

14   process right that would somehow at the same time

15   protect the interest against wrongful conviction at

16   trial.    That simply can't be.           This Court's decision --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the view that

18   Judge Fairchild expressed very simply.                  He said if this

19   fabrication had not occurred, there never would have

20   been any trial.

21                MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, as we discussed in

22   our opening brief in this case, I think that Judge

23   Fairchild's reasoning is classic malicious prosecution

24   reasoning.    That is, that it's the false evidence that

25   impelled the prosecution.          But again, this Court has


                                       12

 1   been absolutely clear that a malicious prosecution

 2   theory cannot be asserted against a prosecutor because a

 3   prosecutor can initiate willfully and maliciously a

 4   wrongful prosecution based on good evidence, bad

 5   evidence, or no evidence at all.

 6                It's simply untenable to say -- and this

 7   Court's decision last term in Van de Kamp made clear

 8   that where the injury comes at trial, where that is the

 9   interest protected against, that you can somehow

10   abrogate immunity and continue with a case based on that

11   kind of claim based on a claim of an earlier due process

12   right --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Was there no injury in

14   the period before?     Let's leave out the trial for a

15   moment.    There was a deprivation of liberty during the

16   investigatory stage.

17                MR. SANDERS:         Your Honor, I think any

18   earlier deprivation of liberty would be covered by the

19   Fourth Amendment.     The Fourth Amendment is not

20   implicated in the question presented here.               It has not

21   been briefed.    Surely there would be an interest against

22   wrongful seizure or, since this -- these arrests were

23   pursuant to legal process, against a form of malicious

24   prosecution.    But again, that would be a Fourth

25   Amendment theory and it could not be asserted if it is

 1   malicious prosecution against a prosecutor.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Would you clear up one

 3   thing for me I really don't quite understand.                     You do

 4   agree that if the police officers did this there would

 5   be liability?

 6              MR. SANDERS:           Your Honor, this Court has not

 7   addressed that issue.        That is the view of some of the

 8   circuits and the Restatement.

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Are you assuming that to

10   be correct or are you disputing that?

11              MR. SANDERS:           We're assuming that to be

12   correct, but if I --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:               But if that's true, why

14   doesn't the trial immunize the police officers because

15   they didn't cause the trial?              Well, they were in the

16   background in the same sense that these prosecutors are.

17   But why would the police officers be liable?

18              MR. SANDERS:           A police officer would never

19   get immunity at trial because --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Not to get immunity, but

21   why is he liable?     Why is he liable?                  Because the injury

22   was caused by the trial, if I understand your theory.

23              MR. SANDERS:           The theory of the common law

24   on malicious prosecution would be that the police

25   officer is liable because his fabrication of evidence

 1   impelled the proceeding, caused the proceeding .

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:              But it was not a malicious

 3   prosecution.   The prosecution -- the prosecutors acted

 4   in good faith all the way through, so there is no

 5   malicious prosecution.        So what is the basis for

 6   liability against the police officers?

 7              MR. SANDERS:          The basis for liability

 8   precisely against the police officer would be the

 9   violation of the due process right to a fair trial,

10   Wrongful conviction on the basis of the introduction --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Why doesn't the theory

12   apply to the facts of this case also?

13              MR. SANDERS:          This theory wouldn't apply to

14   the facts of this case because in this case the

15   prosecutors made the decision independently to initiate

16   the prosecution.   It's undisputed that they did that in

17   their capacity as prosecutors.              They -- the police

18   officers' act could not cause injury but for the

19   immunized act of a prosecutor beginning the prosecution

20   and conducting the trial.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:              This investigation by the

22   prosecutor could not have caused injury but for the

23   immunized act of going forward with the trial.

24              MR. SANDERS:          But, Your Honor, I think --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:              What's the difference?


                                       15

 1              MR. SANDERS:        I think that that reasoning

 2   would be to what this Court affirmed in Yaselli and what

 3   this Court has said -- and which the Court has

 4   repeatedly cited favorably, and that is -- and it would

 5   also run up against the concerns that Justice Kennedy

 6   indicated in his concurrence in Buckley, which this --

 7   the majority in Buckley also disputed and said there is

 8   no disjunction between qualified immunity for a

 9   prosecutor during an investigation but absolute immunity

10   for the act of setting the prosecution in motion.

11              The Court was absolutely clear in footnote 5

12   of Buckley that there was no disjunction, and as this

13   Court has indicated in Malley v. Briggs and other cases,

14   anything other than absolute immunity for a prosecutor

15   would impair the -- would impair the performance of a

16   central actor in the judicial process.

17              With the Court's permission, I'll reserve

18   the balance of my time.

 1   and may it please the Court:

 2                 This Court's decision in Buckley v.

 3   Fitzsimmons the question presented today, which is

 4   whether a cause of action exists against prosecutors

 5   alleged to have fabricated evidence.                     Respondents'

 6   answer to this question asks this Court to announce for

 7   first time ever that there is a free-standing due

 8   process right not to be framed.                That theory would

 9   untether due process from the right to a fair trial,

10   which is the process a defendant is due before being

11   deprived of liberty.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why do we need that theory?

13   I mean, why not just say what Newman said and the others

14   said?     There is no free-standing right.                 There is just a

15   right not to convict a person with made-up evidence, and

16   of course a prosecutor insofar as he's involved in the

17   prosecutorial stage is absolutely immune.                    But if he's

18   involved in the investigatorial stage of that event,

19   well, then he's not immune absolutely.                    That's a policy

20   decision.     That has nothing to do with free-standing

21   rights.

22                 MR. KATYAL:       Respondents' primary submission

23   before this Court is not that argument.                    They don't rest

24   --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.         Then I'm making


                                        17

 1   that argument.

 2               MR. KATYAL:       Right, and with respect to that

 3   I think we have several, several responses.                    The first

 4   is that this Court has rejected that kind of mere

 5   foreseeability analysis in the context of section 1983.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:           Mere foreseeability.           You

 7   can fill in those boundaries, Toffler, not Toffler, as

 8   you wish.   But the basic theory isn't a problem because,

 9   after all, we're just drawing a line somewhere within

10   the stage of an ongoing tort on the basis of policy, and

11   Buckley suggests such a line.            I don't see a conceptual

12   problem there, is my problem.            Maybe there are practical

13   problems, but I don't see a conceptual one.

14               MR. KATYAL:       I think there are practical and

15   conceptual problems, which is why Buckley reserved

16   precisely this question in footnote 5, and here's the

17   basic policy or conceptual concern.                    Our point is that

18   if a section 1983 defendant is absolutely immune for the

19   constitutional wrong, then you can't read back in time;

20   a plaintiff can't look back in time and isolate some

21   other acts as to which they are nonimmune and thereby --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:           I interrupt you right

23   there.   I would say they are not absolutely immune for

24   the whole constitutional offense.                That's the line I'm

25   trying to draw.


                                      18

 1               MR. KATYAL:         And, Justice Breyer, I'm saying

 2   to do that requires you to read the due process

 3   violation as occurring sometime before the trial, and

 4   then we're back to the free-standing rationale and the

 5   opening up of the due process clause to something this

 6   Court has never, ever accepted.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:             So I agree with you on

 8   that.   I agree with you.         I won't do it.             I'll take it

 9   as one tort.     Began before the investigation stage, ends

10   with conviction.     One tort.          Now, within that tort we

11   draw a line and we draw a line based on policy purposes

12   as to when the prosecutor is absolutely or qualifiedly

13   immune, and where that line comes is Buckley,

14   approximately.     Okay?

15               Now, I don't see a conceptual problem with

16   that and I'm having a hard time finding a practical

17   problem.

18               MR. KATYAL:         The conceptual problem is that

19   this Court has been explicit that section 1983 is not

20   the font of tort law.        Rather, you need to isolate a

21   constitutional violation.           Here, the constitutional

22   violation is the due process clause.                     That violation

23   begins, as this Court's decisions in Napue and Pyle say,

24   when the fabricated evidence is introduced at trial in

25   order to secure a conviction.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:           And how do you get the

 2   policeman who has fabricated the evidence?

 3              MR. KATYAL:        Because the policeman

 4   essentially induces the prosecution at an earlier point

 5   of time and acts through the innocent agent, the

 6   prosecutor, that introduction of evidence at trial is

 7   not something as to which the policeman has any sort of

 8   absolute immunity.    And so in Justice Breyer's example

 9   of a prosecutor introducing evidence, that is something

10   as to which the prosecutor is absolutely immune.               That

11   is where the constitutional violation begins.

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What if a prosecutor knows

13   that it's fabricated evidence?            The police officer

14   fabricates the evidence and says:               Mr. Prosecutor, it's

15   a very bad man; I fabricated the evidence.               The

16   prosecutor introduces it.        What result there?

17              See, your footnote 6 presumes that the

18   prosecutor doesn't know.

19              MR. KATYAL:        Right.

20              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose he knows?

21              MR. KATYAL:        And if the prosecutor does

22   know, we don't think that there is a Fifth Amendment due

23   process violation.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Against the policeman?

25              MR. KATYAL:        Against -- against the


                                     20
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   policeman in that circumstance, because the --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Again, the more aggravated

 3   the tort, the greater the immunity.

 4                 MR. KATYAL:      And I agree that that seems a

 5   little odd --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You're basically saying

 7   that you cannot aid and abet someone who is immune, and

 8   that's just not the law.

 9                 MR. KATYAL:      No, what I'm saying and what

10   this Court's decisions have said is that absolute

11   immunity doesn't exist to protect bad apples.                It

12   reflects a larger interest in protecting judicial

13   information coming into the judicial process.                And if

14   prosecutors have to worry at trial that every act they

15   undertake will somehow open up the door to liability,

16   then they will flinch in the performance of their duties

17   and not introduce that evidence.                And that is the

18   distinction between the police officer, who is liable,

19   and the prosecutor, who is -- who is absolutely immune.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            A prosecutor is not

21   going to flinch when he suspects evidence is perjured or

22   fabricated?    Do you really want to send a message to

23   police officers that they should not merely flinch but

24   stop if they have reason to believe that evidence is

25   fabricated?

 1               MR. KATYAL:       Justice Sotomayor, we

 2   absolutely want to send that message.                  The worry is that

 3   allegations of wrongdoing, as this Court has recognized

 4   in Imbler and Van de Kamp, can -- can supersede that.

 5   And just to give you --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Am I right that none of

 7   the -- neither of the two prosecutors in this case were

 8   sanctioned in any way for their conduct?

 9               MR. KATYAL:       I believe that is correct, and

10   I also believe that no ethics complaints were ever

11   brought.   That is, rather the Respondents went into

12   Federal court seeking money damages instead of ethics

13   violations and the like.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But you have no reason

15   to dispute the numerous studies we were provided that

16   show that as a matter of routine prosecutors are not

17   sanctioned for improper prosecutorial conduct in the

18   investigatory stage, are you?

19               MR. KATYAL:       Well, I do think that there is

20   a debate in the briefs before this Court, including the

21   brief by 12,400 or so prosecutors that takes the reverse

22   view.   But be that as it may, I think that is a question

23   for the legislature.

24               This Court has said repeatedly that those

25   ethics and disciplinary violations are -- are a


                                      22
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   successful deterrent, and there is others as well that

 2   this Court has pointed to that may be available,

 3   including counsel's liability.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you can't have it

 5   both ways and say this is a policy we should take into

 6   account and then when Justice Sotomayor asks you a

 7   question, say:   Oh, well, that's for the legislature.               I

 8   mean, you're -- it seems to me you're trying to have it

 9   both ways.

10                MR. KATYAL:      Well, with respect to a cause

11   of action and whether the principles of absolute

12   immunity apply to this, I think this Court has already

13   recognized several times that the overriding interest is

14   protecting the judicial process and not letting

15   information be chilled and not come in.

16                To give you a couple of data points, there

17   were 14.4 million arrests in the year 2006 and 1.1,

18   approximately, million felony convictions.             Respondents'

19   theory would allow prosecutors in any of those

20   circumstances to be sued for an alleged fabrication of

21   evidence, and that's something that could be -- that's

22   something that's not that hard to envision, since

23   criminal evidence, unlike civil evidence, is messy.             It

24   often involves cooperation agreements, leniency

25   agreements and the like, and for that reason it's very


                                      23
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   natural, and this Court has recognized that in Imbler,

 2   for the defendant in a criminal case to say:                    Well, I'm

 3   going to blame the prosecutor; they fabricated evidence,

 4   they made this story up; and -- and then seek civil

 5   liability.

 6                And what this Court has said repeatedly is

 7   that the societal interest suffers.                    And that is why

 8   it's not about, Justice Kennedy, protecting the bad

 9   apple and someone who exacerbates the harm by carrying

10   the fabricated evidence through trial.                   Rather, what

11   this Court's absolute immunity decisions consistently

12   reflect is the principle that when someone is

13   introducing evidence at trial, you don't want to chill

14   them in the performance of their duties in any way

15   through the rubric of civil liability.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I don't understand why at

17   the time of introducing the evidence, the policy

18   concerns that you've described arise, because we were

19   criticizing what he did before he introduced the

20   evidence.

21                MR. KATYAL:      When -- when the evidence is

22   introduced and it's the prosecutor himself who developed

23   that evidence, maybe through flipping a witness or

24   something like that, that --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Right, and he would know


                                      24
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether or not it was fabricated.

 2               MR. KATYAL:      Well, he would know whether or

 3   not it's fabricated, but the question is whether he

 4   would know that he could insulate himself from an

 5   allegation of wrongdoing.        And Respondents' theory,

 6   which allows the due process clause to be some sort of

 7   free-standing right, would permit those suits even at

 8   the earliest stages of an investigation and permit

 9   strike suits even before the criminal process is

10   underway.

11               And that, I think, is a fundamental point,

12   which is this Court, no court has, ever really accepted

13   the notion that prosecutors can be liable, that there is

14   a cause of action for --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But haven't we said that

16   during the investigating stage their conduct is subject

17   to different rules than during the trial?

18               MR. KATYAL:      For purposes of absolute

19   immunity, and we agree with that.               So, for example,

20   Justice Stevens, in your Fourth Amendment decision in

21   1975 on the Seventh Circuit, we agree there is liability

22   when a prosecutor is, for example, conducting a raid or

23   something like that.    There the constitutional violation

24   is complete before the trial, and whatever the

25   prosecutor does at trial --

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:               I just don't see the -- I

 2   don't to see if I can understand the reason why the time

 3   in which the violation is completed, namely after the

 4   trial, goes to the question of whether there is

 5   liability for pretrial conduct.

 6              MR. KATYAL:          Well, we think there is no

 7   liability for pretrial conduct, and so long as you agree

 8   with me that the due process clause violation begins

 9   only at the trial --

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:               It was completed at the

11   trial, but it began when the -- the phony investigation

12   started.

13              MR. KATYAL:          The -- the text of the due

14   process clause says the deprivation of life, liberty,

15   property with -- under due process of law, and due

16   process under this Court's decisions is what happens at

17   trial, not before.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, Mr.

19   Katyal.

21              ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

22                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

23              MR. CLEMENT:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24   please the Court:

25              As I listen to Petitioners, I hear two


                                        26
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   arguments to why there ought to be liability for the

 2   prosecutor -- rather, for the police officer and not the

 3   prosecutor, and both of those are arguments this Court

 4   has already heard and rejected.

 5              On the immunity issue, the argument

 6   Petitioners make seems to distill to the proposition

 7   that as long as you're suing a prosecutor for injuries

 8   inflicted at trial, the prosecutor ought to have

 9   absolute immunity.

10              Now, that's not a crazy theory of immunity.

11   It's exactly the theory of immunity that the Seventh

12   Circuit adopted in the Buckley decision and this Court

13   reversed, unanimously as to the press conference and by

14   a majority opinion with respect to pretrial

15   investigatory conduct involving fabrication.          If that

16   sounds familiar, it should.          That's the conduct that's

17   at issue here.

18              So the absolute immunity issue in this case

19   was decided in Buckley.       Now --

20              JUSTICE ALITO:          When the issue, when the --

21   the claim is based on the evaluation of the truthfulness

22   of a witness who eventually testifies at trial, where's

23   the line to be drawn between the investigative stage and

24   the prosecutorial stage?

25              MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I think, Justice Alito,


                                     27
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the place to draw the line is the place this Court drew

 2   the line in Buckley, which is probable cause.              And

 3   before probable cause, when prosecutors are engaging in

 4   investigatory functions, I don't think we want them

 5   shaping the witness for trial.              I think we want them

 6   trying to figure out who actually committed this crime

 7   and who would we have probable cause to perhaps initiate

 8   process against.

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:            What concerns me about your

10   argument is the -- is a real fear that it will

11   eviscerate Imbler.    Now, maybe you can convince me that

12   it will not have that effect, but as the Solicitor

13   General argued at the end of his argument, a very -- in

14   the typical criminal case, the witnesses are not

15   John Q. Public with -- who have never engaged in any

16   wrongful activity.

17              A typical witness is -- well, let's take the

18   case of the prosecution of a -- a white -- of the CEO of

19   a huge corporation for insider trading or some other

20   white-collar violation.        And the chief witness against

21   this person is, let's say, the CFO of this company, who

22   when initially questioned by law enforcement officials

23   and investigatory officials, made -- made statements

24   denying any participation in any wrongdoing, but

25   eventually changed his story and testifies against the


                                       28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   CEO at trial in exchange for consideration in a plea

 2   deal.

 3               Now, your argument, in a case like that --

 4   or you could change the facts, make it an organized

 5   crime case, make it a prosecution of a drug kingpin

 6   who's testifying -- the witness against him is a

 7   lower-ranking person in the organization who has a

 8   criminal record, maybe has previously committed perjury,

 9   has made numerous false statements, is subject to

10   impeachment.   In all of those cases a claim could be

11   brought against the prosecutor.

12               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, Justice Alito, let me

13   try to answer it this way, which is you mentioned both

14   organized crime cases and insider trading cases.          Well,

15   I think if there is any circuit in which those kind of

16   claims are going to be brought it's probably the Second

17   Circuit.   The Second Circuit has lived with this rule

18   since the year 2000 and the Zahrey decision that's

19   already been mentioned.       There has not been a floodgate

20   opening, there's not been a torrent of these claims.

21   There's been a trickle.       They remain very hard to

22   allege, and the allegations here --

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I mean, that might be

24   true as an empirical matter, but I don't understand why

25   it would be hard to allege.


                                      29
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. CLEMENT:        What would you --

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:          What would you have to

 3   allege to get by Iqbal or to get by summary judgment?

 4   You allege that the testimony at trial was false and

 5   that the prosecutor knew that it was false.                 And in

 6   support of that you have prior inconsistent statements

 7   by the witness, and you may have the evidence that was

 8   introduced by the defense at trial that is inconsistent

 9   with that.    You have a triable issue.

10                MR. CLEMENT:        I don't --

11                JUSTICE ALITO:          You certainly get by

12   12(b)(6).

13                MR. CLEMENT:        As I hear your hypothetical, I

14   don't think so, because the thing that's missing is the

15   allegation that the prosecutors fabricated that

16   evidence.    This isn't a case about coaching a witness.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but what --

18   what if there's an acquittal?             Then you have at least a

19   jury not believing the evidence, and that also is strong

20   support for at least supporting an allegation.                 He

21   fabricated it; nobody believed it when it was presented

22   at trial.

23                MR. CLEMENT:        Well, two things, Your Honor.

24   One is obviously without the fabrication allegations

25   that take place during the investigatory stage, you


                                       30
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would be protected by Imbler.

 2               Now, in the acquittal situations, this Court

 3   doesn't have a case directly on point.                 But if I read

 4   the Hartman decision, for example, Hartman v.                 Moore,

 5   and apply it to this context, I assume that in the

 6   context of an acquittal if you tried to bring a claim

 7   like this, this Court would interpret through the common

 8   law the -- a malicious prosecution type element that you

 9   would have to satisfy.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:          Why is it difficult to

11   allege fabrication?      The -- the allegation is that at

12   point A this witness denied that the defendant did

13   anything wrong, and then at point B the defendant told

14   an entirely different story after having received from

15   the government a plea deal that promises no prosecution

16   and entry into the witness protection program or

17   something like that.      That certainly is sufficient

18   evidence to -- of fabrication, is it not?

19               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, Justice Alito, let me

20   say this.   First of all, you are going to have to

21   pinpoint those kind of allegations pre-probable cause,

22   which is not going to be the case in a lot of cases.

23               Second of all, I mean, this Court --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't know what you mean

25   by that.


                                      31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. CLEMENT:       In -- in the typical case,

 2   if -- if the witness perhaps in the first instance comes

 3   up with one testimony and later comes up in -- with a

 4   different story later, the question for purposes of

 5   absolute immunity is going to be, did all of the conduct

 6   that you're alleging, the fabrication, did all of it

 7   take place before probable cause attached?               And in a lot

 8   of cases prosecutors don't even get involved until after

 9   probable cause, until after there have been arrests,

10   something like that.     And in those cases --

11                JUSTICE ALITO:         That's an entirely false

12   picture of the way any sophisticated prosecution is

13   handled today, completely false.               You want -- the

14   prosecutor may not know whether there's probable cause

15   until the prosecutor interviews the witness.

16                MR. CLEMENT:       And, again --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:         And so then you have to go

18   back and determine whether there was -- if there wasn't

19   probable cause before the interview, then there is

20   liability.   But if there was probable cause before the

21   interview, then there isn't liability.

22                MR. CLEMENT:       I think if I understand your

23   hypothetical, the question would actually be whether

24   there was probable cause before the re-interview,

25   because if at the point --


                                      32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE ALITO:          Before the re-interview,

 2   because the prosecutor doesn't want to take the case to

 3   the grand jury before looking this witness in the eye

 4   and seeing whether this -- this guy who's got a lot of

 5   impeachment baggage is -- is a -- is a credible witness.

 6                MR. CLEMENT:        Well, two things, Justice

 7   Alito.    First of all, if you have all -- if you had the

 8   interview and the re-interview before probable cause and

 9   you have the allegations that it was done for the avowed

10   purpose of depriving the person of their liberty, then

11   you would, I think, apply Iqbal, and you would ask under

12   all the circumstances of that case whether it's a

13   plausible allegation.

14                And this Court is obviously in a better

15   position than I am to say how it would apply Iqbal in

16   those kind of cases.      But what I can tell you is that

17   for nearly a decade the Second Circuit has had this

18   rule.    Now, the Second Circuit is the circuit that

19   brought you Iqbal.     So for that same decade they did not

20   have the rule of Iqbal, and yet they didn't have a

21   torrent of these claims.

22                So, I think going forward, if you recognize

23   these claims --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How -- how do you --

25   I mean, we hear that type of argument every time,


                                       33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   because there is usually a circuit conflict here, and

 2   you look at one circuit and say the world hasn't fallen.

 3   But you have no idea how many of these claims are

 4   asserted and dismissed at an early stage or -- or

 5   whatever.

 6               You're saying, what, that there haven't been

 7   many Second Circuit opinions on this question?

 8               MR. CLEMENT:          I think if you look at

 9   reported, both unpublished and published Second Circuit

10   decisions at the district court level and the court of

11   appeals level, you would find very few cases that even

12   cite Zahrey.   I think it's something like maybe 17 I

13   think is what we found.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you think there

15   will be -- do you think there will be more if we agree

16   with your theory?

17               MR. CLEMENT:          In the Second Circuit?          I

18   don't think so.     I think it will be the same number in

19   the Second Circuit.

20               Now, in the Seventh Circuit that has lived

21   with the Buckley remand rule, I suppose there will now

22   be a couple of dozen cases there.                  But I do think it's

23   revealing that the circuit that has certainly the kind

24   of cases that Justice Alito was dealing with, has not

25   had a flood of these cases.             As far as I'm aware, the


                                        34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   U.S. attorney's offices in that circuit have not had to

 2   rework the way they do business in those circuits, and I

 3   do think that these are claims that are going to be

 4   difficult to allege.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, but it's also

 6   you don't really know, right?            In other words, we're

 7   concerned about the chilling effect on the prosecutors.

 8   We don't know what the impact of the Second Circuit's

 9   decision has been on the prosecutors.

10              MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Your Honor, we don't

11   know for sure.   We don't know either way, because either

12   way this Court is going to adopt a clear rule.                What I

13   can say is at least I'm pointing to empirical evidence

14   in a circuit that has lived with this rule for a decade.

15   That seems to me a better empirical basis to go on than

16   absolutely nothing.

17              But let me give you another example, which

18   is this Court a couple of years ago decided a decision

19   called Hartman v. Moore.        Hartman v. Moore sort of

20   recognized that there was a tort called, I think,

21   retaliatory inducement to prosecute.

22              Now, in footnote 8 this Court recognized

23   that actually you could sue a prosecutor for retaliatory

24   inducement to prosecute if you focused on the

25   investigatory activities.         That's exactly the same basic


                                      35
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   theory we have here, which is you focus on the

 2   investigatory activities of a prosecutor and say that

 3   there is a valid 1983 claim.

 4              Now, again, to my knowledge there have not

 5   been a flood of Hartman claims brought against

 6   prosecutors.     I think --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What -- what is the

 8   basis for the 1983 claim without the submission at

 9   trial?

10              MR. CLEMENT:           Without the submission at

11   trial -- I mean, it would depend, I suppose, on the

12   circumstances.    You could have, certainly, a Fourth

13   Amendment --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, you know I'm

15   not talking about the Fourth Amendment violation, which

16   is complete whether there's a trial or not.

17              MR. CLEMENT:           Well -- and then maybe I just

18   need a concrete hypothetical.              Let's say -- let's say --

19   let me -- let me provide one.              Suppose that there was

20   this -- the prosecutor put on this fabricated evidence

21   at trial, and then the -- the whole case sort of

22   unraveled because the system actually worked the way

23   it's supposed to.     On cross-examination the witness

24   cracked and it became clear that there was this

25   conspiracy to use perjured evidence.


                                        36
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              Now, at that point -- I mean, I suppose the

 2   government's theory would be because you never deprived

 3   the person of their liberty, the knowing use by the

 4   prosecutor of perjured testimony at trial does not

 5   violate the due process clause.

 6              But I hope that's not the rule.                  I mean, I

 7   hope that in a Mooney case, if you bring the -- make a

 8   Mooney violation against somebody who is actually

 9   guilty, so you knowingly use perjured testimony against

10   somebody that's -- that's guilty, so if you did a

11   harmless error analysis, you would say, well, the use of

12   the perjured testimony really didn't deprive the person

13   of their liberty because they were otherwise --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What's -- what's -- what's

15   your best authority for the proposition that there's

16   liability in the case the Chief Justice put?                 What's

17   your best case?

18              MR. CLEMENT:         I -- I -- I'm not sure I have

19   a best case for that, Justice Kennedy.                 I mean, let

20   me -- let me give you what I think is a very good case

21   that illustrates a similar principle, but I -- I will --

22   I will be candid that I think this is an extrapolation

23   from Mooney, but a very sort of clear extrapolation from

 1   because their proposition seems to be that -- this is

 2   the other argument you have heard and rejected -- is

 3   that if there's an absolutely immune act in the causal

 4   chain, then that somehow means that there is no

 5   violation.

 6                 Think about who was sued in the Malley.                  It

 7   was the police officers.         What did the police officers

 8   do?   They procured an invalid arrest warrant.                   Now, did

 9   their actions independent of the absolute immune act of

10   the magistrate injure the plaintiffs?                   No.   Without the

11   magistrate issuing the warrant, there was no arrest,

12   there's no search, there's no injury to the plaintiffs.

13                 So we allow in our system somebody to bring

14   a constitutional tort claim, even though there's an

15   absolutely immune act in the causal chain.

16                 The lower court in Malley actually accepted

17   exactly this argument, that if you have any absolutely

18   immune act in the causal chain that breaks it off.                    This

19   Court rejected it and was frankly fairly dismissive,

20   dismissed it in the footnote, footnote 7 of the opinion.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You will have to refresh

22   my memory.    Wasn't that a Fourth Amendment violation

23   ultimately?

24                 MR. CLEMENT:       It was a Fourth Amendment

25   violation.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So that -- so that's

 2   not --

 3                MR. CLEMENT:       No, I think it illustrates the

 4   principle, which is you don't have to have a completed

 5   constitutional violation in your 1983 action.              I mean,

 6   Malley illustrates that principle, but so does the text

 7   of -- of section 1983, frankly.              Section 1983 doesn't

 8   force you to have a completed constitutional violation.

 9   It provides liability if you subject someone to a

10   constitutional violation or cause them to be subjected

11   to a constitutional violation.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:          The difference here is that

13   the -- the absolutely immune act which follows the --

14   the unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by

15   the very actor who performed the earlier act that --

16   that you say induces liability.              And so the argument is,

17   what's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if

18   you can simply drag him into litigation by -- by

19   alleging that he at an earlier stage committed a

20   violation?

21                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, the --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's the difference.     I

23   mean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is

24   the same actor who has absolute liability whom you're

25   trying to get on the basis of -- of earlier action.

 1               MR. CLEMENT:        Well --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's the reason the rule

 3   seems perverse.

 4               MR. CLEMENT:        What's that?

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's the very reason the

 6   rule they're arguing for seems perverse.

 7               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I would ask -- I would

 8   ask both of you to go back and read two things, and I

 9   would particularly like Justice Scalia to go back and

10   read your separate opinion in Burns.                   Because in Burns

11   you confronted just this issue.              You conceptualized what

12   happens at the warrant stage as a variant of malicious

13   prosecution and you said:         Now, could a prosecutor, sort

14   of as kind of a complaining witness in that context,

15   procure a warrant that they were subsequently involved

16   in?   And you said:    I don't see any reason why not.                I

17   think you got it right there.

18               The other thing I would ask you to look at

19   is footnote 8 of the Hartman v. Moore decision, because

20   there you were dealing with a retaliatory prosecution

21   claim.   Now, the Court's opinion was very careful to

22   say, you know, it's really not a retaliation -- a

23   retaliatory prosecution claim; what it is is a

24   retaliatory inducement to prosecute case.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If you cannot rely


                                      40

 1   on anything that goes on at the trial to establish the

 2   due process violation, what do you rely on to establish

 3   the violation?

 4               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, Mr. Chief Justice --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I guess the question

 6   is where is it complete, or do you say it doesn't have

 7   to be a complete violation?

 8               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I guess what I would do,

 9   Mr. Chief Justice, is try to take issue with your

10   premise, which is that we can't advert to the absolute

11   immune act at all.    Of course we can.                I mean, this

12   isn't --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, let's say that

14   you -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler

15   as conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the

16   trial.   And if you can't advert to that, you don't have

17   a constitutional violation, right?

18               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I would still say we do,

19   but please let me try to take one more crack at the

20   premise, which is Imbler is not a use immunity case and

21   this Court has rejected the proposition that just

22   because you're absolutely immune for an act there's no

23   evidentiary use of that in going after conduct that was

24   earlier in the causal chain.

25               This Court specifically confronted that in a


                                      41

 1   case called Dennis v. Sparks that was with, you know,

 2   the granddaddy of them all, judicial immunity, and said

 3   even the judge's actions could be proved up as part of a

 4   tort action.     So there is no use immunity for --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Against -- against

 6   the judge?

 7                 MR. CLEMENT:        It wasn't against the judge,

 8   but I -- but with all due respect, I don't think that

 9   matters.     And I also think --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that's the

11   distinction here in this case, isn't it?

12                 MR. CLEMENT:        Well, but -- but it's a

13   distinction without a difference.                  It's a distinction

14   this Court confronted in -- in Hartman in footnote 8.

15   It's a distinction Justice Scalia confronted.                  And also,

16   the consequences of accepting their view is to really

17   turn all of your absolute immunity cases into a fool's

18   errand.

19                 I mean, think about Kalina.                I mean, the

20   supporting affidavit wasn't the thing that inflicted

21   injury.    Now, the thing that inflicted injury were the

22   two documents that the supporting affidavit supported,

23   the warrant and the information.                 Now, it would have

24   made no sense for this Court to say, well, there is only

25   qualified immunity for the supporting affidavit, so

 1   let's send this back to the lower court, if you couldn't

 2   even get into evidence the fact that there was an

 3   information or a warrant.

 4                So too in the Malley case, of course you

 5   can use -- now it's a different -- it's a different

 6   person.   In Kalina -- Kalina, it's the same person.

 7               Or take a look at Burns, for example.                   In

 8   Burns the prosecutor's advice to the police officer,

 9   that's not what injured the plaintiff in that case.                      It

10   was the warrant that was eventually procured.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                In terms of the

12   chilling impact on the prosecutor, what difference does

13   it make whether it's at trial or pretrial for use at

14   trial?

15               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I think it makes all the

16   difference in the world in the sense that if -- if they

17   know that everything they do at trial is going to be

18   protected, those functions, which is the basis of this

19   Court's functional approach to absolute immunity, are

20   going to be protected.       Now, if they're going to be --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But it won't be protected.

22   They won't have that assurance, because when they --

23   when they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess

24   the production at trial will be protected, but you're --

25   you're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but


                                      43

 1   you got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we

 2   can sue you, not for introducing it at trial, but for

 3   fabricating it before trial.

 4                I -- I don't see that there is much of a

 5   difference as far as the deterrent effect upon the

 6   prosecutor is concerned.

 7                MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I think there is going

 8   to be an effect on the deterrent effect on the

 9   prosecutor pretrial, which is they will be procured.                       I

10   mean, think about the contrary incentive you're --

11   you're creating.     Suppose you're a prosecutor.                 You've

12   participated in the misconduct before trial.                   You now

13   have the decision to make:           Okay, I was -- I was

14   complicit in the fabrication of this perjured evidence;

15   should I put it on into evidence?                 Well, let's see.       If

16   I don't put it on into evidence and I come clean now,

17   I'm actually liable for the arrest and all the pretrial

18   detention.   If I actually introduce it into evidence

19   now, I'm scot-free.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           There's a different

21   tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what

22   you're describing.     I'm more worried about what Justice

23   Alito brought up, that, other things being equal, I

24   think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors

25   involved in the questioning process.                    That -- that has a


                                       44
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   kind of check on the police.

 2                 And the concern I'd have is that the --this

 3   will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved

 4   in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least

 5   not before the police are well on the way.                     And that is

 6   a very negative incentive, I would think.

 7                 So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule

 8   that you could live with that will in fact minimize the

 9   risk of that kind of disincentive?                  Now, are you just

10   going to say, well, Buckley?

11                 MR. CLEMENT:        Well --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Or is there something -- I

13   mean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable

14   cause.     It turns on and off as you're talking to the

15   witness.     First what he says, you have the probable

16   cause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't.                     I

17   mean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best

18   thought to this problem and tell me what is the most

19   safe rule that will allow you to win your case?

20                 MR. CLEMENT:        Well, Justice Breyer, I mean,

21   I would say that there is no reason for this Court to

22   disturb the line it drew in Buckley.                     Now I could,

23   because of this case --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           We have amicus briefs here

25   that give us a lot of reason.              They say -- they say it's

 1   very discouraging to, you know, AUSAs or DAs going in

 2   and talking to the witnesses with the police.

 3               MR. CLEMENT:          Well --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             And they say they do it in

 5   Chicago, I think.     In other places, they do it a lot.

 6               MR. CLEMENT:          Well, I mean, another thing

 7   presumably, Justice Breyer, you want to encourage is

 8   having the police officers come to the prosecutors and

 9   get legal advice about what they're doing.                      And this

10   Court squarely confronted that question in Burns and

11   said the advice-giving function, which is a function

12   only a prosecutor, only a lawyer anyways, can perform --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, could you answer

14   Justice Breyer's question, which I -- I think raises a

15   -- a critical point in terms of Justice Alito's examples

16   of talking to the witness.            Why isn't that at some

17   point -- I think in Buckley, the "judicial phase."                         Why

18   is this the judicial phase?

19               MR. CLEMENT:          Well, Justice Kennedy, let me

20   respond.   Let me say why I don't think I can really

21   improve on the probable cause line.                      I mean, in this

22   case, the police officers and the prosecutors were

23   involved in this from the get-go.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              No, but probable cause

25   doesn't work because you have -- you have probable cause


                                        46

 1   once you fabricate the evidence.

 2              MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I think --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That's circular.

 4              MR. CLEMENT:        No, I don't think so.      I think

 5   for the purposes of evaluating when there's probable

 6   cause, you have to eliminate the fabricated evidence,

 7   and so I think that you evaluate probable cause, but

 8   here's why I think it's the right line, Because think

 9   about the prosecutor's special function.

10              If you don't have probable cause to arrest

11   any individual for a crime, then the function the police

12   officers ought to be performing is one of a

13   truth-seeking function and that is a classic police

14   investigatory function.

15              Now, the moment they have probable cause,

16   I'm willing to listen to the argument that at that point

17   they shift roles, and at that point they're not looking

18   at the evidence the way the police officer is, just to

19   find out whodunit; but they're looking at it to say,

20   well I have a job to do, I have to put a case on, and,

21   you know, this person says what they say, and, you know,

22   there's some problems with that and the jury's not going

23   to believe that, so let me talk to him some more.

24              That's why I think the probable cause line

25   is not only administrable, but it makes sense in this


                                     47

 1   context.

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose the prosecutor

 3   isn't sure there's probable cause and he calls -- calls

 4   in the accountant, the CFO, and really doesn't begin to

 5   believe his story, so he starts probing and finally he

 6   gets the CFO to change his story with the plea -- plea

 7   bargain.   Would that be part of the judicial process?

 8   Or is that still clearly investigatory?

 9               MR. CLEMENT:        I think at the point -- if the

10   interview begins and he doesn't think he has probable

11   cause, I think that that --

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, he's trying to find

13   out.   That's what --

14               MR. CLEMENT:        Of course he is trying to find

15   out.   But he's -- but he's not trying to find out if

16   there's probable cause necessarily to identify a

17   particular suspect.      What he's trying to do, is there

18   probable cause to arrest anyone?               And that's exactly the

19   question a police officer asks every single day.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, also, you're making

21   me more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all

22   the defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might

23   be a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved

24   in the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they

25   don't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're


                                      48

 1   going to take somebody, put them in jail.

 2                 Maybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing

 3   it back a little bit, this -- this line.

 4                 MR. CLEMENT:       Well -- you know, I'm not sure

 5   what the logical place to push it back any further is,

 6   and I think -- you know --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Where have you got it now?

 8   You've got it as when there is probable cause for

 9   believing that someone has committed a crime?

10                 MR. CLEMENT:       Yes.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Someone?         So it's

12   someone -- needn't be the particular person they

13   eventually indict?

14                 MR. CLEMENT:       That's right.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Uh-huh.

16                 MR. CLEMENT:       And let me say this, Justice

17   Breyer, I mean, I know you don't want to talk about

18   Burns, but I'd like to, just for a second, because I

19   think it's a very similar policy concern.

20                 As a policy matter, sure, we want

21   prosecutors to get -- to give advice to police officers,

22   but qualified immunity is not insignificant protection,

23   and think about that, I mean, the incentives you're

24   creating for the same anomaly that the Court recognized

25   in Buckley.    The incentive would really --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, we thought it

 2   was -- I'm sorry.     Why don't you finish your answer?

 3              MR. CLEMENT:           I just wanted to say the

 4   incentive would really be perverse.                      Under Burns, if the

 5   police -- if the police officer comes to the prosecutor

 6   and says -- you know, we want to fabricate evidence to

 7   frame it, can we do it?         And the prosecutor says, yes,

 8   you can do that, go ahead; there's qualified immunity.

 9              Now, if the prosecutor says, go ahead and

10   let me help, there would somehow be absolute immunity.

11   I mean, that is really an anomalous result, that it's

12   the n anomaly that caused this Court in Buckley to draw

13   the line at probable cause.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I was going to

15   suggest in response to your point that -- you know,

16   qualified immunity is really significant.                     Of course, it

17   is, but we've recognized, in a number of contexts, in

18   the judicial area, for example, that it's -- it's not

19   enough.

20              We have also recognized that in the

21   prosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where

22   you do -- I think this was one of the points Justice

23   Alito was making, is that, sometimes, you're

24   investigating and preparing your case at the same time.

25              You don't just sit back and say, I'm -- I'm


                                        50

 1   just going to look and see what I can find.              You have

 2   particular areas.     The prosecution requires you to show

 3   four things, So you are looking at those four things.

 4   You are preparing your case, and you're investigating.

 5                MR. CLEMENT:         And, again, the Court

 6   addressed exactly this Court in the -- exactly that

 7   issue in the Buckley decision and said, sure -- you

 8   know, from -- with the benefit of hindsight, you can

 9   sort of retrospectively look and make anything in the

10   investigatory stage part of -- and part and parcel of

11   the prosecution.

12                And I don't think that was something that

13   this Court saw as a reason not to draw a clean line

14   that's consistent with the functional approach.             It's

15   consistent, not just with Buckley, but with Burns and

16   with Kalina and with a whole host of this Court's

17   decisions.

18                JUSTICE ALITO:           In -- in answer to Justice

19   Breyer's question, would -- would it be a -- would it be

20   practical and conceptually correct to draw the line at

21   the stage at which the prosecutor is interviewing

22   witnesses to evaluate credibility?

23                So, at that stage, the prosecutorial

24   function has begun and absolute immunity would kick in.

25                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, if I could add, I mean,


                                        51

 1   I suppose I might be able --

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Not on whether there is

 3   probable cause because probable cause is -- is

 4   evanescent.    It comes, and it goes.                   It is -- it is --

 5   it is inextricably intertwined with what the prosecutor

 6   is doing in questioning the witness.

 7                 MR. CLEMENT:       And let me say this:             If I

 8   could add a couple of words, I think we could probably

 9   live with that line, which is, if the prosecutor is

10   interviewing those witnesses with an eye towards

11   credibility for use at trial, I mean, that's a line

12   that, I think, would be, I think, probably pretty

13   consistent with probable cause, but something that we

14   could live with, but --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But with a line toward

16   investigating credibility for use at a trial, which

17   is -- which is, at that point, foreordained, but, if the

18   evaluation is being done for the purpose of determining

19   whether there should be a trial, then, no.                    That's your

20   answer?

21                 MR. CLEMENT:       Well, I mean, I worry that

22   words are being put in my mouth.                I would say that, if

23   the prosecutor is interviewing the witness for the

24   purpose of judging their credibility at trial, then

25   that's something for which you may be able to sort of


                                       52

 1   tweak the line on Buckley and say that's covered.

 2              I actually think it won't make any

 3   difference because I think that should only be happening

 4   after probable cause.        If I could --

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, your approach,

 6   then, encourages prosecutors to be trigger happy.

 7   They're prosecuting right now because they know, then,

 8   that everything else, they have absolute immunity, so --

 9   you know, shoot first and ask questions later.

10              MR. CLEMENT:           Well, shoot first -- you mean

11   go to an impartial magistrate and try to get somebody

12   arrested or --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   No, just begin the

14   formulation.     I'm -- I'm starting to prosecute this

15   person, rather than saying, let's look, let's

16   investigate, let's interview, and then decide who we're

17   going to prosecute.

18              MR. CLEMENT:           Well, I suppose --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   In Justice Alito's

20   hypothetical, you've got a CFO, you can -- you know,

21   you've probably got probable cause to go after him as

22   well, but you want to begin interviewing him, to see if

23   he's going to flip in your case against the CEO.

24              MR. CLEMENT:           Well, if you have probable

25   cause, then I think you're on the other side of the


                                        53

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Buckley line, and that's an objective determination, and

 2   I think --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So you've got --

 4   you've got to make that decision early in the process,

 5   rather than later.

 6                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, I think it's -- I'm not

 7   sure it's a decision you have to make.                 I think it's

 8   actually something that would be evaluated objectively

 9   after the fact, and I think the way that this Court

10   should approach this case is neither of the parties

11   before you have asked this Court to overturn Buckley.

12                I wouldn't do it under those circumstances,

13   but, of course, it's worth adding that, if you were

14   going to overturn Buckley, then the place to probably

15   start would be to go back to first principles, and if

16   you're going to go back to first principles, then what

17   you're going to find is that there was no common law

18   support at all for absolute immunity.

19                And I wouldn't think that this Court was

20   particularly interested in coming up with implied

21   immunities that aren't in the statute and had no basis

22   at the common law, and that's why I think some of the

23   Justices that have looked at this as an original matter

24   have tended to be quite reluctant in recognizing

25   absolute immunity because it lacks support in the text


                                      54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and it lacks support at the common law.

 2               So we're -- we're happy with the lines that

 3   this Court has already drawn.            But if the Court's going

 4   to go back to first principles, well, let's go back to

 5   first principles and look at -- the at the statute

 6   Congress passed in 1871.

 7               That statute did not provide any immunities,

 8   and I do think, as we say in the brief, this is a case

 9   where it's important not to lose the forest for the

10   trees because this is a statute was passed -- passed in

11   1871.   This is one of the great civil rights statutes.

12               Is it really plausible to think that the

13   Congress that passed this statute didn't want to provide

14   a remedy in the circumstances before the Court today?           I

15   think it's clear, from this Court's cases -- there may

16   not be a case that lines up all the dots exactly, but I

17   think it's clear, from this Court's cases, that the

18   police officer that engages in this misconduct has

19   committed a grave, grave constitutional violation and

20   ought to be liable.

21               I think the prosecutor who engages in the

22   pretrial misconduct and then doesn't participate in the

23   trial is just as liable as that police officer, and I

24   can't think of a single reason why the only reason a

25   prosecutor would get absolute immunity is, if they not


                                      55
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   only participated in the pretrial misconduct, but

 2   completed the scheme by committing further misconduct at

 3   trial.

 4                For all those reasons, we think the Court

 5   should affirm.   Thank you.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

 7   Mr. Clement.

 8                Mr. Sanders, you have five -- five minutes

 9   remaining.

10            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SANDERS

11                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12                MR. SANDERS:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13   We have four main points.

14                Beginning with the Second Circuit's decision

15   in Zahrey and subsequent cases in the Second Circuit,

16   have significantly cut back on the meaning of Zahrey.

17   The Wray decision, which we discussed in our reply

18   brief, the Gonzalez decision, which we discussed in our

19   opening brief, have not allowed for this kind of

20   continuous liability for a prosecutor.

21                They have made very clear, particularly the

22   Gonzalez decision, that when it is a prosecutor's

23   actions before a judge advocating on behalf of the

24   State, that are responsible for a deprivation of

25   liberty, in that situation, absolute immunity applies.

 1                I think it's important to understand the

 2   consequences --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:           What -- what does that

 4   prove?   What does that prove?           I don't understand why

 5   you bring that up because it shows that the fact that

 6   there aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second

 7   Circuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second

 8   Circuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your

 9   opponent suggests.

10               Is that --

11               MR. SANDERS:        No, Your Honor.          I think it's

12   to -- I think it's to say that the Zahrey decision has

13   not had the kind of impact and has not been applied in a

14   way that respondents are asking for it to be applied.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.       That's -- that's just

16   what I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied

17   that way, there would have been more than 17 cases in

18   the Second Circuit.

19               MR. SANDERS:        I'm not sure I understand the

20   question.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

22               MR. SANDERS:        The -- I think it's important

23   to understand the consequences of affirming the courts

24   below, either on the basis of the Zahrey theory or on

25   the freestanding due process theory offered by


                                      57

 1   respondents.

 2                 It would work a radical change in the law of

 3   immunity because it would mean that far more wrongful

 4   conviction claims against prosecutors would go forward

 5   under only qualified immunity.

 6                 That is the inevitable consequence of

 7   affirming the courts below in this case.                These cases

 8   are not difficult, as Justice Alito said, to plead,

 9   particularly because, in most of these sorts of cases,

10   most of the discovery will have been done during the

11   post-conviction review process.

12                 And so there will be plenty of -- plenty of

13   grounds for a plaintiff to allege a plausible violation

14   during the investigative process and survive a motion to

15   dismiss or survive summary judgment, even if,

16   ultimately, that comes to nothing, the consequence would

17   be to hold prosecutors to inconsistent standards of

18   liability, qualified immunity or absolute immunity,

19   based simply on the allegations in a complaint,

20   something this Court has specifically said is -- is not

21   appropriate and should not be --

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I want, before you're

23   finished, to get a clear picture of your view of the

24   dimensions of the claim because you rely heavily on the

25   trial part.    Everything proceeds as it was alleged to


                                       58

 1   have proceeded in this case, except that just before the

 2   trial begins, Harris comes forward and said it was all a

 3   pack of lies, and so there is no trial.

 4                MR. SANDERS:        Uh-huh.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is anyone in this picture

 6   liable?    The defendants have been incarcerated for some

 7   time, but when it blows up, they're let out.                 No trial,

 8   but everything else, the same.

 9                MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, I believe there

10   would be no due process liability.                 There might be two

11   independent grounds for liability under some Fourth

12   Amendment malicious prosecution theory, which is not at

13   issue in this case, and possibly under State law

14   remedies, as Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas

15   indicated in their concurrence in Albright, we do not go

16   to the Federal constitution's Due Process Clause unless

17   we're sure that the plaintiffs have exhausted their

18   possible remedies under State law.                 In this case, Iowa

19   State law provides a cause of action for malicious

20   prosecution.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You said -- I think your

22   position is that due process begins when trial is

23   underway, and before that due process doesn't enter the

24   picture?

25                MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, I believe that

 1   this Court's decisions make clear that due process

 2   applies to the judicial process; that is, the filing of

 3   charges and the later conduct of the prosecuting --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but what about the

 5   pretrial detention?      Isn't that a deprivation of

 6   liberty?

 7                MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, it would be, but

 8   that would be Fourth Amendment territory.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why would it be Fourth

10   Amendment?    Why isn't it Fourteenth Amendment right on

11   the nose?    They're deprived of liberty without due

12   process of law.

13                MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, this Court --

14   seven justices in this Court's decision in Albright

15   agreed that there was no due process cause of action for

16   the wrongful institution of criminal proceedings, that

17   in that case there may be some sort of Fourth Amendment

18   claim.    There may be some sort of State law claim under

19   Parrot v. Taylor, but I have not --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that case talked about

21   the institution of prosecution, not the deprivation of

22   liberty during pretrial detention, which is a different

23   matter.

24                MR. SANDERS:        Your Honor, I believe the

25   Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would still

 1   indicate that that is a concern of the Fourth Amendment,

 2   not the Due Process Clause, and that pursuant to Paul v.

 3   Davis and Parrot v. Taylor, there may indeed be some

 4   sort of State law cause of action for defamation or loss

 5   of status, but that there is no support for a Federal

 6   due process claim.
