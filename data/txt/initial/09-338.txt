 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We will hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 09-338,

 5   Renico v. Lett.

 6                  Mr. McGormley.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                  MR. McGORMLEY:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11                  Because this is a habeas case arising from a

12   murder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the

13   threshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any

14   clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the

15   Michigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied

16   in rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had

17   abused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due

18   to deadlock.

19                  The Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas,

20   ignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad

21   discretion, due the trial court determination.                      Here

22   there was a note suggesting acrimonious deliberations

23   received early on in the second day of deliberations,

24   followed by a second note suggesting a deadlock after

25   approximately 10 hours of trial testimony and 4 hours of


                                          3

 1   deliberations.

 2                The trial court at that time engaged the

 3   foreperson in a colloquy, a two-part colloquy, in which

 4   the foreperson not only confirmed the content of the

 5   first note, but also confirmed the existence of a

 6   deadlock.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Excuse me.         The content

 8   of the first note was a query of the court.                     And that

 9   query was:   "What happens if we can't reach a verdict?"

10   Isn't that substantially different?                     Doesn't that

11   suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are

12   the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a

13   consensus is possible?

14                MR. McGORMLEY:            Well, Justice Sotomayor, the

15   first note was the note regarding our raised voices

16   disturbing other proceedings.             The second note

17   regards -

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Excuse me.        How long

19   before that last note was that?

20                MR. McGORMLEY:            Well, the Michigan Supreme

21   Court refers to that as early on in the second day of

22   deliberations.   And then there is approximately 3 hours

23   and 15 more minutes of deliberations, because after the

24   second note -

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Did anybody hear the

 1   voices?

 2               MR. McGORMLEY:               The record doesn't disclose,

 3   doesn't disclose that.

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Could you tell me what

 5   facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show

 6   that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our

 7   earlier Perez case, the very first in this area,

 8   "deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously" in

 9   declaring a mistrial.        What in the facts you have

10   recited -

11               MR. McGORMLEY:               Well -

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                -- show that activity?

13               MR. McGORMLEY:               Justice Sotomayor, the first

14   point I would make is that, of course, this is on habeas

15   review, and so the -- the Michigan Supreme Court made

16   factual findings here that would be due deference.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                What is the factual

18   finding that you think we have to give deference to?                   I

19   know the facts you've recited.                There don't appear to be

20   any of the facts with respect to what occurred during

21   the activity.   So what factual finding do we have to

22   give deference to?

23               MR. McGORMLEY:               Well, the factual finding by

24   the Michigan Supreme Court that -- that there appeared

25   to be acrimonious deliberations.                 That's a factual


                                          5

 1   finding due deference under (e)(1).

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But I'm not sure how

 3   that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that

 4   the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not

 5   precipitously.

 6                MR. McGORMLEY:            Going back to this Court's

 7   opinion in Perez, considering sound judgment,

 8   discretion, considering all the circumstances, here we

 9   have to look at the totality of the circumstances in

10   that it was a relatively short trial, that we have a

11   note that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious

12   deliberations, the second note that could be reasonably

13   construed as a deadlock.

14                And then the trial court did not declare a

15   mistrial at that point.        Rather, the trial court brings

16   the jury out and engages in a colloquy.                 And in that

17   colloquy, the trial court accepts the foreperson's

18   answer at her word.     And that is:             "Are you going to be

19   able to reach unanimous verdict?"                The answer being:

20   "No."   And in fact, it's the Sixth Circuit who

21   second-guessed in this case by saying:                  You can't place

22   that much weight on that statement by the foreperson.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Because the foreperson at

24   first hesitated.   When the court asked the question,

25   "Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not,"


                                        6

 1   then there's no response.            And then the court says, "Yes

 2   or no?"     And only at that second point does the

 3   foreperson say "no."         So it was a reluctant "no."

 4                 MR. McGORMLEY:             I don't necessarily believe

 5   it was a reluctant no.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             She might have been

 7   sneezing.    I mean, we don't know what caused the pause,

 8   do we?

 9                 MR. McGORMLEY:             That's correct,

10   Justice Scalia.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that's another factor

12   in this.    We have the transcript.                Are you urging that,

13   because the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw

14   the jury, worked with the jury, that that's something

15   that deserves a special measure of respect?

16                 MR. McGORMLEY:             Absolutely,

17   Justice Ginsburg.     And this Court has qualified that as

18   broad discretion and special respect due the trial court

19   determination, after the trial court is the one viewing

20   the jury in real time.         So absolutely.             And in fact,

21   this -- this risk of coercion was recognized also by

22   this Court in Arizona v. Washington.

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:             May I ask you another

24   question about what happened?

25                 After the foreperson said:                  No, Judge, we


                                          7

 1   are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge

 2   says:   All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury

 3   is dismissed.     And then the next entry in the transcript

 4   that we have is:     Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we

 5   could set a new trial date.               Now, Mr. Gordon was defense

 6   -- was the defense attorney?

 7                  MR. McGORMLEY:            Correct, Your Honor.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:            So when did he leave?         Do we

 9   know when he left?      He was present when the judge said

10   that she was going to declare a mistrial?

11                  MR. McGORMLEY:            Correct.         But I don't know

12   that minute or so gap.         I don't know when Mr. Gordon

13   snuck out.

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you tell me, along the

15   line of -- the same line of questioning, I understand

16   about AEDPA.     I understand about deference, the

17   jurisdictions.     Just tell me a little bit about how this

18   often works in State courts and in Federal courts?

19                  Would it be good practice, in your view -

20   and that may not control your case, but would it be good

21   practice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this

22   colloquy and then say:         The jurors are dismissed while I

23   talk with counsel.      And you say:             Counsel, in light of

24   this response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial.                      Do

25   you have any comment?

 1                 Is that good practice?

 2                 MR. McGORMLEY:            It may be good practice, but

 3   the question becomes whether it's constitutionally

 4   required.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm asking -- I'm asking

 6   if it's good practice as a general practice.

 7                 MR. McGORMLEY:            I would say -- well, in this

 8   Court -

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Because -- because that

10   will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue.                   I

11   understand deference.       I understand that all intendments

12   are in favor of what the State Supreme Court found.                     I'm

13   just -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in

14   the real world?

15                 MR. McGORMLEY:            Well, I believe that

16   discussion with counsel is a factor in -- in the

17   consideration.    I don't dispute that.                  But this Court

18   has never held that it's a requirement.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if, in fact, there

20   isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not

21   declare a mistrial?      Can the judge go ahead and declare

22   a mistrial?

23                 MR. McGORMLEY:            Absolutely.        And here -- and

24   here's why.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not a very big fact.

 1                MR. McGORMLEY:          Well, it's important in the

 2   coercion context, because certainly the trial court has

 3   an independent obligation to ensure a just judgment.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That independent

 5   obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views

 6   just as a matter of good practice?

 7                MR. McGORMLEY:          It may be.           It may be

 8   reinforced in certain circumstances, but again, we are

 9   looking at the totality of the circumstances when we

10   have a note indicating acrimony, a note indicating

11   deadlock, and then the colloquy in which there's an

12   unequivocal -

13                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, certainly it's good

14   practice.   If both counsel agree that there is manifest

15   necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a

16   double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right?

17                MR. McGORMLEY:          Correct.           Under Dennis, if

18   the defendant consents, then there is no double

19   jeopardy.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Was there an objection here

21   by counsel for the defendant?

22                MR. McGORMLEY:          No.      No, there wasn't.       But,

23   you know, the colloquy is relatively short.                    But no, I

24   believe the defendant's counsel could have objected.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, there was a ruling


                                       10

 1   by the court:    I hereby declare a mistrial.                  I suppose

 2   you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the

 3   jury was present when the judge said:                    I hereby declare

 4   the mistrial.

 5                MR. McGORMLEY:           Correct.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So it would be rather

 7   awkward for the counsel at that is point.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was no -- there was

 9   no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and

10   the court then said immediately afterward:                   The jury is

11   dismissed.   So there was no interval for an objection?

12                MR. McGORMLEY:           Well, it -- it would be

13   difficult for counsel to object at that point, but I

14   still think counsel could have made a record immediately

15   at that point.

16                JUSTICE ALITO:           Why would it have been

17   difficult?   Why would it be difficult for counsel to

18   say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't

19   think that there should be a mistrial, I think you

20   should ask the jury to deliberate further?

21                MR. McGORMLEY:           Well, that is possible and

22   that as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial

23   court -- this is a circuit court -

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            What do you make of the

25   fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor


                                        11

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   acknowledged that the judge made a mistake?

 2                  MR. McGORMLEY:          In Michigan confessions of

 3   error are controlled by court rule as a procedural

 4   matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to

 5   accept statements that could be qualified as a

 6   confession of error or not.              Here the Michigan Supreme

 7   Court addressed this case on the merits, the underlying

 8   double jeopardy merits.          In much the same way, it did

 9   not address potential waiver or consent issues by the

10   defendant.     So we have a merits opinion here.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:           There are thousands and

12   thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are

13   not all that unusual.        So in this case we have testimony

14   going on for 4 days, 10 hours total.                      And we have jury

15   deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very

16   little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the

17   jury was deadlocked.        There are some things for, some

18   against, only a couple.

19                  And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all

20   right.     Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases

21   that must be there over the decades, you probably looked

22   through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar

23   members.     How many have you found where you would say

24   that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on

25   your side?     In other words, there are going to be

 1   millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of

 2   them will support the defense.                Maybe many support you.

 3   But I haven't seen any here that say they support you.

 4   So how many do?   And what do you want me to read to see

 5   that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse

 6   of the judge's discretion?             How many did you find which

 7   will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the

 8   norm?

 9                MR. McGORMLEY:            Well, the difficult part in

10   answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has

11   indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:             Correct.         That's why I am

13   asking the question.        What they've said is, is it an

14   abuse of discretion?        And they've also said the judge

15   has to be careful.      Okay, so we have like an abuse of

16   discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the

17   abuse of discretion side.            I think anyone would admit.

18   But what cases will show to me that it's on your side,

19   not quite an abuse of discretion?                  Or is this the most

20   extreme case in history?

21                MR. McGORMLEY:            I don't believe it is, Your

22   Honor.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             I know you don't believe

24   it.   All I want you to do is to give me some evidence,

25   like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how


                                         13

 1   you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of

 2   this case, but looking on the scale.

 3                 MR. McGORMLEY:          I reach that conclusion by

 4   looking at this Court's other language, for instance -

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I don't want you to look at

 6   this Court.    We don't have a case where we said what was

 7   an abuse of discretion.         I want you to tell me -- and

 8   I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your

 9   answer you found no case supporting it.                  You have found

10   no case in the history of the United States that was

11   more extreme than this -

12                 MR. McGORMLEY:          I have not -

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- where they said it

14   wasn't an abuse of discretion.               That's what I'm judging

15   from your answer.

16                 MR. McGORMLEY:          I have not found a case on

17   these facts with a note indicating acrimonious

18   deliberations, that is correct.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           There is no note

20   indicating.    There are five, there are notes they sent

21   out, and at 9:30 in the morning they said:                  Judge, we

22   have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing.

23   That's what they said.        Then they asked to see the

24   evidence and they said:         Explain Count 2.

25                 Then they said:           Are we allowed to break?

 1   And then they said:       What if we can't agree?                 Mistrial,

 2   retrial, what?     And at 12:27, the same time, they said:

 3   What about lunch?

 4                 Then he brought them out and he says to the

 5   juror:   All right, do you believe it's hopelessly

 6   deadlocked?     And the foreperson said:                  The majority of

 7   us don't believe that.         And he said:               Don't say what

 8   you're going to say.        And then he doesn't have the

 9   lawyer there.

10                 Okay, that's fairly extreme.                    So that's why

11   I ask the question.

12                 MR. McGORMLEY:           But the reference there

13   about don't say what you're going to say is likely a

14   reference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. McGormley, is it your

16   burden to answer that question?                 Given AEDPA, is it up

17   to you to show that this case is within the mainstream

18   or is it up to the other side to show rather

19   conclusively that it is not in the mainstream?                      I

20   thought that's what AEDPA required.

21                 MR. McGORMLEY:           It is Petitioner's burden.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is Petitioner's burden

23   to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to

24   show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no

25   discharge of the jury.         And I'm not aware that they have

 1   carried that burden.      But we will ask when they come up.

 2   It is their burden, however.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           Exactly but I'm drawing

 4   some conclusions from your silence.                     You haven't found a

 5   case supporting it?

 6                MR. McGORMLEY:          I haven't found a case on

 7   these facts, but that's consistent -

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Have you found any case

 9   where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring

10   with counsel, where the declaration was upheld?

11                MR. McGORMLEY:          Actually, there's one out of

12   the Sixth Circuit, Klein v. Leis, from this very

13   circuit, in which the individual -- it was not a

14   deadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort

15   of stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted

16   it up, and the trial court -

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well you can't read from

18   that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was

19   held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of

20   improper prejudicial actions during the trial.

21                MR. McGORMLEY:          But that's -

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Those are different

23   questions.

24                MR. McGORMLEY:          But it's still a manifest

25   necessity determination.         In fact, this Court has


                                       16

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   indicated that on the spectrum of reasons a deadlocked

 2   jury warrants the least amount of appellate scrutiny.

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Could you -- yes, but

 4   that doesn't mean none.

 5                 What -- other than we have cases where

 6   judges have declared mistrials because they are going on

 7   vacation.     Those are easy, okay?

 8                 But somewhere the word "abuse of discretion"

 9   means that someone has discretion, but is improperly

10   exercising it.     What facts would it take for you to

11   believe that that would have been the case?                 What do you

12   have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -

13   that would have been an abuse of discretion?                 What

14   point?   If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that

15   would be enough, right?          Or would it?

16                 MR. McGORMLEY:           Well, to best answer Your

17   Honor's question, I would point out again that in

18   Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of

19   abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned

20   are when the trial court acts irrationally,

21   irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons.                 And in our

22   yellow brief we cited several cases where I would say

23   the Court was correct to find an abuse of discretion -

24   the Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary

25   indication.    The jury in the Starling case indicated


                                         17

 1   that, we are making progress and in fact can we have 15

 2   more minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares

 3   a mistrial.

 4                 Your Honor's example then with the Gordy

 5   case would be the imminent travel plans and docket

 6   considerations.

 7                 We also have where the court acts sua

 8   sponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the

 9   trial court -

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Why isn't that this one,

11   meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked,

12   hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict.                It

13   asks:   What happens if we don't?               And the foreperson

14   hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or

15   not as a group they believe they are hopelessly

16   deadlocked.    Why isn't this precipitous action?

17                 MR. McGORMLEY:          Well, again, as I -- as I

18   mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that

19   it is indicative of acrimony.              It's a reasonable view of

20   the second note that it was indicative of a deadlock.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But again, that's --that's

22   not your burden.    We are operating here under a statute

23   which says:    "In a proceeding instituted by an

24   application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in

25   custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a


                                        18

 1   determination of a factual issue made by a State court

 2   shall be presumed to be correct.               The applicant shall

 3   have the burden of rebutting the presumption of

 4   correctness by clear and convincing evidence."

 5                           Now, what is the factual

 6   determination that has been made here?                   I assume it's

 7   the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.

 8               MR. McGORMLEY:           That is correct.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that has to be rebutted

10   by clear and convincing evidence, correct?

11               MR. McGORMLEY:           That's correct.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why didn't you answer that

13   to those questions.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what is the status of

15   the -- the Allen charge in Michigan?                    Has Michigan taken

16   a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible

17   thing for a trial court to do?

18               MR. McGORMLEY:           Well, a -- Michigan has

19   adopted the ABA standard.          Michigan has the Instruction

20   3.12.   It's not what we would call the traditional Allen

21   dynamite charge because it's not asking the minority to

22   give credence to the majority's opinion.                    So there is a

23   deadlocked jury instruction in Michigan.                    It's not the

24   traditional Allen dynamite charge.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that wasn't


                                       19

 1   requested, either?

 2               MR. McGORMLEY:             Well, that was not -- that

 3   was not done here.      But again, I think it's reasonable,

 4   understanding that this is a dual -- dual-layered

 5   deference case, being a habeas case as well as the trial

 6   court being -- having broad discretion to make this

 7   determination, that when you have -- have the notes -- I

 8   mean, it -- it may tell the -- the trial court may have

 9   felt that giving an Allen charge when there's acrimony

10   may be telling those minority jurors that it doesn't

11   matter and that they may have to submit to the majority

12   opinion.

13               So I believe it was -- it was reasonable for

14   the Michigan Supreme Court here, applying AEDPA to -- to

15   conclude that the -- the trial court acted in

16   conformance with this -

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I ask you as a matter

18   of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have

19   interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and

20   asked them what they thought about whether there was a

21   deadlock?

22               MR. McGORMLEY:             I believe that is

23   permissible, though not constitutionally required.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Is there any reason -- do

25   you suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?

 1                 MR. McGORMLEY:          I believe -

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            She.

 3                 MR. McGORMLEY:          -- she, the trial judge -

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           He took the view of the

 5   foreman, an answer to one question, and that was it; is

 6   that right?

 7                 MR. McGORMLEY:          The -

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           His conclusion that there

 9   was a deadlock was based on one question and one answer

10   of one of the jurors, and that was the whole record

11   supporting his decision; is that right?

12                 MR. McGORMLEY:          Respectfully, no, Your

13   Honor.   I believe it was based on the totality of the

14   circumstances, including the two previous notes and a

15   bifurcated question where -

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, what other

17   circumstance is relevant?           The fact that they raised

18   their voices during deliberation, certainly that -- that

19   doesn't cut any ice either way, does it?

20                 MR. McGORMLEY:          Well -- oh, I believe it

21   does, because this Court has indicated in Arizona

22   that -- that acrimony is a concern.                      It's a

23   countervailing concern to balancing the interest of the

24   defendant having his case decided by a single tribunal

25   and fair and just judgments, as well as society having


                                        21

 1   one fair opportunity to vindicate its laws.                      So I think

 2   it's very much an appropriate consideration.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. McGormley, what

 4   evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not

 5   deadlocked?

 6                  MR. McGORMLEY:          None.

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Which is presumably what

 8   the other side has to prove by clear and convincing

 9   evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the

10   State court.

11                  MR. McGORMLEY:          Correct.           That's why it's

12   imperative to view this case in the habeas box that it

13   resides.   And that is the Michigan Supreme Court made

14   reasonable factual determinations and did not

15   objectively unreasonably apply this Court's precedent.

16   And the fact that we may look at these notes and go one

17   way or the other means that the State wins.                      The State

18   should prevail, because it's a reasonable interpretation

19   of those notes.     If one person may say, I don't know

20   that that really indicates deadlock and the Michigan

21   Supreme Court is looking at it and it's a reasonable

22   determination, then deference should apply and the State

23   should prevail.

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. McGormley, do we have

25   any indication how long this trial judge was on the

 1   bench when this trial came up?

 2                  MR. McGORMLEY:          How long in terms of serving

 3   on the bench?

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.

 5                  MR. McGORMLEY:          My recollection is that this

 6   was an experienced trial judge who then went to either

 7   civil arena from recorder's court or retired.                    So I

 8   believe this was an experienced trial.                    I don't have the

 9   exact years.

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Acrimony, I recognize we

11   have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it

12   could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder

13   count and they were just quarrelling over whether they

14   should add the firearms count, or the other way around.

15                  MR. McGORMLEY:          Well, it -- it -- it gets

16   back to that fundamental -

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              In which case they would

18   be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony

19   might indicate.

20                  MR. McGORMLEY:          Well, it gets back to the

21   fundamental principle that the trial court should be

22   able to take -- now, this is on the second, but the

23   initial layer of deference -- that the trial court

24   should be able to take the foreperson at her word when

25   she says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is

 1   deadlocked, especially -- especially in light of

 2   these -

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You can't say, can you,

 4   that every time the jury records that it can't reach a

 5   verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that

 6   that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?

 7               MR. McGORMLEY:          I do not assert that.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So obviously the word

 9   "deadlock," and as I read the judge's questions, he

10   defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict.

11   And later he uses "hopelessly deadlocked," but changes

12   the question when he asks the foreperson to respond.

13               Isn't there a difference between hopelessly,

14   i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a

15   verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict?

16               MR. McGORMLEY:          Well, I guess I don't quite

17   see the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I

18   think hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher

19   standard than -- than genuinely deadlocked.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          That isn't what the judge

21   said just before she got the response.                 She said:   Are

22   you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?

23               MR. McGORMLEY:          Right.        It's a bifurcated

24   question.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          And the foreperson said:


                                      24

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   No, judge.

 2                  MR. McGORMLEY:          It's a bifurcated question,

 3   correct.     I mean, the -- the first one was regarding

 4   confirming the nature of their note, and then, even with

 5   the interruption, there are -- twice the court

 6   approaches this inability to reach a unanimous verdict.

 7                  So again, here, what is paramount is that

 8   it's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively

 9   unreasonably apply this Court's clearly established

10   precedent.     There -- there is no case that flatly

11   controls this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard.

12   In fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own

13   three-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when

14   they said that there are three considerations that

15   determine.

16                  So when you take that three-part test, which

17   is not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well

18   as the second-guessing of those predicate factual

19   determinations being, well, the jury probably didn't

20   have enough time to even review the witnesses, juries

21   often report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as

22   much weight to this foreperson's statement, it's

23   contrary to these dual layers of deference.

24                  And if there are no further questions, may I

25   reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 2               Ms. -- Ms. McCowan.

 3               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARLA R. McCOWAN

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5               MS. McCOWAN:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7               Habeas relief was properly granted.                   I would

 8   like to first answer Justice Ginsburg's somewhat easy

 9   question for me.     Judge Brown was sworn into service on

10   January 1st of 1991.        At the time of this trial she had

11   been on the bench approximately 6-1/2 years.                   We are not

12   disputing her experience as a trial judge.

13               I do disagree with my friend's contention

14   that the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test.

15   What the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some

16   considerations or some guidelines, including the first

17   of which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions

18   of the parties.     And that does go a long way, Justice

19   Kennedy, toward the idea that the judge is exercising

20   sound discretion.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What -- what would

22   be gained from that?        I -- the parties, one says -

23   let's say one says yes and the other says no.                   You ought

24   to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't.

25               MS. McCOWAN:           Well, at the very least, it


                                         26

 1   evidences that the trial judge at least considered that

 2   there were -- that there competing interests and -- and

 3   debated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an

 4   extraordinarily drastic remedy.

 5                And instead, our position is that there

 6   really is no down side to talking with counsel.                 You

 7   would be able to have the benefit of the parties'

 8   arguments.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do people usually -

10   in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown

11   between prosecution and defense on a question like this?

12   My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if

13   they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to

14   continue, because all they need is, you` know, one

15   holdout.

16                MS. McCOWAN:        My -- my experience -- there

17   is a range of things that are going on.                 I'm sorry, I

18   can't -- I -- I think it just -- it just depends on a

19   variety of the circumstances.             But yes, I think that the

20   case law generally presumes that the defendant does want

21   the first jury to deliberate to verdict.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are

23   -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the

24   only question for us is whether it was an abuse of

25   discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge

 1   here.

 2                That would certainly be the case if this is

 3   coming up through the Federal system and we had a

 4   Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but

 5   it is not.   It -- it is coming up from a State court and

 6   Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to

 7   reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with

 8   State justice.   And that statute says specifically that

 9   where there has been a factual finding by the State

10   court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal

11   courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing

12   evidence.

13                Now, what clear and convincing evidence is

14   there here that there was not a deadlocked jury?

15                MS. McCOWAN:        Well, first, I am not sure

16   that I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with

17   the premise that -- that there was a factual finding by

18   the trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked.

19   The judge acquired or extracted the "no" answer and then

20   immediately declared a mistrial.               The ruling that -

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, what was the basis

22   for that declaration of mistrial?

23                MS. McCOWAN:        Well, presumably on these

24   facts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that

25   the jury was deadlocked.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 2                MS. McCOWAN:        But there is no actual

 3   specific ruling.   And instead, what we are focused here

 4   on is the Michigan Supreme Court's determination that

 5   there was manifest necessity, and in the absence of the

 6   trial judge exercising sound discretion, there is no -

 7   the reason for the -

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The Michigan Supreme

 9   Court's determination is simply a determination of the

10   same fact:   There was a manifest necessity because the

11   jury was deadlocked.

12                MS. McCOWAN:        Well, my -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, that factfinding is

14   implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did,

15   but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.

16                MS. McCOWAN:        My understanding of manifest

17   necessity is that that was a legal determination by the

18   Michigan Supreme Court, that there was -- according to

19   this Court's precedent, there was manifest necessity.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If the jury is

21   hopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that

22   would not constitute manifest necessity?

23                MS. McCOWAN:        Typically, a genuinely and

24   hopelessly deadlocked jury does constitute -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it does get back

 1   to the factual determination of deadlock, correct?

 2                 MS. McCOWAN:        Generally, yes -- yes, I

 3   believe so.     But in -

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:          The Michigan Supreme Court

 5   cited four factors in support of its decision:                     the

 6   length of the deliberations in relation to the

 7   complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the

 8   jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson

 9   said that the jury would not be able to reach a

10   unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no

11   objection by defense counsel.

12                 Is there any decision in this Court that

13   says that under -- that in a case in which those four

14   factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant

15   a mistrial?

16                 MS. McCOWAN:        No, there are no specific

17   requirements.

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:          And is there -- could you

19   give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding

20   that in a case where those four factors are present, a

21   trial judge may not grant a mistrial?

22                 MS. McCOWAN:        Well, no.              But the law does

23   still require that the judge exercise sound discretion

24   in -- in making a determination that there -

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:          The question is when those


                                        30

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to

 2   establish that the judge was exercising sound

 3   discretion?    Unless there is a decision of this Court or

 4   perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying

 5   that, no, even when those four factors are present you

 6   may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the

 7   conclusion that you are asking us to draw?

 8                 MS. McCOWAN:        Well, I -- I under -- I think

 9   I understand the question.            I do -- I do recognize that

10   there are no specific requirements, and that in the

11   absence of that, that there is nothing specific that the

12   trial judge was required to do beyond the exercise of

13   sound discretion.    And in this case the judge -- the

14   record does not support that the judge did exercise

15   sound discretion.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So can -- what -- what

17   is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the

18   question I asked your colleague on the other side, if

19   you can remember it?       I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on

20   the scale.    I mean, this is a fairly simple case.

21                 MS. McCOWAN:        Right.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What is wonderful about

23   this case is there is no disagreement about the facts.

24   We could write them in under two pages, just quoting

25   exactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and


                                        31

 1   note that the lawyer wasn't there.                  So there we are.

 2                Now, imagine that in front of you.                    You -

 3   it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for

 4   him, because you want to find reversals, and all you

 5   have to do is you look and you try to see when the State

 6   courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest

 7   necessity.

 8                So I have some time.               I will read some

 9   cases.    Which ones do you want me to read?                   And I don't

10   need to read the standard.            I have the standard.           And I

11   don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation

12   of the statute; you have the burden.                     And the question

13   is we have a record of those two pages, and does it

14   clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said

15   there was manifest necessity?              Now, I will read -

16   whatever cases you tell me to read, I will read.                     But I

17   want to find facts and I'm not sure you found some,

18   either.

19                MS. McCOWAN:         That's correct, Your Honor.

20   I -

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            How could it be that there

22   are no cases?    I mean really, thousands and thousands of

23   mistrials?

24                MS. McCOWAN:         Indeed, there -

25                JUSTICE BREYER:            How can it be that there

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   are no cases?   Are reversals very, very rare for

 2   manifest necessity?

 3               MS. McCOWAN:         Well, I -- I -- I did

 4   undertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I

 5   did not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find

 6   anything that looks even remotely as bad as this.

 7   Now -

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, that's good.      Now, tell

 9   me then what did you find?           When you say "remotely as

10   bad," then you perhaps found some where contention was

11   rejected, or where contention -- what did you find?

12   What did you find by way of cases where they said on

13   facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there

14   was no manifest necessity?

15               MS. McCOWAN:         Well, I guess the short answer

16   is that --- that there was nothing exactly on point.                  I

17   mean, there were -- there were cases where the judge

18   acted abruptly and hastily and then there were cases

19   where the judge did consider the -- the options of the

20   parties.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the -- so the

22   proposition that what happened here is an abuse of

23   discretion cannot be said to be clearly established,

24   right?

25               MS. McCOWAN:         Well, I don't think that it


                                       33

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   has to be established at -- at a granular level.                   This

 2   Court does require still that the -- that the trial

 3   judge exercise sound discretion in making the

 4   determination that there was manifest necessity.                   And

 5   the case law -

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You don't have

 7   anything like this case that says this would be an abuse

 8   of discretion?

 9               MS. McCOWAN:        Well, I -- I do believe that

10   this case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a

11   plurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge

12   acted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to

13   the parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a

14   mistrial; was acting irrationality, irresponsibly -

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So the fact that

16   it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly

17   established by the decisions of this Court.

18               MS. McCOWAN:        But in Arizona v. Washington

19   this Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the

20   trial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and

21   precipitously, that their action -- that their ruling

22   will not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion

23   requires that the trial judge act carefully and

24   deliberately.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But our -- but our cases

 1   have required much -- much more than that, much more

 2   than referring to a generalized standard that our

 3   opinions have set forth.         They have required proving

 4   that the application of that standard in our opinions

 5   comports with the provision of the statute that requires

 6   you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that

 7   was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application

 8   of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by

 9   the Supreme Court of the United States.

10               Now, our cases don't show that you can

11   simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of

12   discretion standard, that was clearly established by the

13   Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I

14   have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion.               I

15   don't think so.   I think our cases show you have to show

16   that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover

17   your situation.   And you don't have any cases like that.

18               MS. McCOWAN:         Well, I do understand -- well,

19   I guess the best answer that I have for that is that,

20   why there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I

21   don't know, but what I -- what I came up with or

22   theorized is that I think that for the most part trial

23   courts understand that this is a tremendous obligation

24   that they must exercise sound discretion.               And for the

25   most part for 186 years this has pretty much worked.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That may be.       That may well

 2   be -

 3               MS. McCOWAN:        And there's nothing -

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- which says it's a

 5   terrible statute, but there it is.                It says it has to be

 6   contrary to clearly established Federal law as

 7   determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.

 8   And you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established

 9   by an unbroken line of lower court decisions.               That's

10   not what the statute says.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought your -- your

12   position was that everybody agrees on what the law is:

13   If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate.                  So

14   there is no question about that statement of the law.

15   It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up

16   until now we have been talking about this, including

17   Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that

18   is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, is it quite correct

20   to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock?

21   Isn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest

22   necessity to take the action?            Isn't that the test?

23               MS. McCOWAN:        Precisely, Your Honor.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:           And the argument is that

25   there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though


                                      36

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there was disagreement about whether there was a

 2   deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike.

 3                MS. McCOWAN:         Precisely.

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Some people think one -

 5   there is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock.                     Some

 6   people think it -- it might be more.                     I don't think the

 7   test is deadlock.    The test is manifest necessity.

 8                MS. McCOWAN:         I agree.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I thought you

10   answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm

11   -- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although

12   I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue

13   did come down to the factual determination of deadlock,

14   because if there is deadlock then there is manifest

15   necessity.

16                MS. McCOWAN:         I'm sorry.             I though that,

17   when I answered that question, that you were asking if

18   typically, if the jury is genuinely deadlocked, does

19   that constitute an example of manifest necessity?                     I'm

20   sorry for the -

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.    So the case

22   comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine

23   deadlock, right?

24                MS. McCOWAN:         Well, no, I believe that the

25   case ultimately comes down to -- I am sorry if I

 1   misspoke before.     I believe that the case ultimately

 2   comes down to whether the Michigan Supreme Court

 3   unreasonably applied this Court's precedent in finding

 4   that the trial judge exercised -- that there was

 5   manifest necessity in the absence of the trial judge

 6   exercising sound discretion.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                With the layers -

 8   with the two layers of deference worked into your

 9   formulation.     It's not simply whether the trial court

10   erred in the determination that there was a deadlock

11   that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not

12   there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial

13   judge to so determine that we review under an additional

14   abuse of discretion standard.

15                  MS. McCOWAN:        Well, my understanding of 2254

16   is that it does take into consideration the contours of

17   the underlying constitutional violation, and it still is

18   our position that if the -- if the trial judge was not

19   exercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be

20   objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court

21   to have found that, that that is necessarily

22   contemplated by 2254.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Doesn't our law

24   clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears

25   the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if


                                         38

 1   there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden,

 2   hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer

 3   to the case?

 4                 MS. McCOWAN:         Well, that certainly sounds

 5   fair.     I don't want to quibble, but I think that the -

 6   my understanding of the law is that when -- when there

 7   is an objection by the defense, then the burden is on

 8   the prosecution.     In this case, there was no opportunity

 9   to object.    So I'm not sure that -

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, why is that -- why is

11   that so?    If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was

12   11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been

13   reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the

14   granting of a mistrial?

15                 MS. McCOWAN:         I think, yes, practically -

16   practically speaking, I think he probably would have

17   been reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a

18   Friday afternoon and the judge has essentially released

19   them for the day.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What does he have to lose

21   at that point?     She has made the ruling and that's that

22   there is going to be a mistrial.                 The lawyer at that

23   point can say:     Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I

24   would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen

25   charge.    Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.

 1               MS. McCOWAN:           Well, I think just as a

 2   practical matter, having the jury hear that the defense

 3   does not want the jury to leave, the potential for

 4   prejudice would be tremendous.                And as a practical

 5   matter, I think that the parties would have been

 6   reluctant to do that.        And I think -

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:             Are you really saying that?

 8   You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a

 9   client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1

10   for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to

11   have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the

12   window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say:

13   Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar

14   and object to the granting of a mistrial?

15               MS. McCOWAN:           Well, I -- I'm not sure how we

16   -- we would know on these facts that the jury was 11-to

17   1 for acquittal.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, I'm not suggesting

19   that they were or they weren't.                 I'm just asking about

20   what defense counsel would do in that situation.                   Maybe

21   they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm

22   familiar with.     I would think that they would not be

23   hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was

24   going to prejudice the client.

25               MS. McCOWAN:           I certainly would hope so as

 1   well.    But here I think that it was all just done just

 2   so fast and without warning and truly without any

 3   opportunity to object.         And so for that reason, I -- I

 4   think that the lack of objection really doesn't do

 5   anything to fortify the conclusion that there was

 6   manifest necessity in these facts.                   Instead -

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What -- what -- I'm

 8   sorry.   Please finish your sentence.

 9                  MS. McCOWAN:        No.

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.   What other

11   explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too

12   loud," other than that there was some degree of acrimony

13   on the jury?

14                  MS. McCOWAN:        Well, I don't think that the

15   Michigan Supreme Court even made a specific finding that

16   the jury had become -- had completely devolved at that

17   point and they were no longer -- I think that -

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, you don't

19   dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we

20   being too loud?

21                  MS. McCOWAN:        Not at all.

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what would

23   that indicate other than that there was some degree of

24   acrimony?

25                  MS. McCOWAN:        I think it just also indicates

 1   they maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and

 2   they want to make sure that they are not being

 3   overheard, and that, you know, they have some privacy in

 4   their deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage

 5   in a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be.

 6                I don't think that there is -- I mean, I

 7   suppose what I'm trying to say, however inartfully, is

 8   that I don't think we can do anything other than just

 9   take that note at face value.             They send out a note

10   saying:   We have a concern that our voice levels may be

11   disturbing the other proceedings.                That's it.   It did

12   not -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, maybe that's right

14   and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that

15   it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be.                And you

16   say:   Well, it also couldn't be.              That may well be.   But

17   we are bound to accept the factual determination of the

18   State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing

19   evidence that that's wrong.

20                MS. McCOWAN:        I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe

21   I am just not understanding the Michigan Supreme Court

22   opinion, but I don't know that they actually made a

23   finding that that was, in fact, evidence of acrimony.

24                I thought that the Michigan Supreme Court

25   said that may indicate that they perhaps had become -


                                       42

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that the deliberations had become acrimonious.               And I -

 2   and I think that that's a credible point.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Don't waste your time.      I

 4   will look for it.

 5                MS. McCOWAN:         I'm sorry.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Don't waste your argument

 7   time.   I will look for it.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Counsel, there is no

 9   case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly

10   identical facts, so this is not under the "contrary to"

11   prong of 24 -- of 2254(d)(1).

12                So it has to be under the "unreasonable

13   application."   Particularly for me, what Supreme Court

14   precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and

15   explain how and why?

16                MS. McCOWAN:         I think Arizona v. Washington

17   clearly establishes the law that the trial judge must

18   exercise sound discretion in finding a manifest

19   necessity.   And in this case, on these facts, it was

20   objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court

21   to have found that there was manifest necessity in the

22   absence of any discretion being exercised whatsoever by

23   the trial judge.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And in that case, one of

25   the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the


                                        43

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?

 2                  MS. McCOWAN:        In this case, that he -- that

 3   the trial judge failed?

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In -- in Arizona.

 5                  MS. McCOWAN:        Oh, right.             In -- right,

 6   exactly.     In Arizona v. Washington, what this Court had

 7   found is that -- that the judge did exercise discretion;

 8   that was -- that was evidenced by the judge giving the

 9   parties an opportunity to weigh in on it.

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's a little shaky as

11   precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said:                       The

12   trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new

13   trial.     But in passing, to get there, the Court said:

14   Well, this case didn't involve that.                      But the Court

15   isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in

16   that case didn't violate defendant's right.

17                  MS. McCOWAN:        But I thought that this Court

18   did say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial

19   judge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion,

20   and a review in court must satisfy itself that, in

21   accordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact

22   exercise sound discretion in finding that there was

23   manifest necessity.

24                  And I think that this case looks different

25   from Washington and may be similar to what was going on


                                         44

 1   in Jorn, where the judge acted without warning, without

 2   any opportunity for the parties to weigh in on the

 3   matter, and simply declared a mistrial, which this Court

 4   found to be irrational, irresponsible, and precipitous.

 5   And we -

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:          So are you suggesting that

 7   whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in

 8   granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA?

 9   It is clearly established that whenever there is an

10   abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA.

11   It is an unreasonable application of our precedent?

12                MS. McCOWAN:        I'm sorry.             Just to clarify.

13   You are saying if the trial judge abused -- in fact

14   abuses his discretion?

15                JUSTICE ALITO:          Right.

16                MS. McCOWAN:        Yes.       I think that if the

17   Michigan -- on these facts, for the Michigan Supreme

18   Court to have found that there -- that there was

19   manifest necessity in the absence of the judge

20   exercising any discretion whatsoever, that that was in

21   fact, an unreasonable application of this Court's

22   precedent.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So the standard of review

24   for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme

25   Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for


                                       45

 1   reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court

 2   of appeals despite AEDPA?            We simply look and see

 3   whether there has been an abuse of discretion.                   If there

 4   has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?

 5                MS. McCOWAN:          No, I'm sorry.         To clarify, it

 6   still has to be whether -- we are looking at the

 7   Michigan Supreme Court's decision here.                   We are in -- on

 8   habeas, you are looking at the last reasoned State

 9   court's opinion.

10                And if the State supreme court -- the last

11   reasoned court opinion says -- makes an objectively

12   unreasonable determination, under this Court's clearly

13   established precedent then relief will be warranted.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             But it's objectively

15   unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse

16   of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?

17                MS. McCOWAN:          Well, if the trial judge does

18   not exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts

19   irrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I

20   believe that relief would be warranted, even under

21   habeas review.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So it's not just abuse of

23   discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something

24   else?   Plus what?

25                MS. McCOWAN:          Well, it's -- it's whether the

 1   Michigan -- whether the -- the decision under review,

 2   whether it was an objectively unreasonable determination

 3   of this Court's precedent.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So you -- you do

 5   agree that there could be situations where a Federal

 6   court on direct review would find abuse of discretion,

 7   and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that

 8   that has to stand?

 9               MS. McCOWAN:           Yes.       And I want to clarify.

10   I think my understanding is that it's not just whether

11   this Court disagrees.        It does still has to be an

12   objectively unreasonable determination.                   So it's not

13   just simply whether -- whether this Court or any habeas

14   court reviewing it would come to a different conclusion.

15   It still has to be objectively unreasonable.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So there are a

17   category of cases where a Federal court could look at it

18   and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same

19   court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not

20   entitled to relief under AEDPA?

21               MS. McCOWAN:           I think that that is right.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But "objectively

23   unreasonable" is already built into the criterion of

24   abuse of discretion.        You don't abuse your discretion if

25   what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the

 1   ballpark.   It seems to me you are doubling up here.

 2   I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.

 3                MS. McCOWAN:        Well, our argument is that the

 4   trial court was not in the ballpark here.                 The trial

 5   court in this case did not exercise any discretion

 6   whatsoever, let alone sound discretion.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How can you say

 8   that?   I mean, you may think the discretion was abused,

 9   but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was

10   going to be a mistrial.        He exercised discretion.              He

11   looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are

12   you hopelessly deadlocked?           Are you going to be able to

13   reach a unanimous verdict?

14                And he was able to rely on the fact that

15   they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being

16   too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in

17   which there were 10 hours of testimony.

18                I mean, I understand your argument that he

19   abused his discretion, but I don't understand the

20   argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.

21                MS. McCOWAN:        Well, my -- my argument is

22   that the judge was not exercising sound discretion

23   because she was not responsibly gathering the facts.

24   She reached the conclusion that the jury was genuinely

25   deadlocked before she even asked a single question.                       She


                                       48

 1   got a -- a note from the jury -

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, she asked the

 3   foreperson a question.

 4                  MS. McCOWAN:         But if I could just back up a

 5   couple lines, she received the note saying:                    What if we

 6   can't agree.     And she said:            I have to conclude from

 7   that, that that is your situation at this time.

 8                  So she had already reached the conclusion

 9   that they were deadlocked before even asking a single

10   question.     And then from there she -- she misdefines,

11   for lack of a better description -- she conflated mere

12   disagreement with deadlock, never corrected that -

13   that -- that erroneous definition.                    And she corralled

14   the -- the foreperson in a matter of seconds -

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Where did -- where

16   did -- I'm sorry.      Where did she conflate the two things

17   you said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing?

18   What was it, inability to -

19                 MS. McCOWAN:          I'm in the petition appendix

20   at page 94a, where she says -- I'm sorry; at the bottom

21   of 93a.   She said:      "I need to ask if the jury is

22   deadlocked?    In other words, is there a disagreement as

23   to the verdict?"

24                  Disagreement is not -

 1   read down further.      She says:           "Are you going to reach a

 2   unanimous verdict or not?"             And the foreperson says

 3   "No."

 4               MS. McCOWAN:           But in the absence of an

 5   expression of deadlock from the entire jury, on these

 6   facts in this case, it was unreasonable for the Michigan

 7   Supreme Court to find that that satisfied the trial

 8   judge's obligation to exercise sound discretion.                   At a

 9   minimum, the trial judge is required to responsively

10   gather the facts.

11               In this case, she -- she acted hastily and

12   precipitously and without regard for my client's right

13   to have this first jury deliberate to a verdict.                   She

14   declared a mistrial at the very first sign of

15   disagreement and did not give anybody an opportunity to

16   weigh in on that before she declared -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, just -- with

18   respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement.

19   Reasonably interpreting, a note saying "Are we being too

20   loud" is a sign of disagreement.                 And there is another

21   note that comes out:        "What happens if we can't agree?"

22   You are making it sound more precipitous than it was.

23               MS. McCOWAN:           Well -

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Also you are ignoring the

 1   believe it was hopelessly deadlocked and the foreperson

 2   said the majority of us don't believe that.                  And then

 3   later -

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, no, no.   I'm

 5   sorry.

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- and there is a period,

 7   in the opinion of the supreme court after we don't

 8   believe that.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                There is not a

10   period on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief.                  Is that a

11   mistake?   There's a -

12               MS. McCOWAN:        I thought there was a dash.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- dash.    And -- and

14   could the court be concerned that the person was about

15   to say, and again with deference to the court, "The

16   majority -- majority of us don't believe that" -- that

17   the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent.

18   Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?

19               MS. McCOWAN:        Well, it may be correct to

20   stop her right there, but there is other ways to figure

21   out exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain.

22   And if she was trying to say, well, the majority of us

23   think we can keep going, then it was -- it was incumbent

24   upon the trial judge to -- to do more.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Isn't that exactly

 1   what she did?   After that he says don't tell me what you

 2   are going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to

 3   say.   I don't want to know what your verdict might be or

 4   how the split is or anything like that, are you going to

 5   reach a unanimous verdict?           She did go on after that -

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           The foreperson did not

 7   immediately answer.     She had to ask a second question,

 8   yes or no.   And the foreperson answered for herself but

 9   not necessarily for the jury when she said no.

10                MS. McCOWAN:        I think that's right.          And I

11   think -

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How -- how do you

13   know she answered for herself?              The judge was talking -

14   she can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself.                 She is

15   answering for the jury.

16                MS. McCOWAN:        I -- I think that really at

17   best, though -- given the circumstances of this case, at

18   best that was an expression of the foreperson's opinion,

19   that the jury would not likely be able -- but that is

20   not a statement.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do you always have to poll

22   the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement?

 1   real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact.             It

 2   perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the

 3   holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the

 4   holdouts.    I'm not aware that that's a requirement.

 5                  MS. McCOWAN:        It's certainly not a

 6   requirement and we were not saying that it is a

 7   requirement.     But on these facts when the jury has

 8   simply sent the foreperson out to gather more

 9   information, the trial judge was required to, in some

10   way, either -- either assure itself that the -- that the

11   jury as a whole did agree with the foreperson's

12   expression -

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:           You don't think it's a fair

14   inference from the note that the jury was stuck?               Do you

15   think it's -- it's likely that they were just curious

16   and they were rolling along just fine, but they were

17   just curious, well, what if it happens after we

18   deliberated a little more if we can't reach a -- a

19   verdict?    We just have a curiosity about that?           Do you

20   think that's a fair inference from that note?

21                  MS. McCOWAN:        I think all that is fair is

22   that they were just trying to gather more information.

 1   Hernandez-Guardado and Lindsay v. Smith, two cases in

 2   which -- circuit cases, granted, but two cases in which

 3   involved jury deadlocks and counsel was not asked a

 4   question.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            And those are the ones -

 6   so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated.

 7   You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is.            The

 8   standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State

 9   court reasonable in deciding that there was a sound -

10   sound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's -

11   that's, you know, like 100 years ago or something.

12               MR. McGORMLEY:           186.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            186 years ago when it was

14   something like "sound, careful, exercise patience" -- or

15   whatever, "the sound, careful exercise of discretion."

16   They said there was.      And the question for us is, was

17   that reasonable?   Okay?       I guess if the judge had said,

18   "Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and

19   the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get

20   there -- dismissed," that would be unreasonable.

21               (Laughter.)

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Objectively unreasonable.

23   So come as close as you can to that, where they held

24   reasonable, and what case is it?

25               MR. McGORMLEY:           Well -

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. McGormley, you have

 2   stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question

 3   that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have

 4   emphasized the two screens.              This comes to us after we

 5   have the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme

 6   Court ruling.     So the case isn't all that easy, without

 7   making the judgment as though it were coming up in the

 8   Federal system.

 9                MR. McGORMLEY:            Correct, Justice Ginsburg,

10   this is not a very easy -

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask you, do you

12   think the most relevant precedent from this Court -

13   would you agree that the most relevant precedent from

14   this Court is Arizona v. Washington?

15                MR. McGORMLEY:            I would not.           And I -

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Why not?

17                MR. McGORMLEY:            The reason why, Justice

18   Stevens, is because Arizona was not even a deadlocked

19   jury case.   And there is language that helps flesh out

20   what an abuse of discretion would be.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:             What do you think the most

22   relevant precedent from this Court is?

23                MR. McGORMLEY:            Perez.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you have an

25   answer to Justice Breyer's question?                      It was sometime

 1   ago, but -

 2                (Laughter. )

 3                MR. McGORMLEY:          My best answer, Justice

 4   Breyer, is that the best cases I have are -- are

 5   those -- are those two, because this -- this Court has

 6   never overruled a manifest necessity determination due

 7   to a deadlocked jury.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Are you suggesting that

 9   you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision

10   before we could declare that something was

11   unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably

12   applied?

13                MR. McGORMLEY:          No, my point is that -- is

14   in the 186 years since Perez it's never happened.              It

15   does not happen.   And that is consistent with the broad

16   discretion and special respect -

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But that could also be

18   consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough

19   that judges have to act slowly and --and with thought,

20   and that lower courts are catching those when they are

21   not.   I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm

22   saying.

23                MR. McGORMLEY:          Well, I -- I think it is
