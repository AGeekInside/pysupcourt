 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. ORTIZ:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                 This case poses two substantive issues:

11   First, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act

12   impliedly repeals section 1331's "well-pleaded

13   complaint" requirement?         Only if it does can a district

14   court look through a petition to compel arbitration that

15   itself contains no Federal question to ground Federal

16   subject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question

17   lurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be

18   arbitrated.

19                 And, second, if section 4 does repeal this

20   part of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted

21   State-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit

22   furnish look-through jurisdiction?

23                 Your Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute

24   between two radically different conceptions of Federal

25   question jurisdiction.        One view, Respondents', is so


                                         3

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   broad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in

 2   Federal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit

 3   card debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined

 4   subject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the

 5   arbitration agreement itself arguably arises under

 6   Federal law.

 7              But, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original

 8   meaning of section 4, the structure of the overall

 9   Federal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal

10   Arbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the

11   Petitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here.

12   First, the language.       The words "save for such

13   agreement," Your Honors, as the words "save for"

14   themselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement

15   exerts some negative effect on otherwise existing

16   jurisdiction.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That simply means

18   that you can't bring an action in Federal court because

19   the agreement says you can't.              The agreement says you've

20   got to arbitrate.    So if you throw the agreement out

21   save for such agreement, the question is whether or not

22   you could then bring the action in Federal court.

23              MR. ORTIZ:         Your Honor, the -- those words

24   "save for such agreement" were originally intended to

25   refer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the


                                         4

 1   Federal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such

 2   suits.   The words "but for" suggest that the agreement

 3   itself somehow impairs jurisdiction.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Ortiz, why isn't

 5   section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care

 6   of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of

 7   it?

 8                 MR. ORTIZ:      Your Honor, section 2 says that

 9   an arbitration agreement shall be valid, irrevocable,

10   and enforceable.    At the time when section 2 was

11   enacted, the Federal courts were still split between law

12   and equity.    Section 2 by itself could well have made

13   such arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in

14   law.   Section 4, "save for such agreement," makes clear

15   that there is no --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I'm not sure that I

17   follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this

18   doctrine of ouster come from?              It came from the court.

19   The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration

20   agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction.              Why

21   would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule

22   never made any sense in the first place, so we're not

23   going to follow it?      It's not any rule that Congress has

24   imposed on the courts.

25                 MR. ORTIZ:      Your Honor, section 2 by itself


                                         5

 1   would not have made clear that in -- such agreements

 2   were enforceable in equity.              As Justice Story wrote in

 3   Tobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought

 4   in the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of

 5   jurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration.

 6   And so although under section 2 such an agreement might

 7   be enforceable in law -- damages might be available,

 8   penalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might

 9   also be able to recover the expenses incurred in an

10   arbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came

11   to its conclusion -- that would not be clear that --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               That may have been the

13   historic model.    This was never a notion that Congress

14   enforced on the courts.         They imposed it on themselves.

15              So my question remains why shouldn't the

16   Court then say this agreement has been declared

17   enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to

18   recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any

19   more; we can change it?

20              MR. ORTIZ:         No, Your Honor.            It is true that

21   Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act abrogated the

22   ouster doctrine.   The only question is whether section 2

23   would do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary

24   because of the division between law and equity at the

25   time.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:               I'm just not getting the --

 2   I have never understood this argument and I still don't

 3   understand it now.      What is it in the text of section 2

 4   that would seem to leave it inadequate to touch equity

 5   as well as law?

 6               MR. ORTIZ:         Your Honor, section 2 says that

 7   arbitration agreements shall be valid, irrevocable and

 8   enforceable, but it does not say how they could be

 9   enforced.

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Exactly.        And why,

11   therefore, would anyone -- why would anyone be drawing

12   distinctions as to how?          It would be enforceable in any

13   way that an agreement might appropriately be enforced in

14   the courts of the United States at the time -- or any

15   courts, for that matter, at the time the act was passed.

16               MR. ORTIZ:         Your Honor, if Congress wanted

17   to be very clear that ouster in all of its forms was no

18   longer any kind of issue in enforcing arbitration

19   agreements, it took the extra step in section 4.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:               It -- it made a categorical

21   statement in section 2.          Why did it need to be any

22   clearer than that?

23               MR. ORTIZ:         Well, because, Your Honor, it

24   would be the case that arbitration agreements could be

25   enforceable, but just not enforceable in the way that


                                          7

 1   might be most helpful.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, it could be, but why

 3   in the world would anyone draw that inference?

 4                MR. ORTIZ:        Your Honor, because there were

 5   separate bars at law and equity at the time -- at the

 6   time of ouster.     Under law, there was some room in some

 7   jurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across

 8   the board.   In equity there was an even higher standard

 9   at the time against jurisdiction.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:              I have the same problem

11   that Justice Souter does, especially since section 2

12   refers to equity.     It says they will be irrevocable and

13   enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or

14   in equity for the revocation of any contract.

15                Obviously this -- this section was meant to

16   apply to equitable actions.               You wouldn't dismiss them

17   in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?

18                MR. ORTIZ:        But that particular section,

19   Justice Scalia, is meant to refer to ordinary State

20   contract doctrines in law and equity, which would make

21   the overall contract unenforceable.                       The "save for"

22   language is specifically directed at ouster, which is a

23   jurisdictional doctrine rather than one of substantive

24   contract law.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't know.          When it says


                                          8

 1   they are enforceable and makes an exception only for

 2   grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I

 3   would -- I would think that the general command was

 4   meant to apply to both law and equity.

 5              MR. ORTIZ:        Your Honor, the Respondents'

 6   view also doesn't take into account the other provisions

 7   of the Federal Arbitration Act itself.                  Under their

 8   view, the "save for" language is literally read out of

 9   section 4 of the agreement, since the rest of section 4

10   would accomplish exactly what they think the

11   look-through doctrine that they are arguing for without

12   those four critical words.

13              Also, sections 203 and sections 205 show

14   that when Congress wanted to expand subject matter

15   jurisdiction, it knew how to do so clearly and

16   unequivocally.   And in fact, when Congress adopted

17   Section 205 in 1970 --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:             I hate to interrupt you

19   here, but would you explain why the words "save for such

20   agreement" cut back on the jurisdiction?                 I didn't quite

21   understand your point.

22              MR. ORTIZ:        Justice Stevens, the point is

23   that "save for such agreement" instructs a court to jump

24   over the historical ouster doctrine.

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Doesn't it just instruct

 1   the court to decide whether, if there were no such

 2   agreements, would there be Federal jurisdiction in the

 3   underlying dispute?

 4               MR. ORTIZ:       Yes.      Yes, Your Honor.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:           So in this case there

 6   would be.

 7               MR. ORTIZ:       No, Your Honor, because the

 8   underlying dispute between the parties in this case is

 9   a -- concerns the arbitration agreement, not the

10   underlying bank debt.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, it's not the

12   underlying bank debt, but it is an underlying dispute

13   over which this Federal -- if you had brought your class

14   action as an original case, there would have been

15   Federal jurisdiction.

16               MR. ORTIZ:       Yes, Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:           So then why doesn't the

18   language read on this case?

19               MR. ORTIZ:       Well, Your Honor, the language

20   in -- the language -- the particular language of section

21   4 is meant to say, save for such agreement but for the

22   doctrine of ouster, setting aside the ouster doctrine

23   whether there would be --

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:           The text says nothing

25   about the ouster doctrine.

 1                MR. ORTIZ:        No.       But read in its historical

 2   context, Your Honor --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Rather than literally.

 4                MR. ORTIZ:        Well, literally at the time it

 5   would have been understood to refer -- to refer to that,

 6   because ouster was the whole problem against which FAA

 7   itself was first enacted.            FAA --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  This is a tough --

 9   it's a tough sell.      When you say "save for such

10   agreement," which I agree with Justice Stevens seems to

11   me you've put the agreement aside and then you say right

12   away then you look at the agreement to see if there is

13   Federal jurisdiction and only the agreement, not through

14   that.   So you're throwing it out and then you bring it

15   right back in.   It seems --

16                MR. ORTIZ:        Not quite, Your Honor.            What --

17   the rest of that sentence in section 4 instructs the

18   court to look at a suit concerning the subject matter in

19   controversy, which would be a suit seeking specific

20   performance of the arbitration.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Of the arbitration

22   agreement?

23                MR. ORTIZ:        Yes, sir.           So you are -- what

24   the court is instructed to do under the "save for such

25   agreement" clause is to ignore the historical problem of

 1   ouster and then to see whether in a suit brought to

 2   specifically enforce the arbitration agreement, there

 3   would be Federal subject matter jurisdiction.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.   And I guess

 5   it's -- I mean, you say if it said save for the historic

 6   doctrine of ouster, then it would be easy to say, and

 7   then you look at the arbitration agreement.                  But it says

 8   "save for such agreement" and then you look at the

 9   agreement.

10                MR. ORTIZ:       Well, you're not quite looking

11   at the agreement.     And this makes clear, I believe, that

12   ouster was the problem being referred to in those four

13   words in section 4.      It says a suit arising out of a

14   controversy.   It's instructing the Federal courts to

15   determine Federal subject matter jurisdiction for a

16   section 4 proceeding, which was completely novel at the

17   time.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You just -- you just used

19   the words "arising out of the controversy."                  "The

20   controversy" is used in several sections of the

21   Arbitration Act, and "the controversy" in other contexts

22   means the underlying dispute between the parties.                   "The

23   controversy" is not over the enforcement of the

24   arbitration agreement.

25                MR. ORTIZ:       With all respect, Justice

 1   Ginsburg, it's a little bit more complicated than that.

 2   The Federal Arbitration Act uses the word "controversy"

 3   four times, twice in section 2, once in section 4 and

 4   once in section 5.

 5              In section 2, the word "controversy" is

 6   embedded in a larger phrase:              "Controversy arising out

 7   of such contractor transaction."                 It is that context for

 8   the word "controversy" that makes clear that in section

 9   2, both instances in section 2, it is referring to the

10   dispute which is sought to be arbitrated.

11              In section 5, by contrast, the simple word

12   which appears the middle of 4A of the Petitioner's

13   brief, either -- section 5, which deals with the

14   appointment of arbitrators or umpires, it says "either

15   party to the controversy", it's clear in the section 5

16   context that the word "controversy" by itself refers to

17   the controversy over arbitration, not to the underlying

18   dispute.

19              JUSTICE ALITO:             In Moses H. Cone, didn't the

20   court say that the controversy was the underlying

21   dispute?

22              MR. ORTIZ:          Your Honor, that -- this Court,

23   in that footnote 32 of Moses H. Cone, mentioned language

24   that refers to the underlying dispute.                    In the context

25   of both the sentence, the footnote itself, and the


                                         13

 1   overall case, it is clear that the Court could not have

 2   meant that.

 3                 That phrase is followed immediately by a

 4   semicolon and then the word "hence."                     And after the word

 5   "hence" in that same sentence in the same footnote, this

 6   Court says, "Hence an independent basis for jurisdiction

 7   needs to exist," which in context makes it clear that

 8   it's not referring to look through.

 9                 Also that sentence cites a Fifth Circuit

10   case, Commercial Metals Company, and the other -- points

11   to the other cases in it.           They basically show that an

12   independent -- stand for the proposition that an

13   independent basis of jurisdiction exists, not that there

14   is look through.    And, in fact, one of them dealing with

15   Federal-question jurisdiction says that the Federal

16   issue has to appear on the face of the complaint.

17                 The rest of footnote 32, Your Honor, is all

18   directed towards -- towards the jurisdictional inertness

19   of the FAA overall.      And the case of Moses H. Cone,

20   itself, if look through had been rigorously adopted

21   there, it would have defeated subject-matter

22   jurisdiction because there would not have been complete

23   diversity among the parties.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But you do think --

25   you do think we should look through to determine

 1   diversity and the amount in question?                   In other words,

 2   not in the Federal-question context, but if it's

 3   diversity, you say we do look through the arbitration

 4   agreement.

 5                MR. ORTIZ:      Your Honor, that seems a

 6   somewhat different sense of look through; but, to the

 7   extent that ordinary, background 1331 or 1332 principles

 8   authorize such look through, that is appropriate in

 9   arbitration cases as much as it is appropriate outside

10   of arbitration cases.

11                It is Petitioner's contention that section 4

12   has no independent look-through force.                  To the extent

13   that look through is appropriate, it is because it is

14   appropriate under section 1332, itself.                        If under

15   Respondents' view section 4 operates independently to

16   authorize look through, then it would presumably

17   override 1332's normal principle that you do not look

18   through in determining complete diversity.                  And it would

19   have the overall effect of paradoxically reducing the

20   number of petitions to compel on the diversity side that

21   could be brought in Federal court.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Say that again.        I didn't

23   follow that.

24                MR. ORTIZ:      The -- the point is a simple

25   one, but it's sometimes hard to express.                  If you -- if


                                       15

 1   this Court says that section 4 operates independently to

 2   authorize look through in section 1331 and section 1332,

 3   the courts, district courts, will be in the position of

 4   looking through section 1332 petitions to determine

 5   whether the parties are completely diverse.

 6              It will not be basing the complete diversity

 7   determination on the parties before it in the

 8   arbitration -- in the petition to compel, itself, but it

 9   will be looking through to the underlying dispute.

10              Now, in Moses H. Cone, if the Court had done

11   that, it would have picked up the architect who was

12   dropped from the actual -- between the actual underlying

13   lawsuit and the petition to compel arbitration, and

14   completeness of diversity would have been defeated

15   there.

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is that point argued in

17   Moses -- Moses Cone?     Was that point argued in that

18   case?

19              MR. ORTIZ:       I do -- I do not know, Your

20   Honor.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why -- why wouldn't 1332

22   require complete diversity and require the court to

23   assure itself of that anyway?

24              MR. ORTIZ:       No, Your Honor.            The question --

25   1332 does not authorize look through for purposes of


                                      16

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   determining completeness of diversity, so if section 4

 2   independently authorizes --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought you said it did

 4   have a look through, an automatic look through, itself.

 5              MR. ORTIZ:       Not under the completeness of

 6   diversity, Your Honor.      To the extent it has anything

 7   equivalent to look through, it's on the amount-in-

 8   controversy side of Section 1332.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I see.           I see.   You are --

10   you are -- you are limiting it to the amount.

11              MR. ORTIZ:       Yes.       So, under Respondents'

12   view, there would be -- section 4 would authorize a look

13   through one part of section 1332 and not with respect to

14   another part of section 1332 under --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I am not -- I mean just --

16   I have to be sure I follow.           Why couldn't it require the

17   same look through in a diversity case as it does in a

18   Federal-question case?

19              MR. ORTIZ:       Because, Your Honor, if this

20   Court authorizes look through in Federal-question cases

21   through the arbitration agreement, itself, to the

22   underlying dispute, then if that look -- and that look

23   through comes -- authorization comes from Section 4 --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Right.

25              MR. ORTIZ:       -- then in 1332 cases, this

 1   Court would be looking through not only for

 2   amount-in-controversy purposes --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Complete diversity.

 4                MR. ORTIZ:      -- but also for complete

 5   diversity.

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           What's wrong with that?

 7                MR. ORTIZ:      Well, that would have the

 8   effect, Your Honor, of not allowing the petitioner to

 9   define the contours of the lawsuit and would actually

10   reduce the number of section 1332 petitions that could

11   be brought in Federal court.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Maybe it would.   So what?

13                MR. ORTIZ:      Well, Your Honor, if that is --

14   that is an implication that is -- is lurking in

15   Respondents' position, and it is also -- in a case like

16   this it is a little bit worrying as to why ordinary

17   section 1332 principles should not apply.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:           There is a dispute between

19   people.   You look at their underlying dispute, the

20   underlying one, and you say:            Is there diversity?

21   What's the problem?

22                MR. ORTIZ:      Well, Your Honor, that's not

23   actually the way you use Federal -- lower Federal court

24   now.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           Why -- why wouldn't you do

 1   just what I said, just what we started with?                       You take

 2   out the arbitration agreement, and then you look to see

 3   what this dispute is about.             And if it's about something

 4   that happens to involve all people from one side in one

 5   State and from another State on the other side, there is

 6   jurisdiction.    Why is that a problem?                  I don't

 7   understand.

 8                 MR. ORTIZ:      Your Honor, it -- it removes the

 9   Petitioner's ability or the plaintiff's ability or the

10   -- similar to the plaintiff's ability in an ordinary

11   lawsuit to define --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why?

13                 MR. ORTIZ:      -- the parties.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why?

15                 MR. ORTIZ:      Well, because, Your Honor,

16   someone could not bring a section 4 petition in Federal

17   court against maybe one party seeking to force that

18   party into arbitration if there are other parties

19   involved in the underlying dispute where there is no

20   diversity.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           All right.        So you define

22   "look through" as -- under our hypothetical here as

23   looking through to all people who might potentially be

24   parties under this arbitration agreement.

25                 MR. ORTIZ:      Well, that would be the

 1   implication of taking the kind of look-through theory

 2   that Respondents are arguing for in this case and

 3   applying it evenhandedly.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I will think about that.

 5   I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't -- it wasn't clear to me that

 6   that was so.

 7                 MR. ORTIZ:      But, Your Honor, there are also

 8   several jurisdictional gaps in the act that are created

 9   under Respondents' view.          The critical --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can I hold up just a

11   second to make sure I understand it.                     You are saying

12   that, let's say, Person A has an arbitration agreement

13   that implicates Persons B and C.                C is diverse, but B is

14   not.   They could decide to compel arbitration with

15   respect to B and leave C out of it.                      But if you follow

16   the look-through doctrine, you would say, well, the

17   dispute is between A and B and C; and so you would be

18   depriving A of their right to frame their own complaint

19   in a way that doesn't create Federal jurisdiction.

20                 MR. ORTIZ:      Exactly, Your Honor, and that --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that's not quite so,

22   because the -- the action could proceed with just A and

23   C, and then it -- it could come to a complete judgment

24   as to them.    In the look through for the -- the claims

25   that are involved, the action couldn't possibly proceed


                                        20
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   without taking account of the pre-emption claim that the

 2   Federal -- the Federal claim.

 3               You couldn't -- you could decide the case

 4   completely in No. 1, the diversity case, but not in No.

 5   2.   So there -- so there is a difference.                 It's true,

 6   you don't decide it completely as to all parties.

 7               MR. ORTIZ:       When the -- no, Your Honor.

 8   But there -- there could under your situation be large

 9   parts of the underlying dispute that are not covered

10   under -- and still left to be decided.                  It is, you know,

11   not the case that necessarily everything would be

12   subject to arbitration.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Of course, I suppose

14   how that works depends on what the rules are about how

15   you frame the dispute once you do look through.

16               I mean, if there is a pending State suit

17   between A and B, even though C may -- you could have

18   sued C as well, I mean the judge can say, well, I am

19   only going to look through to what the -- the actual

20   litigation is; and if I look at that, that's not a

21   Federal case.   And -- and -- and so your position

22   follows.

23               MR. ORTIZ:       This Court could; and,

24   interestingly, that wasn't the situation in Moses H.

25   Cone, itself.   There, there was a preexisting lawsuit,


                                       21
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and this Court did not look through.                   The court found

 2   that there was no problem with the architect being

 3   absent from the petition to compel arbitration, itself.

 4              Well, Your Honors, there is also, as I

 5   mentioned, strange jurisdictional gaps that are created

 6   under Respondents' view of this case.                   Section 4 is the

 7   only section of the arbitration -- in the Federal

 8   Arbitration Act that has the critical "save for such"

 9   language, which under Respondents' view authorizes

10   look-through jurisdiction, in particular, Sections 7, 9,

11   10, and 11, which allow a court, a Federal court, to

12   compel the attendance of witnesses at ab arbitration.

13   That is Section 7; and then 9, 10, and 11, which

14   respectively allow a Federal court to confirm, vacate,

15   or modify an arbitration once it has happened.

16              None of those sections contain language

17   which under Respondents' view or the Fourth Circuit's

18   view are necessary for there to be look through.

19              In all those cases -- situations, Your

20   Honor, the Federal courts would be in the position of

21   being able to compel arbitration under section 4 but not

22   being able to compel the attendance of witnesses at the

23   arbitration or to subsequently confirm, vacate, or

24   modify an award coming from an arbitration that they,

25   themselves, compelled.

 1               Coming from an arbitration that they

 2   themselves compelled.       The closest Respondent comes to

 3   sort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over

 4   this gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue

 5   that this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter

 6   jurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an

 7   emanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which

 8   actually has the necessary "save for" language.

 9               Also, Your Honors, this look-through

10   approach to Federal subject matter jurisdiction violates

11   the core purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act.                  The

12   Federal Arbitration Act was meant to get things to

13   arbitration quickly and to have arbitrators, not judges,

14   decide them.    These --      sometimes often complex

15   jurisdictional inquiries undermine both those aims.

16               Here this case has been pending in Federal

17   court just at the jurisdictional stage for many years

18   now.   In the Strong case which is now en banc before the

19   Fifth Circuit -- I'm sorry, the Eleventh Circuit --

20   Justice -- Judge -- excuse me, Judge Marcus wrote a

21   32-page opinion.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Yes, and what really

23   leapt off the page at me in that opinion, he gets to the

24   end, I think he basically presents your position and

25   then he says:    Thus, on my reading the relevant portion


                                        23

 1   of section 4 could be rewritten this way.

 2               Well, I mean that to me is a confession of

 3   error if you have to rewrite the statute to get to your

 4   position.

 5               MR. ORTIZ:      Well, Your Honor, he didn't say

 6   it had to be rewritten.       He said if you wanted to make

 7   it even clearer what was originally intended under

 8   section 4 that is how you would do it.                 That's a far cry

 9   from saying that you need to do violence to the statute.

10   Here --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, his rewriting

12   doesn't look very much like section 4 to me.

13               MR. ORTIZ:      Your Honor, if his rewriting,

14   given the disappearance of the ouster doctrine -- he's

15   trying to make it clear to present context what was

16   originally understood at the time the Congress

17   originally enacted the FAA.           There is no memory,

18   historical memory or otherwise, of the ouster doctrine,

19   no realization how it actually played out; and against

20   that absence of knowledge, Judge Marcus is trying to

21   educate his readers and the lower courts as to how

22   things need to be done.

23               But certainly the language as originally

24   understood would have -- that save-for language would

25   have been all about, which it is clear from the time was

 1   thought by Congress to be the major obstacle to

 2   arbitration.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:             What about the fact that

 4   that was not included in the New Jersey statute, nor was

 5   it included in -- was it included in the Uniform

 6   Arbitration Act?

 7              MR. ORTIZ:          No, Your Honor.                Now --

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:             What's the explanation for

 9   that?

10              MR. ORTIZ:          The explanation, Your Honor, is

11   that in New York law and equity have been merged.

12              JUSTICE ALITO:             I know.             And you're saying

13   New Jersey; it was, you know, a very complicated

14   argument about the status of it.                 What about the Uniform

15   Arbitration Act?

16              MR. ORTIZ:          By the later times it appeared

17   that it was closer, coming -- the law and equity across

18   many jurisdictions was coming closer, but at the time in

19   the Federal court system at least, if only because of

20   Justice Story's hostility towards jurisdiction, finding

21   jurisdiction in the Tobey case to build equity seeking

22   specific performance kinds of things, that language is

23   necessarily clear.

24              Your Honors, if there are no further

25   questions I would like to reserve my time for rebuttal.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 2              MR. ORTIZ:       Thank you.

 4              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 5                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 6              MR. PHILLIPS:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 7   and may it please the Court:

 8              It seems to me that if the argument that

 9   just ended doesn't prove anything, it suggests that

10   perhaps the Court ought to follow the simple expedient

11   of read the statute as it's written, apply it as written

12   and come to what strikes me, at least, as a reasonably

13   easy resolution of this particular case.

14              The statute says that a party aggrieved by

15   the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that

16   precisely in this case because the other side has filed

17   a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an

18   underlying dispute -- may petition any United States

19   district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's

20   pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context

21   you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you

22   say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil

23   action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of

24   the controversy between the parties.

25              It seems to me reasonably clear to interpret


                                      26
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that language as saying you look to the underlying

 2   dispute between the parties.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that's the question

 4   that I have, Mr. Phillips.            What is the underlying

 5   dispute between the parties?

 6                 It seems to me that your look-through

 7   argument is look-through only halfway.                    That is, if you

 8   look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that

 9   was brought in the State court, the controversy is here

10   we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged.

11   So we have a suit on a debt.              Why isn't that the

12   controversy?     You have to make the counterclaim the

13   controversy, which comes up only defensively.                   It wasn't

14   brought as a lawsuit.

15                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Justice Ginsburg, the

16   language of section 4 actually talks about the subject

17   matter of a suit arising out of, not the existence of a

18   suit; and section 4 doesn't require that a lawsuit have

19   been filed.     So it's not appropriate simply to say to

20   yourself look at what litigation actually exists,

21   because in as many cases as not there is not going to be

22   any litigation ongoing.          So the court has to make the

23   hypothetical:     would the court have had jurisdiction

24   over the subject matter of this dispute?                   And the

25   dispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very


                                         27

 1   explicit about -- he said specifically that if he had

 2   brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have

 3   arisen under Federal law.

 4                It seems to me that's as clear a concession

 5   that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal

 6   law.   And therefore --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Who gets to frame --

 8   who gets to frame the complaint?               Normally if you're a

 9   party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal

10   law, you have control over the complaint.                You don't

11   have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a

12   way that implicates a Federal question.                 You can go out

13   of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a

14   Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you

15   could not bring it in Federal court.

16                Just as in the diversity example, you can

17   specifically avoid suing people who would create

18   diversity.   But in your position the judge has to in his

19   mind write a complaint and see whether there is

20   jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide

21   whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse

22   parties?

23                MR. PHILLIPS:         I think what the judge has to

24   do is to take -- is to give the plaintiff in the section

25   4 complaint the benefit of his allegations.                And we have


                                       28
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   made an allegation here that the subject matter of this

 2   dispute arises under Federal law, and we did that not

 3   just based on our own assessment of the situation in the

 4   abstract, but we did that on the basis that she had

 5   filed a very specific claim against us asserting that we

 6   had violated essentially section 20.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But -- but she chose to

 8   assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint --

 9   the counterclaim if it had been brought as an

10   independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for

11   Federal jurisdiction.       But the litigant who has this

12   claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that

13   you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.

14               MR. PHILLIPS:           But Justice Ginsburg, I think

15   the difference is that we are not seeking to remove her

16   original lawsuit.    That's not -- if that were the case,

17   then I think the argument you're making is a legitimate

18   one.   All we are seeking to do is to assert our

19   independent section 4 rights and that's not at all

20   dependent on the --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But in the practical

22   effect, what happens?       Now you have asserted that you

23   can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts --

24   that arises under Federal law.               But you say it's is not

25   the same as removal because the underlying claim, your


                                        29
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State

 2   court; but what happens to that claim once you have this

 3   arbitration?

 4              MR. PHILLIPS:             Well, there are a couple

 5   possibilities.   I mean, first of all, the arbitration

 6   agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you --

 7   if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent

 8   claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have

 9   the right to enforce the arbitration as to that

10   particular claim.     So that's specifically what we did in

11   this particular case.

12              So in theory, at least the collection action

13   would remain in State court as a State cause of action,

14   although it would certainly be available to the

15   Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're

16   going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm

17   content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well.                   So

18   they could do it that way or we could arbitrate the

19   Federal law.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Mr. Phillips --

21              MR. PHILLIPS:             I'm sorry?

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Clear up one thing for me.

23   Is it correct, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, that the

24   counterclaim was purely defensive?                   Didn't it ask for

25   additional relief?      The counterclaim, wasn't it a class

 1   action?

 2               MR. PHILLIPS:          Oh, right.            Yeah -- no --

 3   exactly.   That's absolutely true.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:            So it was not merely an

 5   defense to the action, the State court action.

 6               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I meant -- I didn't mean

 8   to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a

 9   counterclaim.   Of course you could.                    But this --

10               MR. PHILLIPS:          But I couldn't -- I couldn't

11   remove it --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Chose not to --

13               MR. PHILLIPS:          I think that was the point

14   she was trying to make.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- chose not to litigate

16   the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going

17   to bring up this claim.        It wasn't as an original

18   matter.

19               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.        I -- I understand

20   that, Justice Ginsburg, but the -- the -- but the point

21   I am trying to make here is that the language of section

22   4 just talks about the subject matter of the controversy

23   between the parties.      It doesn't specifically talk about

24   an existing lawsuit, and frankly it doesn't envision the

25   existence of a specific lawsuit.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The controversy between

 2   the parties is the credit card company says, customer,

 3   you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if

 4   that's so, then I have certain offsets because they

 5   charged me too much interest.              How do you --

 6              MR. PHILLIPS:            Well, in that --

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- how do you -- it's all

 8   part of the same controversy, isn't it?

 9              MR. PHILLIPS:            But -- no -- well, I mean you

10   could -- you can certainly view it as part of the same

11   controversy, but the -- but the bottom line is, the

12   question is:    Would a Federal court have jurisdiction

13   over the dispute that arises under Federal law between

14   the Petitioner and the Respondents?                      And the answer is

15   clearly yes.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:              What is the dispute?           You

17   say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been

18   brought in a complaint.

19              MR. PHILLIPS:            It's defined by our complaint

20   in section 4.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:              But you -- from your

22   argument, I would gather that a court would be able to

23   imagine a counterclaim.         Once it finds out, you know,

24   what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about,

25   the court could imagine that there would be a

 1   counterclaim for interest or for something else.

 2               MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, I'm not sure -- I'm not

 3   even sure --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's very strange to decide

 5   Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined --

 6   imagined complaints.

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, I -- I mean the problem

 8   with that -- I mean the difficulty arises, Justice

 9   Scalia, because the language of the statute does say

10   that the court has to determine whether it would have

11   jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy.

12   And then that --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So the problem with his --

14   I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to

15   imagine anything.

16               MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, with his

17   interpretation, you have to imagine everything.             In

18   point of fact, you have to imagine that this had

19   something to do with ouster when it doesn't use the word

20   "ouster."

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well --

22               MR. PHILLIPS:           It has to do with equity and

23   law when it uses "equity" and "law" in other contexts.

24   And --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You don't have to imagine

 1   complaints.     You -- you don't have to invent litigation.

 2                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, no.            That's true, but

 3   what it -- but -- but the flip side of that is that this

 4   is a section, a fundamental provision, of the Federal

 5   Arbitration Act that apparently was designed to provide

 6   a basis of Federal jurisdiction for the Gila Indian

 7   Tribe claims.     It seems inconceivable to me that

 8   Congress had that narrow an interpretation of section 4

 9   in mind when it passed this particular law.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's close to inconceivable

11   to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct

12   litigation that is not yet in existence.

13                 MR. PHILLIPS:          But I think all of this

14   really is talking -- I mean this is not significantly

15   different --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- answer that the

17   litigation does exist.

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, but your position is it

20   doesn't have to exist.         Had that litigation not been

21   brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before

22   a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to

23   consider what is the dispute between the parties and

24   what kind of complaints could that dispute have

25   generated.

 1               MR. PHILLIPS:          And it may well be, Justice

 2   Scalia, that in that context the answer is that the

 3   court will say that the claim is unripe; that we don't

 4   know for sure whether or not this is going to congeal

 5   into a real dispute between the parties.                 And if that's

 6   the case, obviously, then the court does not have to go

 7   forward.   But you don't have to worry about that in the

 8   context of this particular litigation because that

 9   dispute has congealed.       The parties are at loggerheads

10   over the particular issue in this case.                 And -- I'm

11   sorry.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There would be nothing

13   inappropriate about a State court entertaining that

14   excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to

15   it.   I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs

16   the interest --

17               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Not state usury law.       So

19   you could have this case going on in State court.

20               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And the State court would

22   be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.

23               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.        Although, you know,

24   that's to the -- obviously, that sets aside the

25   arbitration agreement completely.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, why does it set

 2   aside?   This is the thing I guess I don't understand

 3   about the case, and that is what is really driving your

 4   side, given the difficulties that I share with the

 5   Justices on my right and left here.                     And the -- the

 6   tacit assumption seems to be that you in fact are going

 7   to get shortchanged on your arbitration right if you

 8   have to bring your arbitration claim in a State court.

 9   And I don't see that.

10                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, first of all, section 4

11   doesn't apply in --

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I know section 4 doesn't,

13   but section 2 does.

14                MR. PHILLIPS:         To be sure, section 2 does,

15   but whether or not --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           You can -- based on the

17   Federal act, you can in State court claim your right to

18   enforce the arbitration agreement.

19                MR. PHILLIPS:         Right, but the flip side of

20   that is --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why don't you do it in the

22   State court instead of going through these gymnastics?

23                MR. PHILLIPS:         Because we have serious

 1   Federal court.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Speaking of gymnastics,

 3   can I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could

 4   you have brought a declaratory judgment action to

 5   establish that your Federal claim --

 6                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes.

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- controls this dispute

 8   and could you have then said that you wanted this

 9   arbitrated?

10                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes, Justice Kennedy.        I

11   believe we could have done both of those.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why didn't you do that?

13   Why are we here?

14                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, because we brought the

15   action under section 4, which I think --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean, could you still do

17   that after this case?

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Assuming there's no statute

19   of limitations issue, and I don't know that there would

20   be, but that would available.              But it still seems to me

21   that the bottom-line question is:                 Are you entitled to

22   bring an action under section 4?

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So your theory -- I mean

24   basically I think you concede that the other side has a

25   point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the

 1   dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know

 2   if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that

 3   you can get into Federal court on.                   For example, it

 4   hasn't even arisen.       You know, there is no lawsuit.                 And

 5   I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is

 6   they should say to you you'd like to have this in

 7   Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute?                   What's it

 8   about?

 9                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And once he says what's it

11   about, both sides will say, well, basically it started

12   off -- it's just about collecting some money from

13   in-state parties.       So that's not Federal.

14                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So that, you know,

16   something could happen here.             It could happen that they

17   could decide they want to sue in a big class action and

18   get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State

19   which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC

20   reg, and then it could be Federal.                   And the judge might

21   say to you:    "What?     You're just imagining."              And that

22   would be up to the judge.

23                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right, and the judge would

24   have the discretion to decide --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's a kind of a defense.

 1               MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:           But you'd say then it might

 3   be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.

 4               MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.        There could be a

 5   letter that says, look, what you're doing here violates

 6   Federal law, and if you don't stop it, we are going to

 7   take action against you.        And then we have to sit there

 8   and wait.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:           A real suit.      And --

10               MR. PHILLIPS:         But they are here.       They are

11   here.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:           And in a real suit, there

13   is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one

14   you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where

15   they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are

16   going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's

17   what we want arbitrated.

18               MR. PHILLIPS:         And that's precisely what

19   we've asked for here, Justice Breyer.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:           So this one is not so hard

21   to figure out.

22               MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           There might be some that

24   are.

25               MR. PHILLIPS:         Right, and there's no

 1   question about that, and it's --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What's hard to

 3   figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you

 4   have a dispute with the franchisor.                       And the franchisee

 5   says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue

 6   you under the California antitrust law, and he does.

 7   And the Federal court says, we've looked through and

 8   says, well, you could have sued under the Federal

 9   antitrust law.   And you --           yes, I could have; I

10   deliberately didn't.        And then they say, well, this is

11   something that could have been brought in Federal court.

12   And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to

13   frame his complaint as he sees fit.

14              MR. PHILLIPS:             And I understand that,

15   Mr. Chief Justice.      And in the right case, you know, I'm

16   not sure how I would come out in that particular --

17              JUSTICE BREYER:               Well, in his case, in the

18   Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get

19   into court, probably don't because they are bringing

20   this under a State law?

21              MR. PHILLIPS:             You see, I would comply with

22   the original complaint.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No.     But you just

24   say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in

25   Federal court?

 1              MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.        Well, that's exactly

 2   what the Eleventh Circuit held.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's a violation of

 4   the Sherman Act.

 5              MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Of course, it could

 7   be brought in Federal court.

 8              MR. PHILLIPS:           Well -- and in the right

 9   case, the Federal -- you know, if I had to go that far,

10   I might well make that argument, Mr. Chief Justice, but

11   in this case I don't have to go that far.                And I think

12   all the Court needs to resolve is in a situation where

13   the parties have a very concrete dispute between them,

14   one that arises exclusively under Federal law, and a

15   party seeks to have that claim arbitrated under section

16   4 pursuant to --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That claim doesn't --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Let me get one fact.

19              MR. PHILLIPS:           I'm sorry.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Is the State court suit

21   still pending?

22              MR. PHILLIPS:           Yes, the State court suit is

23   pending.

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:             So there are two separate

25   underlying actions.

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1              MR. PHILLIPS:           The State court has stayed

 2   its hand pending the outcome of the Federal litigation.

 3   So we'll see what happens.          But, obviously, as I say --

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But there could be

 5   nothing left for the State court to do after you have

 6   the arbitration.   I mean, not that you arbitrate about

 7   interest due on a nonexistent debt.                     I mean, you have to

 8   have the two things together.

 9              MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, I mean, in some ways,

10   as I say, it seems to me that's Petitioner's right or

11   potentially -- or ours.        I suppose either side could ask

12   to have that arbitrated, but the truth is if you took --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I just can't envision a

14   case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a

15   debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.

16              MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And you remove the State

18   court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal

19   court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the

20   arbitration.   It just seems to me you have effected --

21   accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the

22   -- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on

23   the basis of a counterclaim.

24              MR. PHILLIPS:           But see, Justice Ginsburg, I

25   think that's not right.        I think that actually what


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   happens is you eliminate what I perceive to be the

 2   Federal question in this through the arbitral process.

 3               You still have the underlying collection

 4   action.   If the Court says, no, there is no violation of

 5   the usury laws, you have not overcharged, you have not

 6   made any mistakes, the question we still have is a claim

 7   on the debt and her obligation to pay it.

 8               Now, whether she wants to adjudicate that in

 9   State court or resolve it as part of the arbitral

10   process, that's really up to her as far as how that

11   goes.   But the arbitration agreement could not be

12   plainer in saying that you can divide up the claims for

13   purposes of seeking arbitration, and that seems to fit

14   perfectly well with an effort to say that there is a

15   specific claim here that arises exclusively under

16   Federal law, and that, therefore, we can enforce our

17   arbitration rights pursuant to that section 4 right.

18               And that's, frankly, all we are trying to

19   accomplish here, Justice Ginsburg.

20               The second part of the statute which is

21   the -- you know, the one that has obviously created the

22   greatest amount of controversy here, is, you know,

23   "would have jurisdiction over the subject matter."

24   Again, it seems to me that this is the easiest case the

25   Court is going to face in this area, because here is one


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   where there is no question --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's what worries me.

 3   That's what worries me.

 4               (Laughter.)

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            If we accept your theory,

 6   this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that

 7   are further down the line?

 8               MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I think what's going to

 9   happen -- I candidly don't think they are going to come

10   up that much, in part because these issues have been

11   around a long time.     You know, it's not like there have

12   been dozens of these kinds of issues arising over time.

13   I don't think it's likely to be that big a problem.

14               But again, it seems to me that district

15   courts have the authority to resolve this, because if

16   they don't believe that there really is a Federal claim

17   that would justify exercise of section 4, they can say

18   that.   If they do, then they will -- then they will send

19   it.

20               I mean, look -- the other thing about this

21   is, you know, the other side makes a big fuss about

22   federalism, but we are not asking to take the issues

23   away from the Federal court -- from the State courts to

24   the Federal courts.     What we are asking for is what

25   everybody has agreed to here, which is to have these

 1   disputes resolved by arbitration.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But you could have asked

 3   for that in the State court as well, and --

 4              MR. PHILLIPS:            There is no question about

 5   that, Justice Ginsburg.         The problem is that there is

 6   some lack of confidence in the State courts that we will

 7   get the same treatment under section 4 that we would get

 8   in Federal court.    And Congress created that right.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Then bring that up here on

10   appeal from the State court.

11              MR. PHILLIPS:            Well, I wish it were that

12   easy to get this Court to grant review of everything

13   that I bring up here in the first place.

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:              You don't have any

15   trouble.

16              (Laughter.)

17              MR. PHILLIPS:            I appreciate that.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:              It's not really -- of

19   getting constants from Federal judges; the arbitrators

20   can decide this question.

21              MR. PHILLIPS:            Right.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:              The arbitrator might

23   decide there is no preemption.

24              MR. PHILLIPS:            Right.        But the -- and that's

25   fine and we have to live with that.                      And obviously,


                                        45

 1   since we can't change the standards of review on the

 2   back end under sections 9, 10 and 11, we are going to be

 3   pretty much stuck with that -- with that determination.

 4   But the truth is the bigger risk is that the trial

 5   judge, the State court will not send it to arbitration.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this, I haven't

 7   reread the Moses Cone case, but is your adversary

 8   correct in saying that there would have been no

 9   jurisdiction in that case it we followed your view?

10              MR. PHILLIPS:          No.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Because the arbitrator was

12   not of diverse citizenship from the other parties?

13              MR. PHILLIPS:          I mean, It wasn't litigated.

14   It's not clear on the face of the opinion.               So if there

15   is something he knows that I don't know, maybe.                  But

16   I -- I -- certainly nothing in there that reflects

17   that -- that view of the world.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But -- if, in fact, were a

19   nondiverse party in the Moses Cohen, there should have

20   been no jurisdiction?

21              MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, now, the nondiverse

22   party issue, it depends on how you read section 4.                     You

23   know, section 4 talks about the parties.               And the

24   parties there I don't think means parties to the

25   underlying controversy.       I think there parties refers


                                      46
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   specifically to the dispute in front of the court.

 2                So I don't think the pass-through problem

 3   for 1332 applies in that particular context for complete

 4   diversity.

 5                I don't think Congress envisioned you would

 6   look beyond the immediate dispute under section 4 to see

 7   whether there are additional parties, except to the

 8   extent, obviously, that you would have necessary and

 9   indispensable party litigation that might bring them in.

10                I think the assumption is you take the

11   complaint as it's written, and then you look to see

12   whether or not there is amount of controversy.             For that

13   you have to go beyond because the dispute with respect

14   to arbitration is not going to get you anywhere near

15   that number.   And you have to look beyond for Federal

16   questions to see whether or not there is a Federal issue

17   there to be enforced.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:           Is this right?   I'm asking

19   if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good

20   response in rebuttal.

21                MR. PHILLIPS:         I'm not going to give a good

22   response?

23                JUSTICE BREYER:           If you read it the other

24   way -- if you read it the other way, the way the

25   Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not?


                                       47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   That then you look to see if there is Federal

 2   jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that

 3   right?

 4                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Under their interpretation?

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, under their

 6   interpretation.

 7                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So, what you could have is

 9   you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement

10   that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between

11   them, and one is from Vermont; the other from

12   California.

13                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So there is jurisdiction.

15   And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters

16   of -- that never could come into Federal court.                 I mean

17   there are such matters you could argue about.

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Sure.       Right.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But nevertheless, we have a

20   Federal court issuing this injunction, under their

21   theory.

22                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.        Assuming the amount

23   of --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Assuming they are right.

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Assuming the amount of

 1   controversy -- I mean, it could have an amount --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, I see.       The arbitration

 3   agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.        It has to have an

 5   independent basis for Federal jurisdiction.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       So then

 7   probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the

 8   amount.

 9                MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, that's exactly our

10   point.    That's why you have to look through.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            So if you didn't look

12   through, then this would apply to nothing?

13                MR. PHILLIPS:          Pretty much that's our view

14   of the case.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            If the arbitration --

16                MR. PHILLIPS:          Yes.      I'm sure my opponent

17   will say something different than that.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:            The arbitration agreement

19   has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement,

20   then you could have really important Federal questions

21   in substantive issues --

22                MR. PHILLIPS:          Yes.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- that couldn't come in

24   because the arbitration agreement doesn't?                 Or you could

25   have State questions that would suddenly come in because

 1   the arbitration agreement does.               The arbitration -- but

 2   now you're saying, well, that second case is never going

 3   to arise.

 4               MR. PHILLIPS:           Probably not.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             Probably not, because no

 6   arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a

 7   nullity of the statute?

 8               MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:             Except to overcome the

10   ouster.   Okay.   We've got your side of it.

11               (Laughter.)

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, it makes a nullity of

13   it, except that it gets into the Federal court the

14   decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the

15   object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the

16   underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or

17   not.

18               As I understood the purpose of the

19   Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration

20   was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in

21   State cases as well.       And it's entirely compatible with

22   that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct

23   arbitration in a case this involves an underlying

24   controversy that's purely non-Federal.

25               MR. PHILLIPS:           Oh absolutely.       I mean, you

 1   know, in a situation -- it depends on how you interpret

 2   it.   If you interpret it the way that the Petitioner

 3   does in saying that you can't have any look through --

 4   now he softens that and says, well, no, you can have

 5   look through for diversity.

 6               But if you accept the idea that section 4

 7   only makes you look at the dispute at the arbitration

 8   level, then the reality is you're going to have no cases

 9   that are going to be covered, because you're never going

10   to satisfy the amount in controversy.

11               And then the issue is why do you get to look

12   through for diversity purposes and never get to look

13   through for Federal question purposes?                  And it -- it

14   seems to me the much easier way to reconcile the

15   language of the statute is to say, of course, you look

16   through to see, particularly if you have an unquestioned

17   Federal question dispute that's being litigated between

18   the parties; we know that; there is not an issue before

19   us.   In fact, he has conceded as much even here in court

20   today.

21               And so, it seems to me that's the solution

22   to this case.   Now admittedly, there will be other cases

23   where you may have right in these questions, and there

24   will be other cases where the parties will have to fight

25   at the Federal district court level as to precisely

 1   what's at issue and what the plaintiff really means to

 2   be fighting over.     And it may be in some instances you

 3   won't get an order that directs arbitration.                   But that's

 4   not this case.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why isn't it proper to

 6   look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a

 7   dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor.

 8   Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your

 9   case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal

10   jurisdiction, fine.       But we are not going to look to see

11   what the defendants cases is or might be.                   We'll just

12   look at your case and that's how we will define the

13   controversy.

14                MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, there are two problems

15   with that.     First of all, the statute talks about the

16   subject matter of the controversy.                   It doesn't talk

17   about the specific controversy.

18                And second of all, the statute clearly

19   envisions that there are going to be situations where

20   there is no complaint, there is no underlying State

21   court cause of action, and it still envisions in that

22   situation that a district court is going to have to

23   determine whether or not it would have jurisdiction.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But then you'll have not

25   only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been


                                         52

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of

 2   counterclaim to that claim.

 3              MR. PHILLIPS:          But it seems to me that's

 4   precisely what the language "would have jurisdiction

 5   over the subject matter of the controversy" asks this

 6   Court to make a determination of.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So you would come into

 8   the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere,

 9   but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the

10   defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim?

11   That's a lot of hypothesis.

12              MR. PHILLIPS:          But it seems to me, Justice

13   Ginsburg, the better way to think about this is what if

14   we were getting letters from the Petitioner saying you

15   are engaged in usurious conduct, you're outrageous, you

16   got to stop what you're doing, we are going to bring a

17   class action against you, you had better change your

18   behavior tomorrow, and they don't sue us, and they don't

19   sue us, and they don't sue us?

20              And then the question is are we entitled to

21   go to court to get that resolved and are we entitled to

22   have the resolution to that issue as a matter of

23   arbitration?

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Phillips, the answer

25   to a better hypothetical is what if there had been no


                                      53
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   original collection action but they had brought such an

 2   action.

 3              MR. PHILLIPS:             Right.        Well, that's --

 4   actually, you're right.

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:               That's the case you're

 6   really saying.    You're saying that is like this case.

 7              MR. PHILLIPS:             That is this case.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:               And Justice Ginsburg is

 9   suggesting it's not, because it happens to arise out of

10   a different -- quite different dispute.

11              MR. PHILLIPS:             Right.        I thought your

12   question absolutely nailed it because you said, would

13   this -- you know, if you brought that suit could you and

14   would you, and the answer is yes, you could, and

15   therefore you know as -- without any question that it's

16   a Federal suit.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Excuse me --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:               As I understand your

19   opponent, they would agree there was no jurisdiction

20   even in that case.

21              MR. PHILLIPS:             Right.        I think that's no

22   doubt that that's their position.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                What do you do with the

24   assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync

25   with your view, because they would not give you -- you


                                         54

 1   could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the

 2   arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would

 3   not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the

 4   award?

 5                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I mean the interesting

 6   thing about 9, 10 and 11 is if anything the language is

 7   broader than our language.           If we didn't have the "save

 8   for" and "would have jurisdiction under," this would

 9   clearly be an action that arises under Federal law,

10   because the question, you know, section 4 says have you

11   been aggrieved, do you have a right of action, and do

12   you have a remedy for that action?

13                 I mean, without this rigamarole that we've

14   been talking about this whole time, we would have -- we

15   would easily have a 1331 action.                So if anything you

16   would argue that 9, 10 and 11 arise under Federal law

17   regardless.    Now if you don't want to go that far, then

18   it seems to me you just say you read sections 9, 10 and

19   11 and pairing material with the limitation in Section 4

20   and you wouldn't read it any broader than that.

21                 But there is no basis for taking the

22   unlimited languages in 9, 10 and 11 and somehow

23   distorting that to more narrowly limit the rights that

24   we have under Section 4.          So I --

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But the Petitioner says you


                                        55
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   never clearly clarify the particular Federal on which

 2   the jurisdiction rests on this case.                    What --   can you

 3   clarify that?

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes.      This case arises under

 5   section 4 through Section 27.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         Section 4 creates the

 7   Federal --

 8                MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes, it does create it,

 9   because section 4, without the "would have jurisdiction"

10   language clearly would be arising under jurisdiction, in

11   my judgment, and the only thing -- and then it places an

12   additional requirement on you.

13                You can't just use the contract that gets

14   you into Federal court.        You have to then look to see

15   whether you would have had an underlying cause of action

16   or an underlying Federal claim or whether there would

17   have been diversity jurisdiction on the underlying

18   claim.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why -- why can't you have

20   sort of modified look, through like a modified limited

21   hangout or whatever it was?            That is to say, you can

22   look through for the purpose of determining whether the

23   arbitration agreement raises a Federal question.                    But

24   that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine

25   whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal


                                       56
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   question.

 2               MR. PHILLIPS:         Because I think -- I think

 3   the reference in the statute to controversy clearly

 4   envisions the underlying dispute between the parties,

 5   because it's not just the arbitration agreement and it's

 6   not even just the controversy; it's the subject matter

 7   of the controversy, and you compare that to section 2

 8   and it's clear that what the Congress has in mind there

 9   is the underlying dispute between the parties.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is the Petitioner's -- I'm

11   sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is

12   the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through

13   compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which

14   allows removal if there is a Federal defense?

15               MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I mean, I don't know if

16   it's compromised by it.       I think it -- the Beneficial

17   case makes it absolutely clear that we have here a

18   Federal claim and therefore --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's of course in the

20   context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.        But again I don't

22   think -- I don't think section 4 is asking the courts to

23   make that determination.        I think what section 4 is

24   asking the Court to look at is the subject matter of the

25   controversy, and is it -- is it clear under the


                                      57

 1   circumstances that there is in fact a Federal claim

 2   underlying it?    And here there is no question on that.

 3   I ask you to affirm.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 7                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MR. ORTIZ:       Thank you, Your Honor.             Just a

10   few quick points.

11                I think this Court should be exactly clear

12   how much Federal question jurisdiction the look-through

13   theory would create.       So long as a Federal issue can be

14   imagined anywhere in the lawsuit, there would be Federal

15   question jurisdiction under this theory, and this is

16   almost by definition going to be the case in any dispute

17   concerning credit card debt, either because of the

18   theory of complete pre-emption from the FDIA, or because

19   of the theory used in the Strong case before the

20   Eleventh Circuit that RICO's prohibition on the

21   collection of unlawful debt --

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What about a Federal

23   defense?

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            That isn't quite true,

25   because here there is a definition in the Federal claim


                                        58

 1   in your counterclaim.

 2                 MR. ORTIZ:       I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            There is a definition of

 4   the controversy in your counterclaim and in their

 5   response.

 6                 MR. ORTIZ:       No -- there -- in general, if

 7   you accepted their theory, as long as there is an issue

 8   that could be spun as a Federal issue which there will

 9   always be in a credit card debt collection case and

10   just -- in most States, that on look-through theory

11   would be --

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            You're suggesting that

13   every credit card debtor would have a class action?

14                 MR. ORTIZ:       Your Honor, every -- it does not

15   have to be a class action to establish what would serve

16   --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's your view, but I

18   mean believe me, I think I can keep that problem under

19   control.     That was your original point.                I see the

20   point, it's going to spread too far; you'd have to have

21   some rules that cabin it.

22                 Assume I got that under control; maybe I

23   don't.     This is a case of "well, his brother was worse."

24   What do you want to say about the criticisms of the

25   horrible things that happen if we adopt your position?

 4   jurisdictional inquiry -- inquiries clear.              Petitioner

 5   does not believe that is true.

 6               For example, here the real party in interest

 7   dispute consumed much of the court's time.              The lower

 8   courts have gone both ways on this issue.              It's

 9   incredibly fact-dependent.         There is no easy answer for

10   it.

11               Also, Your Honor, Petitioner does not

12   believe that the Declaratory Judgment Act would have

13   been appropriate in this case.             Declaratory judgments

14   are discretionary and in this context of where you have

15   a pending State court lawsuit Petitioner believes that a

16   Federal district court would be very cautious before

17   permitting one.

18               Also Your Honor, if in the context of

19   declaratory judgment action presumably the district

20   court would have to take the State court admission into

21   account, and in particular here it was admitted that the

22   account was with Discover Financial Services not with

23   the bank.

24               Also, Your Honors, this -- Respondents try

25   to portray Petitioner's position as siphoning off all

 1   Federal question jurisdiction.               That is not true.     Under

 2   Petitioner's view, a lot of Federal question

 3   jurisdiction -- some would remain.                  It would just be

 4   that the arbitration agreement itself would have to

 5   sound in Federal law.       ERISA arbitration agreements

 6   would still be covered.         Some labor agreements would

 7   still be covered.    There would be --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry, what do

 9   you mean would still be covered?

10                MR. ORTIZ:       Would still be covered under

11   Petitioner's theory of what section 4 means.                  So for

12   example, Mr. Chief Justice --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Which would still be

14   in Federal court.

15                MR. ORTIZ:       Would still be in Federal court.

16   Thank you.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

18   The case is submitted.

20   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
