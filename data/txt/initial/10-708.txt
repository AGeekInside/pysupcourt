3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

4    first this morning in Case 10-708, First American

5    Financial Corporation v. Edwards.

6                  Mr. Panner.

7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER

8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9                  MR. PANNER:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                Article III requires a private plaintiff to

12   show injury-in-fact, which means at a minimum that the

13   alleged illegal conduct made her worse off.               Factual

14   injury does not automatically follow from violation of a

15   statutory duty owed to the plaintiff, and Ms. Edwards

16   has not alleged the type of harm alleged by plaintiffs

17   in the common law cases that she invokes:               no

18   misappropriation of her property, no loss of desired

19   opportunity or benefit, no injury to reputation.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:         So, let me just be -- use

21   an example, a hypothetical based on the next case,

22   really.    I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you

23   can't phone people between 7:00 at night and 7:00 in the

24   morning and try to sell them something.               Okay?   That's

25   the law.

1                MR. PANNER:     Yes, Your Honor.

2                JUSTICE BREYER:        And anyone who gets such a

3    phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they

4    sue in court if they receive such a call.

5                The harm was getting the call.           So, my

6    grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls

7    her, loved the telephone call.         She loved it.    Best

8    thing happened to her in a month.          Okay?

9                Now, can she sue?

10               MR. PANNER:     No, Your Honor.        If she does

11   not have actual injury, the fact of the statutory

12   violation would not give rise to standing in that case.

13   Now, it's -- I think it would be quite unlikely that a

14   plaintiff would come before the court and say:

15   Actually, the statutory violation delighted me; I

16   nevertheless would like my $500.

17               But if the injury-in-fact requirement means

18   anything, it means that a plaintiff who comes before the

19   court must have a harm in fact.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:        So, in other words, if the

21   FDA bans a substance on the ground that 98 percent of

22   the people it hurts, and there's some kind of automatic

23   recovery, $500, anybody who bought the substance because

24   it wasn't supposed to be sold, and she's one of

25   the 2 percent that it helped --

1                  MR. PANNER:      Well, Your Honor, in the case

2    in which --

3                  JUSTICE BREYER:          -- can't sue?

4                  MR. PANNER:      In the case in which someone is

5    exposed to a substance that has -- that is illegal, they

6    might well suffer a harm, and the harm might be the

7    exposure to the substance.            And the -- the sort of

8    inquiry that you're looking into, which is even if the

9    exposure ended up not being harmful, would that be a

10   case --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, here she was exposed,

12   or the plaintiff was exposed, to the kind of transaction

13   that Congress said was harmful as a general matter, just

14   like the example you gave.

15                 MR. PANNER:      I don't think so, Your Honor.

16   And the reason is that in this case, the violation -- as

17   her complaint makes clear, she paid the only rate for

18   title insurance available in Ohio.                 She does not

19   complain of the quality of the insurance or the service

20   she received.   She does not maintain --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Because she can't --

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, going back to

23   Justice Breyer's --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I'm sorry.

25                 Justice Ginsburg.

1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Because she can't prove

2    it at the early stage.      I mean, the problem that

3    Congress was concerned about was that you can't tell

4    until the house is going to be sold in the end how

5    adequate the title insurance was.            So, Congress is

6    acting on the potential that these kind of kickbacks can

7    cause harm.    And this does seem to fit the bill of

8    restitution, unjust enrichment cases, where the

9    plaintiff doesn't have to prove any harm; she just gets

10   back what the defendant should not have received.

11                 MR. PANNER:     Your Honor, with respect to

12   unjust enrichment cases, those cases reflect

13   circumstances where there's a benefit received at the

14   expense of the plaintiff.        And in -- in the traditional

15   sorts of cases -- unjust enrichment, of course, is an

16   invention as a category that's relatively recent.              But

17   the unjust enrichment cases reflect quasi-contract

18   circumstances where a benefit was conferred that in

19   justice should have been compensated; so, the plaintiff

20   is made worse off in not receiving the benefit -- or the

21   compensation for the benefit; or a circumstance of

22   constructive trust where there was property or other

23   right of the plaintiff that was misappropriated and used

24   without the permission of the plaintiff; so, an

25   opportunity or a property was taken away.

1                 This is not a case like that, and there's no

2    allegation that there is anything lacking in the

3    insurance that was issued.          This is a circumstance in

4    which Congress may believe that a certain practice as a

5    general matter can tend to bring out -- bring about

6    bad -- bad outcomes and can therefore make it unlawful.

7    But the question here is whether this plaintiff has a

8    harm --

9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, are you taking

10   the very broad position that this is an unusual State,

11   as appears to be in three or four others where the

12   States mandate that title insurance be at a fixed price?

13   But in those States in which there is no such mandate,

14   you seem to be arguing that Congress can't ever presume

15   damages or injury, that even in those cases, the

16   plaintiff has to come in and prove that they would have

17   paid less.

18                Is that the position you're taking?

19                MR. PANNER:     I -- no, Your Honor.      The type

20   of injury that is incurred doesn't necessarily have to

21   be a financial one, and there could be circumstances

22   where a plaintiff would allege an injury.          And I -- it's

23   important to --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, no.   Please tell me,

25   in those States in which insurance is not fixed by the

1    State --

2                MR. PANNER:     Well, if there --

3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- what does the

4    plaintiff have to do other than to say I -- they didn't

5    disclose to me that there was a kickback, and I want the

6    amount I paid for the service?

7                Do they have to show something more?

8                MR. PANNER:     If the -- I want to -- I'm not

9    sure I understand Your Honor's question, but if the

10   question is there were various rates available and the

11   plaintiff alleges an overcharge, that they purchased

12   a -- a policy and there was a cheaper policy available,

13   and as a result of the violation --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, you are in fact

15   arguing very broadly that there is no presumption of --

16   of injury in these cases, that the plaintiff still has

17   to come in and prove --

18               MR. PANNER:     Your Honor --

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- that in fact they

20   would have gotten a cheaper -- a cheaper policy?

21               MR. PANNER:     Your Honor, the -- the

22   plaintiff would have to allege in the complaint and then

23   eventually show that there was some injury.         It doesn't

24   have to be a financial injury.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Same thing with nominal

1    damages and statutory damages?              You're -- you're taking

2    a very broad position now.

3                MR. PANNER:        I don't think so, Your Honor,

4    because, again, the question for purposes of standing,

5    the question for purposes of the ability of a plaintiff

6    to come into court, is to show that they have some

7    injury-in-fact, that there is some harm, some way in

8    which they were made worse off.              This plaintiff --

9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's not so

10   extraordinary.   It's what has to be shown in -- in

11   Sherman Act cases, right?         Contracts and combinations

12   in -- in restraint of trade are unlawful; but in order

13   to recover under the Sherman Act, you have to show not

14   only that it was unlawful, but that you were harmed by

15   it.

16               MR. PANNER:        That's true.        That's certainly

17   the norm in all sort of tort -- tort cases.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I was going to ask you,

19   along that line, are there antitrust cases that -- that

20   Respondents or the Government could cite in which a

21   party can go into court alleging that the market has

22   been distorted, even though that person has no damage?

23   Anything like that in the antitrust -- what would be

24   their closest case?

25               MR. PANNER:        Well, Your Honor, I'm not

 1   sure -- I did not see any of the cases that they cited

 2   involving the trust -- the trust circumstance --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

 4                MR. PANNER:     -- where there was that sort of

 5   vague allegation.   The trust cases I think actually are

 6   a good illustration of the type of injury that's

 7   required.   We're talking about trust, not antitrust now.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Right.

 9                MR. PANNER:     But the trust cases involve a

10   circumstance, the -- I think that the plaintiff here

11   kind of gives the game away by, in the -- when talking

12   about the Michoud case, using the phrase "the plaintiff

13   may sue."   And, of course, that's not what the case

14   says.   What the case says is that a -- that a

15   beneficiary can come into court and say the trust has

16   violated the duty to me; I want to unwind the

17   transaction to get the benefit that I would have gotten

18   had the trustee behaved in the way required.

19                So, in those cases involving trustees, for

20   example, they --

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           There's not automatic

22   disgorgement in those --

23                MR. PANNER:     There could be automatic

24   disgorgement, Your Honor.       But, again, that reflects the

25   lost value of what was paid for in terms of the -- of


                                    10

 1   the --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, but --

 3                JUSTICE KAGAN:        But, Mr. Panner, I

 4   thought --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- let's assume that a

 6   trustee acts on its own interest and sells property, but

 7   let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property,

 8   so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of

 9   anything.    What's the injury to the beneficiary?

10                MR. PANNER:      Well, the injury to the

11   beneficiary in that circumstance, Your Honor, is that

12   the trustee would have misappropriated an opportunity

13   that belonged to the beneficiary.            In the cases

14   that are -- in the ordinary case, then, the beneficiary

15   has the option to say I'd like to unwind that or get the

16   benefit that the trustee got, if there was self-dealing.

17   But in a circumstance where a trustee sells, for

18   example, a piece of property and the -- and the claim is

19   one for restitution to try to unwind the transaction

20   that was done, it's the option of the beneficiary to

21   say:   You know what, maybe I am wrong, but I think I

22   would be better off if I could undo that transaction.

23                So, it's a very conventional kind of harm

24   where someone believes that their property was -- was

25   taken away from them and used in a way to their


                                     11

 1   detriment, and they are therefore seeking relief.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, what more does this

 3   plaintiff have to allege other than, if I had been told

 4   that this was a prearranged, tied product between the

 5   mortgage and the title company but that I had a right to

 6   get an untied product even at the same price, and I

 7   would have exercised that right if I had known?            Would

 8   that be enough?

 9                MR. PANNER:     That might be enough, Your

10   Honor.   But that's exactly what she didn't allege --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Would that be enough

12   in -- in Justice Breyer's example, of someone who says I

13   received a call at midnight and it bothered me?

14                MR. PANNER:     Yes, I think that certainly

15   would be enough, absolutely.            The point is that this

16   complaint abstracted away any such particularized claim

17   for a very particular purpose, which was that in order

18   to maintain this case as a class action, the basis of

19   harm could not be anything personal or individual to

20   this plaintiff.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, you go back to your

22   position that Congress has no power to give a cause of

23   action on the basis of a statutory violation in which it

24   is presuming injury?

25                MR. PANNER:     That is correct, Your Honor.

 2   particular plaintiff an injury that's constitutionally

 3   sufficient under Article III.           I think this Court has

 4   made clear that Congress cannot do that and that the

 5   existence of a statutory right by itself, even the

 6   invasion, the violation of the statutory right does not

 7   create injury for constitutional purposes.           Injury --

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, certainly you

 9   couldn't -- you couldn't sue.           But if I paid money that

10   I would have -- and that I'm entitled to get back, then

11   I've been injured, because --

12                MR. PANNER:     Well, Your Honor, you paid

13   money -- in this case the plaintiff paid money for a

14   title insurance policy which she received.          She paid at

15   -- at the legally required rate, and she makes no

16   complaint about the policy, nor does she claim that it

17   would have mattered to her --

18                JUSTICE ALITO:       Could I ask you to clarify

19   something?   What could a plaintiff who purchases title

20   insurance in Ohio allege that would be sufficient to

21   provide standing?

22                MR. PANNER:     Well, certainly if a plaintiff

23   said that the -- that the manner in which the title

24   insurance was provided had delayed her closing or that

25   there were procedures that were --

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:       No, what could be done --

 2   okay.   Go ahead.

 3                MR. PANNER:     -- that there was something

 4   about the service that she received as a result of

 5   the -- the referral to a particular title insurer,

 6   again, assuming that this is a violation, which we

 7   don't -- we don't think it is.            But -- but assuming that

 8   it is, that --

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:       So, you could -- the

10   plaintiff could allege some kind defective service at

11   the time when the title insurance was purchased?           There

12   really is no service provided at that time, is there?

13               MR. PANNER:      Actually, most --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:        You get -- you get a title

15   insurance policy and that's it; and you don't know

16   whether -- you don't know what will happen if there's

17   some problem alleged with the title at some point down

18   the road.

19               MR. PANNER:      Well, that's really -- the --

20   the risk of that is really on the title insurer, which

21   is why the title insurer has no incentive whatsoever to

22   encourage poor service by a title insurance agent.           The

23   title --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, that -- that leads

25   me to this -- I thought -- I never thought of title

 1   insurance companies as being fungible, and some were

 2   very, very good about narrowing the exceptions, about

 3   working with the seller of the property, if you

 4   represented the buyer, to get rid of the exceptions.

 5   And so, I'm not sure that it's just a question of a

 6   policy versus no policy.         There's a -- there's a quality

 7   to the -- to the research they do.

 8                And the next -- and related to that is this:

 9   You -- you put the case as if the price is going to be

10   the same for the insurance.            (A) I think there's nothing

11   in -- in the State law that permits the insurance

12   company to get -- to set a lower rate; and, second,

13   don't the title companies charge other fees, title

14   search fees and so forth, other fees in addition to the

15   price of the insurance?         And those other fees,

16   arguably -- I know she didn't allege any damage -- but

17   those other fees arguably are too high because of this

18   fixed market.

19                MR. PANNER:        Well, Your Honor, that --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Now, she didn't allege

21   that.   I know that.

22                MR. PANNER:        She didn't allege it, and I

23   think that's critical, because the -- the issue is not

24   whether it's conceivable that an injury could occur from

25   the violation.   It could.         And what you have indicated


                                       15

 1   about difficulty clearing objections to a title, for

 2   example, if there was a problem that she had with

 3   respect to that and she believed that it was the case,

 4   that would actually be the job of the title agent,

 5   which -- and there's no allegation that she was

 6   improperly referred to the title agent.

 7                 So, there -- the insurer is issuing --

 8   underwriting the policy and bears the residual risk, but

 9   it's the agent that is actually engaged with the -- with

10   the plaintiff here.      And there, the agent's name here

11   was Tower City.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Suppose Congress makes a

13   finding, and this is the finding:             We think that lawyers

14   or whoever is engaged in these who hire title insurance

15   companies should hire the best one on the merits, not on

16   the basis of which one will give them the biggest

17   kickback.    We think that's so because that will help

18   keep people secure.      Everyone in such -- who buys a

19   house will feel more secure knowing that the market

20   worked there.    We can't prove who feels insecure and who

21   doesn't.    We think in general they would.          And so, we

22   give everybody the right to recover $500 if they are

23   injured where the injury consists of being engaged in a

24   transaction where the title insurance company was not

25   chosen on the merits but was chosen in whole or in part

 1   on the basis of a kickback.          And they write that right

 2   into the statute.

 3                So, therefore, there is no doubt that the

 4   plaintiff here suffered the harm that Congress sought to

 5   forbid.   That harm was being engaged in a transaction

 6   where the title insurance company was not chosen on the

 7   merits but partly in terms of a kickback.          Now, what in

 8   the Constitution forbids Congress from doing that?

 9                MR. PANNER:      The Constitution, Article III,

10   as this Court has interpreted it, requires that a

11   plaintiff that comes into court must have suffered an

12   injury-in-fact.   And Congress cannot create that injury

13   legislatively.    Otherwise, the Congress can enlist the

14   courts for regulatory purposes that are unrelated to the

15   core function of the court as this Court has -- has

16   articulated it --

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Panner --

18                MR. PANNER:      -- which is --

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:        -- suppose that there were a

20   contract between Mrs. Edwards and Tower and the contract

21   had a no-kickback clause, not one that suggested that

22   Ms. Edwards had to show any kind of injury, greater cost

23   or lesser service, but just you can't have any

24   kickbacks.   Can she sue on that contract?

25                MR. PANNER:      Well, if it was a negotiated

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   agreement and it was -- it was one where the parties had

 2   given value for that assurance, then that would

 3   represent something that there had been a judgment in

 4   advance by this -- by this particular individual that

 5   there was -- that that was something -- that was a

 6   performance that she was willing to pay for and a

 7   promise that meant something to her.             And so, that would

 8   potentially be a different case.

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:       And now suppose that

10   Congress passes a law and says every contract of this

11   kind has to have such a provision in it.

12               MR. PANNER:      Right.

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Would she now have standing?

14               MR. PANNER:      Most likely not, Your Honor,

15   and the reason is that it's the difference between a

16   contract that the parties engage in, where there would

17   be a -- if there's a negotiated contract, it would be

18   reasonable for the court to say, well, there's value

19   attached to the rights that the parties have bargained

20   for here.   But it's different if Congress is using it as

21   a mechanism to create injury legislatively, and in that

22   circumstance, the court would still have to determine

23   whether there was injury-in-fact that would allow the --

24   allow the plaintiff to get into court.

 1                MR. PANNER:     But it's a different case.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Could Congress decree that

 3   the agent in this case shall be an agent of the

 4   purchaser rather than an agent of the title insurance

 5   company?   As it has done in real estate, I think.          The

 6   real estate broker must be an agent of the seller and

 7   not of the purchaser.      Can it -- can it establish a

 8   trust relationship between the purchaser here and the

 9   person selecting the title insurance company?

10                MR. PANNER:     Well, I think that Congress

11   could potentially create a trust relationship --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:        And if it did, would the

13   violation of that trust relationship constitute injury

14   for -- for Article III purposes?

15                MR. PANNER:     Well, it would depend, Your

16   Honor.   Not -- not per se.       It would depend on whether

17   there was some way in which that violation caused an

18   injury-in-fact.   So, for example -- first of all, to the

19   extent that there was some --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:        We don't require

21   injury-in-fact for most breaches of trust, do we?

22                MR. PANNER:     You do, Your Honor.       That is to

23   say that in the case of any of the examples that the

24   plaintiff has cited there is an underlying interest, an

25   antecedent interest, a concrete interest in property or


                                    19
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   in an economic opportunity, paid-for services of an

 2   agent, and it is that concrete interest which is invaded

 3   by the -- by the alleged violation of the -- of the

 4   responsibility of trust.

 5               But, of course, here you don't even have

 6   that relationship of trust.        The -- as --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, I understand, but I'm

 8   just saying that that concrete interest can be created

 9   by Congress instead of being created by contract.          What

10   difference does it make?     If you become a trustee by

11   contract, you get one result; but if you are a trustee

12   by government decree so that you must be a trustee,

13   contract or not?

14               MR. PANNER:     No, I --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Somehow the situation

16   changes?

17               MR. PANNER:     I don't -- I don't think the

18   situation would change.     I guess what I'm saying is that

19   even -- I don't see any of the common law cases

20   involving trusts, trustees, as involving recoveries or

21   suits in the absence of what this Court would certainly

22   consider to be an injury-in-fact, that is to say some

23   harm to a concrete interest that exists apart from the

24   statutory duty or the common law duty.

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But, Mr. Panner, in response

 1   to Justice Scalia's questions and my questions, you are

 2   suggesting that there's a difference depending on what

 3   the source of the law is.       If the source of the right is

 4   -- is a contract, there's one result.            If the source of

 5   the right is a statute, there's another result.           And I

 6   thought that that was very much -- that is -- that's

 7   very much inconsistent with our case law, and

 8   specifically with Lujan.

 9                MR. PANNER:     I certainly didn't mean to say

10   that, Your Honor.   So, let me try to clarify.          The

11   question was -- there are circumstances in which the

12   legal relationship is such that there could be -- let me

13   back up.

14               The question is whether there's an

15   injury-in-fact, that is to say a harm that exists as a

16   factual matter.   And those interests certainly can be

17   reflected by the legal duties that are created.           So, for

18   example, there are legal duties in contract that are

19   intended to protect the interests of the contracting

20   parties.   There are legal duties under the law of trust

21   that are intended to protect the beneficiary.

22               But this Court has frequently reflected the

23   fact that there is the question of the violation, but

24   then there is separately the question of the injury.

25   And the point that I'm making -- and it should be the


                                    21
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   same answer with respect to your question and

 2   Justice Scalia's -- is if -- the mere fact of the

 3   violation of a duty does not create injury per se, and

 4   none of the cases reflect that.            And that is the

 5   proposition that plaintiff relies on here, precisely

 6   because of what she alleged and what she is

 7   attempting -- the type of case that she is attempting to

 8   bring.

 9                  She's attempting to bring a case in which

10   the statutory violation is the injury.              No other injury

11   is required.    She very straightforwardly says it does

12   not matter if there's any economic harm, it does not

13   matter if there's any quality difference, it does not

14   matter if there is any consequential effect on me at

15   all.

16               JUSTICE KAGAN:          I'm not sure that that's the

17   right understanding of her complaint.              She's saying:   I

18   don't have to prove those things because there's been a

19   judgment made that -- that these kinds of practices tend

20   to decrease service and tend to increase price, and

21   therefore I don't have to prove those matters.

22               And that's the exact same judgment that's

23   made in the trust cases, for example.

24               MR. PANNER:        Again, I don't think that the

25   trust cases can be fairly read to say that, Your Honor.


                                      22

 1   But the key point is that there's a distinction between

 2   what Congress -- the statutory duties that Congress can

 3   impose and the manner in which Congress can choose to

 4   have those enforced -- well --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Suppose she -- suppose

 6   she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a

 7   well-respected economist that says Congress was right;

 8   these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect

 9   on the people who are purchasing title insurance.          And

10   goes through all kinds of analyses that show that.

11   Would that be adequate then?

12               MR. PANNER:     Well, at the pleading stage, it

13   might be, Your Honor.    That is to say that if -- if the

14   question were whether there was an allegation, certainly

15   it's possible that there could be a sufficiently

16   concrete allegation in a complaint that there was that

17   sort of an impact, but -- and this is critical -- not

18   only was that not alleged here, but the mere fact that

19   there's a statutory duty does not reflect that's the

20   judgment or, you know, the fact that there's been any

21   sort of systemic effect.

22               Congress has broadly prohibited practices

23   involving kickbacks, and the paradigm case has nothing

24   to do with a situation in which a title insurance agent

25   is issuing a title insurance policy for an underwriter.

 1               Now, it's not to say that Congress can't

 2   pass a broader prohibition and -- you know, and require

 3   that it be enforced.     Well, Congress can pass a broader

 4   prohibition, and then the executive could enforce it.

 5   But what Congress cannot do is to dictate in advance

 6   that a particular practice has caused injury to a

 7   particular plaintiff.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, I'm still

 9   having problems --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Just following up Justice

11   Ginsburg's hypothetical, suppose the Congress works with

12   economists and concludes there is a reasonable

13   probability that if there were no kickbacks, there would

14   be a more competitive market, there would be lower

15   prices for some of the escrow fees, some of the

16   collateral fees in addition to the title insurance, and

17   the plaintiff then alleges that there is this reasonable

18   probability that there would be a more efficient market,

19   resulting in cost savings.         Would that be enough?

20               MR. PANNER:       Well, Your Honor, there has to

21   be a connection between the violation alleged and the

22   harm that ensues.    And so, a general understanding

23   that a particular --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, the person alleges:

25   And I was in this market and I might have -- there's a


                                     24
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   reasonable probability I could have had a lower price,

 2   according to economic theory.

 3               MR. PANNER:       Well -- well, again, that

 4   wasn't alleged here.     So, the question with these

 5   particular --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, I'm assuming it's

 7   alleged.

 8               MR. PANNER:       I understand that, Your Honor.

 9   And so, the question would be particular to the

10   allegations that were made.          In a case like this one,

11   it's in all likelihood a generic allegation that there

12   had been -- that there was some sort of systemic effect

13   is -- it would be insufficient.            That would be a

14   speculative sort of claim of harm, and that would be

15   really something where if it's a general systemic effect

16   with no traceability between the violation that's

18   that would be something for the executive.

19               Mr. Chief Justice, if I can reserve --

20               JUSTICE ALITO:         And if the plaintiff went

21   any further and alleged some harm particular to her,

22   wouldn't that be even more speculative?

 1   rebuttal time, but --

 2                 MR. PANNER:      Thank you, Your Honor.

 3                 I think it would depend.               I mean, certainly

 4   there are all sorts of circumstances where there is

 5   broad systemic harm, but yet the harm to the plaintiff

 6   is very clear, if you think about, for example, about

 7   price fixing.

 8                 If I could reserve the remainder.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

12              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

13                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14                 MR. LAMKEN:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

15   and may it please the Court:

16                 For at least 280 years, the law has been

17   clear that when someone breaches a duty of loyalty owed

18   to you by taking a kickback or otherwise introducing a

19   conflict into a transaction, you can sue on the basis of

20   that alone, without showing a further harm in terms of

21   economic loss.    The invasion of your right to

22   conflict-free service was itself a sufficiently concrete

23   and particularized injury-in-fact, not an abstract and

24   undifferentiated --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         You speak of a duty of


                                      26

 1   loyalty.    There's no duty of loyalty owed here.              It was

 2   just a law that said you cannot get -- and I'm not even

 3   sure it's proper to call it a kickback.               It's a

 4   commission.    These people are agents for the title

 5   insurance company, and they get a commission on -- on

 6   every sale of title insurance that they make.               You can

 7   call it a kickback, I suppose.           I don't know why the

 8   other side does.    But -- but it seems to me a

 9   commission.    There's no duty of loyalty.             Isn't -- isn't

10   the seller here the agent of the title insurance

11   company?

12                 MR. LAMKEN:     Congress could have made them,

13   the agent, could have -- as you pointed out, could have

14   made them a full-fledged fiduciary.               Elevating your

15   interest in having no conflicts whatsoever in the

16   transaction --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        We have a different -- we

18   have a different case then.

19                 MR. LAMKEN:     Yes.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        But they didn't do that,

21   did they?

22                 MR. LAMKEN:     Congress actually elevated one

23   component of that by giving you a right to freedom from

24   a particular conflict of interest, and that is the

25   kickbacks that undermine their incentive to serve your

 1   best interest, that undermine their incentive to choose

 2   the insurer that provides the best quality and the best

 3   service.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, this is where I have

 5   problems with your argument, because this doesn't seem

 6   to me to be a fiduciary relationship, and I don't see

 7   where the -- where the duty of loyalty comes from.                  And

 8   to say that Congress can just impose some attributes of

 9   a fiduciary relationship wherever it wants seems rather

10   strange.

11               Let me give you this example:               I take my car

12   to an auto dealer to have -- because it's making a

13   strange sound.   And I say call me up when you figure out

14   what you think is the problem.          They call me up, and

15   they say, well, there are certain things wrong with it,

16   and it's going to cost you $1,000.               And I say, okay,

17   now, thanks for diagnosing the problem; where should I

18   have it fixed?   Should I have it fixed at your shop or

19   should I go to another place and have it fixed?               And

20   they say, well, have it fixed at our shop.               Now, is

21   there a breach of a duty of loyalty there?

22               MR. LAMKEN:      Well, you might have an

23   interest in getting an honest opinion.               It's just not

24   protected in law.   They're allowed to tell you what they

25   want to tell you because you have no protected interest

 1   in their opinion.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:        I know.        But we're looking

 3   for whether there's an injury-in-fact.             Put aside the

 4   question of whether there's a breach of the duty in law.

 5   There is allegedly here.      I just don't see where there's

 6   an injury-in-fact, because I know -- I'm an idiot if I

 7   don't realize -- that they have a strong economic

 8   incentive to say come have it fixed at my place.

 9               MR. LAMKEN:      Well, in fact, Your Honor,

10   Congress is entitled to elevate your interest in

11   obtaining honest judgments or conflict-free advice to

12   legal protection, whether you would be an idiot in

13   accepting it or expecting it in the first instance.

14   They can take that relationship and make it confidential

15   and make it an honest one, even if you hadn't expected

16   that in the first place.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, the issue isn't

18   whether they can afford it legal protection.             They

19   certainly can.   And there can be suits by -- by the

20   Federal Government or, I think, under this statute even

21   by State -- State attorneys general.             The issue isn't

22   whether Congress can achieve that result.             It's whether

23   they can achieve it by permitting private suits.

24               MR. LAMKEN:      Right.      But the common law was

25   absolutely clear that when someone invaded your right to


                                    29
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   a conflict-free transaction, invaded your right not to

 2   have kickbacks in your transaction, you didn't have to

 3   prove that there was an economic consequence.              The

 4   invasion of your right not to have conflicts invade that

 5   transaction was sufficient.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Could you tell -- could

 7   you tell me, just with Justice Alito's automobile

 8   hypothetical, just as a matter of agency law -- I'm a

 9   little rusty on this one.       If the auto repair people

10   phone and say:   And you need two parts and we'll

11   purchase those parts for you.            And they then purchase

12   parts from a company that they own.              Under standard

13   agency law, could the vehicle owner get disgorgement?

14               MR. LAMKEN:      If the -- if they are acting --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And he doesn't know --

16   they haven't been informed --

17               MR. LAMKEN:      If that is an agency duty --

18   and we assume that that's an agent; they're acting as

19   agent for the person with the broken car -- the answer

20   is absolutely, without having to show any loss.              And

21   this Court's case in Magruder v. Drury was that type of

22   case, where it was absolutely clear that the plaintiff

23   would not have paid a cent more, the estate would not

24   have paid a cent more, if that -- they had gone

25   elsewhere to make the purchase.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:         If I take a car to an auto

 2   mechanic, he's not my agent.            He's an independent

 3   contractor doing business.        He's not my agent.

 4               MR. LAMKEN:      That's exactly why I said --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:         And it's not an agency

 6   relation here, either.

 7               MR. LAMKEN:      Congress --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:         It's a customer going to

 9   somebody who is an independent contractor.

10               MR. LAMKEN:      Congress imposed one component

11   of the duty that applies to agents and fiduciaries

12   across the board, and that is:           Don't take kickbacks

13   that undermine the incentive to obtain the best deal for

14   your consumer.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:         More than agents and

16   fiduciaries across the board.           He is neither an agent

17   nor a fiduciary.   And what's the closest case you have

18   to a situation where there is neither an agency

19   relationship nor a trust relationship, and yet this kind

20   of a right to sue without showing damage exists?              What's

21   the -- what's your best shot?

22               MR. LAMKEN:      Well, the law has a number of

23   contexts where you don't have to show financial loss.

24   If somebody defames you, you don't have -- in your

25   business, you don't have to show that you're financially

 1   injured.   That's injury-in-fact in and of itself.

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, that gets to a

 3   point that I'm having trouble getting my arms around.

 4   It seems to me what your position is, what you want us

 5   to focus on, there are three possible arguments.                 One is

 6   that there is injury-in-fact in this case.                 I see some

 7   of that argument in your briefs.             Two, that Congress

 8   presumes injury-in-fact.        Injury-in-fact is still

 9   required, but that is presumed.            I read that to be

10   perhaps what the trust cases say.             Or, three, that

11   injury-in-fact is not required at all.                 Now, which are

12   you arguing?    One, two or three?

13               MR. LAMKEN:        I think our argument is that

14   the invasion of your statutory right to a conflict-free

15   service is itself an injury-in-fact --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay, statutory

17   right.

18               MR. LAMKEN:        But it also has --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Can I -- I'm sorry

20   to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question.

21   You said violation of a statute is injury-in-fact.                   I

22   would have thought that would be called injury-in-law.

23   And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that

24   what is required is injury-in-fact, I understand that to

25   be in contradistinction to injury-in-law.                 And when you


                                      32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   tell me all that you've got or all that you want to

 2   plead is violation of the statute, that doesn't sound

 3   like injury-in-fact.

 4                 MR. LAMKEN:     It's injury-in-fact in the

 5   following two senses, Judge -- Mr. Chief Justice:

 6   First, all you have to do -- getting a conflict-free

 7   referral is itself substantively more valuable than

 8   getting one laden by conflict.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Okay.   Now, that

10   goes back to the first proposition.                That's an argument

11   that there is injury-in-fact here.                So, it seems to me

12   that -- I don't mean this in a pejorative sense, but it

13   seems to me that you slide back and forth between one,

14   two, and three, which makes it hard for us to get a

15   decision.

16                 MR. LAMKEN:     I think the answer is, so long

17   as Congress has entitled you to something of potential

18   value that isn't being denied to every other member of

19   the public in an undifferentiated way, that is

20   sufficient to be injury-in-fact.            Now --

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Potential --

22   potential value.

23                 MR. LAMKEN:     Potential value.            And it's more

24   valuable --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Now, we said in the


                                     33

 1   Whitmore case, and this is a quote:               "Allegations of

 2   possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements

 3   of Article III."   Potential value sounds to me like

 4   possible future injury.

 5               MR. LAMKEN:      In this sense, Your Honor:

 6   It's what you received is substantively less valuable.

 7   All you have to do is ask yourself, would I value more

 8   advice from somebody who's playing it straight --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Okay.

10               MR. LAMKEN:      -- on a financial side or

11   someone who is taking kickbacks from --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So, that's

13   injury-in-fact?

14               MR. LAMKEN:      That's injury-in-fact --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Okay.

16               MR. LAMKEN:      -- and there's another way in

17   which it's injury-in-fact.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So, if you tell me

19   what this case is about is whether or not you've shown

20   injury-in-fact, it's not a significant -- significant

21   case, and your client has to prove that at trial.

22               MR. LAMKEN:      Well, she proved that she got

23   something less valuable.      She got something she was

24   entitled to --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But I thought -- and

 1   maybe it's a unique circumstance in this case, but Ohio

 2   says this is going to cost you the same no matter what

 3   you do.

 4                MR. LAMKEN:       That's actually quite

 5   incorrect, Your Honor.       Ohio --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.   But then

 7   again, that's an argument about was there or was there

 8   not injury-in-fact.

 9                MR. LAMKEN:       Well, the injury-in-fact is

10   getting something that's potentially -- not getting

11   something to which the law entitles you, which has

12   potential value to you.        And a conflict-free referral is

13   much more valuable than one laden by conflicts.

14                And there is another thing.                We haven't

15   disclaimed the notion entirely.            We haven't -- in fact,

16   we believe it is very likely that -- that quality or

17   price suffered as a result of these -- of these

18   conflicts.   But --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That sounds --

20   again, to use a word we've said is inadequate to support

21   standing, that sounds conjectural.

22                MR. LAMKEN:       No, it's not.           It's not

23   conjectural at all.      Congress specifically found that

24   these are the consequences.           But the --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, no, no.    We're

 1   talking about not what Congress found; what the

 2   injury-in-fact is.

 3                 MR. LAMKEN:      Right.        Your Honor --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So, you will agree,

 5   won't you, that the idea that it's certainly possible or

 6   whatever your formulation was, that the quality here

 7   wasn't good enough or that the entire quality across the

 8   board might be better, that's conjectural, right?

 9                 MR. LAMKEN:      No.        Well, Your Honor, it's

10   very hard to prove.      And it was for that exact reason

11   that --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Now we're in point

13   -- now we're at level two:          It's hard to prove.        So, is

14   that your argument, that Congress presumed injury?

15                 MR. LAMKEN:      No, Your Honor.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Okay.

17                 MR. LAMKEN:      That's why the common law

18   elevated the right to conflict-free services from not

23   to the middle category.        As I'm now seeing it, you have

 1   passes a statute that creates a pariah.           It could be a

 2   substance.    It could be a form of behavior.         It could be

 3   a structure of an industry.

 4                 And then once it does that, it makes that

 5   unlawful.    And now what it's done, it is more unusual

 6   than I ever thought.     It comes up in the loyalty

 7   context, fiduciary, but we're not talking about

 8   fiduciary.    It says it is a harm and you will earn money

 9   if you deal with a pariah, assuming it wasn't your

10   fault.

11                Now, that's where I have ended up with your

12   answers to the Chief, and now, having put it that way, I

13   can find loads of examples in my mind where there's a

14   trustee or fiduciary involved.           I can think of an

15   example in the qui tam context, but to think of one

16   right on point is a little hard, though I thought there

17   must be some.

18                MR. LAMKEN:      Justice Breyer, the breach of

19   contract, in some sense, is precisely that pariah.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:         The what?

21                MR. LAMKEN:      A breach of contract.      If

22   somebody breaches a -- a contractual duty owed to me, I

23   don't have to prove that I suffered economic injury.

24   The breach of the promise itself gives me a grievance

25   sufficient to entitle me to sue for nominal damages

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:        You mean you can sue in

 3   court even if what you come in and you say, they

 4   breached my contract, and as a result, I made $10,000 I

 5   wouldn't have otherwise made?           And when the judge says

 6   "And what damages do you seek," you say?

 7                MR. LAMKEN:     I'd like $1 more, Your Honor.

 8   I want nominal damages or if there's --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:        And you can do that?

10                MR. LAMKEN:     Or -- or -- so, if there are

11   stipulated liquidated damages, you're entitled to those

12   as well.   That was the common law rule for years --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:        No liquidated --

14                MR. LAMKEN:     -- it's the majority rule

15   today.

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, no, that --

 3   that gets -- I didn't mean to be facetious, but it gets

 4   to the question of whether or not you have to actually

 5   show injury-in-fact.      Your allegation in this case is

 6   for damages, not just nominal damages but damages.

 7                  MR. LAMKEN:     Your Honor, if the injury is

 8   sufficient to get you in court to get $1 --

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is that -- is that right?

10   I thought --

11                MR. LAMKEN:       -- it doesn't evaporate just

12   because you want to get --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Lamken, you're not

14   seeking damages.    You're seeking what the statute says

15   you can get, which is your money back treble?

16                MR. LAMKEN:       Exactly, Your Honor.          We're

17   seeking precisely what the statute entitles to us when

18   there is the breach of this duty owed to us --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So, it's not that you

 2   sorry.

 3                  MR. LAMKEN:     -- one injury not two, one

 4   injury-in-fact, a violation of a duty owed to us for our

 6   having suffered an economic loss.

 8   out of this contract?

13   whether or not Ms. Edwards would want to get out of the

14   deal or not.    But the statute says that she doesn't have

15   to give up her insurance which protects her home in

17   guaranteed her, which were --

19   didn't see an allegation for rescission or -- or, you

 1   before, which is, indeed, it's -- we think it's like --

 2   that there is -- there are diminution in quality and

 3   paying excessive price, but the law says we don't have

 4   to prove that because the -- because the law has

 5   elevated our right to a conflict-free transaction to be

 6   -- to legally protected status.

 7               The very reason the common law said -- in

 8   the fiduciary and the trust and all the other

 9   confidential issues in context, said we're not going to

10   ask about the economics, we're not going to regulate the

11   economics here, because that's too hard.          What we're

12   going to do is we're going to protect your right to

13   receive the best advice possible.          And at that --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, maybe I'm just

15   looking at this too simply.        You pay -- your client paid

16   $455 for title insurance, correct?

17               MR. LAMKEN:     Yes.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         She is claiming that she

19   paid that money on the statutory assumption that the

20   agent would disclose to her any kickbacks, correct?

21               MR. LAMKEN:     It's not a disclosure duty but

22   on the statutory basis that she was entitled to a

23   conflict-free referral, that they were not directing her

24   purchase on the basis of conflict that so undermined --

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I paid money, I lost the

 4   money, I'd have it back because what I've bought was a

 5   conflict-free --

 6               MR. LAMKEN:       That's exactly right.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- referral, and that's

 8   not what I got.

 9               MR. LAMKEN:       Like an aggrieved trust

10   beneficiary, she is seeking to get back something that

11   belonged to her, $455 that she parted company with in a

12   conflicted transaction.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You -- you don't

14   want a conflict-free transaction because you don't want

15   to get out of this contract.             You're perfectly happy

16   with the contract.    You want $500.              You don't want a

17   conflict-free transaction, because even if it was a --

18   were a conflict-free transaction, the price would be the

19   same, in Ohio.

20               MR. LAMKEN:       Not necessarily so, Your Honor,

21   because Ohio does not preclude price competition.                 You

 2   an injury-in-fact; she might have gotten a better deal.

 3                  MR. LAMKEN:     She has been exposed -- it's

 4   impossible to tell whether or not Fidelity would have

 5   been better because of financial soundness or another

 6   company would have been better because it has better

 7   claim handling down the road.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        And you don't want to have

 9   to prove that, because if you proved any damage, there

10   goes your class action --

11               MR. LAMKEN:        Absolutely not.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- because you don't have

13   commonality.

14               MR. LAMKEN:        The reason we're not -- we did

15   not allege it is because the statute doesn't require it,

16   and for 280 years, when somebody takes a -- takes a

17   kickback that interferes with your obtaining the best

18   deal possible, that itself was actionable without

19   proving any further --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           How does it -- how does it

21   harm her to get a title insurance policy for the price

22   of $453 from what you call a kickback-free seller, as

23   opposed to getting the same title insurance for $453

24   from a non-kickback-free seller?             Is that an

 1                MR. LAMKEN:      Yes.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:         The -- the vague notion

 3   of -- of buying it from -- from -- I don't know, a white

 4   knight?    Is that the kind of injury-in-fact that our

 5   cases talk about?

 6                MR. LAMKEN:      Your Honor --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         It seems to me purely -- I

 8   don't know -- philosophical.

 9                MR. LAMKEN:      It's not philosophical at all

10   because that exact right, ensuring that she gets her --

11   her purchase in a kickback-free transaction is for her

12   benefit.   And when she is denied that right, she has

13   been denied something of potential value that hasn't

14   been denied to everybody else in the universe.

15                For her protection, she was entitled to have

16   them -- the very fact of a kickback undermines the

17   incentive to pursue her best interest.            Like a trust

18   beneficiary, a home buyer spending her money to insure

19   title on her home has a concrete and particularized

20   interest in insuring that those who direct the purchase

21   are not doing it based on kickbacks, which so

22   undermine the incentive to seek her best interest.

23                It may be very hard to prove in individual

24   cases that, you know, Fidelity is more financially sound

25   or another has better claims handling.            But it was

 1   precisely for that reason that Congress got out of the

 2   business and the courts got out of the business of

 3   trying to regulate the underlying economics.            They're

 4   not going to regulate price.            They're not going to

 5   regulate quality.   And, instead, we're going to give you

 6   a right to get the referral from somebody who has

 7   expertise and who doesn't have a conflict created by a

 8   conflict -- by a kickback that so undermines their

 9   incentive --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Doubtless Congress wanted

11   to get out of the business.         But the issue here is

12   whether Congress can get out of the business, whether it

13   is the function of courts to provide relief to people

14   who haven't been injured.       I mean, that's -- that's --

15   that's the whole issue.

16               MR. LAMKEN:      Justice Scalia, the

17   Constitution, statutes, the common law regularly create

18   bright-line across-the-board rights to protect

19   underlying financial or other economic interests, where

20   the right may sweep more broadly and may apply in cases

21   where those underlying interests are defected.           But we

22   don't go look backwards at the purpose of the right,

23   abstract the right to its purpose and say, well, unless

24   it's purpose was -- was achieved in this particular

25   purpose, we're not going to --

 2   injury-in-fact if the plaintiff knew everything that was

 3   relevant to this -- was an economist who had studied the

 4   effect of these things on title insurance price and

 5   quality and, in fact, had -- was aware of every single

 6   transaction that had ever occurred between the title

 7   insurance company and the title agent?           Would there be

 8   injury-in-fact in that situation?

 9               MR. LAMKEN:     Yes.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:       Nevertheless said, okay, I

11   understand this is what I'm getting into, but I'm going

12   ahead.

16   injury-in-fact?

17               MR. LAMKEN:     Yes, because he has been denied

18   something he is entitled to, which is another expert's

19   untainted referral which is not affected in any way by

20   kickbacks, which we know are entirely corrosive in the

21   interest to pursue his best interest.           He might --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but it's circular

23   for you to say he's denied something he's entitled to.

24   The question is whether there's an injury.           The

 3   entitled to it and, therefore, it's an injury, that's

 4   just -- that's just circular.            That gives no substance

 5   at all to the -- to the meaning of the term "injury."

 6               MR. LAMKEN:      Yes, but the -- the invasion of

 7   a statutory right itself can be injury-in-fact so long

 8   as it's sufficiently concrete and -- and particularized.

 9   That you're not just asserting another -- an interest of

10   the public at large.

11               The Court has protected interests as

12   divorced from property interests as the right to obtain

13   information from the government through FOIA or FACA.

14   It can protect your -- your non-property interest in not

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Further harm that

 8   happens to be economic, not further economic harm.

 9                 MR. LAMKEN:     Exactly.

20                 MR. YANG:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22                 When an individual has a statutory right to

23   a kickback-free referral in a financial transaction, she

24   participates in a particular financial transaction in

25   which her right is violated, and she pays money for the

 1   service unlawfully referred, she has sustained an

 2   Article III injury-in-fact based on, as this Court has

 3   repeatedly explained its test, an invasion of a legally

 4   protected interest that is --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Suppose -- Mr. Yang, let

 6   me give -- give you a hypothetical.              Suppose, you know,

 7   Congress did this to spare the Attorney General the

 8   necessity of suing to enforce these requirements.

 9   Suppose Congress wants to take the burden off the back

10   of the Internal Revenue Service.

11               So, it says that anybody who buys any

12   product from a company that has not paid its taxes is

13   entitled to $500.   Okay?     What that person is entitled

14   to is a -- a tax-observant seller, given a national

15   right to a tax-observant seller.           Would every person who

16   buys from some -- some company that hasn't paid its

17   taxes have a cause of action?

18               MR. YANG:     No.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Why not?

20               MR. YANG:     This Court has explained, I think

21   principally in your opinion in Lujan v. Defenders of

22   Wildlife, that Congress cannot convert an

23   undifferentiated public interest in enforcement of the

24   law --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:          But this is differentiated.

 1   You have to have bought from one of these companies.

 2   It's not everybody.       Not everybody has bought from these

 3   tax cheats.

 4                 MR. YANG:     I -- I understand.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         It's only the people who

 6   bought from tax cheats.

 7                 MR. YANG:     There is also a threshold.

 8   Obviously, Congress can't simply narrow the class of --

 9   of plaintiffs to say people with college degrees or

10   people who were born on a Monday.             There needs to be a

11   sufficient connection between the --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         A nexus, right?     Your brief

13   is full of "nexus" --

14                 MR. YANG:     Well, would you --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         It's legal jargon for

16   "connection."

17                 MR. YANG:     We'll use "connection" here.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Lovely.      Say "connection."

19   I like it.

20                 (Laughter.)

21                 MR. YANG:     We'll say "connection."

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I love it.

23                 MR. YANG:     But what -- in our view, there

24   needs to be a reasonable connection between the

25   proscribed conduct -- here, the paying of taxes -- and

 1   the class of persons --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Okay.

 3                MR. YANG:      -- to which the Congress has

 4   conferred the right, and that has to be such that the

 5   person class is reasonably regarded as victims of the

 6   conduct --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:          How much of a connection

 8   is -- is necessary?      Suppose you have a law that

 9   requires all machine parts produced by companies to --

10   to contain a certain feature, and anyone who buys one

11   that doesn't contain that feature gets $500.              I purchase

12   one.   That feature is of no use to me at all.             That

13   product would be just as good for me for the purposes

14   for which I am using it had it not had that feature.

15                Would that be okay?           Would I have a cause of

16   action?

17                MR. YANG:      It's unclear.          Let me -- let me

18   try to figure out the hypothetical a little bit further.

19   If Congress -- for instance, if the machine part was a

20   safety harness in your car and you purchased a car with

21   a safety harness but you happen simply, you know, to not

22   use the safety harness, Congress might well be able to

23   say -- provide for a protection for all purchasers of

24   this particular vehicle or any kind of vehicle must --

25   that those types of vehicles must have that safety


                                      51

 1   equipment in order to protect the consumers who purchase

 2   it.

 3                And in that instance, Congress could well

 4   provide for a statutory damage provision to protect such

 5   an individual generally.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:          So, even though I've

 7   installed my own safety harness, which I always do when

 8   I buy a car, I --

 9                (Laughter.)

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- I can sue because this

11   car that they sold me didn't have the safety harness?

12                MR. YANG:      That's --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:          500 bucks.

14                MR. YANG:      That's correct.        And let me --

15   let me go to some historical analogues to explain why

16   the focus has to be on the invasion of a legally

17   protected interest.      You have things like trespass.          At

18   common law -- and this was well known to the framers.

19   At common law, if you simply step across a boundary

20   line, a line defined in law and the rights that are

21   defined in law that are associated with that line, if

22   you simply step across this and step back, that is a

23   trespass.   You could bring an action in court.            You

24   could have no -- no impact whatsoever except the

25   invasion of your legal right, and you would get nominal


                                      52
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   damages.

 2                 And that type -- similarly, if you had a

 3   contract, you could have a breach of the contract.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Justice Scalia has a point,

 5   because, I mean, as I heard him, he was -- he was

 6   reiterating what used to be called a prudential rule of

 7   standing.    It wasn't constitutional, but you looked to

 8   see if the statute is meant to protect this kind of

 9   person against that kind of harm.            All right?      And if

10   not, there's lack of prudential standing.

11                Well, if that's the test, his case would

12   fall outside it, because the tax law is not meant to

13   protect the plaintiff there, but this case would fall

14   within it.

15                MR. YANG:     I think it's more than prudential

16   standing.    It goes to what is an injury-in-fact, which

17   the Court has, again, repeatedly explained is an

18   invasion of a legally protected interest that is

19   sufficiently concrete and particularized.

20                Now, we don't think that Congress can,

21   through the guise of a right, convert a generalized

22   interest in enforcement of the law into something that

23   an individual can come in to --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, why do --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:         What is -- I'm sorry,

 1   Chief, go ahead.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What -- why do we

 3   always say injury-in-fact then?            You say so long as the

 4   harm is a violation of the law, a legally protected

 5   interest.   Our standing cases always say injury-in-fact

 6   as opposed to injury-in-law.             And yet, you're saying if

 7   you violate the law, you have sufficient injury.

 8                MR. YANG:     Well, your cases actually say an

 9   injury-in-fact, and then you go on to explain that --

10   for instance, in Defenders of Wildlife, that that is an

11   invasion of a legally protected interest.               And I'm not

12   saying it's any invasion of the law, but when Congress

13   confers a right --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Because they also go

15   on to say that it has to be concrete.

16                MR. YANG:     Right.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Real and immediate,

18   not conjectural or hypothetical.

19                MR. YANG:     That's right.           It can't be an

20   abstract type of a thing; it has to be in a specific

21   factual context that's amenable to judicial -- a

22   realistic judicial appreciation of the consequences --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So that all of our

24   cases -- we could have left "in fact" out of all of

25   them?   None of them come out differently because we

 1   insist on injury-in-fact?

 2                 MR. YANG:    Well, I -- I don't know if you

 3   could have left it out.       You could have called it

 4   anything.    It is a legal label that the Court has

 5   applied to --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The difference

 7   between legal harm, though -- I mean, isn't that -- I

 8   guess I'm just repeating myself.            Injury-in-fact -- how

 9   do you understand that to be different than any other

10   kind of injury?

11                 MR. YANG:    Well, an injury-in-fact is not

12   simply a legal injury in the sense of any violation of

13   the law.    It is an invasion of a legally protected

14   interest with respect to this particular individual, the

15   particular plaintiff.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              There are two

17   elements.    That's the particularized requirement, and I

18   understand that.    But you're saying there's --

19   injury-in-fact simply means particularized?

20                 MR. YANG:    No.     No, no, no, no.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Okay.

22                 MR. YANG:    It includes several concepts.            An

23   injury-in-fact is an invasion of a legally protected

24   interest.    It either has to be actual or imminent, and

25   it has to be concrete and particularized.                 Now, again --


                                      55
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   so, there's several concepts within the umbrella of

 2   injury-in-fact.

 3                 But I'd like to go back to the examples that

 4   we would find, at the time of the framing, of many types

 5   of injuries where you don't have to have anything other

 6   than an invasion of your legally protected right.               For

 7   instance, a right to an agreement.                If there's a breach

 8   that has no impact whatsoever, you would be able to get

 9   in and sue.

10                 Now, there's a question of the

11   quantification of damage, but that's separate.               That's

12   not whether you have an injury-in-fact.               It is how --

13   the measure of damages, and the measure of damages at

14   common law would be nominal damages.

15                 Similarly, an invasion -- a trespass

16   invasion, or, for instance, if you were a beneficiary of

17   a trust --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure about

19   trespass.    The object of my owning property is that I

20   have a right to exclude.       This is what I own.          This is

21   what the law protects.      This is a -- this is a spatial

22   area for --

23                 MR. YANG:    But why does --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- for my -- which is my

25   own domain.

 1                MR. YANG:     And why you have that is --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And there -- there is an

 3   injury to that right.      Now --

 4                MR. YANG:     But if the right's threatened --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- you want to say -- you

 6   want to say that Congress can say that you have a right

 7   to buy a conflict-free title insurance policy.             I'm --

 8   I'm not sure that the two equate.

 9                MR. YANG:     Well, going back to your

10   hypothetical, the reason you have that interest, the

11   reason you have the right to exclude this space, is

12   solely by operation of the law.            Those concepts that are

13   attached to property rights were created by common law

14   courts.   Just as common law courts can create rights,

15   the invasion of which create interest, so too can a

16   State legislature or when Congress is acting within its

17   Article III -- Article I power.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, but it's essential to

19   my -- it's essential to my feeling of security and

20   dignity and privacy.     Like the Justice Breyer telephone

21   call hypothetical.

22                MR. YANG:     I don't -- I don't think the --

23   any common law court has inquired whether the invasion

24   -- the trespass somehow made you insecure or invaded

25   your privacy --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You can -- the

 2   trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because

 3   you are talking about a property right, and you can sell

 4   a property right.    You can go to somebody and say I have

 5   the right to keep people off of this piece of property.

 6   Do you want to buy it?      Here's how much it's worth.               But

 7   if -- that's only a property right to the extent you can

 8   keep people off of it.

 9               Here, no one's going to buy this right from

10   the -- the plaintiff, because everybody's got it anyway.

11   You don't -- you don't pay her, because she doesn't have

12   a tangible concrete right.         The trespass case, the

13   person obviously does, because he can sell it.

14               MR. YANG:      Well, anything can be monetized.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, this one --

16   that's my point.    This cannot be monetized because

17   everybody's already got it.

18               You can answer.

25   specific financial transaction.           It's a transaction

17                 (Laughter.)

18                 MR. PANNER:     That of the -- that of the

19   plaintiff and that of the Government, Your Honor.               I

20   should have been more particularized.

21                 (Laughter.)

22                 MR. PANNER:     The violation of a duty owed to

23   us, that is what plaintiff claims is the injury here.

24   The violation of a duty is a violation of a duty; it is

25   not injury.    And similarly the Government says that what


                                     59

 1   is required is a sufficient connection to the conduct.

 2   But what is required is not a connection to the conduct;

 3   what is required is an injury-in-fact, a harm to the

 4   plaintiff who is seeking to obtain redress from the

 5   courts.   And that fundamental limitation on the role of

 6   the courts is critical to the liberty of the people who

 7   come before the courts and who are subject to the power

 8   of the courts.

 9               It is absolutely appropriate for someone who

10   has been harmed through the violation of a statutory or

11   common law duty owed to that person to come before the

12   court seeking redress, but what is not possible is for

13   the courts to be open to a plaintiff who has not alleged

14   that the statutory duty -- the statutory violation that

15   has been alleged has caused any adverse impact.

16               Now, of course, there are broadly -- there

17   are -- there's illegal conduct that may have caused harm

18   to a broad section of the population.            If somebody

19   engages in price fixing and then sells those price-fixed

20   goods, it may be very easy to show that, as a result of

21   that, many people suffered harm and can come into court

22   to sue for it.   Similarly, there are non-financial harms

23   that are the basis for standing in many, many cases:

24   for example, defamation, harm to reputation,

25   discrimination where somebody is subject to a -- an


                                    60

 1   injury of being discriminated against.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        What about a -- I'm sorry

 3   to interrupt your -- your concluding remarks, but I am

 4   troubled by the dollar nominal damages for breach of

 5   contract.   What do you say about that?

 6                MR. PANNER:     Well, Your Honor, in -- in a

 7   circumstance in which there is a bargain for

 8   performance, and it may well be that there is a

 9   recognition that there is value that was assigned to

10   that performance that may be hard to measure, and

11   therefore there is a concrete injury that's hard to

12   measure, and, therefore, nominal damages is awarded.

13               Now, it's -- the cases are not uniform on

14   whether nominal damages are available.              There's -- it's

15   actually split and that there's -- we are not aware of a

16   case in this Court that would say that in a circumstance

17   in which there was a harmless breach, that -- that a

18   suit for nominal damages would establish Article III

19   standing.   So, with respect to that, I'm -- I'm not sure

20   what the correct answer would be.

21               Unless the Court has further questions?

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel,

23   counsel.

24               The case is submitted.
