 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton,

 5   the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning.

 6                Mr. Hamilton.

 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN HAMILTON

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MR. HAMILTON:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                The Tenth Circuit and Stephanie Lanning were

12   wrong in ignoring the new Chapter 13 means test

13   contained in the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code.

14   The amendments to the 2005 Bankruptcy Code were intended

15   to reduce judicial discretion by inserting a formula

16   rather than the judicial discretion that had previously

17   been accorded to judges and to the litigants.

18                Stephanie Lanning fell afoul of the means

19   test because during the first 2 months of a 6-month

20   lookback period, which I will explain in a moment, she

21   had more income than what she had in the rest of the

22   6-month lookback period.          That income was from a buyout

23   from her former employer, Payless, and distorted what

24   her income appeared to be during that 6-month period of

25   time.   Because of that, the amount which the means test


                                         3

 1   showed that she would be required to pay to her

 2   creditors was more than she could actually pay.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which means -- which

 4   means what?    What is the consequence of that?               You

 5   concede that on the strict application of the 6 months

 6   she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to

 7   pay the creditors.      So what happens to her?

 8                 MR. HAMILTON:          What happens to her and what

 9   could have happened to her may be two different

10   propositions, Justice Ginsburg.                 In the first place,

11   there are two parts to that 6-month lookback period,

12   which are found in 101(10A) of the United States

13   Bankruptcy Code -- and the statutes, by the way here,

14   are found at pages 83 through 96 of the petition

15   appendix.

16                 101(10A) has a first part which defines the

17   6-month lookback period as being 6 months prior to the

18   filing of the date of the petition -- actually, the end

19   of the month prior to the filing of the petition.

20   Congress's thought was, it seems, that that would be

21   more representative of what an individual's actual

22   income would be.

23                 There is a second part to that 6-month

24   lookback period which says essentially that the debtor

25   can move that 6-month lookback period by not filing


                                          4

 1   certain papers with the court.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's -- can you explain

 3   that?   It seems very odd.         It says she can do that if

 4   she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do.                  I

 5   mean, she's supposed to file that schedule.                 She's

 6   required, the statute says, to file it.                 But she gets an

 7   advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?

 8                MR. HAMILTON:         The part of the statute that

 9   you are referring to is under 523, and it essentially

10   says that debtor shall file -- 521, excuse me -- shall

11   file certain schedules and that would include the income

12   and expense schedules, Schedule I and Schedule J.                   And

13   certainly the court has the ability, under that statute,

14   to extend the time or to excuse the performance of a

15   debtor in that regard.       So there's nothing incongruous

16   about that wording in the statute.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             What do you -- what do

18   you do with the contention that the court is bounded by

19   other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of

20   creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the

21   district court from resetting it?

22                MR. HAMILTON:         Certainly all of those time

23   frames can be moved, Justice Sotomayor.                 There is -

24   again, the actual timing of the confirmation hearing in

25   a Chapter 13 case may be fluid, although there are


                                        5

 1   certain time limits for the first meeting of creditors

 2   and for when the first -- when the confirmation hearing

 3   is held.    They can be extended, just as the confirmation

 4   hearing would be in a Chapter 12 or in a Chapter 11

 5   case.

 6                So the idea is the second part of 101(10A)

 7   allows the debtor to say:           Your Honor, my 6-month time

 8   frame immediately prior to the filing of the bankruptcy

 9   petition is not representative of my income; I would

10   like to have that time frame moved.                      And that time frame

11   would appear to be moveable up to the confirmation

12   hearing.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Moveable to where?          What

14   -- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the

15   statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2

16   extraordinary months.       So now she's going to say:

17   Court, please change the period.                 Change it to what?

18   Anything she wants?

19                MR. HAMILTON:          No, Your Honor.             That would

20   be up to the court.     It would be discretionary with the

21   court, as the language suggests in the second part of

22   101(10A).

23                JUSTICE ALITO:             But isn't it the case that

24   before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were

25   recognized as having discretion in calculating projected


                                         6

 1   disposable income to take into account changes in the

 2   debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and

 3   shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to

 4   continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress

 5   provided some clear indication that they wanted to

 6   depart from it?

 7                 MR. HAMILTON:         Certainly prior to the 2005

 8   amendments, your assessment is correct.                  The court had

 9   the discretion to be able to assess the debtor's

10   situation, use its discretion to determine what income

11   and expenses should be calculated in determining whether

12   or not a debtor was paying his or her best efforts under

13   1325(b)(1).

14                 Here, there is a clear formula.                And if you

15   read these -- there are three, three key statutes that

16   form a triangle in order to give me the conclusion that

17   I make and that I suggest to Your Honor.                  And that is,

18   we start with 1325(b)(1), which is the statute that

19   brings into play the disposable income and projected

20   disposable income requirements.                "Disposable income" is

21   now defined as "current monthly income."

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:            It is odd that Congress

23   provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they

24   would provide such a detailed formula and then say:                  But

25   the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a

 1   projection.

 2                  But still we have the word "projection" -

 3   "projected."     And your interpretation leads to very

 4   strange, really absurd results; isn't that true?                And

 5   you have to devise some really elaborate escape

 6   strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those

 7   very strange results.

 8                  MR. HAMILTON:         Respectfully, Justice Alito,

 9   I don't any agree with the assessment that -- of what

10   you just stated.     Essentially, this formula allows the

11   bankruptcy court to move that 6-month period of time,

12   not to ignore the formula.               The formula's there.

13                  The formula defines "current monthly

14   income."   From the current monthly income then is

15   subtracted reasonable and necessary expenses.               And

16   formerly, under the old law, the '78 code, those

17   reasonable and necessary expenses contained a few

18   specifics, but largely it was up to the court to

19   determine them.

20                  JUSTICE ALITO:            But you say that that can be

21   done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the

22   debtor is required to file; isn't that right?

23                  MR. HAMILTON:         In -- under 101(10A), the

24   second part, yes.     But I think there are -- there are

25   some other -- other avenues for the debtor that are

 1   statutory.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:              What do you do with the

 3   situation in which the change that is projected to occur

 4   and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that

 5   causes an increase in the debtor's income?                       Let's say

 6   the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the

 7   lookback period and then just before the filing of the

 8   plan gets a job with a good salary.                       You would say that

 9   the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the

10   debtor would be required to pay practically nothing.

11                MR. HAMILTON:           No, Your Honor, I would not

12   agree with that.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:              What is a creditor to do in

14   that situation?

15                MR. HAMILTON:           Well, there -- there are a

16   couple of avenues.      There is a new statutory provision

17   under 1325(a)(7) that says the plan must be filed in

18   good faith and -- I'm sorry, the petition must be filed

19   in good faith.     1325(a)(3) provides that the petition

20   must be filed in good faith.               So we still have the good

21   faith analysis that the debtor's actions may be

22   subjected to even after the plan is filed.                       And that

23   would be as trustee the avenue that I would approach is

24   that, even though the schedule formula may have been

25   complied with, that if there had been a drastic increase


                                          9

 1   in income post-petition, then that -- that should need

 2   to be accounted for.

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Counsel, why -- what

 4   commends going through all these machinations, all of

 5   these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results?

 6   Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the

 7   circumstances in which a court can deviate from the

 8   statutory formula?

 9                 I mean, it's not -- even before this change,

10   it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change

11   the projected income.        They have to have a clear ground

12   to do so.    Why is that inadequate to protect the

13   interests that Congress had in creating this new formula

14   for income and expenses?

15                 MR. HAMILTON:          My answer, Justice Sotomayor,

16   is that Congress provided the formula, and it's not up

17   to the courts, I suggest, to modify that formula.                   Part

18   of the -

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              There was a formula

20   before.    It was somewhat ambiguous, and that's what led

21   to the more defined terms for income and expense.                   But

22   that says nothing about changing the court's power to

23   act in a situation where the formula's clearly not going

24   to work.    That was the standard before.

25                 MR. HAMILTON:          Two points, Justice


                                         10

 1   Sotomayor.     One is that there was no formula before.

 2   There was some general guidance that was given in the

 3   statute.     It's much like the proposition of good faith.

 4   Good faith is almost incapable of definition, yet every

 5   circuit in the United States has a laundry list of

 6   factors that are taken into account for good faith.

 7                  Here, reasonable and necessary expenses

 8   under the old law had a few suggestions as to what

 9   needed to be involved with them.                  Now we have a portion

10   of another part of the triangle, which is under 707(b).

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But in a sense that cuts

12   against you.     As I was -- when I was reading your

13   opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if

14   you accept the Respondent's position Congress did

15   nothing at all.     Well, they did do something very

16   important.     They had a formula for disposable income.

17   The question is, does that formula apply to projected?

18   Can that formula be modified altered or projected for

19   projected?     So it's not as if Congress did nothing or

20   it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even

21   under the Respondent's view.              It accomplished something

22   very important.

23                  MR. HAMILTON:         My answer, Justice Kennedy,

24   is that the definition of the word, quote, "projected,"

25   end of quote, has -- there's never has been one in the


                                         11

 1   code.   That was a term that was in the 1978 code and is

 2   carried over into the present code.

 3                How it was applied is vastly different.                   The

 4   dispute under the prior law was over whether or not the

 5   court could take into account changes in circumstances

 6   which were likely to occur post-confirmation.                    And so we

 7   had cases like the Anderson v. Satterlee case out of the

 8   Ninth Circuit and the Midkiff case out of the Tenth

 9   Circuit that disagreed as to how that ought to be

10   applied.

11                In the Anderson v. Satterlee case the

12   Chapter 13 trustee requested that the debtor sign

13   essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess

14   income to the plan, and the Anderson court said:                    Wait a

15   minute; there is another statute at issue here and that

16   is 1329.   1329 allows for the modification of the plan

17   after the plan has been confirmed.                  Prior to the

18   confirmation of the plan, the debtor still has the

19   ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments

20   made by Justice Alito -- the debtor still has the

21   ability to amend the plan under 1323.

22                So all of these statutes need to be read

23   together to show what the result is.                    Now the question

24   is not whether or not changes should be taken into

 1   occur, but whether or not the court may deviate from the

 2   statute where Congress has said this is how we want you

 3   to determine current monthly income, therefore

 4   disposable income and consequently projected disposable

 5   income.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you already told us

 7   that there could be a deviation through this

 8   101(10A)(ii).   And why, if that was all that needed to

 9   be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say,

10   bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this

11   provision and we will get another period that doesn't

12   have those 2 months with the extraordinary income?

13                MR. HAMILTON:         No, Justice Ginsburg, and the

14   reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to

15   the debtor to move that 6-month period.                 Neither the

16   unsecured creditors nor the trustee have the ability to

17   request that that 6-month period be moved.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, it could have been

19   suggested to the debtor:         You can accomplish what you

20   want by using this provision.

21                MR. HAMILTON:         The record is silent as to

22   whether or not that occurred.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What -- where can you move

24   it?   I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry

25   as Justice Ginsburg.     What's the -- what has to be the

 1   ending date if you move the -- you can't move it any -

 2   much beyond the date of what, the hearing?

 3                  MR. HAMILTON:         It would be up to

 4   confirmation, but the confirmation hearing could be

 5   continued as the court saw fit.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The review of the

 7   determination or the request to move the period is -- is

 8   what?     Up to the total discretion of the -- of the

 9   judge?

10                  MR. HAMILTON:         It appears to be so under the

11   statute, Chief Justice Roberts.

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your objection to

13   the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect

14   to defining "projected disposable" -- you don't mind the

15   discretion on the other side.

16                  MR. HAMILTON:         No, Your Honor, I don't

17   believe the discretion is not in determining the income,

18   only in determining the time period.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right, but the only

20   purpose of moving the time period is to change the

21   income.

22                  MR. HAMILTON:         That's true.          And there are

23   other options that the debtor had available in addition

24   to that, that we have referred to as the four options,

25   which would be the debtor could have here just delayed

 1   filing the case for a couple of months and these

 2   problems would not have occurred.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           There is another discretion

 4   that you don't seem to object to.                 You say that one -

 5   one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put

 6   in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move

 7   for a revision of the confirmed plan.

 8                MR. HAMILTON:         Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           What constrains the judge

10   in allowing or not allowing the revision?                Doesn't he

11   have the same kind of discretion with regard to the

12   revision that you're objecting to with regard to his

13   establishing the payments?

14                MR. HAMILTON:         Justice Scalia, I don't think

15   so.   1329 has been subject to quite a bit of litigation,

16   but the argument that we make in our reply brief is that

17   it would be simply necessary to plug in and plug out

18   whatever the change in circumstance is.

19                So the debtor would be able to say, my

20   wife's income is now gone, so we want to take that out

21   of the formula.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that's the same thing

23   that's being argued here, that -- that you start with

24   the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and

25   then you have to show that there were some extraordinary


                                       15

 1   circumstances that justify a change.                    I don't see that

 2   there's any difference.

 3                MR. HAMILTON:         There may not be, except that

 4   there is a statutory requirement as to how that is

 5   accomplished and that's where the 101(10A)(ii) comes

 6   into play.   It's not so much that there is a problem

 7   with -

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           What your case comes down

 9   to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do

10   it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the

11   plan initially but by revising it.

12                MR. HAMILTON:         Not necessarily, Your Honor.

13   That certainly is one way.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Maybe?

15                MR. HAMILTON:         It may be, yes.           It depends

16   on the facts of the case.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's a good

18   answer, isn't it, because your point would be the

19   statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with

20   respect to projected disposable income, but it does in

21   the other areas.

22                MR. HAMILTON:         Well, again I respectfully

23   disagree, Chief Justice Roberts.                1329 -

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That was a friendly

25   question.

 1                  MR. HAMILTON:         I'm sorry?           I'm sorry, I

 2   didn't hear.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, my -- my point

 4   and what I thought your point would be is that the fact

 5   that there is exercise of discretion in two different

 6   areas is not the problem.            The problem is that in one

 7   area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the

 8   other area, projected disposable income, it's not.

 9                  MR. HAMILTON:         I agree.

10                  (Laughter. )

11                  JUSTICE ALITO:          But can the -- can the plan

12   be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based

13   on something that was known before the plan was

14   confirmed?

15                  MR. HAMILTON:         That depends on which

16   jurisdiction one would be in, Justice Alito.                     The most

17   current example -

18                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, if it can't, then how

19   is this modification remedy going to work?

20                  MR. HAMILTON:         I think it should be.           For

21   example, a good example of this would be debtor is

22   expected 2 years from now to no longer have to repay a

23   401(k) loan.     And so one view would be that you ought to

24   take that into account as of that date and figure those

25   calculations, which becomes extremely unwieldy.                     You are


                                         17

 1   guessing at that point.          The debtor may say:        Well, I

 2   may be losing that, but I don't know what my actual

 3   circumstances are going to be 2 years from now.                Chapter

 4   13 is a fluid process.

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Your argument is that the

 6   Court has to confirm a plan that is really not

 7   confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the

 8   payments under the plan, but then can turn around

 9   immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for

10   payments to be made.

11                  MR. HAMILTON:         No, Your Honor.      That is not

12   my argument.

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I thought that -

14   explain it, then?

15                  MR. HAMILTON:         Well, what we are saying is

16   that this plan cannot be confirmed as it stands because

17   the debtor would have to be able to make those payments

18   and the debtor obviously is not capable of making those

19   payments.   But it's because she chose the wrong options.

20   If she had chosen the -

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But let me just stop you

22   there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and

23   to Justice Scalia doesn't fit.                Chief -- you can not -

24   the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan

25   was she has to pay over $1,000 a month, because she


                                         18

 1   could never do that.    So you are not going to get that

 2   confirmed plan which could be amended later.

 3               MR. HAMILTON:         Well, I agreed with that.               I

 4   may have misunderstood the question that I was asked.

 5   But what I'm saying is that the statute needs to be

 6   followed and if the debtor had followed the statutes

 7   here then the debtor likely could have obtained a

 8   confirmed plan by moving that 6-month time frame.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, what in addition to

10   -- you brought up the 101 solution that she doesn't do

11   what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move

12   it if the judge agrees.       And you said she has other

13   options.

14               MR. HAMILTON:         Yes.       Well, the other options

15   -- and I referred to them as the four options and the

16   101(10A)(ii) is one of those options.                   As I said, she

17   could have delayed filing the case.                    There is nothing in

18   the schedules that would indicate that she was filing

19   this bankruptcy under exigent circumstances.                   There is

20   no foreclosure, there is no repossession, there's no

21   garnishment, there's no lawsuit.               So delay would have

22   been a possible, and a debtor is always able to

23   determine the date of the filing of the petition.

24               The second thing that she could have done is

25   file a Chapter 7, and this is the anomaly between


                                      19

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Chapter 13 and Chapter 7, is that she would have

 2   qualified in all likelihood for a discharge under

 3   Chapter 7 because she would have met the special

 4   circumstances test in 707(b).

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But then the creditors

 6   would have been a lot worse off, would they not have

 7   been?

 8               MR. HAMILTON:           That's very possible, but

 9   it's a formula that Congress thought to place into

10   effect and it's not -

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, why would -- why

12   would the trustee be urging the possibility that it

13   would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which

14   case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but

15   it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that

16   would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?

17               MR. HAMILTON:           Here, Justice Ginsburg, the

18   reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to

19   enforce the rule of law in order to have the courts

20   determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted.

21   By my view, it seemed like that had she followed the

22   rules maybe she would have gotten there, but the way she

23   did it she can't.    It's kind of like driving a car.               You

24   can't expect that a the car is going to perform well if

25   you don't turn the engine on.

 2                MR. HAMILTON:         And here she didn't turn the

 3   engine on.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can I come back to

 5   Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would

 6   ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan?

 7   Because as you say, the plan here would not have been

 8   confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always.               I

 9   mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because

10   the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the

11   payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is

12   clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the

13   preceding 6 months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to

14   have that -- that amount of money, there would be the

15   opportunity to adjust.

16                MR. HAMILTON:         Maybe not -- I'm sorry.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           In other words, is your

18   response to Justice Ginsburg "always," that it will

19   always be the case that where there would be an

20   adjustment under this theory, there would not have been

21   a confirmation in the first place?

22                MR. HAMILTON:         If the plan is not

23   confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which

24   are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to

25   recommend confirmation, and nor do I think any trustee


                                       21

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would.     Any events that are in the equation before the

 2   date of confirmation would likely be then subject to

 3   1327, the res judicata provisions of chapter 13.                     So if

 4   the plan is confirmed, say in Stephanie Lanning's case,

 5   with these facts known, then she would not be able to

 6   come in afterwards and ask for the court to modify under

 7   1329 because that's part of the confirmation order.

 8                 The other options that were available -- we

 9   discussed briefly the ability to file this as a Chapter

10   7.   She also could have converted this case to a Chapter

11   7 post-petition with the same result, or she could have

12   dismissed this case and refiled.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Isn't that -- wouldn't

14   that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to

15   dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time

16   period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out

17   those 2 months that are not representative of her

18   income?

19                 MR. HAMILTON:          Because, Justice Ginsburg,

20   the statute does not permit that.                   It's not within the

21   formula, and that's the question:                   Is the formula

22   binding or is it not binding?               If it is binding then

23   this -- obviously.      Congress intended a more rule-bound

24   statute.    It got that.       It was obvious that it intended

25   to reduce judicial discretion, and the statute seems to


                                         22

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   accomplish that.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the thing is -- but

 3   you have explained, your number one solution for her is

 4   this 101 route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in

 5   the court.

 6                MR. HAMILTON:         Only in moving the 6-month

 7   period, Justice Ginsburg.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.

 9                MR. HAMILTON:         That would be the only

10   discretion that the statute would appear to accord to

11   the court.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Where is that, by

13   the way, the provision that allows it to move the

14   6-month period?

15                MR. HAMILTON:         It's in 101(10A) and it

16   provides that the term "current monthly income" means

17   the average monthly income from all sources that the

18   debtor receives, or in a joint case the debtor and the

19   debtor's spouse receive, without regard to whether such

20   income is taxable income derived during the 6-month

21   period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i),

22   little (i) -- or (ii).       And those are -- that's the

23   disjuncture; it's the 6-month period prior or some other

24   time frame, and the language is important.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:          What do you say about cases


                                       23

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the

 2   problem?   For example, if the debtor had good income for

 3   many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before

 4   the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there

 5   is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another

 6   job?   Or it could be the converse, has very low income

 7   for a long period and then right before gets a job.          So

 8   you are not going to be able to cure those problems by

 9   moving the 6-month period.           What do you do then?

10               MR. HAMILTON:          Well, Justice Alito, I think

11   I would tie in 1323 with respect to the first

12   proposition, and that is if the debtor's circumstances

13   have markedly changed, then the debtor has the ability

14   to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask

15   the court to move that time frame forward to a

16   confirmation hearing that would take into account the

17   drop in income.

18               With respect to the second part of your

19   proposition, and that is an increase in income, then I

20   as Chapter 13 trustee would have the ability to object

21   to it on the basis of -- of good faith under either

22   1325(a)(3) or 1325(a)(7), either the plan or the filing

23   of the case itself.     And those -- the filing of the

24   1325(a)(3) was the primary way in which all of these

25   disputes were resolved before the 1984 amendments which

 1   brought in subsection (b) to 1325 which introduced the

 2   concept of disposable income.

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How do you file an

 4   amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when

 5   101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a

 6   schedule of current income?            If there's been a plan

 7   confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule

 8   had to have been filed.

 9                MR. HAMILTON:         Those are -

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You don't do one without

11   the other.

12                MR. HAMILTON:         Those are two different

13   propositions, Your Honor.          One is if the plan is

14   confirmed and one if it is not confirmed.               If it is not

15   confirmed, then you are correct; at some point the

16   trustee and the court are going to want to see a

17   Schedule I and J to see what the actual income and

18   expenses are.   If the plan has already been confirmed,

19   then the ability to change the plan has to be done under

20   1329, which is -

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Forget about 1329.   I'm

22   going to the situation where the plan has been proposed,

23   let's say.   The courts -- if a schedule of income has

24   been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change

25   the 6-month lookback period, correct?

 1               MR. HAMILTON:            I don't agree with the word

 2   "jurisdiction," Justice Sotomayor.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Well, it can't under

 4   101(10A).

 5               MR. HAMILTON:            The debtor would certainly

 6   have the ability to ask the court to be excused from

 7   that requirement given a change in circumstances.                   But

 8   again it would be the formula that would be honored,

 9   rather than the court substituting judicial discretion.

10               If there -

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Can I ask -- yes, there is

12   one more question.

13               MR. HAMILTON:            Okay.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Can I ask whether 1323,

15   which you have now invoked, does not provide the same

16   kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting

17   to?

18               What -- what standards are there for

19   granting or not granting modification of the plan?                   Is

20   it pretty much up to the judge?

21               MR. HAMILTON:            No.      I believe again the

22   court is bound, Justice Scalia, by the 101(10A) formula.

23   It's obvious that Congress intended the formula.                It

24   would not make much sense to read the statute to have

25   some other formula.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then -- then -- okay.

 2   You are between a rock and a hard place.                  Either 1323

 3   gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said,

 4   it's one way out, or it isn't.               Which is it?

 5                 MR. HAMILTON:         I haven't said that it gets

 6   me out of the formula.        It gets me out of the time frame

 7   issue, because certainly the statute doesn't take into

 8   specific account what happens if the debtor loses a job,

 9   say, post-petition?     Obviously -- example, husband loses

10   the job at Goodyear after the bankruptcy petition is

11   filed.    And I think 1323 is broad enough to allow an

12   amendment which would involve only moving the time

13   frame.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.        So any -- any

15   amendment has to relate to a period -

16                MR. HAMILTON:          I believe so, Justice Scalia.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- subsequent to the

18   filing.

19                 MR. HAMILTON:         If there are no other

20   questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my

21   time, Chief Justice Roberts.

24               ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

25                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 1               MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 2   it please the Court:

 3               The Court, I think, has the parties'

 4   arguments very well in hand.             I think the -- the one

 5   point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think

 6   the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue

 7   that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an

 8   anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the

 9   6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that

10   Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that

11   we would look at.

12               And the answer to that question is no, and I

13   want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions.

14   Everything is going to be in the cert petition.                I am

15   going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is

16   1325, which is the operative provision here.             And

17   1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor

18   objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's

19   only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is

20   the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control.

21               The plan has to provide that all of the

22   debtor's projected disposable income to be received in

23   the applicable commitment period beginning on the date

24   the first payment is due under the plan will be applied

25   to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.


                                        28

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               And the thing to note first about that

 2   provision is that it, too, sets a timetable.                  It's not

 3   just projected disposable income, but it's projected

 4   disposable income of a very particular type, to be

 5   received in the applicable commitment period.                  So unless

 6   there is something particularly strange about the

 7   definition of "disposable income," Congress specified a

 8   period that the income is going to be measured in, and

 9   that's over the course of the plan; the word "projected"

10   tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that

11   amount of money's going to be.

12               Now, my friend makes the point that

13   disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the

14   definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection

15   (2), 1325(b)(2).     For purposes of this subsection the

16   term "disposable income" means current monthly income

17   received by the debtor subject to some deductions and

18   then the expenses.      So then we have to go to the

19   definition of "current monthly income."                   Current monthly

20   income is in 101; it's at page 83.

21               That's where we get the 6-month period.                  And

22   it tells us that current monthly income is the average

23   monthly income from all sources, so it's very

24   encompassing, without regard to whether such income is

25   taxable income derived during the 6-month period.


                                         29

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  So, my friend's argument is that, well,

 2   Congress said 6 months.          The answer to that point is a

 3   couple fold.     First, as was suggested in the first

 4   half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific

 5   problem there.     Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what

 6   the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for

 7   determining someone's income.

 8                  Some courts would say, all right, you are a

 9   Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the

10   latest month.     Some courts said 6 months.                  We have a

11   court in our brief that said 4 years.                     So, we have to

12   have a starting point to project from.

13                  But the second point is that this term

14   "current monthly income" isn't principally a Chapter 13

15   term at all.     So, my friend's argument is that Congress

16   stuck this 6-month period into Chapter 13, so it would

17   be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says

18   we are throwing it out, we are giving the district

19   judges discretion.      It's not quite right.

20                  The place to look is in section 707, which

21   is two pages later.      707 is a Chapter 7 provision.                    And

22   my friend started out by saying the problem with our

23   position is that we were not following the Chapter 7

24   means test.     That's the key.           This term is really a -

25   borrowed from Chapter 7.           So 707(b)(2)(A)(i) is at the


                                         30

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   beginning of page 85 of the appendix.

 2                 And, so, we are in a Chapter 7 case here.

 3   And this is the means test.             It tells us that:      "In

 4   considering under paragraph 1," so we are trying to

 5   figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under

 6   Chapter 7 -- "whether the granting of relief would be an

 7   abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall

 8   presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly

 9   income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses

10   2, 3, and 4" -- those are expense clauses -- "and

11   multiplied by 60 is not less than" a certain amount.

12                 So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA

13   created this presumption of abuse in Chapter 7 and it

14   then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in

15   Chapter 13.    So that 6-month period has real force and

16   effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 7.                 So it's not

17   like Congress in Chapter 13 fixed the 6-month period,

18   which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull.

19   You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly.

20                 Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought

21   to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it.                 It indicates

22   Congress is concerned with the 6-month period.                 But it's

23   not like Congress added to Chapter 13 this 6-month

24   concept.   It added it to Chapter 7, where it's in full

25   force and effect.

 1               Can I make one other point about that

 2   language, just to repeat it again?                  That the courts

 3   are -

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you -- you have lost

 5   me.

 6                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Okay.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where is the 6-month -

 8               MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Sure.        It's back.    We have

 9   to go back two pages.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, I got -- I got it

11   there.

12                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Okay.        Sure.    I'm sorry.

13   The term is "current monthly income."                   So we are in

14   Chapter 7, so four lines down".               "The court shall

15   presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly

16   income" -- that's the 6 months, current monthly income.

17   That's the 6-month period of income.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I -- I -- I see.        I see.

19                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          See, that's mostly where it

20   matters.   Then Congress borrowed it in Chapter 13.                    But

21   it didn't get rid of, as was pointed out before, the

22   term -- "projected"; it didn't get rid of the period,

23   the commitment period.

24                But I do want to point out something very

25   particular about this language.               Here's the phrase:


                                       32

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "Current monthly income, reduced by the amounts

 2   determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4" -- those are

 3   expenses -- "and multiplied by 60."                       That's what my

 4   friend says the phrase "projected disposable income to

 5   be received over the applicable commitment period" is.

 6                  Our point is that if Congress intended that

 7   mechanical formulation, it would have used the exact

 8   words that I have just read from you in Chapter 7,

 9   because that's mechanical.

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Without the word

11   "projected"?

12                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I'm sorry?

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Without the word

14   "projected"?

15                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:          That's exactly.           They used

16   "multiplied."     And Congress did that several times in

17   BAPCPA and before BAPCPA.            When Congress wanted, look,

18   we are going to have a mathematical formula, it used a

19   mathematical formula.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why don't you follow

21   his suggestion and just move the 6-month period, because

22   the statute specifically grants that authority to the

23   judge?

24                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Sure.        Let me make a few

25   points about that, sir.          So I'll again read the language


                                         33

 1   again.   So we are on 83.         It says that -- little (ii) is

 2   going to be -- it's going to be "6 months ending on the

 3   date on which current income is determined by the court

 4   for purposes of this title if the debtor does not file

 5   the schedule of current income."

 6                 A couple OF points about that.

 7   Justice Alito, you were right, this is a one-way pro

 8   debtor ratchet, right.        The creditor and the trustee, if

 9   the debtor a month before confirmation gets a new job or

10   their expenses go down -- let's say you had a car, but

11   you know that the car payments are going to be done.

12   Under the trustee's view, then you still get to count

13   the car payments which are totally pretend, or if you

14   got a much higher paying job.

15                 In fact, in this case she did get a higher

16   paying job.    Towards the end of the period, she got a

17   raise.   And we say that has to be counted, too.                 We have

18   to have a debtor and creditor-neutral provision.                  In a

19   statute that's designed to make sure the debtor pays a

20   much as possible to her creditors, it's very strange to

21   put this entirely in the debtor's hands.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Can I ask you this.        There

23   seems to be at least a subtle difference between your

24   position and the government's position.                  You say that

25   the projected disposable income will be different from


                                        34

 1   the disposable income calculated during the lookback

 2   period when it is known or virtually certain that there

 3   will be differences in income or expenses.               And the

 4   government says that there is a difference when

 5   something is likely to occur in the future.

 6                Where do you -- where do you get from the

 7   statute your known or virtually certain differences?

 8                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          The contrast between 1325

 9   and 1329.   What I tried to do in my brief, and I have

10   laid it out at the beginning of the argument section.

11   That's where we try to articulate our rule.               What we

12   have done is we have looked at the cases.               As you

13   pointed out, this is pre-BAPCPA practice.               Courts have

14   set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of

15   certainty and the degree of deviation.

16                And courts have said -- I will give you an

17   example that will illustrate the difference perhaps.

18   You have times when someone expects to get a raise.

19   They don't know that they are going to get it, or they

20   expect to get a promotion.           And courts will say, even if

21   that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we

22   are not going to count it for purposes of 1325(b); come

23   back under 1329.

24                And we point out in our merits brief that in

25   fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement

 1   post-confirmation here, and under 1329 that money was

 2   applied.

 3                  So, Justice Scalia, there are

 4   post-confirmation events, but if you know ahead of

 5   time -- and this case is a perfect example, it -- we

 6   know she is not going to get another buyout from Payless

 7   Shoe Stores.     When it's known or virtually certain, we

 8   think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice Sotomayor's

 9   point about, you know, making it hard.

10                  Let me make one other point.               I wanted to

11   finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 101.

12   This provision has taken on greater significance in the

13   oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner.                    I

14   did want to point out to the Court a provision that is

15   not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court

16   were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and

17   that's 521(i).

18                  And 521(i) tells us that you do have to file

19   the forms at the beginning or you have to file them

20   within 45 days, but upon request of the debtor made

21   within 45 days after the date of filing the petition,

22   the court may allow the debtor an additional period of

23   not to exceed 45 days.         So it does seem to constrain the

24   power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all

25   around.

 1                So, I have made two points.                   One is it's a

 2   one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not

 3   unlimited.

 4                  The third is it just doesn't make any sense.

 5   Why would Congress design a system that would have all

 6   of these machinations.         If we agree that Congress

 7   wants -- it seems my friend and I agree that Congress

 8   believes that she shouldn't have to make the payments

 9   that would be required under the trustee's reading of

10   "projected disposable income."                The question is how we

11   get there.     The trustee's answer is that you are

12   required by the text; I'm sorry, Congress took this

13   option away.

14                  And I think that, as I have explained, the

15   term "projected disposable income to be received in the

16   applicable commitment period" really is not language

17   that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes

18   that -

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, I think -- I

20   think that's exactly right when you look at term

21   "projected disposable income."

22                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But if you look as

24   "disposable income" -

25                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Yes.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- as a defined term

 2   and then add "projected," I think it's a different -

 3   different -- different argument, different kettle of

 4   fish.    I mean, because particularly in a statute

 5   intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it.

 6   You look at it in the abstract, "projected disposable

 7   income," it doesn't achieve that objective.

 8                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          And that is exactly,

 9   Mr. Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of

10   "current monthly income in the 6-month period."                   I agree

11   that it is an important point.               It is their strongest

12   argument.

13                 My only point is that I have explained, I

14   think, why Congress put the 6-month period in for

15   purposes of Chapter 7 and also to have the starting

16   point.    If I -- to give you an example, take inflation.

17   If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise

18   in prices over the previous 6 months, if Congress did

19   that in a statute and then told us to look at projected

20   inflation, we would still not ignore things that will

21   tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an

22   oil price spike or an increase in health care costs.                   It

23   would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to

24   only look into the past and not look into the future,

25   particularly when the whole point of the statute is to


                                        38

 1   make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands

 2   that the debtor is able to pay.

 3                On the point of discretion, I should also

 4   say BAPCPA as a whole was intended to reduce discretion.

 5   And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our

 6   position is to turn to all of these other discretionary

 7   provisions -

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if you -- you

 9   wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a

10   definition of disposable income, and you wanted the

11   court to -- you don't want to say project that forward,

12   what -- what word would be more natural than saying

13   projected?

14                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I -- I -- I would use the

15   language that Congress did in 707.                  Remember, the

16   current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined

17   under clauses 2, 3, and 4 and multiplied by 60.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, that's altering

19   disposable income -- the definition of disposable

20   income.   I'm asking isn't the most natural word to

21   achieve your friend's result to use projected.                  What

22   other word would you say when you say this is the period

23   you look at and you want to take it forward?

24                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Multiply.          And Congress did

25   that a bunch of times.       Projected -- if we try to


                                       39

 1   project something, we try and make the -- and everybody

 2   agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual

 3   term.     It is:   You make your best estimate of the future

 4   based on the data you have now.                  My friend is right.

 5   One piece of data we have now is her previous 6 months'

 6   income.     Another piece of data is we know that she's not

 7   going to have the same income in the future.

 8                 If there are no further questions.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, Counsel.

11                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HARRINGTON

12      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13                       SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

14                 MS. HARRINGTON:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may

15   it please the Court:

16                 In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law,

17   Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing

18   case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring

19   that the statutory scheme is administrable.                     Now,

20   Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate

21   simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to

22   take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply

23   that number by the number of months in the plan in

24   assessing whether the plan is confirmable.                     But there

25   are several strong signals in the code that that is

 1   actually not what Congress intended courts to do.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:           But do you think bankruptcy

 3   courts are supposed to be economic forecasters?               For

 4   example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income

 5   during the 6-month period, the 6-month lookback period,

 6   should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say:               Well,

 7   it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over

 8   the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it

 9   by the amount of inflation; or:               This person works in a

10   particular industry where historically, over the last

11   five years or ten years, there's been a 3 percent

12   increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it

13   by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that?

14               MS. HARRINGTON:            Certainly not,

15   Justice Alito.   Bankruptcy -

16               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, why not?     You say that

17   the bankruptcy courts should take into account things

18   that are likely to occur in the future.

19               MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, bankruptcy courts -

20   we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever

21   speculate about what might happen in the future.               What

22   we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into

23   account what they know, in this case, already has

24   happened, but also what they know will happen.               And so

25   to give an example of a change that would benefit

 1   creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor

 2   has secured a higher-paying job just before or just

 3   after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to

 4   take into account the fact that her income going forward

 5   would be greater than would be reflected in the

 6   calculation of her current disposable income.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, "know will happen" is

 8   quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought

 9   your test was likely to happen.

10               MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, likely to happen

11   based on what you know now.            I think -- we haven't

12   suggested a particular burden of proof.                     I think -

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not -- not likely, based on

14   what you know.   Well, that's quite different from you

15   know it will happen.

16               MS. HARRINGTON:            Right.           So there is an

17   example mentioned earlier:           If the debtor is repaying a

18   loan to her 401(k) program, that is the type of loan

19   that can't be extended time-wise.                 And so she will keep

20   making those payments, which will be deducted as an

21   expense in the calculation of her current disposable

22   income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is

23   likely to stop making those payments.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is there a difference

25   between your test and the Respondent's test?

 1                MS. HARRINGTON:            Not according to what I

 2   heard Mr. Goldstein say at the argument.                    Again, we do

 3   not mean to suggest that a court should use -

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              His words were "known to

 5   a virtual certainty," which are -- likely to happen is

 6   different than likely to happen.

 7                MS. HARRINGTON:            I think, in part, it

 8   depends on what type of change you are talking about.

 9   Again, we would never say that a court should speculate

10   about what should happen.           But, for instance, to take

11   another example on the expense side, if a debtor when

12   she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation

13   home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured

14   debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from

15   her income in the calculation of her current disposable

16   income.    But if she proposes to surrender that property

17   as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that

18   debt payment going forward.             And so that's the type

19   of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward.

20   Under Petitioner's view, a court would not be able to

21   take into account the fact that that current expense -

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's -- that's "know will

23   happen."   That is "know will happen."                   But I don't know

24   how you can, at one and the same time, say:                    Courts

25   shall not speculate, and then say that the test is


                                        43

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   "likely to happen."

 2                MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, again, in this -

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, to -- you know, to

 4   look forward and say:      Is it likely or not likely?

 5   That's speculation.     I don't know a better definition of

 6   speculation, to tell you the truth.

 7                MS. HARRINGTON:           Okay.        But then, we

 8   wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of

 9   "likely."   And again, in this case the change had

10   already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what

11   her situation is now and what we can project it to be

12   going forward.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It seems to me that,

14   particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad -

15   well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting

16   of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking

17   into account a lot of things that are more properly

18   taken into account when it comes to whether the plan

19   should be confirmed or not.

20                MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, this is -

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What's going to

22   happen?   What's the situation going to be?                 What should,

23   you know, the creditors get?            What should the debtor

24   get?   There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into

25   the projected disposable income.

 1                 MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, except that if the

 2   creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of

 3   projected disposable income is one of the conditions of

 4   confirmability of the plan.             The court can't confirm it

 5   unless it can -

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, is that -- I

 7   mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and

 8   somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say:

 9   Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before

10   the filing.   So don't confirm it.                 We know she has got

11   all this -- all this other money.                  That -- it could do

12   it that way, couldn't it?

13                 MS. HARRINGTON:           I'm sorry, if she got a

14   higher-paying job just before?               Is that what you're

15   suggesting?

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, whatever the

17   situation is, can't that be taken into account when it

18   comes to confirmation?

19                 MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, it could affect the

20   -- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't

21   been brought up is under Section 1325(a)(6), the court

22   is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the

23   Court is actually required to think about what is going

24   to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be

25   able to repay her creditors.             And so it doesn't make

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to

 2   consider what it knows will happen in the future in

 3   determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if

 4   there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and

 5   1325(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from

 6   considering the same facts it knows about what is going

 7   to happen in the future -

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What if the debtor is a

 9   waiter and during the last month of the 6-month period,

10   because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips

11   have gone up either way up or way down?                  What's the

12   court supposed to do then?

13                 MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, I think one purpose

14   of having the 6-month lookback period in the calculation

15   of current income is exactly to take into account those

16   situations.    There are many people who are gainfully

17   employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates

18   over time.    And so requiring that courts use the 6-month

19   lookback period, I think, gives creditors a better sense

20   of whether the current income figure provided by the

21   debtor is accurate.     It reduces the chance for strategic

22   filing because it sort of takes some of the significance

23   away of the time of filing.

24                 And so it seems fairer in that case to

25   consider that 6-month average in a case where income


                                        46

 1   fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the

 2   -- what the debtor's current income is.                   And again, in

 3   many -- in a significant number of cases the calculation

 4   of a current disposable income will be a good prediction

 5   of what the debtor's disposable income will be going

 6   forward.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How do you deal with the

 8   Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes?                  One

 9   is that on the expense side, Congress provided for

10   special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the

11   income side?

12                  MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, the special

13   circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of

14   the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't

15   tell you what to do in terms of projecting that

16   disposable income.      And so you can adjust what you think

17   the current disposable income is based on an expense

18   that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an

19   expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is

20   accounted for in those expenses.                  But again, it doesn't

21   tell you what to do -- how to project that number going

22   forward.

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the argument

24   that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the

25   plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time


                                         47

 1   when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback.

 2   She could have waited.

 3               MS. HARRINGTON:           Well, that is certainly

 4   true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case.

 5   That is not an option available to all debtors, many of

 6   whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent

 7   foreclosure proceedings.        Delay is simply not an option.

 8               And if I could address Section

 9   101(10A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I

10   mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the

11   discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other

12   6-month lookback period.        They pick a date and go 6

13   months back from whatever that date is.                So if a change

14   occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it

15   makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to

16   change the lookback period because you would have to

17   wait 6 months, essentially, after the filing of the

18   petition to set it back.

19               But again, the biggest problem with using

20   that section as a workaround is that that is an option

21   that is available to debtors, but not to creditors.                If

22   a debtor files a Chapter 13 petition along with all the

23   Schedules that are required under Section 521 of the

24   code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me,

25   the creditor has no option and the trustee has no

 1   option -

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, the creditor

 3   has the option of objecting the confirmation of the

 4   plan.

 5               MS. HARRINGTON:           They can object to

 6   confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis?                    If

 7   the Petitioner argues that the calculation of projected

 8   disposable income is merely a mechanical multiplication

 9   of the current disposable income times 60 or 36, then

10   they have no way of allowing the court to take account

11   of a change that has happened just before or after the

12   time of the petition that would inure to the creditor's

13   benefit.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 They can't say:   I

15   object because the 6-month period is unrepresentative

16   because of this particular event?

17               MS. HARRINGTON:           They could say that, but

18   it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for

19   refusing to confirm a plan.           I think they would have to

20   make the argument that -

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Does the government

22   have a position on that?

23               MS. HARRINGTON:           I think unless there were

24   bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not

25   confirming a plan, and that was the -- the reason that


                                      49

 1   my friend on Petitioner's counsel suggested.                   But again,

 2   it's not clear how that would be bad faith, if a debtor

 3   proposes a plan that -- that commits all of her

 4   projected disposable income under the trustee's view of

 5   what that number is, it's hard to see how you could say

 6   that that was a plan that was proposed in bad faith.

 7                 So again, I just want to -- just to respond

 8   to the -- the argument that the government in

 9   Respondent's view reads the 6-month period totally out

10   of the code -

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You can finish the

12   sentence.

13                 MS. HARRINGTON:           Okay.        The calculation of

14   a -- a debtor's current disposable income will often be

15   a reliable predictor of her future disposable income and

16   when that's the case, then a reliable way of projecting

17   is simply be multiplying.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Ms.

19   Harrington.

20                 MS. HARRINGTON:           Thank you.

23                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAN HAMILTON

24                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 1                First of all, I want to note that the plan

 2   is not confirmed in this case; this was an interlocutory

 3   appeal.   There is an amended order at the BAP level that

 4   allows it as an interlocutory appeal.                   So the debtor

 5   still has preconfirmation options, rather than having to

 6   rely upon 1329 or something else in the record.

 7                Secondly I want to point out that 1325 as

 8   has been suggested by Justice Ginsburg only incorporates

 9   a part of 707(b), and the part it doesn't incorporate is

10   the special circumstances on the income side.                    It only

11   incorporates special circumstances on the expense side.

12   The significance of that is that what has been

13   substituted for special circumstances on the income side

14   is the 101(10A) formula minus certain expenses from

15   707(b).

16                The certain expenses from 707(b) are not a

17   wild card.   They are IRS standards in certain other

18   specially defined circumstances.                The idea that this

19   would allow a phantom car payment -- no, we don't think

20   so.   There is language in that section that says that

21   the expenses have to be applicable and actual.

22                And one case recently decided in the Ninth

23   Circuit, the Ransom case, says that.                    You have to look

24   at the language in 707(b) in order to determine the

25   propriety of the expenses, which has nothing to do with

 1   the applicability of the 6-month time frame.

 2               What the government and what the Respondent

 3   choose to do here is to basically gut the entire means

 4   test based upon one word, and that's "projected."                 And

 5   they choose to use an undefined term "projected" over

 6   the statutory language that Congress chose to determine

 7   what debtors should pay to their creditors, and it's a

 8   congressional choice.     And as many commentators have

 9   suggested, if there is a remedy here, it is a

10   congressional remedy and not a judicial remedy.

11               Thank you.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.
