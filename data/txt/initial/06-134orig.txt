 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   next in case 134 on our original docket, New Jersey v.

 5   Delaware.

 6                Mr. Farr.

 7                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

 8                        ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 9                MR. FARR:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Although the 1905 Compact between Delaware

12   and New Jersey did not settle the boundary dispute

13   between them, New Jersey nevertheless agreed to dismiss

14   the suit that it had filed before this Court to

15   determine the boundary.         And the reason for those two

16   seemingly contradictory facts, I think, is because the

17   Compact did resolve permanently certain issues of

18   jurisdiction, implementing rules that could be

19   administered without regard to where the boundary was.

20               Thus in particular Article VII, the

21   provision of the Compact that's particularly at issue in

22   this case, provided that each State could continue to

23   exercise its traditional riparian authority over the

24   riparian owners on its side of the river according to

25   its laws.   Now, the Special Master I think fundamentally


                                         3
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   changed the nature of the Compact by superimposing the

 2   boundary line into the terms of an agreement that was

 3   meant to operate without it.             And I think he did so

 4   because he mistakenly applied the presumption that all

 5   promises with respect to jurisdiction and territory must

 6   be unmistakable; and this Court, however, had said

 7   several years before, in Virginia versus Maryland, that

 8   that presumption simply is not applicable to compacts

 9   that are entered into when the boundaries between the

10   States are disputed.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Farr, one of the

12   striking things about this Compact is that to the extent

13   that it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail

14   about service arrests on the river and about fishing,

15   but then you get to these two articles at the end and

16   they certainly don't have that same definite detailed

17   quality.    As I read the Article VII that you're

18   stressing, it says -- let's see -- "may continue to

19   exercise."   So it seems to me that "may continue to" was

20   just whatever was the status quo, that will continue;

21   not to do anything dispositive, just whatever was will

22   continue.

23                MR. FARR:      Well, several things about that,

24   Justice Ginsburg.    First of all I think that the

25   language "continue to" necessarily brings in the


                                         4

 1   historical antecedents of regulation of riparian matters

 2   by both States.    It's undisputed in this case that on

 3   New Jersey's side of the river, that is with respect to

 4   riparian owners on the New Jersey side, New Jersey had

 5   exercised full and exclusive authority over, for

 6   example, wharfing out to navigable water, the building

 7   of piers and wharfs to do that, the granting of lands,

 8   without any involvement whatsoever by Delaware.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Was it clear that New

10   Jersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf

11   out, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to

12   New Jersey's environmental laws?

13                 MR. FARR:     No.      I think what --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The history doesn't show

15   anything about that?

16                 MR. FARR:     The history doesn't show

17   anything --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So if --

19                 MR. FARR:     -- specific about that kind of

20   law.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- if it -- if it would

22   have been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws,

23   had New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the

24   wharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to

25   me the wharf would be subject to Delaware's


                                         5
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   environmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the

 2   river.

 3               MR. FARR:     I think without the Compact that

 4   would be true, but I think what the Compact is saying is

 5   that you get to retain the degree of power on your own

 6   side of the river that you had before, without regard

 7   ultimately to where the boundary is determined to be.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:           So your -- your argument --

 9   it seems to me it's not that easy, because your argument

10   is assuming that by virtue of the "may continue"

11   language, the State of New Jersey acquires a new power,

12   and the new power in effect is to -- is to make grants

13   of subaqueous land that belonged not to New Jersey but

14   to Delaware, and that's the stretch.

15               It -- it seems to me that that is such an

16   extraordinary position or proposition, that you've got

17   to have something more specific than "may continue" in

18   order to construe that as meaning an agreement which was

19   intended to give New Jersey the power to grant away

20   Delaware land.

21               MR. FARR:     Well, Justice Souter, I think

22   that the difficulty with that question is it assumes

23   knowledge of where the boundary is.                    In other words,

24   when one talks about New Jersey getting a new power to

25   grant lands that are within Delaware, that is a -- that


                                       6
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is a question that necessarily assumes that the boundary

 2   has to be part of that understanding.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't --

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, I'm simply saying that

 5   your position --   and I accept your position -- that the

 6   Compact is intended to continue to operate whether or

 7   not the boundary is -- is ultimately determined, and if

 8   so, after it is ultimately determined -- and once we get

 9   to that point of continuing to operate after, then

10   necessarily the only way it can operate on your theory

11   is to give New Jersey the power to grant Delaware land.

12   And if New Jersey has that power, it must have been a

13   power that was intended in the 1905 Compact, and that

14   intent strikes me as a very extraordinary intent; and --

15   and my -- the point of my question was the application

16   of the Compact in the new circumstances, as you claim it

17   to be, would be so extraordinary that you ought to have

18   language more specific than "may continue" in order to

19   establish that extraordinary result.

20                MR. FARR:     Well, of course.              It is -- it is

21   saying "may continue to grant riparian rights and lands

22   under its laws."   So it is not simply the language "may

23   continue."

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, if you emphasize

25   "under its laws," then don't you lose?                  Because New

 1   Jersey does not -- I presume New Jersey does not have

 2   law, for example, in its constitution, providing that it

 3   can grant Delaware land.

 4                MR. FARR:     Well, I don't think that the laws

 5   have to refer specifically, obviously, to granting

 6   Delaware land.   It did have provision for granting laws

 7   beyond the low-water mark in New Jersey.                Many of the

 8   grants before 1905 specifically --

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But I'm going on the

10   assumption that it, in fact, had jurisdiction; that it

11   had land below -- beyond the low-water mark.

12               MR. FARR:      But what I think you're

13   suggesting, Justice Souter, I think, is what -- what

14   fundamentally alters the nature of the Compact is to

15   assume that New Jersey had certain powers up until the

16   time the boundary line was determined, and then it lost

17   those powers after the boundary line was --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:            It didn't so much lose -- I

19   mean it had a generalized recognition of power.               In

20   order to exercise that power, it had to possess certain

21   attributes, i.e., land.

22               Once it lost that land, it had nothing to

23   exercise the power over.         In fact, it had a little bit

24   left.   It had the distance between the high- and the

25   low-water marks, so it still had the power.               But the --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the recognition of the power in 1905 was, in effect, a

 2   formula; and the formula depends on facts to be applied;

 3   and the facts changed once the boundary was determined.

 4               MR. FARR:        You see, I think there are two

 5   problems with that, Justice Souter.

 6               First of all, the very notion that there

 7   would be something left if the boundary line was

 8   determined to be at the low-water mark on the New Jersey

 9   side -- in other words, that Article 7 would continue to

10   operate; it would just operate subject to the boundary

11   -- at least in the context of the riparian right that we

12   are talking about, the right to wharf out to navigable

13   water, that right is essentially meaningless if you stop

14   at the low-water mark.

15               In other words, what you're saying and what

16   the Special Master's recommendation essentially does, it

17   says New Jersey has no right to authorize wharfing out

18   to navigable water without Delaware's consent.

19               JUSTICE ALITO:            What right do you think --

20               MR. FARR:        I --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:            What right do you think New

22   Jersey has now with respect to the subaqueous land?           Is

23   it simply to authorize it to be disturbed to the extent

24   necessary to construct a wharf, or does it go any

25   further than that?

1                MR. FARR:      Basically, I think what you have

2    said, Justice Alito, is exactly right.                  It is --

3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I have a more basic

4    question.   Assume -- assuming that the subaqueous land

5    belongs to New Jersey and that New Jersey gives a

6    private individual a right to wharf out into the

7    Delaware, does that individual acquire ownership of the

8    land under the water, assuming New Jersey owns the

9    subaqueous land?

10               MR. FARR:      It depends on the form of the

11   grant, but, typically, if New Jersey --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But, normally, authority to

13   wharf out doesn't convey the land with it; does it?

14               MR. FARR:      It conveys an interest in the

15   land that allows the doing of the activity --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Of the wharf.

17               MR. FARR:      -- for which the --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Of the wharf.

19               MR. FARR:      That's correct.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now, if -- if merely

21   authority to wharf out would not even convey New

22   Jersey's own land, how can you argue that, by reason of

23   this Compact, it implicitly conveyed what is now

24   Delaware's land?

25               MR. FARR:      Well, because Delaware has


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    essentially said in Article VII, we believe, Justice

2    Scalia, that New Jersey may continue to do this.                   It was

3    doing -- I mean this land --

4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           May continue to wharf out,

5    but not continue to grant subaqueous land, which you say

6    doesn't go with wharfing out.

7                MR. FARR:     Well, what we are -- what we're

8    talking about, I think, is we're talking about granting

9    the interest in land that is necessary for the riparian

10   owner to be able to wharf out.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that if you have

12   one of these wharves that goes beyond the low-water mark

13   and there are two people at the end of it and one of

14   them shoots the other, would they be prosecuted for

15   murder in Delaware or New Jersey?

16               MR. FARR:     Well, in -- in -- there was a

17   gambling offense at the end of a pier in -- in -- that

18   proceeded from the New Jersey shoreline, in 19 -- in the

19   late 1950's in a case called the Federenco case, which I

20   don't have the cite for immediately.                   The New Jersey

21   Supreme Court held that that was within the jurisdiction

22   of New Jersey, and Delaware filed a --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I suspect the New

24   Jersey Supreme Court would.

25               MR. FARR:     Delaware filed a brief, Mr. Chief

1    Justice, supporting that position.

2                  So -- but if I could return just for a

3    second to Justice Souter's point and Justice Scalia's

4    point, if one thinks for a moment -- we're -- we're

5    trying to, I think, interpret the -- the 1905 Compact as

6    it must have been understood by the commissioners who

7    drafted it.

8                  And so I think that, unlike the Special

9    Master, who at the time he's interpreting it, knows

10   where the boundary line is, we have to think about,

11   first of all, would the commissioners essentially have

12   been saying to New Jersey, as your hypothesis would

13   suggest, that each State on its own side of the river

14   has the right to grant riparian rights and lands and

15   exercise riparian jurisdiction subject to the boundary

16   line, which for New Jersey would mean that, in fact, if

17   it lost the boundary case, it would effectively have no

18   riparian jurisdiction at all?

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Farr, what about the

20   article that follows Article VII?                 Article VIII says:

21   "Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial

22   limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State in or

23   over the Delaware River."           So that's a qualification at

24   least on every other article.

25                 MR. FARR:     Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I may


                                        12

1    say, the quote is longer than that and in a critically

2    important way.    It says it may not do that "except as

3    herein expressly set forth."

4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, and I don't see

5    anything expressly set forth in VII, which just says

6    "may continue to," which says the status quo is

7    maintained.

8                  MR. FARR:     Well, I mean, obviously, we're --

9    we're debating the meaning of Article VII, but it seems

10   to me that Article VII is an express provision herein,

11   meaning in the Compact.         So that what Article VII is

12   aiming at, it seems to me, if we are correct that it is

13   essentially meant to operate without respect to the

14   boundary, would expressly set forth a cession.

15                 And I might point out that when this case

16   was before this Court or the two States were before this

17   Court back in 1934, Delaware's counsel before this Court

18   said pretty much exactly what I'm saying this morning:

19   that -- and this is on page 44 of our blue brief, but

20   said that the Compact of 1905 in his view ceded to the

21   State of New Jersey all the right to control the

22   erection of those wharves, meaning wharves that were

23   constructed by New Jersey riparian owners past the

24   low-water mark, and to say who shall erect them.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, are you asking us to

1    reject the concept of concurrent jurisdiction in all

2    circumstances?

3                  MR. FARR:     As far as State jurisdiction

4    goes, it seems to me there is not concurrent

5    jurisdiction over riparian structures such as piers and

6    wharves and other kinds of acknowledged riparian rights.

7    With respect to matters that are nonriparian, for

8    example, if a riparian owner in New Jersey wanted to

9    construct a hotel that was beyond the low-water mark,

10   that would not be a riparian use.                 And Delaware --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How do we split that

12   difference?   I mean let's --

13                 MR. FARR:     Pardon me?

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I mean, how do we

15   decide the difference between those two cases?                  And

16   applicable here, for example, let's say it's perfectly

17   fine for New Jersey to build a wharf out there, but they

18   can't use it for liquified natural gas, which Delaware

19   may conclude poses particular problems that other uses

20   don't.

21                 MR. FARR:     But I think what you've done, Mr.

22   Chief Justice, if I may, is I think you've detached the

23   purpose of a wharf from the wharf itself.                  The purpose

24   of a wharf is the loading and unloading of goods.

25   That's what -- what they are used for.                   Vessels draw up,

1    tie up and unload or load goods and/or passengers.

2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Could New Jersey -- could

3    New Jersey prevent its use for liquified gas?

4                  MR. FARR:     Under State law, yes, it could,

5    Your Honor.

6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well -- but New Jersey had

7    given this riparian owner the right to wharf out.

8                  MR. FARR:     Well --

9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           So, obviously, the right to

10   wharf out does not include the right to use the wharf

11   for whatever you like, and the only thing we're arguing

12   about is whether it is New Jersey or Delaware that can

13   impose limitations.      But that it is subject to

14   limitation is, it seems to me, absolutely clear.

15                 MR. FARR:     I agree with that.           There's no

16   question that it is subject to limitation.                The question

17   is, whose laws apply?       Who -- and it seems to me that is

18   the question that Article VII expressly answered.

19   Article VII again says "each State on its own side of

20   the river" -- which is not a designation that is limited

21   by the boundary, because Delaware made that argument to

22   the Special Master, the Special Master rejected it, and

23   Delaware did not file exceptions in this Court.                So "on

24   its own side of the river" I think is properly taken to

25   mean with respect to the riparian owners on its bank of

1    the river.   Those riparian owners -- I mean, excuse me

2    -- "each State may continue on its own side of the river

3    to exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and

4    nature, make grants of riparian rights and land under

5    the respective laws of the States."

6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And in your view to what

7    extent does this involve subaqueous lands toward -- and

8    I'll just put "toward" -- the New Jersey side?

9                 MR. FARR:     Unfortunately, I'm not sure I

10   understand the phrase "toward the New Jersey side."                 I

11   mean, between the low-water mark --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure I understand

13   your position on where New Jersey's jurisdiction begins

14   and ends with reference to subaqueous lands.

15                MR. FARR:     Well, it's -- literal ownership

16   of the land begins at the high-water mark on the New

17   Jersey side and ends at the low-water mark on the New

18   Jersey side, its actual ownership.                 Under the Compact,

19   we believe Delaware has ceded to it the right to grant

20   certain interests in subaqueous land to the extent but

21   only to the extent that they are necessary to allow

22   owners in New Jersey, riparian owners, to exercise

23   riparian rights, provided that the New Jersey State law

24   grants them that right.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That suggests --

1                 MR. FARR:     If they were --

2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- it's still an

3    extraordinary power for one State to give up.               If

4    Delaware -- if that land -- they didn't settle the

5    boundary, but it might be on the Delaware side.               If

6    Delaware was giving up so much, what did it get in

7    exchange?

8                 MR. FARR:     Well, again, the question that

9    you're asking assumes that the negotiators were coming

10   into the negotiation with their boundary positions fixed

11   and that they were essentially horse-trading within the

12   bounds of the different positions taken by the two

13   States.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No, I'm not assuming

15   that.   I'm assuming it's unknown, but there is the

16   possibility that it's going to end up --

17               MR. FARR:      There's the possibility that --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- end up --

19               MR. FARR:      I'm sorry.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There's a possibility

21   that it will end up on the Delaware side.               And you're

22   suggesting that Delaware relinquished all of its

23   regulatory authority and gave it to New Jersey, no

24   matter where the boundary turned out to be.

25               MR. FARR:      That is what I'm suggesting with

1    respect to this narrow category of riparian rights.

2    Just as that's true, for example, in Article I.            New

3    Jersey has the right to serve criminal process with

4    respect, for example, to crimes that occur on the

5    eastern half of the river, which is something that New

6    Jersey clearly would not have had if it ultimately lost

7    the boundary dispute; whereas Delaware got, in Article

8    II, the authority to serve process for crimes occurring

9    on the western half of the river, which it would have

10   had anyway, whether it won or lost the boundary dispute,

11   assuming that the half of the river refers to the

12   channel.   So I mean -- let me --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's -- Article I --

14   that's an exception.      And you don't have the benefit of

15   that exception when you're talking about Article VII.

16               MR. FARR:      The exception --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The exception is not that

18   specific as to the -- as to the extent of the

19   jurisdiction.

20               MR. FARR:      Well, Justice Kennedy, I think

21   you've asked a very good question, but -- but I guess I

22   think it is -- it's quite specific, because the question

23   is, what do the terms "on its own side of the river"

24   mean?   Those obviously have some geographical impact

25   here, and indeed in -- before the Special Master,


                                       18
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    Delaware's position was yes, that is a geographical

2    designation, but what it means is "up to the boundary

3    line."    In other words, up to the low-water mark.               AS I

4    say, the Special Master rejected that position.

5    Delaware did not file exceptions from that position.                So

6    I think we can accept at this point in the case that's

7    not what "on its own side of the river" means.                    So

8    the question then is:        What does it mean?           And it seems

9    to me what it means is, with respect to the riparian

10   property owned by New Jersey citizens on the New Jersey

11   side of the river, Delaware citizens on the Delaware

12   side of the river.      And what it is therefore doing is

13   saying each State may control and determine the rights

14   of its citizens who own riparian property --

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Farr, is there --

16                MR. FARR:       -- regardless of where --

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Is there a limit on New

18   Jersey's rights?   As long as it's building a wharf, can

19   it do anything it wants to on that or is there -- for

20   example, could it dam up the navigable part of the river

21   in order to build a superstructure on the wharf?

22                MR. FARR:       Well, there are two questions

23   there, Justice Stevens, if I can separate them for a

24   moment.   As far as State law goes, purely State law, I

25   think the answer to that question is that New Jersey

1    determines what can and cannot be done --

2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, then I should --

3                 MR. FARR:     -- on a wharf.

4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           I should rephrase it.            To

5    what extent, if any, does Delaware place a limit on the

6    way in which New Jersey may exercise its riparian

7    rights?

8                 MR. FARR:     Under State -- by applying

9    Delaware State law, I think it cannot impose any limits.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Any limit whatsoever?

11                MR. FARR:     With respect to the exercise of

12   riparian rights.   Because once it --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Even if -- even if the

14   building of the wharf interfered with the navigation on

15   the river?

16                MR. FARR:     Well, this is, I think, why I was

17   trying to separate it into two parts.                   What I've left

18   out, the part I've left out so far, is Federal law.

19   Federal law has a significant amount to say about what

20   happens with respect to piers and wharves --

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, I'm just asking, is

22   it --

23                MR. FARR:     -- in any State.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- does Delaware law place

25   any limit on what New Jersey may do in exercising its

1    riparian rights?

2                   MR. FARR:     I mean, it does impose a limit,

3    but we don't think those limits are valid under Article

4    VII of the Compact.       I think the --

5                   JUSTICE STEVENS:           I mean, can they validly

6    impose a limit?

7                   MR. FARR:     No, no, they cannot.              They --

8    what this does is it says, for New Jersey riparian

9    owners, when they are building wharves and piers, they

10   are subject to the laws of New Jersey.                    "The respective

11   States" means that the laws of one State or the laws of

12   the other State, depending on which side of the river

13   you're on.   So they are subject to New Jersey law.                  Now,

14   obviously, any pier or wharf that interfered with

15   navigation interferes with the Federal navigational

16   servitude.   So that would be subject to review under

17   Federal law.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:             And what about the example

19   of using a -- setting a gambling casino or something at

20   the end of the wharf, well into Delaware territory?

21   You'd say Delaware has no right to object to that.

22                MR. FARR:       No, I would say it does have a

23   right there because that is not a --

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:             That's not a riparian use.

25                MR. FARR:       That's not a riparian use.             We're

1    talking about --

2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Anything involving loading

3    and unloading of ships and so forth would be

4    permissible?

5                MR. FARR:      Exactly.

6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Then how come your

7    position in my murder hypothetical was what it was?

8    Because I assume murder is not a riparian use either.

9    And yet, why would Delaware have jurisdiction over a

10   casino but not over a crime?

11               MR. FARR:      Because I think we're talking

12   about now what happens with respect -- I mean, if we're

13   talking -- this was a gambling -- it wasn't a casino.

14   This was a gambling offense that took place on a

15   facility that actually was used for the loading and

16   unloading of ships.     The gambling was an outside

17   activity not relating to the use of the wharf.                So I

18   think the understanding was that riparian jurisdiction

19   of every kind and nature would be sufficient to say,

20   once you have built the wharf and it is a legitimate

21   riparian purpose not subject to Delaware laws, then New

22   Jersey would apply its criminal laws as well.                And as I

23   say, Delaware filed an amicus brief -- unfortunately, we

24   don't have a copy of it in the record -- but the New

25   Jersey Supreme Court noted that Delaware supported New

1    Jersey's jurisdiction over that gambling offense.

2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Farr, could you tell me

3    -- one thing in Article VII perplexes me.                      Why does it

4    say that each State may "make grants, leases, and

5    conveyances of riparian lands and rights"?                      "Rights" I

6    can understand.    But why would they say "conveyances of

7    riparian lands"?

8                 MR. FARR:      I assume --

9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, obviously each

10   State can -- riparian lands are within each State.

11   Nobody questioned that at the time.

12               MR. FARR:       Well, I think the fact is that

13   this is why one needs to give some sort of practical --

14   take a practical view of what Article VII is talking

15   about.   Article VII -- the two riparian rights that are

16   of particular interest and were established clearly in

17   1905, obviously subject to the State limitations, were,

18   first of all, the right to draw water, the riparian

19   right that was at issue in Virginia v. Maryland, where

20   the Court said Maryland can't apply its police power, I

21   might point out.   The second was piers and wharves.

22   Obviously, a pier and a wharf that stops at the

23   low-water mark is of no use at all.                      It's got to get out

24   to the navigable water.         That's where the ships are.

25   It's the Willie Sutton principle.                 So once have you

1    that, if you're going to have riparian rights, you've

2    got to have the ability to grant some interest in lands

3    so that they can exercise their right out to the point

4    where it becomes meaningful.             And that's, it seems to

5    me, why --

6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you say "riparian lands"

7    means the land under the wharf?               That's a strange use of

8    "riparian lands."

9                 MR. FARR:      No, that's what -- I mean,

10   "riparian lands" could mean the lands on the bank, but I

11   think that's not what they're talking about in this

12   context.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you know of any other

14   instance where people talk of riparian lands and they

15   mean land extending under the water?

16                MR. FARR:      I think, because of the context

17   here, when it's linked with the rights, that the

18   necessary -- the limitation that Justice Alito mentioned

19   gives -- colors it essentially to say this is what we're

20   talking about.   And after all, this is similar --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's your position, that

22   "lands" means the lands under the water?

23                MR. FARR:      That's correct, because this is

24   settling -- 1 the point of it is to settle and avoid

25   future controversy with respect to the river, and those

1    are the lands that are under the river.

2                If I could reserve --

3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And there was in fact in

4    this project, was there not, there was required dredging

5    of 1.24 million cubic yards of submerged soil that would

6    be --

7                MR. FARR:       That's true.

8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- on the Delaware side

9    of the boundary?

10               MR. FARR:       That's true.                 Although I might

11   point out that, as the Weggle Declaration says in the

12   record -- and I can get a citation to that in a moment,

13   it's in our brief -- that actually is a relatively small

14   amount compared to much dredging that went on prior to

15   1905.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought this extended

17   out more than any prior exercise of riparian rights.

18               MR. FARR:       In the Delaware River, I believe

19   that is correct.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Yes.          This was going to

21   be 2,000 feet, and the greatest extension up until then

22   was between 500 and 600.

23               MR. FARR:       I'm not -- I think the second

24   figure may be short.       But nonetheless, I don't argue

25   with the premise.

4                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

5                    ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT

6                 MR. FREDERICK:           Thank you, Mr. Chief

7    Justice, and may it please the Court:

8                 Our position can be summarized in two words:

9    Boundaries matter.      Boundaries determine where States

10   can make grants of land, and they determine where a

11   State can exercise its police powers.                     And with respect

12   to both principle, the Special Master got it exactly

13   right.   Nothing in Article VII or elsewhere in the

14   Compact of 1905 precludes the State of New Jersey from

15   exercising its police powers within the boundary

16   determined by this Court in its 1934 boundary decision.

17   And, in fact, at 291 --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I just interrupt right

19   there, Mr. Frederick?        Do you contend that they may no

20   longer build wharves that go beyond the State line?

21                MR. FREDERICK:           No.      Our position is that --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, then boundries don't

23   matter completely.

24                MR. FREDERICK:           No, they can -- under

25   Delaware law, a riparian owner in New Jersey can extend

1    past the low-water mark as has been permitted by New

2    Jersey, by Delaware in every single instance since 1961

3    when Delaware enacted subaqueous land laws, except the

4    two times where New Jersey riparian owners sought to

5    violate Delaware's laws by building LNG facilities:                 In

6    1972 when the El Paso Company sought to build an LNG

7    facility and was denied by Delaware and New Jersey

8    acquiesced in that denial, and then in 2005 when

9    Delaware made the status determination that the Crown

10   Landing facility was a prohibited bulk transfer facility

11   precluded by Delaware law.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           What if Delaware took the

13   position that there simply is the maximum amount of

14   allowable building in the river, and from now on it will

15   not, in fact, agree to grant, authorize, whatever the

16   title is, any further wharves and piers on New Jersey's

17   side?   Does Delaware have the authority to do that?

18                MR. FREDERICK:         Delaware can exercise its

19   police authority as --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:           It's passed a statute.

21                MR. FREDERICK:         Yes.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Is the statute effective?

23                MR. FREDERICK:         The statute is not effected

24   in the hypothetical that you give.                 Nothing in Delaware

25   subaqueous land laws goes to clutter, visual or

1    otherwise, on the bank.

2                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm talking about a new

3    statute.     Delaware says enough is enough; no more wharfs

4    and piers from the New Jersey side.                       Is that statute

5    effective and enforceable?

6                  MR. FREDERICK:          That statute would be

7    subject to Delaware takings law, and Delaware has found

8    that --

9                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            But, Mr. Frederick, if

10   the -- if the legislature of Delaware passes that

11   statute, I assume they intend it to mean what it says.

12   And as against a claim by New Jersey or on behalf of a

13   New Jersey grantee, is that Delaware statute effective?

14                 MR. FREDERICK:          It depends.            Justice Souter,

15   it depends.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It depends on what?

17                 MR. FREDERICK:          The Constitution of the

18   United States and the constitution of Delaware.                      A

19   private --

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Forget the Federal right

21   now.   We're talking about construing a compact.                     So far

22   as this Compact is concerned, so far as the domestic

23   laws of the two states, New Jersey and Delaware, are

24   concerned, would the Delaware statute be effective?

25                 MR. FREDERICK:          The Delaware statute would

1    not be affected by the 1905 Compact, Justice Souter,

2    because Delaware would assert presumably, if defending

3    that law, that it was subject to regular police power

4    restrictions.    But those police power restrictions --

5                   JUSTICE SOUTER:           I'm not asking you what

6    Delaware would say.       I think I can imagine what Delaware

7    would say.     I want to know whether Delaware would

8    prevail when it got here --

9                   MR. FREDERICK:         No.

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:             -- in your view?

11                MR. FREDERICK:           I don't think that Delaware

12   would prevail on a blanket prohibition of the exercise

13   of riparian rights by New Jersey landowners.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Why?

15                MR. FREDERICK:           Because Delaware has always

16   permitted the exercise of riparian rights because --

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, that is before there

18   was all these wharves were out here, and Delaware is now

19   saying the facts have changed.

20                MR. FREDERICK:           Delaware certainly has the

21   power, under our theory of the case as recommended by

22   the Special Master, to implement its police powers.

23   Those police powers are always subject to constitutional

24   constraints.    And under the hypothetical you posed, as

25   extreme as it is, Justice Souter, the Constitution, both


                                         29
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    under Delaware law and under the United States

2    Constitution, might well say the State has gone too far

3    in exercising its police --

4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me you're

5    running away from the hypothetical.                    I have the question

6    that Justice Souter has, basically to what extent does

7    concurrent jurisdiction apply, what are the limits that

8    we will apply in later cases to implement this concept

9    of concurrent jurisdiction?           In the laws of some States

10   you can't overburden an easement.               If you give a power

11   company an easement, it can't put huge 300-foot

12   structures on the easement without taking -- is that the

13   kind of analysis that we have to apply in order to make

14   your concurrent jurisdiction and the Master's concurrent

15   jurisdiction theory work?

16               MR. FREDERICK:         I'm not sure that you would

17   need to go that far, certainly in light of the practical

18   realities of the 150 years of shared use of the Delaware

19   River, Justice Kennedy.

20               Importantly, under New Jersey's theory, to

21   go to your hypothetical, Justice Souter, where the

22   entire bed of the river within the Twelve-Mile Circle

23   would be built out, that would be a functional

24   abrogation of this Court's boundary decision, because

25   this Court held that the land under the piers was not


                                      30
                        Alderson Reporting Company

1    belonging to New Jersey and that an attempt to extend

2    the entire boundary outward, water-ward, would be

3    overriding what this Court determined was the --

4    easement.

5                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           But again, you're changing

6    the hypothetical.    Your answer, I -- the answer that you

7    just gave, I presume would be the same whether Delaware

8    had passed any particular statute regarding wharfage

9    from the New Jersey side or whether it had -- you were

10   giving an answer which took into consideration the

11   Compact but which basically depended upon we'll call it

12   the general riparian law.

13                 The question, however, is the effectiveness

14   of a Delaware statute directed specifically to this

15   issue that says "no more."

16                 MR. FREDERICK:         That becomes a dormant

17   Commerce Clause problem, Justice Souter.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           He is asking about under

19   this thing.   Forget about the Commerce Clause.            And it's

20   obvious what the purpose of the hypothetical is.             You're

21   saying that to give you the right to wharf out does not

22   mean that you can use the wharf for any purpose that's

23   contrary to the police power prescriptions of Delaware.

24   That is reasonable enough.

25                 Well, what if one of the police power


                                        31

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    prescriptions is you can't have a wharf?                Now, you know,

2    can you flatly contradict what Article VII says?               And I

3    really think you ought to give that one away.

4                (Laughter.)

5                MR. FREDERICK:          Justice Scalia, under a

6    broad theory of where the boundary is in matters, it

7    would require New Jersey to have access to grant

8    Delaware lands.   And under our theory as accepted by the

9    Special Master, that would not be permitted.               If it is

10   simply a question of use, we would acknowledge that the

11   New Jersey riparian owner can --

12               JUSTICE ALITO:          I think you're eliminating

13   the right to wharf out.        Before 1905, New Jersey was

14   allowing the construction of wharves, isn't that

15   correct?

16               MR. FREDERICK:          There were only two proven

17   in the record, Justice Alito, and neither of which was

18   proved in this record to go beyond the low-water mark.

19   But, yes, you're right.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It was a wharf that didn't

21   go beyond a low-water mark?

22               MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.       Parts of the Twelve

23   Mile Circle --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What did they do, jump onto

25   the land?

1                (Laughter.)

2                MR. FREDERICK:         No.      In parts of the Twelve

3    Mile Circle, Justice Scalia, particularly in Gloucester

4    County, there's marshy area where the low-water area

5    extends hundreds of feet into the river.                   And that is

6    where the boundary is -- is determined.                   And it was not

7    necessary in some places within the Twelve Mile Circle

8    to go beyond the low-water mark in order to build a

9    pier --

10               JUSTICE ALITO:         Isn't it true -- we can look

11   and see what was authorized or not before 1905.                   But

12   isn't it true that the ability to wharf out is a classic

13   American -- a classic riparian right --

14               MR. FREDERICK:         Certainly.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:         -- under U.S. law?

16               MR. FREDERICK:         Certainly.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:         And in deciding whether to

18   allow someone to wharf out, the State with jurisdiction

19   would decide whether the wharf was consistent with State

20   objectives, safety objectives, interference with

21   navigation and so forth?

22               MR. FREDERICK:         Yes, Justice Alito.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:         And Article VII says that

24   each State on its own side of the river may continue to

25   make conveyances of riparian rights.                   So why doesn't


                                      33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    that mean that each State is continued -- continues to

2    have the ability to authorize the wharfing out and to

3    decide whether particular wharves are consistent with

4    the State's police powers?

5                MR. FREDERICK:         The last part of your

6    question, Justice Alito, is where the rub lies, because

7    riparian law was subject to the individual determination

8    of what a riparian right was, and how the State's

9    regulation of that right as a private property right

10   would be determined.      What this Court's cases uniformly

11   hold is that the police power trumps that private

12   riparian right, and this was recognized by the attorney

13   general for New Jersey.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:         If you separate these two,

15   then the riparian right is worthless, is it not?

16               MR. FREDERICK:         I beg your pardon?

17               JUSTICE ALITO:         It's worthless if you

18   separate those two.

19               MR. FREDERICK:         No.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:         If you say, New Jersey can

21   authorize wharfing out, except Delaware can say you

22   can't wharf out, because it's inconsistent with our

23   police power, then -- then the authorization to allow

24   wharfing out is meaningless.

25               MR. FREDERICK:         No, because wharfing out is

1    always dependent on whether or not it is so far into the

2    river to impede the navigable channel, to become a

3    nuisance, and none of the cases by this Court talking

4    about wharfing rights concern the police powers issued

5    by the State.   Cummings v The City of Chicago held that

6    the Federal riparian right given to the wharf owner in

7    Chicago was not -- could not override a State's

8    determination of how the wharf could be built, that

9    police power.   Hudson v McCarter --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that assumes that

11   there is going to be a wharf.             You want us to say that

12   the police power means that there cannot be a wharf if

13   New Jersey says no.

14                MR. FREDERICK:         No.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that seems to me

16   inconsistent.   If Delaware says no.

17                MR. FREDERICK:         Justice --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That seems to me

19   inconsistent with saying that New Jersey has a right to

20   wharf out.

21                MR. FREDERICK:         We are not going that far,

22   Justice Kennedy.   What we are saying --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I don't know where -- what

24   -- where do you draw the line, what is your distinction?

25                MR. FREDERICK:         A wharf that impedes

1    navigation is a nuisance that is subject to classic

2    police power restrictions.          A wharf that does not have

3    any of those consequences is permitted and Delaware has

4    permitted those wharves.         In fact even recently when the

5    State of New Jersey petitioned to Delaware to obtain a

6    permit for the Fort Mott State Recreational Park,

7    Delaware granted that to them.

8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So a wharf that is just

9    ugly is okay.   Your answer to Justice Souter is,

10   Delaware can't say no more wharfs.

11                MR. FREDERICK:         Delaware cannot say no more

12   wharfs, but that doesn't answer the question that's

13   really at the rub of this case, which is what you do on

14   the wharf.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So we here decide --

16   under your view the case comes down to whether or not

17   use of the wharf for a liquified natural gas terminal is

18   a traditional riparian right.

19                MR. FREDERICK:         And all of the law and

20   evidence suggests that it is not.                In fact, the riparian

21   grants that New Jersey issued after its Wharf Act of 18

22   never contained a specification of use.                 They admitted

23   in the record --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So let's say

25   Delaware, it's not liquified natural, gas but it's, you

1    know, bulk shipments.       Is that a traditional riparian

2    right that Delaware could not prohibit or is it

3    something that it could prohibit?

4                  MR. FREDERICK:         Delaware has permitted that.

5    The Keystone facility allows for bulk shipments of coal

6    to be delivered and offloaded within the Twelve Mile

7    Circle.

8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Under your view a riparian

9    right exists only to say whether there should be a

10   wharf.    The -- the State with jurisdiction over the

11   riparian right has no interest in what's going to happen

12   on that wharf, or what the wharf is going to look like?

13                MR. FREDERICK:          They are distinctive rights.

14   It's like -- it's like zoning laws, Justice Kennedy.

15   You can own a piece of land but that does not mean that

16   you can override the police powers of the State by what

17   you do on land.

18                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what's the point you

19   just made that Delaware can't permit a coal wharf but it

20   cannot prohibit a liquified natural gas wharf?

21                MR. FREDERICK:          Delaware's Subaqueous Lands

22   Act makes that distinction.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:          No, but --

24                MR. FREDERICK:          As a matter of police power

25   --

1                  JUSTICE ALITO:         -- not what Delaware will do

2    or did do.    Can it, could it do that?

3                  MR. FREDERICK:         Delaware has to --

4                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Could Delaware prohibit a

5    coal wharf?

6                  MR. FREDERICK:         It -- yes.             It could.   That

7    if -- if it were deemed to be a proper exercise of its

8    police authority, yes, it could.

9                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, that's the question.

10                 MR. FREDERICK:         And the answer, Justice

11   Souter, is not decided by the facts on the case here but

12   rather on the individual circumstances.                      I appreciate

13   that there are hypotheticals that --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Then your answer to Justice

15   Alito is, tell me more about the circumstances and I

16   will then give you an answer.

17                 MR. FREDERICK:         Indeed.             Because there are

18   constitutional constraints.             There are dormant Commerce

19   Clause considerations.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No.      So what we want

21   to know it whether or not there are constraints in the

22   Compact.

23                 MR. FREDERICK:         The Compact does not contain

24   the constraints, the Attorney General of New Jersey

25   recognized it, and this is at the appendix starting at

1    905 of the Delaware appendix.              In 1867 in New Jersey,

2    Attorney General Robeson issued a very lengthy and

3    scholarly opinion on the difference between the powers

4    that a State could exercise over riparian rights, and he

5    distinguished in that opinion between what he called the

6    great public uses, which would be for defense, for the

7    environment, for protection of the people's safety, and

8    what were deemed to be public uses.                      Those who would be

9    using those riparian lands for a railway bridge or a

10   terminal that would be for commercial purposes.

11                 And he said that in the instance of the

12   great public uses, there would not be a need to pay

13   compensation because that great public right overrided

14   the riparian proprietor's exercise of riparian right.

15   With respect to the public use, however, and this is at

16   page 910 to 911 Delaware's appendix, he said that with

17   respect to those public uses, there might be a

18   requirement for a taking or a payment of compensation.

19                 And so Justice Souter, I appreciate that our

20   position has a frustration, in the sense that it does

21   require individual facts.           But I would submit to you

22   that in the 160 years in which the -- New Jersey

23   citizens have been wharfing into the Delaware River,

24   Delaware has permitted that in every single instance,

25   except two.   And there are both liquified natural gas

1    facilities.

2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It's rather recent that

3    Delaware has gotten into the business of regulating at

4    all.   I thought that for most of this period until the

5    '60s, Delaware just wasn't doing anything unless

6    something was a nuisance, and that didn't come up.

7                  MR. FREDERICK:         It is correct that Delaware

8    regulated by the common law, Justice Ginsburg, but as

9    the Special Master correctly found just because the

10   limitation under the FX judicial precedents is for

11   nuisances does not mean there is no regulation.             When

12   Delaware chose to override its common law riparian

13   jurisdiction by implementing statutes, New Jersey

14   acceded to them to the point that in its consideration

15   of coastal zone management laws in the 1970s, the

16   attorney general of New Jersey was specifically

17   consulted whether compliance with the Federal statute

18   and Delaware statutes was necessary.

19                 And in 1980 issued a coastal zone management

20   plan, New Jersey did -- that recognized that if there

21   was an LNG facility, the agreement of both states was

22   necessary.    The deponents in this case, every single one

23   of them from the New Jersey side, including persons who

24   had worked for the State for nearly 30 years, said that

25   the entire time they had worked for the State, if the

2    obtained from the State of Delaware.                    We would submit

3    that the constant --

4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                A permit -- a permit

5    for the project or a permit for the wharf?

6                 MR. FREDERICK:         If the wharf extended beyond

7    the boundary line, Mr. Chief Justice, a permit for the

8    wharf, and that permit --

9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, then what does

10   the 1905 Compact give New Jersey?

11                MR. FREDERICK:         It gives New Jersey the

12   right to say who shall be the riparian owners to

13   exercise their rights, what they can do, and up to the

14   point where there would be an encroachment of the police

15   power of the State, the permission to do that.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What case -- and I could

17   ask Mr. Farr the same question -- do I consult in order

18   to give content to the term riparian rights?                   Where can

19   I see what the substance of riparian rights is, in the

20   -- in the decisions of this Court or in other leading

21   decisions.

22                MR. FREDERICK:         The leading decision of this

23   Court, Justice Kennedy, is a case called Shively v

24   Bowlby, which was decided a few years before the 1905

25   Compact; and in that case this Court went through an

1    exhaustive determination to show what the riparian

2    rights were, State by State by State.                     The purpose there

3    was to determine whether or not an Oregon riparian land

4    owner had rights that were consistent under Oregon

5    common law with those granted in a deed by Congress, and

6    in order to do that the Court went through a very long

7    examination and analysis of riparian rights as they

8    existed in all --

9                JUSTICE SCALIA:             If I understand you

10   correctly, Mr. Frederick, you say that the -- that the

11   police power of Delaware, despite Article VII, includes

12   the power to require you to get a license before you can

13   wharf out from the New Jersey Shore?

14               MR. FREDERICK:           I'm saying yes, that under

15   Delaware's -- no, it's --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             In other words, Delaware

17   can say no you can't wharf out unless, you get a license

18   from us, despite Article VII.

19               MR. FREDERICK:           If it goes beyond the

20   boundary, that is the position New Jersey --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course it goes beyond

22   the boundary.   If it --

23               MR. FREDERICK:           They have --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             If the other side of the

1    allow anything to be done up to -- up to the low water

2    mark, but you're saying that despite Article VII

3    Delaware can say no, you cannot wharf out until you get

4    a license from us?

5                MR. FREDERICK:            Yes.       There are prohibited

6    uses, Justice Scalia.

7                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Oh --

8                MR. FREDERICK:            You have to get a license

9    under New Jersey law, too, and that's the whole point of

10   State officials by New Jersey saying compliance had to

11   be with both laws.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You've just read Article --

13   Article VII out of the Compact.

14               MR. FREDERICK:            No.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It gives nothing to New

16   Jersey.

17               MR. FREDERICK:            It protects the New Jersey

18   landowners who in the interregnum between the 1905

19   Compact and this Court's boundary determination would

20   have faced the uncertainty that their grants would be

21   deemed puerperous by Delaware.

22               What this Court said in its boundary

23   decision was that the mere use of those was recognized

24   by Delaware under the common law, was not deemed to be a

25   nuisance, but in this Court's decision in Coffee versus


                                         43

1    Groover, a grant made by a state that does not have

2    lawful title to the land would be deemed invalid.                     That

3    case, which was decided in the late 1880s, invalidated

4    grants that had been made by the State of Florida at a

5    time when the boundary was uncertain.                     And this Court

6    said that those grants were invalid in light of the

7    uncertain title that the State had when it made those

8    grants.

9                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Why wouldn't Delaware's

10   police power allow it to require the demolition of all

11   existing wharfs?

12                MR. FREDERICK:           Those would be deemed

13   takings, Justice Alito.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's fine.        They can do

15   it.

16                MR. FREDERICK:           But it can be acquired by

17   compensation, yes.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So long as it pays.

19                MR. FREDERICK:           Yes.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What's left under

21   your reading of Virginia v. Maryland?                     I understood that

22   case to say -- I mean it's the same thing, the Maryland

23   boundary goes to the low-water mark on the Virginia

24   shore.    Yet this Court held that that did not include

25   police power to prevent the particular riparian use at

1    issue there.

2                   MR. FREDERICK:         The decision in Virginia v.

3    Maryland is distinguishable in a number of ways, and if

4    I could take a moment to go through those ways.

5                   The first is that it involved a different

6    Compact with different language.                 The 1785 Compact

7    between Virginia and Maryland specifically provided that

8    each -- the citizens of each State shall have "full

9    property in the shores of the Potomac River."                   The court

10   construed the phrase "full property" to include riparian

11   rights.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Excuse me.       New Jersey does

13   not have full property in the shore of the Delaware?

14               MR. FREDERICK:            Yes.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, then that's no basis

16   for distinguishing.       What else is there?

17               MR. FREDERICK:            The Black-Jenkins award

18   issued to resolve the boundary line was decided in 1877.

19   And in that arbitration decision, Maryland specifically

20   represented that the boundary should be drawn around the

21   wharves that were on the Virginia side of the boundary

22   so that the boundary, instead of being at the low-water

23   mark, would carve out every pier that had been

24   constructed.

25               The arbitrators rejected that, but in the


                                         45

1    process provided that the riparian owners on the

2    Virginia side could go beyond the low-water mark -- that

3    is a direct quote -- "beyond the low-water mark to

4    exercise their riparian rights."               Congress --

5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's the case here

6    as well.   There's no doubt that New Jersey under the

7    Compact has the right to grant riparian rights,

8    including wharfing out, that go beyond the low-water

9    mark.

10               MR. FREDERICK:          The doubt here, Mr. Chief

11   Justice, is what the phrase "own side" means.                And we

12   think the better reading of own side is captured by the

13   grants part of the Special Master's recommendation is

14   that own side means the boundary.                But to the extent

15   that a right can be exercised, a riparian right

16   authorized by New Jersey beyond the low-water mark, it

17   is still subject to the police powers.

18               And at page 10 of the Special Master's

19   report in Virginia v. Maryland, the Special Master

20   specifically said this case does not concern the

21   exercise of the police powers, but rather the mere

22   withdrawal of the water.         There is no issue here as to

23   the types of general police powers that would apply to

24   the riparian right.

25               And finally, I would note that the Special

1    Master was the same.       He was uniquely positioned in this

2    case to assess the applicability of Virginia v. Maryland

3    because he had been the special master in that case,

4    too.

5                JUSTICE STEVENS:             I don't understand the

6    difference between withdrawing water as not being

7    subject to the police powers.              That could mean they

8    could drain the river, in effect.

9                MR. FREDERICK:           Well, what the court held

10   and what was decided in that case was that the taking of

11   the water by Virginia was not to the level where it

12   would give rise to the kind of police concern that

13   Maryland might express.         The court left that issue open.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't understand that.

15   It's up to Maryland what's a concern.                    If Maryland

16   doesn't want any water taken, why isn't that a valid

17   exercise of Maryland's police power?

18               MR. FREDERICK:           It would be a valid

19   exercise, but I was answering Mr. Chief Justice's

20   question about what is left of it.                  And the question,

21   what is left of it is that Virginia can continue to

22   withdraw water from the Potomac River.                    Whether there

23   should be a problem in the future about overwithdrawing

24   or an exercise --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  As I understand our

1    decision in Virginia v.         Maryland it's that withdrawing

2    of the water is a carve out of Maryland's police power

3    that would otherwise apply.

4                 MR. FREDERICK:          It would -- it would be a

5    limited carve out, that is correct.

6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.   Now why

7    isn't there a limited carve out on the New Jersey side

8    of similar riparian rights?             In other words, New Jersey

9    has the authority to authorize wharfing out and to that

10   extent, it's a carve out of Delaware's police power.

11               MR. FREDERICK:           It is a limited carve out to

12   the extent of permitting the wharfing out, Mr. Chief

13   Justice.   But that --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You don't even acknowledge

15   that.   You deny even that.          You have said that Delaware

16   can prevent the wharfing out and say you can't wharf out

17   unless you get a license from us.

18               MR. FREDERICK:           If it is a nuisance you

19   cannot get a license.       That is classic riparian law,

20   Mr. -- Justice --

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, I understood your

22   earlier answer to be exactly what Justice Scalia said.

23   Are you now saying that Delaware can prevent it only on

24   the grounds of preventing a nuisance?

25               MR. FREDERICK:           I'm saying yes.         That would

1    be a classic exercise of riparian --

2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I'm not saying whether that

3    would be a classic exercise.           Is that the only

4    circumstance in which it can be exercised, or

5    conversely, does Delaware have the authority to say no

6    simply because it says no?

7                I thought your answer the first time around

8    finally was the latter.       It can say no.           And I think

9    that's what my brother Scalia thought.

10               Now are you saying it can say no only if

11   there is a nuisance or some other specified reason?

12               MR. FREDERICK:         Let me try it this way.           As

13   a limitation of a riparian right, the State of Delaware

14   can limit the length of the wharf, whether the wharf

15   goes in ordinary circumstances, but as to a prohibition,

16   it cannot do so unless it is a nuisance as a matter of

17   riparian jurisdiction.      As a matter of police power --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I don't.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Wait.       He is not done.    As

20   a matter of police power, however, they can do anything?

21               MR. FREDERICK:         No.      The State can limit the

22   activities that can occur on the wharf.                And that is the

23   crucial distinction here.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:           And it can limit it, I

25   presume, subject to some reasonable rule of health and

1    safety?

2                MR. FREDERICK:           That's correct.

3                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.       It simply cannot say

4    as a matter of legislative view case no more wharfs?

5                MR. FREDERICK:           That's correct.

6                JUSTICE ALITO:           Who decides whether it's a

7    nuisance?   If Delaware says that docking a sailboat is a

8    nuisance, who decides that?             Does all of this have to be

9    decided by us in original cases?

10               (Laughter.)

11               MR. FREDERICK:           Typically the Corps of

12   Engineers determines that issue as a matter of

13   application of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors

14   Appropriations Act.      Section 10 of that act, Justice

15   Alito, the Corps of Engineers has the authority to

16   determine whether or not a docking or wharfing in a

17   navigable waterway of the United States would constitute

18   a nuisance to --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But you're not talking

20   about nuisance.    You're talking about Delaware's

21   environmental laws.      That's what this project concerns.

22               MR. FREDERICK:           That's correct.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And you were saying

24   Delaware's environmental laws trump whatever riparian

25   right New Jersey can grant?

1                 MR. FREDERICK:          The environmental laws would

2    apply to the project.       The position of Delaware is not

3    that BP can't build its wharf.               It's that it can't

4    engage in a prohibited use on that wharf.                  The wharf

5    itself is not a nuisance.           It does not violate any

6    normal standard of riparian use.

7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Could the State of New

8    Jersey allow the wharf to be built for some unspecified

9    purpose, just let it stick out there until it decides

10   what it wants to do with it?

11                MR. FREDERICK:          As I matter of both States'

12   laws, Justice Kennedy, that's not how either state does

13   it.   Both States now require as part of the

14   environmental --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm asking a hypothetical,

16   could it do that?    It would seem to me that would be a

17   very stupid riparian use, but could it do that?

18                MR. FREDERICK:          I think that, yes, it could

19   do that if its intent was to achieve access to the

20   navigable waterway.      But both states, both New Jersey,

21   outside the Twelve-Mile Circle, and Delaware apply

22   police powers now so that permits have to be required

23   when --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How does that work?

25   What if New Jersey says to the wharf owners you must

1    dredge around your wharf because we think it's -- you

2    know, silt is depositing, and Delaware says you may not

3    dredge around your wharf because we think it's going to

4    disturb the oysters?      Who -- how do you concur

5    jurisdiction work in that case?

6                 MR. FREDERICK:         That is an easy one, Mr.

7    Chief Justice, because New Jersey has conceded that it

8    does not have the authority to regulate dredging within

9    the Twelve Mile Circle.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it's something

11   they do have the authority to regulate.

12               MR. FREDERICK:          That's the point.         Riparian

13   jurisdiction is quite limited.              It concerns only certain

14   aspects of the riparian owner's access to the waterways,

15   and that limitation of that property right has been

16   recognized for centuries by this Court and others

17   courts.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You used the word

19   "riparian jurisdiction."         We have riparian rights.

20   That's a familiar term.        Riparian jurisdiction which is

21   used in Article VII is a novelty.

22               MR. FREDERICK:          That's correct, Justice

23   Ginsburg.   I'm using it in the term that the Special

24   Master did it, which is the State's jurisdiction to

25   govern the exercise of riparian rights.                 It is not a


                                       52

1    term of art.

2                Farnham's treatise, which is another source

3    of where riparian rights traditionally have been

4    recognized, did not use that phrase, and the parties

5    could not find any --

6                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Frederick, does the

7    riparian right include the right to dump refuse or

8    sewage into a river?

9                MR. FREDERICK:          It is a -- yes, it is a part

10   of the classic riparian right, intakes and discharges,

11   Justice Stevens.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            And even though that would

13   create a nuisance across the river, you could -- they

14   still would have -- who would trump?                    Who would prevail?

15               MR. FREDERICK:          The police power would

16   prevail on that, because what you dump is what -- is

17   where everything matters.          If the dumping is simply

18   water that doesn't have any ecological effects, that --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, I'm assuming something

20   that pollutes the river.

21               MR. FREDERICK:          That would be subject to the

22   environmental laws.     That's classic police power

23   recognized by this Court in Hudson v. McCarter.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

25   Mr. Frederick.

3                             ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

4                  MR. FARR:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5    May I just say two things, and, first of all, something

6    that we haven't really talked about this morning.

7                  With respect to matters of nuisance and all,

8    Federal law provides a substantial array of laws:               The

9    Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Coastal Zone

10   Management Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, all of those

11   things.

12                Anything built out from New Jersey has to

13   undergo Federal review; and, subject to the Compact,

14   Delaware has rights to participate at that Federal

15   level.    So what we are talking about here, and what the

16   bill of complaint deals with, is the question of whether

17   Delaware can do what it did here, which is apply its

18   State law enacted under its police power to say that a

19   proposed project, riparian project, for the New Jersey

20   side is impermissible and cannot be built.               So we are

21   dealing just with the law of State versus State.

22                Now -- so I'd like to suggest if -- if we

23   put ourselves in the shoes of the Commissioners who were

24   negotiating this Compact in 1905, what is the likely

25   reaction if Article VII -- if, now, Delaware had


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    proposed at the time that, instead of the language as it

2    is now, at the end of Article VII the words were added

3    "subject to the police power of the other State"?

4                 New Jersey obviously would have had the

5    reaction to that that that is something that depends on

6    the boundary.   There is no chance that New Jersey is

7    going to be able to exercise any police power on the

8    Delaware side, because there is no boundary dispute that

9    would involve that.

10               So this would essentially be a one-way veto

11   that Delaware would be trying to add to the contract to

12   say:   Could we -- we'll be able to override any riparian

13   structure under our police power.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's a one-way pass.     Why

15   shouldn't it be a one-way veto?

16               MR. FARR:      Well --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't give Delaware

18   anything.

19               MR. FARR:      Well, except for the fact that,

20   again, if we put ourselves in their shoes, it seems to

21   me what New Jersey would say is:               If you are proposing

22   that you can veto all of our riparian projects using

23   your police power because of your view of the boundary,

24   why are we dismissing the case that we just filed, or

25   filed in 1877 --

1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You are saying that the --

2                 MR. FARR:       --to determine the boundaries?

3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You are saying that the

4    concept of "riparian rights" displaces the police power,

5    to a large extent.

6                 MR. FARR:       To the extent that the exercise

7    of the police power is inconsistent with the power of

8    the State, the authority of the State, to authorize a

9    pier or wharf for the purposes for which piers and

10   wharves are used, which is the loading and unloading of

11   goods.

12                If that is what the State -- if that is what

13   New Jersey has done, that is not subject to an override

14   or a veto by Delaware exercising its police power.                     I

15   mean this was an important value at the time that the

16   Compact was enacted, and New Jersey would not have

17   lightly let Delaware veto it.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Mr. Farr, can I ask

19   you a question as purely a --

20                MR. FARR:       Of course.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  -- matter of

22   curiosity?   The parties talk about the Duke of York's

23   grant to William Penn in this case, but nobody ever

24   explains where Delaware came from.                   How did that --

25   where did Delaware -- I mean a grant to William Penn is

1    Pennsylvania.   Where -- when did Delaware --

2                MR. FARR:      Oh, there were -- I think there

3    were further grants along the process and further

4    division of -- of territory.            I think some of that is

5    actually explained in New Jersey v.                     Delaware, too.   I

6    may be leading you in the wrong direction, but I don't

7    think so.

9    is submitted.
