 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MR. ALLEN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                For well over a century this Court has

12   recognized the importance of the attorney-client

13   privilege.   In Hunt v. Blackburn in 1888, the Court

14   clearly states that the seal of secrecy upon

15   communications between client and attorney is founded

16   upon the necessity, in the interest of justice, that the

17   aid and advice of persons having knowledge and skill in

18   the practice of law provide that advice in a manner that

19   is safely and readily available and, importantly, free

20   from the consequences or apprehension of disclosure.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Allen, except for the

22   fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think

23   that the -- that confidentiality right is any more

24   important to the proper functioning of society than,

25   let's say, the protection of trade secrets?                 So that in


                                         3

 1   a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I

 2   produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and

 3   it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no,

 4   turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to

 5   interlocutory appeal in that case?                  And if not there,

 6   then why here?

 7                 MR. ALLEN:       Justice Scalia, there are --

 8   there are several answers to the question.                  Let me

 9   start, first, with the -- the issue of the importance of

10   -- of the attorney-client privilege as a key and central

11   element of the administration of justice that this Court

12   has recognized, not just with Hunt, but in a number of

13   cases since.

14                 But the question I think also goes more to

15   prong three of Cohen, which is the reviewability

16   standard.    In the context of attorney-client privileged

17   information, once that information is disclosed to your

18   adversary, it is disclosed to the last person on earth

19   you might want to see it.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The same thing with a trade

21   secret.     It is a suit between another company who is a

22   competitor of yours --

23                 MR. ALLEN:       Well --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And the Judge says, turn

25   over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and


                                         4

 1   you say no.    No interlocutory appeal, right?

 2                 MR. ALLEN:      I think with trade secrets --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Or do you say there should

 4   be an interlocutory appeal there?

 5                 MR. ALLEN:      Your Honor, we do not argue

 6   that -- here, that there should be an interlocutory

 7   appeal for trade secrets.          I think the practical

 8   resolution to the trade secret question is present in

 9   most cases of commercial litigation, where the court

10   would provide a protective order limiting access to the

11   trade secret; in other words, limiting access to

12   counsel.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But what if the court

14   doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited?                 The court here

15   could do the same thing, depending on the secret being

16   disclosed.    It could set up any number of protective

17   mechanisms.

18                 The issue is broader than that, which is:

19   Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more

20   important in the attorney-client privilege than in the

21   trade secret context?

22                 MR. ALLEN:      Yes, Justice Sotomayor.           But,

23   with regard to the attorney-client privilege, first on

24   the issue of the protective order, the protective order

25   cannot limit the adversary's counsel from seeing the

 1   information.

 2              As I said earlier, I think that's the last

 3   person in the world you would want to see.                     You could

 4   limit access to trade secrets to counsel, who could make

 5   no use of the Coca-Cola formula or -- or Colonel

 6   Sanders' chicken recipe, but -- but the --

 7              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Ah.         Are you sure?

 8              MR. ALLEN:         But -- but the answer to the --

 9   the importance question, I think, has to return to the

10   central and important role that the privilege plays in

11   the administration of justice.

12              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But isn't the role --

13   the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and

14   open communication between client and attorney?                    That's

15   the purpose of the rule, isn't it?

16              MR. ALLEN:         It -- it is the purpose of the

17   rule, at least in part, Your Honor.

18              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.        If that is

19   the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes

20   that purpose.   The minute you create an exception, you

21   are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and

22   open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage

23   is already done.

24              The further disclosure doesn't really serve

25   the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful

 1   way.     The fact that an erroneous decision on

 2   attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people

 3   from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they

 4   are staying within the rules.

 5                 MR. ALLEN:       Your Honor, I --          don't think we

 6   are here to suggest that it would stop people from

 7   talking to their lawyers.           I think the point is that the

 8   incremental erosion of the rule is going to lessen the

 9   value of the privilege.         At this --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well -- but that's what

11   I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that

12   erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made

13   routinely by the lower courts.

14                 Assuming, as I do, that there are some

15   erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily

16   the majority, why is there an incremental erosion

17   significant enough to overcome our interests in the

18   finality rule?

19                 MR. ALLEN:       Your Honor, I don't think we

20   suggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are

21   occurring routinely.       Certainly, we have suggested they

22   occurred in this case and that they happened in other

23   cases.

24                 But I think the more direct answer to your

25   question goes to the Court's holding in Upjohn.                One of


                                         7

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the things that Upjohn points out is that what is

 2   necessary -- and I think the Court makes a similar

 3   observation in Swidler & Berlin, that one of the things

 4   that's necessary for the privilege to have effect is

 5   predictability.

 6              If -- if there is no predictability, then

 7   you fall back to the apprehension or the worry of

 8   disclosure that is observed in Hunt.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Okay.      Let's talk about

10   predictability.    Once you make an exception for waiver,

11   there is already that limitation.                 It's not absolute.

12   Maybe it can be waived.

13              Secondly, you have to worry about a district

14   court finding it to have been waived, even though it

15   really wasn't.    That's another point of doubt.

16              And, thirdly, you have to worry about the

17   Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly

18   found it to have been waived because we give, you know,

19   weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district

20   court.

21              Once you -- once you factor in all of those

22   uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know,

23   about a fail-safe privilege at all.                     There are those

24   doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased

25   enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a

 1   mistake without -- without your being able to go up to

 2   the court of appeals on that mistake.

 3              MR. ALLEN:       Your Honor, I don't disagree

 4   that -- that the rule we search for will not still have

 5   problems with the protection of the attorney-client

 6   privilege, but I do disagree that it will not

 7   significantly improve the quality of the rules that

 8   counsel are -- are designed -- or counsel are -- are

 9   instructed to follow.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Allen, you used a

11   term before, and I think you were right in using it --

12   you said, "interlocutory review," but

13   Cohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the

14   theory is, it is a final judgment.               It's not

15   interlocutory.

16              And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b).

17   They can certify a question, if they think it's

18   sufficiently important and they need an answer, without

19   pretending that it's a final judgment in the case.

20              So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be

21   particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to

22   include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully

23   denied?

24              MR. ALLEN:       No, Justice Ginsburg.           I don't

25   believe that you do.    I used the term "interlocutory"


                                      9

 1   only to refer to the fact that the appeal would take

 2   place while the case-in-chief proceeds.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And that's what 1292(b)

 4   was meant to deal with.

 5                 MR. ALLEN:      I don't think 1292 would --

 6   would obtain, in this instance, and I think the -- the

 7   judge in the district court made this observation

 8   himself, although he did not expound on his reasoning.

 9                 It would appear that the reasoning would be

10   that this -- that a decision in this case is not likely

11   to materially advance the ultimate determination of the

12   litigation, so, therefore, I think 1292(b) would not be

13   applicable in the ordinary case to a -- to a ruling

14   finding waiver of the attorney-client privilege.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Why do you think that

16   your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more

17   important than any other privilege?                     I mean, Justice

18   Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you

19   can protect this the same as you can any other trade

20   secret -- any trade secret.

21                 Of course, you do disclose it to the

22   opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of

23   any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent,

24   psychiatrist and patient.          I take all of those are

25   privileged.    Do we allow collateral appeals there?

 1              MR. ALLEN:        No, Your Honor, you have not.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if we don't allow

 3   collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the

 4   priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or

 5   something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a

 6   psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we

 7   allow collateral appeal here?

 8              MR. ALLEN:        Your Honor, first of all, I

 9   don't think the issue of those other privileges has, to

10   the best of my knowledge, come before this Court.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:            But then if we grant your

12   collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally

13   grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably

14   makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?

15              MR. ALLEN:        I don't believe you do, Your

16   Honor, and let me say, first of all, the -- the instance

17   that Your Honor points to, where the information would

18   be disclosed to the other party, it's not the other

19   party in this instance, that --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:            It's the lawyer.

21              MR. ALLEN:        -- that you are worried about in

22   first instance.   It is, in fact, the counsel.           And --

23   and, second of all, I think the importance criteria

24   as -- as previously defined in this Court's cases, is a

25   measure of the importance of the interest that will be

 1   lost if appeal is not available now.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:           So it's -- in your opinion,

 3   it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to

 4   clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest

 5   or protect the wife or husband or protect the

 6   psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient?

 7              Now, that's hard for me to see why.                I mean,

 8   I think lawyers are very important, but it's a little

 9   hard to see why they are more important than these other

10   people.

11              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             What is the use --

12   I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off.

13              But what is the use by the adversary lawyer

14   that you are worried about?          That the lawyer is going to

15   used information against your client, correct?

16              MR. ALLEN:       Correct, Your Honor.

17              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So there is a remedy.

18   After final judgment, if the information was disclosed

19   erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it

20   back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so

21   make your case without it.

22              MR. ALLEN:       Your Honor, that -- I apologize.

23              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Why isn't that an

24   effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming

25   exists in the disclosure?

 1                 MR. ALLEN:      That is the analysis that the

 2   Eleventh Circuit applied, and I think it was incorrect

 3   for the following reasons:           First of all, it treats the

 4   attorney-client privilege as if it is a use privilege,

 5   as you describe it in your questioning.                 It is not a use

 6   privilege.    It's a right to be free from compelled

 7   disclosure.    So returning to -- to trial is not going to

 8   undisclose the information that's already --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            You have to a right to

10   choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be

11   represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we

12   don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed.

13                 MR. ALLEN:      That's --

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Why is this any greater

15   in terms of the harm that your client suffers?

16                 MR. ALLEN:      That is correct, Your Honor, but

17   in the attorney-client privilege cases, this Court did

18   not find that collateral order jurisdiction did not

19   obtain because of the fact that the attorney-client

20   privilege or the attorney-client -- excuse me --

21   disqualification cases were not important.                The Court's

22   ruling was premised upon the fact that that order was

23   sufficiently reviewable under prong three of Cohen.                 So

24   it's not -- the decisions were not based on Cohen --

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I understand what the

 1   court below did.   I'm just following up on your point

 2   about the importance of this privilege and why it's

 3   critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as

 4   opposed to the final judgment ruling.

 5              MR. ALLEN:         Justice Sotomayor, the -- the

 6   importance in this instance is -- is measured against

 7   the societal importance or the societal need for

 8   non-piecemeal application of the final judgment rule.

 9   So when you measure the attorney-client privilege and

10   the role that it plays in the administration of justice

11   in ensuring observance with laws against a rule of

12   efficiency, in this instance in our view, the

13   attorney-client privilege weighs heavier in that

14   consideration.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It's not -- it's not a

16   rule of efficiency.      It's a firm final judgment rule

17   that we have in the Federal system.                     And we are talking

18   about a narrow exception.          The exception was first

19   declared in Cohen v. Beneficial.                The question there was

20   security for costs, yes or no?              Does that -- that is a

21   pure question of law.       It doesn't depend on the variety

22   of factual circumstances.          Attorney-client is quite

23   different because it can often be fact-bound.                     It

24   depends upon this particular case.

25              Cohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind


                                       14

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of question that doesn't get you into the facts.

 2   Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound

 3   question, you are really eroding the final judgment

 4   rule.

 5                MR. ALLEN:        I understand your question,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.     I think in this instance, the facts

 7   that the Court would need to consider are sufficiently

 8   narrow that it should not trouble the final judgment

 9   rule and sufficiently collateral --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you are carving out

11   an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the

12   kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with.

13   Here's a rule that a State has.                You have to put up

14   security for costs before you go ahead with a class

15   action.   The answer to that is either yes or no, that it

16   either requires it or it doesn't require it.                      No facts

17   at all.   You just have a class action, you need security

18   for costs.

19                Maybe this particular case doesn't involve

20   many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges

21   cases, waiver cases that surely do.                      So we can't take

22   that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it

23   to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.

24                MR. ALLEN:        I agree, Justice Ginsburg that

25   that was the kind of narrow issue that was at issue


                                        15

 1   in -- in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial.               But this Court

 2   has considered much more factually intensive cases in

 3   the context of qualified immunity or maybe as a better

 4   example, the context of the double jeopardy claim such

 5   as in Abney.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Because those are cases

 7   that say your right is not to be tried, your right is

 8   not to be exposed to trial at all.

 9                MR. ALLEN:      That is correct, Your Honor.          My

10   only point is that the appellate courts are perfectly

11   capable and able to consider the facts that are at issue

12   in those cases, and it does not unduly burden the

13   appellate process in the context of those type of cases.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask two yes or no

15   questions?   One, did you, in fact, ask for a 1292(b)

16   right to appeal, make an interlocutory appeal?

17                MR. ALLEN:      No, Your Honor, we did not.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:           And the second question

19   is, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the

20   other way?   If they had denied access to the documents,

21   would the other -- would the person seeking discovery

22   have the same right to appeal that you asked for here?

23                MR. ALLEN:      No, Your Honor, the -- the party

24   losing the claim would not have the same right to

25   appeal.


                                      16

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why not?

 2              MR. ALLEN:       I think access to information in

 3   the course of discovery does not trigger the same

 4   important interest that orders compelling discovery of

 5   attorney-client would trigger?            So I don't think that

 6   they would in any way satisfy that test.               And I think,

 7   in fact, the question presented as designed even by

 8   Respondent does not capture orders that deny the

 9   disclosure of attorney-client privilege information.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Some time ago

11   Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this

12   different than the other privileges, and I would like

13   your answer to that.

14              MR. ALLEN:       Justice Breyer, I think that the

15   answer to that question has to focus on the role that

16   the privilege plays in the administration of justice,

17   and it's why I went, in response to Justice Sotomayor's

18   question, why I went to the balancing between the

19   interest of the attorney-client privilege versus the

20   interest of a more rigorous application of the final

21   judgment rule.

22              So -- so, while I think it is instructive to

23   compare the privilege to other privileges that the Court

24   may in the future confront, I think the proper analysis

25   is to balance that, that rigorous application of the


                                     17
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   final judgment rule, to the attorney-client privilege.

 2   And I think in that instance it resolves more quickly.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Allen, one of the

 4   purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of

 5   Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not

 6   going to come up very often, but attorney-client

 7   privilege, once you say that that's open to --

 8   everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to

 9   get that.     And if you -- and if we hold the way you want

10   us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she

11   thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or

12   that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to

13   take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal

14   of right.

15                 MR. ALLEN:       Justice Ginsburg, I don't

16   believe that the attorney would be obligated to take the

17   appeal.     And I believe that the -- that the facts that

18   we've laid out in our brief with regard to what has

19   actually occurred -- we wonder how many appeals might

20   take place.     We know how many appeals might take place,

21   because we have the experience in the Third and the

22   Ninth and the D.C. Circuits that tell us that in the

23   11 years since Ford was decided by Judge Becker in the

24   Third Circuit, the opinion by Judge Becker in the Third

25   Circuit, that there have been only 11 such cases brought


                                        18
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   up on appeal.   So, we have some experience to tell us

 2   what will actually happen.

 3              But I don't believe it requires that the

 4   attorney as a matter of obligation take that appeal.

 5   The Court, I believe, dealt with this same issue in the

 6   Behrens v. Pelletier case, which is a qualified immunity

 7   case, where the Court wondered whether or not there were

 8   going to be an increase, a significant increase in

 9   the -- the appeals that arose out of -- out of the

10   Court's holding.   And the Court observed that the only

11   conclusion that could be reached -- and I believe the

12   Court quoted in that opinion the opinion of Judge

13   Easterbrook in the Able case in the Seventh Circuit --

14   that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that

15   there was forebearance by the lawyers in taking appeals

16   that they otherwise had the opportunity to take.              I

17   think there is no reason to conclude that there would be

18   a difference in the analysis in -- in the case here.

19              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Are you -- just so I'm

20   clear about your position, are you arguing that all

21   issues related to attorney-client, whether they are

22   waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege,

23   et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable

24   because the public interest is the same in all cases

25   related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you

 1   wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?

 2                 MR. ALLEN:      Correct, Your Honor.             We have

 3   asked that the Court address, in this instance, the

 4   question presented having to do with only waiver cases.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So -- but your position

 6   logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it?

 7                 MR. ALLEN:      Your Honor --

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Otherwise, how do we

 9   distinguish or make a difference in your analysis?

10                 MR. ALLEN:      I think it's certainly -- it

11   certainly should be assumed that if this Court rules in

12   our favor, it must conclude that the attorney-client

13   privilege is important.        If it concludes that the --

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            No one is doubting its

15   importance.    The issue is whether or that importance

16   outweighs the finality rule.             That's a very different

17   thing for you.

18                 MR. ALLEN:      I -- I agree.             But -- but in

19   order to get to -- to the position we advocate, the

20   Court must pass that threshold and establish importance.

21   If the Court reaches that conclusion it is certainly

22   likely that the importance test in other existence-of-

23   privilege cases, for example, would obtain.

24                 I -- I don't think that compels the

25   conclusion that any case addressing privilege must


                                       20
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   therefore be permitted collateral order jurisdiction.

 2   For example, I believe you recited the crime fraud

 3   exception in your question.           Certainly crime fraud

 4   exception might present a difficulty with prong two of

 5   the Cohen analysis, which has to do with the

 6   separability of the issue on appeal for merit.           So it

 7   may well be that in crime fraud cases there is not

 8   sufficient separability of the issue from the merits and

 9   therefore collateral order jurisdiction would not

10   obtain.

11               As I mentioned earlier, I think we are in

12   agreement that orders that deny the disclosure of

13   information would not be immediately appealable.          So

14   there are -- there are a number of instances that this

15   Court might find in what I'll call general privilege

16   cases that might not obtain, and it's the course that

17   the Court has taken in other sort of general areas of

18   law.   For example, in the attorney disqualification

19   cases, the Court started off in Firestone finding that

20   orders denying disqualification did not satisfy

21   collateral order jurisdiction and it limited its

22   holdings to -- to that instance.

23               In Flanagan it took up the question of

24   whether or not collateral order jurisdiction obtained in

25   disqualification cases and criminal cases, and in


                                      21
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Richardson-Merrell in civil cases.                So the Court has

 2   traditionally taken, if you will, the facts of the case

 3   presented to them and limited its rulings to the facts

 4   of those cases.   We suggest that approach in this case.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is there any sensible

 6   line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and

 7   a holding that the privilege has been waived?                   I know in

 8   your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a

 9   distinction between waiver of the privilege and the

10   existence of the privilege.           I didn't follow it.

11               MR. ALLEN:       Other than the examples that I

12   --- that I just gave, Your Honor, I don't think there is

13   a principled difference between the finding of

14   importance, and that is -- that is clearly a threshold

15   issue.   As Court said in Will, it's the -- the -- what

16   the issues ultimately boil down to.

17               So with regard to that issue I -- I agree,

18   but with regard to crime fraud exception or instances

19   when no disclosure is ordered, another example that I

20   think the Respondent points to in their brief is

21   instances of inadvertent disclosure.                   Instances of

22   inadvertent disclosure would not trigger the -- the

23   prejudice element necessary because the -- if you will,

24   the cat is in fact already out of the bag at that point.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There is another.            You

 1   are stressing the importance of the attorney-client

 2   relationship, the work of the attorney.                    Do you extend

 3   your position to work product?             It's not privileged.

 4               MR. ALLEN:       No, Your Honor --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it's certainly --

 6   it's certainly protected against disclosure.

 7               MR. ALLEN:       We do not extend the -- the rule

 8   that we advocate to work product in the -- in the broad

 9   sense.   Certainly there are exceptions within Rule 26 to

10   when work product can in fact under the right

11   circumstances be disclosed.           So we are not embracing the

12   -- the work product as a general rule.                    Certainly the

13   mental impressions of client -- of counsel, which is the

14   important exclusion of the work product doctrine in Rule

15   26, we would embrace as a -- as an appropriate

16   limitation on the rule that we are advocating.

17               Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further

18   questions, may I reserve the remainder of my time?

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 1   appeal as of right for privilege or waiver, and most of

 2   the circuits continue that approach.                   That is the right

 3   approach because attorney-client privilege cases do not

 4   fit the parameters of the Cohen appealability and there

 5   are alternative responses that are available on the

 6   remedial side.   In terms of the Cohen factors, the

 7   factor of importance which has just been discussed here,

 8   this Court has over the 60 years of some 30 opinions

 9   refined the importance test and moved it away from the

10   questions of place, shape of litigation, dynamics of

11   litigation, to a very narrow set of cases in which a

12   government is typically a party or a government

13   official, and there is a very significant either

14   constitutional or statutory question principally of

15   immunity from suit.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will get to that,

17   I think, when the government lawyer gets up.                  But does

18   that distinction make sense to you?

19              MS. RESNIK:         I think the --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Government lawyers

21   get the privilege, private lawyers don't?

22              MS. RESNIK:         As I understand the

23   government's position here, it's that ordinary lawyers

24   don't get the privilege in ordinary litigation.                  The

25   government is here to speak to the question of State


                                      24

 1   secrets and particular kinds of particular official

 2   privileges, but not to the regular case.                And I think

 3   it's important that we understand from the presence of

 4   them that this is a rule that is appropriate for lawyers

 5   on all sides of the fence, because the immediate

 6   availability of appeal as a right stops in the tracks.

 7   The case was decided at the district court in October of

 8   2007 and, holding aside these proceedings, it was August

 9   of 2008 when the Eleventh Circuit rejected the mandamus

10   and the appeal.

11              So the wisdom of the final judgment rule is

12   precisely because the cost and delay, particularly in

13   the area of discovery and evidentiary privileges, is so

14   significant given that there are so many of these.                And

15   one of the important --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But we are talking

17   about the central privilege to the maintenance of the

18   adversary system which we've determined to be central to

19   maintaining the rule of law.            This is not like the other

20   privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary

21   privileges, because it is the privilege that allows

22   lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases.

23   And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single

24   ruling by a district court judge to undermine the

25   privilege is going to affect people.

 1              What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer

 2   could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you

 3   are saying the district court can require the disclosure

 4   of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the

 5   court of appeals to check it out.

 6              MS. RESNIK:       Well, there are remedies --

 7   there are two directions for an answer.               One is that in

 8   all the courts of appeal of the three circuits that have

 9   this rule, work product as well as attorney-client

10   privilege is available on appeal in the Third Circuit.

11   Trade secrets is available, although the Third Circuit

12   has raised questions given Will v. Hallock and

13   Cunningham about whether or not this remains a viable

14   position, but trade secrets is available.

15   Psychotherapists is appealable, spouse is appealable,

16   and nontestifying experts as well.               Which is the --

17              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That is in the Third

18   Circuit.

19              MS. RESNIK:       Well, the Third, the Ninth and

20   the D.C. together are the three that have opened up the

21   door, and they have found -- the experience of those

22   appellate judges has not found that it is easy to make

23   the distinction among these, and as a consequence there

24   is appeal as of right to this entire cluster of cases.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Allen has told us


                                     26
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I

 2   don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit.

 3               MS. RESNIK:       Well, I take to be -- the

 4   cheerful news is that by and large everyone is getting

 5   it right at the trial level.            But we are looking at the

 6   question -- first of all, one question would be how to

 7   count the cases of whether there's these other appeals

 8   as well.

 9               But more importantly, both the law professor

10   and judge amici in our brief asked to look at the

11   pipeline, and there are two levels of the pipeline, or

12   three.   One is that in the district courts we try to

13   look at the numbers of instances when trial judges write

14   opinions, magistrate and district judges, which is only

15   the tip of that iceberg.

16               As best we can tell, somewhere between 10

17   and 30 times a month in Westlaw reports one can find a

18   conclusion either upholding or denying disclosure.

19   Moreover it's sequential --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it matters

21   which they do, right?      If they are denying disclosure

22   the statistics don't mean much.

23               MS. RESNIK:       We found about half the cases,

24   and the law professors amici and judges amici found

25   about 104, in which in which disclosure was required, in


                                      27
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the six-month period.       So there is a significant number

 2   at the trial level that exists in terms of the pipeline.

 3   If we go just to the case that is before you, the

 4   Federal district judge reserved question on a second

 5   attorney-client privilege question because issuing a

 6   protective order on the deposition, there is a related

 7   case here and he precluded the lawyers from

 8   participating in it.

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:          I was on the Third Circuit

10   for eight years under this regime.                 And it didn't seem

11   to me that the sky was falling.             In fact I can't

12   remember any cases, any appeals involving this issue,

13   and we had lots of cases of a variety of kinds.                 So

14   maybe there's -- I don't want to be a witness in this,

15   but you know, convince me that the sky really will fall

16   if we were to adopt this.

17              MS. RESNIK:         I am not going to convince you

18   that the sky is going to fall, but I am going to suggest

19   that the Cohen rule does not apply to these cases not

20   only because the sky isn't going to fall.                 The empirical

21   question is there will be more cases for sure and there

22   will be more people with comparable privileges knocking

23   at the appellate doors, and they'll be sorting, so that

24   goes to the county.      Do we count the cases that knocked

25   and you said no to as well as the cases you said yes to.

 1                 The other case is that the Cohen rule

 2   requires a particular kind of importance and a

 3   particular kind of severability.                 In this case, the

 4   trial judge said, in fairness, there has been a waiver

 5   because you've injected new issues in the case.                 In

 6   order to get to the in fairness waiver injection, you

 7   have to know the facts of the case and weigh the waiver

 8   against the other facts in the case.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:          So the Eleventh Circuit was

10   wrong on that issue?       Didn't they hold that this was --

11   this was separate from the merits?

12                 MS. RESNIK:       In our view, every one of

13   the -- this case fails the test on all four -- three to

14   four of the Cohen prongs, which is separability and

15   conclusiveness or -- or distinct ideas, potentially,

16   importance, and remediability.               And therefore, the

17   embeddedness here is typical of cases, CrimeStar was an

18   example already mentioned, in which the factual

19   predicates are here.       In terms of coming back to the

20   piecemeals, in this case the trial judge reserved the

21   question.     The lawyers below have asked for a

22   pre-ruling.     The questions to be asked at the deposition

23   will not waive attorney-client privilege.                The trial

24   judge said, I don't know the answer to that, it hasn't

25   been fully breached and we don't know what you are going


                                        29

 1   to ask.     Therefore, in this very case, if the rule were

 2   that you could appeal as a right, you could be back in

 3   this case twice to the Eleventh Circuit during the

 4   pendency of the case.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Ms. Resnick, can you go

 6   back and articulate what you see as the rule that we

 7   have on what is important enough?                  Because that is what

 8   really is at question.         So how would you articulate a

 9   rule that would apply both to the cases in which we have

10   granted interlocutory appeal and to those that you are

11   advocating we don't.       Because it's not just freedom from

12   suits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy.                    We

13   have granted interlocutory appeal in other cases,

14   including in the Cohen case.

15                 MS. RESNIK:       Well, Cohen involved the major

16   question of the application of the Erie principle in

17   1949 involving a state -- the right of security for

18   expenses.    And I would take Cohen and the Vale case and

19   the drugging case of Sell as instances in which, is the

20   litigant, during the pendency of the case, going to be

21   economically secure or free, or drugged or not drugged,

22   as distinct qualities which are all framed in either

23   State law or Constitutional premises.                    If we look over

24   the course of the 60 years, the category is not neat.

25   But the turning point is in 1978 with the Coopers


                                        30
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   opinion which says death knell, which says strategic

 2   interactions, the shape of class actions, is not

 3   available for appeal as a right.

 4                 In 1994, one might have thought of the

 5   digital case that a contract not to continue by -- just

 6   settle would have been within the set, but the Court

 7   said, no, that kind of private contractual interest is

 8   not sufficient.

 9                 And in 2006, in the Will case, the court

10   narrowed it again by saying the res judicata sequence is

11   insufficient.    So in the last decade the Cohen cases

12   have come down to basically qualified immunity or

13   Constitutionally-freighted -- structural or almost

14   abstract, not interpersonal dynamics of the litigation,

15   including contractual relationships or evidentiary

16   privileges.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But are you suggesting

18   that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way

19   today if the question of security for costs, whether

20   State or Federal, hadn't been settled?

21                 MS. RESNIK:      Well, Cohen predates this --

22   the Congress's creation of 1292(b), which you mentioned

23   earlier, Justice Ginsburg.           And so what it is looking at

24   is, when Cohen was initially decided it opened a window,

25   but in the relationship between Court and Congress, the


                                       31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   judicial conference went to the Congress and said, We

 2   need a broader window, and Congress adopted verbatim in

 3   1958 the 1292(b) criteria which, clearly, Cohen would

 4   have been eligible for or potentially eligible for, and

 5   there are attorney-client privilege cases that do go off

 6   under 1292(b).

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But it is a bit of a

 8   hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the

 9   materially advanced -- the litigation and those other

10   criteria?

11                 MS. RESNIK:       There are a few selective

12   waiver cases.     There are a few of these that come up,

13   but you are completely right that it is a hurdle but we

14   have alternatives here as well.                As the example of the

15   -- once the Federal Court Study Committee suggested we

16   needed more appeal rights after the Coopers case,

17   Congress responded by authorizing the Court through its

18   rulemaking to provide interlocutory orders as final, and

19   23(f) is the next example, which also provides the

20   mechanism.

21                 The basic point is that there are other

22   routes.     The remedial prong of Cohen is amply responded

23   to here, because first, internal to the case, there

24   could be protective orders and limited disclosure.

25   Second, you can take the issue and stipulate it against


                                        32

 1   you.   Third, you could actually, if you ever did go to

 2   trial, not testify.      That's the Jackie B. Redman

 3   scenario.   Fourth, you have the after-a-fact appeal.

 4   Fifth, mandamus is available, and there are circuit

 5   courts.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that is only in

 7   egregious cases.

 8               MS. RESNIK:        In the extraordinary case there

 9   is mandamus.   There is also certification, and all of

10   these are routes that are filtered.                     Cohen opens the

11   door completely.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:           Are you -- are you arguing

13   that the collateral order door is closed now?                     That --

14   that nobody else is going to get through that door?

15               MS. RESNIK:        I can't forecast future cases,

16   except to say that this Court has repeatedly in the last

17   decade narrowed the door substantially.                     And I take it

18   it has come in relationship to the door opening through

19   the other mechanisms, Congressional carve-ups like the

20   Classified Informations Procedure Act, the Congressional

21   carve-up in Catha, and each of those isn't a wide-open

22   door, but either discretionary or timeframed or limited.

23   And of course, that goes to the problem that an

24   interlocutory appeal really is interlocutory and stops

25   everything, whereas the 23(f) rule says after the court


                                       33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   order, there's nothing stayed at the district court

 2   level.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:            An interlocutory appeal

 4   doesn't have to stop everything, does it?

 5              MS. RESNIK:         The -- as a rule of filing a

 6   notice of appeal with a court of appeal at the -- a

 7   statutory rule provision puts the -- stays the district

 8   court activity.    That's why 23(f) moderates that rule,

 9   as I understand it.

10              Further, I wanted to come back to the

11   question here in terms of importance.                   Rule 501 and 502

12   of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Number 502 has just

13   been reworked.    501 remains that in some of these the

14   existence of the privilege will arise -- will be a

15   question of state law.        I know of no one of the Erie

16   cases in which the interlocutory appellate question

17   turns on the question of state law as a predicate, and

18   the D.C. Circuit rule is that it's when there's an

19   adverse privilege ruling that you get appeal as a right.

20   It's -- that's the D.C. circuit's rule for -- and

21   indeed, it had several of these, not very many, but a

22   few of these cases.

23              So then 502 has just come with the workings

24   of the judicial conference and the Congress together,

25   and the lawyers, to shape a rule that is very protective


                                       34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of inadvertent waiver, protective about its sequential

 2   impacts as well, and articulating and Federalizing that

 3   area of law, as well as providing under 502(a) for -- if

 4   you waive in the course of a Federal proceeding, 502

 5   organizes the way a district court should think about

 6   it.

 7              If there were appeal as a right of waiver

 8   right now, after this case, then all those 502 cases

 9   could come directly, whereas instead a few might get

10   here or not by 1292(b).       And again, if it looked like

11   there needed to be a wholesale reworking because of the

12   vulnerability of the system, then the Court and

13   committee working with the lawyers can draft together

14   some revision.   But the --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The usual way that

16   the district court, after denying the recognition of the

17   privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the

18   lawyer to go to jail.      They say, You've got contempt,

19   you can appeal contempt.        The district judges, as you've

20   mentioned, they want these things to move on and they

21   tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and

22   the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely

23   difficult choice, of violating what they think is their

24   ethical obligation or going to jail.

25              MS. RESNIK:        Well, it is the case that Judge


                                      35

 1   Wilkinson recently reiterated Judge Friendly's

 2   suggestion that -- or commentary that contempt is a

 3   provision that is available.            And it is a route.    But

 4   we've found --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And how -- how is it --

 6   unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal

 7   contempt.   It wouldn't be civil contempt.             The judge

 8   says, I'm not going to hold you, and --

 9               MS. RESNIK:       What -- we have found that many

10   courts of appeals have responded, precisely because of

11   either the draconian nature of criminal contempt or the

12   possibility that it won't issue, by looking at some of

13   these cases, in the extraordinary instance, through

14   mandamus and there are at least a dozen mandamus --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But mandamus is supposed

16   -- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment

17   rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available,

18   then mandamus would not lie, right?

19               MS. RESNIK:       That is directly -- that is

20   exactly correct, yes.      It is that the appeal of these

21   unappealing groups is because the final judgment rule

22   says even if there is an error and even if it's a very

23   important error, absent this very narrow category of

24   cases that are final through our gloss on Cohen, the

25   basic plan is you wait till the end.

 1                In this instance, this district judge, in

 2   the related case, certified under 1292(b), the RICO

 3   question that came back -- came up to this Court, it

 4   also had a 23(f) appeal in this case.

 5                So this is actually a textbook case, if you

 6   will, of watching both the pros and cons of

 7   interlocutory appellate review, and, in this instance,

 8   what we see is that the district court, here, said this

 9   is too run-of-the-mill for 1292(b).

10                However, if you want, cooperating with the

11   lawyers, I will -- I will put everything in abeyance, if

12   you want to seek mandamus.          And so the district judge

13   was attentive to the lawyers' concerns, moreover because

14   the district judge has put a protective order on related

15   materials.

16                We have an example of a district judge, who

17   is very aware of the parameters of the litigation, and

18   that goes to remedies.       We dont' know --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, a protective

20   order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't

21   going to work at all.      You're not going to -- I mean,

22   the lawyers on the other side get the privileged

23   material, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the

24   viability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't

25   matter if the clients get it.

 1                MS. RESNIK:        In -- the -- underlying the

 2   privilege is the workings of the system for both private

 3   ordering and for the justice system.                     The rare instances

 4   in which a trial judge affirmatively makes a finding of

 5   waiver through conduct, in this instance or in some

 6   other way, are going to not undermine the privilege in

 7   its initial formation, and the final judgment rule has

 8   said, repeatedly, We could get it wrong on class action

 9   certification.    We could get it wrong on attorney

10   disqualification.

11                Nevertheless, the costs of the final

12   judgment rule are so substantial --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but the -- you

14   know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the

15   exact opposite.     It will say that the opening up of the

16   privilege and the disclosure, however rare the case is,

17   will, in fact, undermine the -- the value of the

18   privilege.

19                MS. RESNIK:        I appreciate -- and before you

20   on amici, on both sides, are people deeply committed to

21   the administration of justice.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Oh, sure, the other

23   people are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief

24   of the American Bar Association and view that as a

25   representation of how the people affected here, the

 1   lawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will

 2   happen to it.

 3                 MS. RESNIK:      And I believe that the judges

 4   and lawyers and law professors, who have written to you

 5   on the other side, are committed to understanding that

 6   the privilege is important instrumentally.                The trial --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Oh, but the law --

 8   the law professors aren't the ones who deal with this

 9   question on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about

10   going to jail, if they want to protect their client's --

11   what they view as their ethical obligations.

12                 MS. RESNIK:      There are many provisions short

13   of going to jail, and, furthermore, I want to come back

14   to the -- to the rule, the limited --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But it's only going to

16   jail that gives you criminal intent.

17                 MS. RESNIK:      Yes.       It is.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            That's immediately

19   appealable.

20                 MS. RESNIK:      And the -- the underlying

21   insight of Cohen, is that there are many instances when

22   dramatic events occur in the dynamics of trial, but the

23   Congress has concluded that the final judgment rule

24   requires waiting till you get to the end.

25                 And in the instances -- contempt, as

 1   standing here as an alternative around that rule, as is

 2   mandamus, as is 1292(b), are small windows, not for the

 3   regular course of events.

 4              The empiric suggests that, by and large,

 5   people are getting it right, but there will a lot of

 6   requests for review and the strategic dimension, which

 7   is what the attorney-client privilege and the class

 8   action holdings in Cohen are about, will invite more of

 9   the strategic play, so that, in the plea from the judges

10   who also participated in the amicus --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is the attorney-client

12   claim sometimes raised, along with a host of other

13   discovery issues, as a bargaining chip?

14              MS. RESNIK:       These are packages that -- yes,

15   the attorney-client privilege -- and this is granular

16   work by district and magistrate judges of -- of hundreds

17   of thousands of pieces of paper.

18              It could go, piecemeal, to the court of

19   appeals more than one time and it can also come up, even

20   at trial, interrupting a trial.             So we could watch the

21   sequence of a frequent, repetitious return back and

22   forth to the court of appeals on this kind of privilege

23   and, potentially, on other kinds of privileges.

24              Thank you very much.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

 2              ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 3               ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 4                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 5                    SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 6              MR. KNEEDLER:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court.     In the last 15 years, this Court, in

 8   applying the principles of Cohen, has repeatedly

 9   stressed that a necessary requirement is that the order

10   involved and the issues implicated be important and,

11   particularly, that the issues be so important as to

12   outweigh the values served by the important and usual

13   rule of a final judgment requirement.

14              In our view, the denial of an assertion of

15   attorney-client privilege in an individual case does not

16   rise to that level and to the --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, except when

18   the government is the one raising it.

19              MR. KNEEDLER:            No.      We do not -- we -- to be

20   clear, we are not asserting that an -- that an assertion

21   of attorney-client privilege by the government is -- is

22   immediately --

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Yes, but, in the

24   government context, what would be in the private

25   context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a


                                        41

 1   different type of governmental privilege.

 2                 When you give advice to a government agency,

 3   you don't call that the attorney-client privilege.                    You

 4   call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative

 5   privilege, all these other things.

 6                 In the private sector, when you are an

 7   attorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say,

 8   This has got something.        It's the attorney-client

 9   privilege.

10                 MR. KNEEDLER:        Let me also stress, we are

11   not arguing that a denial of the assertion of the

12   deliberative process privilege is immediately

13   appealable.

14                 Our -- the -- the submission that we make in

15   the latter part of our brief, and that we urge the Court

16   not to foreclose here, is the Presidential

17   communications privilege, which applies to

18   communications involving the President or his top

19   advisors.

20                 And we also say that the State secrets

21   privilege raises similar concerns.                 Both of those serve

22   functions of constitutional significance.                 We do not

23   make the same claim about -- about the general

24   government privilege for deliberative process.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So you are saying


                                       42

 1   that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an

 2   interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other

 3   than Presidential communications and State secrets?

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:         I don't want to rule out the

 5   possibility that there could be a statutory privilege of

 6   some -- of some particular sort --

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, you could -- you

 8   could seek an interlocutory appeal under 1292(b).

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:         That -- that would be -- that

10   would be available in an appropriate case.               There are

11   the -- there are the limitations.               We trust that a court

12   would -- would grant that, but these -- these are

13   interests of the highest order.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry.   There

15   are problems with 1292(b).         Are you telling me, when

16   your office writes a letter to the Department of

17   Interior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal --

18   we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a

19   really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you

20   assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the

21   attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge

22   says, that's not covered, for one reason or another,

23   you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?

24              MR. KNEEDLER:         No.      Not -- we don't get an

25   interlocutory appeal under -- under 1291.               No.   We are


                                     43
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not arguing for that -- for that position.                  And, for the

 2   two particular privileges that -- that we have

 3   identified in our -- in our brief, it is possible that

 4   1292(b) certification would be granted by the -- by the

 5   Court, but it is also possible that it would not.

 6              And I -- I would like to -- I would like to

 7   identify -- and I think Justice Sotomayor asked about --

 8   about a test for importance, and the Court, in its

 9   recent decision in Will, tried to summarize what -- what

10   it has been driving at over the last 15 years on this

11   importance prong and whether the importance outweighs

12   the -- the final judgment values.

13              And what the Court said there is that there

14   has -- that the denial of an immediate appeal has to

15   undermine -- let me -- let me quote -- "has to undermine

16   some particular value of high order."

17              And then the Court identified the things

18   that have fallen into that category.                  It mentioned

19   separation of powers.     The Court mentioned disruption of

20   government operations through the denial of qualified

21   immunity, and I would add the denial of statutory

22   immunity under the Westfall Act to that.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You don't think that

24   the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who

25   gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was


                                     44
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   an issue in Cohen?

 2                 MR. KNEEDLER:        We -- I think the -- I do

 3   not.   And I think the problem is that the denial of

 4   attorney-client privilege is tied up with discovery of

 5   the sort that happens every day in Federal Court.                 It's

 6   bound up with -- with discovery plans, that --

 7   objections on relevance, materiality, various -- various

 8   privileges.

 9                 One of the important values served by the

10   final judgment rule is that the conduct of -- of

11   district court proceedings like that is committed to the

12   judgment and discretion of the district court, and if a

13   disappointed litigant could automatically run to the

14   court of appeals that undermines the ability of the

15   district court judge to manage the day-to-day --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We are not talking

17   about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to

18   is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like

19   every other evidentiary privilege that you have just

20   listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of

21   things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is

22   different, even more important than who has to post

23   security for costs, because it is central to the rule of

24   law, because it is central to how the adversary system

25   functions.

 1              MR. KNEEDLER:          I think the more precise

 2   question, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the

 3   question is whether the denial of an attorney-client

 4   privilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the

 5   values of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal,

 6   and I think, as has been pointed out by several of the

 7   Justices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the

 8   privilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the

 9   confidence people might have in it.                    There are

10   uncertainties at trial.       These are often fact-based

11   determinations that would be subject to clearly

12   erroneous review on appeal.           The very sorts of reasons

13   why issues like this are committed to the district

14   court's discretion and reviewed on final judgment when

15   you can find out whether the error actually made a

16   difference on a particular case.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But the review -- I

18   follow your answer but the review on final judgment is

19   meaningless.   I mean, the cat is out of the bag.

20              MR. KNEEDLER:          Well, it's not entirely

21   meaningless.   It can -- if the evidence was used in the

22   trial and had -- had a substantial impact you can have a

23   reversal of the judgment, and -- and the -- the injury

24   can be mitigated by saying that the -- that the evidence

25   cannot be -- cannot be used in the retrial.                   That is


                                      46
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The injury to the

 3   party, but not the injury to the attorney-client

 4   privilege.

 5                MR. KNEEDLER:        Well, again, the -- the

 6   question is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for

 7   competence in its own right but to encourage frank

 8   communications in order to promote litigation in the

 9   function of lawyers.     And the question is whether the

10   denial of a privilege in a particular case will so

11   undermine that privilege as a general matter to warrant

12   an immediate appeal.     And we think the answer is clearly

13   no.   And also the loss of the privilege to the

14   individual litigant we think is not a sufficient basis,

15   because the other cases that I mentioned, and that the

16   Court identified in Will are situations where the injury

17   transcends the particular case.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Kneedler, I think I

19   have this right, but correct me if I am wrong.               I

20   thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a

21   question that we would like to get this legal question

22   settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security

23   for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up

24   up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit.               It

25   would be the practical end of the lawsuit.               Unlike in an


                                      47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on.

 2               So Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that

 3   this was an important question unsettled under Erie, it

 4   is the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put

 5   up security costs would be out of --

 6               MR. KNEEDLER:         That's -- that's a very

 7   important -- that's a very important point.                  And I think

 8   that --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true

10   that true, that the case goes on?               Isn't it true that of

11   the civil cases that get through discovery, only a tiny

12   percentage ever come to an appealable final judgment?

13   The vast, vast majority of these things are settled, are

14   they not?

15               MR. KNEEDLER:         They are.           And I -- I -- I

16   think that supports the point for not having immediate

17   appealable --

18               JUSTICE ALITO:         Right, because there never

19   could be an appeal.

20               MR. KNEEDLER:         Well, but the --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:         It means that the

22   erroneous -- if there was an erroneous ruling, it's

23   built into the -- it's irretrievably built into -- well

24   not irretrievably, but powerfully built into the

25   bargaining --

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. KNEEDLER:         But that's the nature of

 2   trial proceedings and discovery.               Judges may make

 3   erroneous rulings.    And this Court, again, acknowledged

 4   in Will that the purpose of the final judgment rule is

 5   no to protect -- prevent particular injustices that

 6   might happen in a particular case.                Again, to go back to

 7   what the Court has stressed, there has to be a -- a -- a

 8   value, and the Court said constitutional or statutory or

 9   something with a large public pedigree where the --

10   where the injury will -- will not be -- where the

11   weighing of the costs and benefits comes out quite

12   differently.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          If the privilege were in a

14   statute, that would make a difference?

15               MR. KNEEDLER:         I don't think so if there was

16   a statute that just codified the -- the privileges like

17   this.   What I -- what I -- what I was suggesting is

18   there might be a statute that would identify a

19   particular governmental interest as in the D.C.

20   Circuit's decision in the -- in the --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Putting aside the

22   question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a

23   good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that

24   litigants on one side frequently request and demand in

25   discovery material that they know is covered by the


                                      49
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's

 2   where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them

 3   leverage, because they know that the other side is going

 4   to have to go through this impossible process and can't

 5   get an immediate appeal.

 6              Why isn't that a concern that we should

 7   have?

 8              MR. KNEEDLER:          I think and that's a --

 9   district judges are -- are -- who manage these cases

10   every day can see through that, and -- and -- and can be

11   trusted to, by and large, make correct results.                It may

12   be that there will be an occasional erroneous

13   determination.   But, again, as for privileges generally,

14   that's -- that's so.

15              I did want to make one final point about --

16   about irreparable injury.         For the sorts of privileges

17   that we have identified in -- in our brief, the -- the

18   presidential communications privilege and whatnot,

19   that -- that harm is immediate and broad on behalf of

20   the nation as a whole.       That is a different question

21   from the harm to a particular litigant when a privilege

22   is denied in a particular case and it doesn't undermine

23   the broader purposes of the privilege.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

25   Mr. Kneedler.

 1               Mr. Allen, you have four minutes remaining.

 2             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN

 3                     ON BEHALF THE PETITIONER

 4               MR. ALLEN:        I would like to address the

 5   question that Justice Alito raised with regard to

 6   whether or not an appeal of a collateral issue dealing

 7   with waiver or privilege would stay the litigation.                The

 8   answer is it does not.        The case remains with the

 9   district court, the district court is empowered to

10   manage the case.    Only the question addressing the issue

11   would go up with collateral order jurisdiction.             Indeed,

12   in this case, the court did not stay the litigation

13   below.   So, the court maintains that ability to manage

14   its own docket.    To be sure --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:             It certainly doesn't go

16   ahead with the trial, does it?

17               MR. ALLEN:        He has not gone ahead with the

18   trial.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:             It never would, would it?

20               MR. ALLEN:        He is certainly empowered to do

21   so.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, just go ahead with

23   trial while a material issue is still pending, I can't

24   imagine that.

25               MR. ALLEN:        Your Honor, the scenario that


                                       51

 1   you raise would put the attorney or the client,

 2   depending on who is in the box, if you will, to some

 3   hard choices.    But there are two ways that the case

 4   stays:   Either the district court has to order that the

 5   case stays or on appeal the court of appeals has to

 6   order that the case stays.           The parties and their

 7   counsel cannot stay the case.

 8                So, I agree with you that it could be a

 9   difficult situation for the parties.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I can't imagine a judge

11   going to trial in a case when an important issue like

12   this is pending on appeal.           Has that ever happened?

13                MR. ALLEN:       I am unaware that it has -- it

14   has ever happened, Your Honor, and I hope it doesn't.

15   But the -- but point is that the district court

16   maintains that power and authority to run -- to run its

17   courtroom.

18                The United States cites Will for the

19   proposition that -- that the collateral order doctrine

20   is designed to impact some particular value of high

21   order, and it recites from Will a number of those

22   particular values of high order, including qualified

23   immunity.    As this Court recognized in -- in Harlow,

24   a -- a doctrine of common law origin, much like the

25   attorney-client privilege, the -- the doctrine in


                                       52
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Harlow, qualified immunity is designed to impact and

 2   affect the efficient operation of government.

 3                 The design of the attorney-client privilege

 4   is intended to have the same impact on the efficient and

 5   effective operation of the administration of justice.

 6                 If I could go back, Justice Breyer, to the

 7   question that you raised with regard to other privilege.

 8   I would suggest that a holding in this case in our favor

 9   would have no impact on the Court's later determination

10   of privileges of husband, wife, spousal privileges, or

11   of priest and penitent type privileges.                     I would suggest

12   that the better course would be to examine a case that

13   develops the importance or the impact of those

14   privileges, but certainly with regard, for example, to

15   spousal immunity or spousal privilege, the way that the

16   States recognize them -- I believe that all 50 States

17   recognize spousal privilege -- is varied.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:          So -- so, I think any

19   system of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal,

20   will, in fact, work some injustice.                     I have no doubt

21   about that.    Any system that allows too many

22   interlocutory appeals wrecks the judicial system through

23   delay.

24                 Now, I think on that kind of question which

25   is here, maybe there is some information that you come


                                       53

 1   across with the ABA, for example, that has 300,000 --

 2   maybe 600 -- you know, hundreds of thousands of members.

 3   There might be instances in the circuits where appeal

 4   was denied, where the lawyers would say, my goodness,

 5   appeal was denied, I want to tell you the hardship that

 6   that worked.

 7                 Has anyone gone around and tried to find if

 8   there are such instances, as there must be, how serious

 9   it was?     How harmful, how often do we have any empirical

10   information on that question?

11                 MR. ALLEN:       Your Honor, I do not have any

12   empirical information to answer that question.             But to

13   go to the -- to the -- to the underlying premise of

14   whether or not those other cases might generate some

15   flood gate, if you will, I think we have -- we have

16   answered to be clear with Respondent's description of

17   our counting.    I don't think it is a statistical

18   analysis.    We simply counted the actual appeals, 11.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Is it wrong for me to

20   expect that if this would work, a lot of instances of

21   serious hardship not allowing the appeal, some lawyers

22   in their meetings would be upset and they would raise a

23   few examples?    So doesn't the fact that you have been

24   unable to find any tend to count against you?

25                 MR. ALLEN:       I don't believe it does, Your

 1   Honor, I don't believe that should count against us.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.
