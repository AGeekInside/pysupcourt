 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   next in Case 07-371, Taylor versus Sturgell.

 5                  Ms. Rosenbaum.

 6                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA ROSENBAUM

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10                  It is the basic principle of American law

11   that a lawsuit does not decide the rights of

12   non-parties.    That basic principle has a few narrow

13   exceptions, none of which applies here.

14                  Taylor had no involvement in the prior case.

15   He had no legal relationship with any parties to that

16   case.   And no party to that case had the legal authority

17   to represent him.

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                When you have a

19   situation where it is an associational standing case,

20   and an individual is the one that's relied upon give the

21   association standing, in that case is the individual,

22   even though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by

23   the association's case?

24                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         I think that would depend on

25   whether the association in that case had the authority


                                          3

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to bring that case on behalf of that individual.

 2                 In order for a person to be bound on the

 3   basis of representation in the prior case, the party to

 4   the prior case had to have the authority to bring the

 5   case on behalf of that other person.                     It had to be a

 6   representational relationship where the party for the

 7   first case is exercising the authority to represent the

 8   later case.   And there has to be a relationship that

 9   exists at the time of the first litigation.

10                 Someone can't retroactively be represented

11   during the first litigation.

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What if you had a case and

13   there's a suspicion of something like that that's here,

14   although the courts below did not so find?                     What if you

15   had a case in -- like this in which the first litigant

16   said to the second, I brought my case and I lost.                     I

17   want you to try again for me?              And if you do and you

18   win, I will give you a job making use of the fruits of

19   the litigation?

20                 Would there be an estoppel in that case?

21                 MS. ROSENBAUM:         No, not just on those facts.

22   And I do want to emphasize --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why.

24                 MS. ROSENBAUM:         -- first that is a big shift

25   from what was decided blow.              What the court held below


                                         4

 1   was that Herrick represented Taylor in the previous


 2   case.    It did not hold that Taylor was somehow


 3   representing Herrick in this case.


 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It held, as I recall,


 5   specifically, I think, that there was no collusion

 6   found.    And the suggestion was that if collusion had

 7   been found -- and I was giving you an example of

 8   something that I would call collusion at least -- that

 9   the result might have been different.

10                 MS. ROSENBAUM:         Collusion is sort of a

11   pejorative way of saying an agreement.                   An agreement can

12   be -- can lead to preclusion under a certain

13   circumstances instances, but for --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why wouldn't my example

15   have done so?    In my example the agreement was I lost;

16   please try again for me.          And if you win, I'm going to

17   give you a job making use of the fruits of the lawsuit.

18                 Would that agreement not have been enough

19   to -- to sustain a collusion here?

20                 MS. ROSENBAUM:         No, not without the party to

21   the first case controlling the second case.                  But this

22   Court does not --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why should that -- why

24   should that matter?

25                 MS. ROSENBAUM:         Because what's being

 1   protected here is the person's right to the opportunity

 2   to be heard on their claim.               And in that case --

 3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But --

 4                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         -- second claim.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The claim that

 6   Justice Souter has posited is not one that the second

 7   person would have been -- he was soliciting.                      He was

 8   solicited to be a plaintiff in that second case.                      That

 9   is not the case that is involved here.                      As far as we

10   know --

11                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Exactly.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            As far as we know, Taylor

13   didn't even know about the first case.                      He brings the

14   second case.    There is no indication that it was

15   solicited by Herrick.        So I don't know why you're even

16   reaching the case where someone -- someone is -- you say

17   has to be controlled, but why are we getting into the

18   details of such a situation when we have no

19   solicitation?

20                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Exactly.             This Court does

21   not need to decide what sort of solicitation or

22   recruitment or agreement would reasonably --

23                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Right.          But if we adopted

24   -- as I understand it, if we adopted your theory across

25   the board, it would preclude -- it would preclude a


                                          6

 1   preclusion in the case of my hypothetical, and that's

 2   what I want to get at.

 3                  Should we, by adopting your theory,

 4   eliminate the possibility of preclusion in the case that

 5   I put to you?

 6                  And you're saying, I guess:                Well, if --

 7   even there, there should be no preclusion unless the

 8   first party controlled the case in the -- controlled the

 9   second case.

10                  And my question is:             Why?

11                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Well, again, that's a

12   question of whether that second party is acting as an

13   agent for the first party and really just trying to

14   relitigate that first party's opportunity to be heard.

15   And if the second party is an agent, then the second

16   party can be precluded.

17                  But, again, exactly what would constitute

18   that agency is not something that this Court needs to

19   decide, because the facts here do not demonstrate that

20   Taylor was representing Herrick in this case.

21                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, do you think that the

22   collusion point was perhaps just ill-phrased here?

23   There was no collusion, certainly, in the sense that

24   there was any kind of secret dealing going on.

25                  The second lawsuit, the people involved in


                                          7

 1   it, couldn't Taylor -- couldn't have been more candid, I

 2   guess, about what was going on.                And so there was no

 3   collusion in the sense of concealment or

 4   underhandedness.

 5               Do you think that is perhaps the reason that

 6   the court of appeals found that there was no collusion;

 7   and that, therefore, we ought to discount that finding?

 8               MS. ROSENBAUM:            Well, I think the court of

 9   appeals found that there was no collusion because the

10   facts that are in the record about the relationship

11   between Taylor and Herrick do not demonstrate that there

12   was any collusion.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, didn't the court of

14   appeals actually say there was no collusion, or did it

15   say, we don't need to reach that question?

16               MS. ROSENBAUM:            It said that the facts were

17   ambiguous, and it did not need to decide it.                  But it

18   also specifically said that on the facts before it, that

19   Taylor could have brought an entirely separate,

20   independent case, separate from Herrick.                  So --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:            So these facts do not

22   necessarily show collusion to avoid the preclusive

23   effects of Herrick?

24               MS. ROSENBAUM:            Yes.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:            We do not need to determine


                                          8

 1   whether they count as tactical maneuvering.              They did

 2   find -- they did say there was a close working

 3   relationship relative to the successive cases.                Didn't

 4   they say that?

 5                 MS. ROSENBAUM:         They did say that.       But,

 6   again, that just brings up the question of what sort of

 7   relationship is necessary for the -- there to be

 8   preclusion.

 9                 And many people have close relationships but

10   that does not necessarily mean that those people are

11   bound, or expect to be bound, by decisions in each

12   others' cases, particularly --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But here the close

14   relationship seems to boil down to this, and you correct

15   me if I'm wrong here because I may be missing some fact.

16                 But it is inconceivable to me that any

17   reason for Taylor's participation or Taylor's bringing

18   this lawsuit could be found except the reason of trying

19   to relitigate Herrick's lawsuit so that Taylor would

20   then either get the job or have an easier time

21   fulfilling the job of fixing up the airplane.

22                 I can't think of any other reason on the

23   facts as I understand them from the briefs.

24                 Is there a -- on the facts of case, any

25   other possible reason?

 1                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes.       First, I just want to

 2   point out that there was no agreement, or the record

 3   does not show and there was no agreement between them to

 4   actually work on the plane.

 5                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.      But why else would

 6   he be doing -- why else would he have been doing this?

 7   What does the record show as another possible

 8   explanation?

 9                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Taylor is the executive

10   director of the Antique Aircraft Association, and he is

11   someone who is interested in antique aircraft and in

12   aviation generally.       And after reading Herrick's

13   decision -- his explanation in the motion for discovery

14   for filing his FOIA request is that he read the decision

15   in Herrick, and that he understood it to mean that he

16   was legally entitled to the records.                      And so --

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't need a reason to

18   file a FOIA request anyway, right?                   Just the naked

19   curiosity justifies your obtaining the documents, right?

20   I mean this is a lawsuit that does not require a reason

21   except I want the documents.              You've got them.            I'm

22   entitled to them.

23                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes.       It requires the --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean somebody could have

25   walked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit,


                                         10

 1   right?

 2               MS. ROSENBAUM:          Anyone who was interested in

 3   the record could file a FOIA request for them.

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But if somebody walked in

 5   off the street and began this lawsuit and had absolutely

 6   no connection with Herrick, and so on, the issue of

 7   preclusion wouldn't come up, or at least it wouldn't

 8   come up in the context that it comes up here.

 9               But this isn't somebody who walked in off

10   the street, and the claim is there is a preclusion

11   doctrine because of the relationship between party one

12   and party two.   And the fact that anybody who comes in

13   off the street could have asked -- could have made the

14   same request, in effect, is not an answer to the

15   collusion claim; is it?

16               MS. ROSENBAUM:          Well, it shows that the

17   problem, if it exists, of there being repeated

18   litigation over the same records is not one that would

19   be solved through preclusion.             And Respondents have not

20   shown there actually is a problem with repeated

21   litigation over the same records.                And the Department of

22   Justice represents the defendants in all FOIA cases, so

23   they would be able to know if that was a problem that

24   came up again and again.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about if it is


                                       11

 1   the executive director of the association, and the suit

 2   is brought in the name the association, and they lose.

 3   Can he bring suit as, you know, I'm just Joe Blow, but I

 4   happen to be the executive director, but I'm bringing

 5   this in my own name?

 6                MS. ROSENBAUM:         The question -- that would

 7   then come down to whether or not he controlled the first

 8   case, because one of the categories in which people are

 9   bound by prior litigation in which they were not

10   themselves parties, is if they had control over the

11   first case and had the full and fair opportunity to

12   litigate in that case.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, let's say that

14   it is somebody above him, you know, the president of the

15   association, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and

16   he's just the executive director?

17                MS. ROSENBAUM:         But he was not in control of

18   the first case and did not get his opportunity to be

19   heard in that case --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But he recommended

21   to the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit.

22   The president said okay, and they did, and then they

23   lost.   Can he go ahead as an individual?

24                MS. ROSENBAUM:         If he was not in control of

25   that first case, yes, he could go ahead as an individual


                                       12

 1   if he was not -- if he is not representing the


 2   association in the second case, but is, instead,


 3   representing himself.


 4               JUSTICE ALITO:          And could he continue to


 5   solicit other members of the association to file FOIA

 6   suits all over the country until they finally got a

 7   favorable decision?

 8               MS. ROSENBAUM:          Well, that would come down

 9   to what the definition of "solicit" was and whether

10   those people were acting as agents of that person who is

11   doing the soliciting.

12               But, again, this Court does not need to

13   decide exactly what sort of solicitation would create

14   that agency relationship, because the facts in the

15   record here do not show that that is what happened here.

16               And also FOIA is set up to allow there to be

17   repeated litigation over the same records.                Under FOIA,

18   every requester has -- every person has the right to

19   request records.   And once they have requested those

20   records and been denied them, they have suffered a

21   concrete and particular injury; and they have the right

22   to seek judicial review of that injury.

23               So that makes this case different from the

24   taxpayer standing in -- cases cited --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that means

 1   your statement implicates very serious questions of

 2   standing under Article III, whether Congress can say

 3   create the injury by saying you've been denied records

 4   and, therefore, you have standing.                 I think that's -- I

 5   wouldn't go ahead assuming that that was correct.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Although it is not really

 7   just your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?

 8                MS. ROSENBAUM:         That is the way Congress set

 9   up FOIA is to -- to give people that statutory

10   entitlement to the records.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And it does cover idle

12   curiosity.   I mean, I suppose if anyone in the courtroom

13   were to file a request for the same information, there

14   could be no argument that there would be any kind of

15   preclusion just because it's been heard before.

16                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Exactly.            And if there were

17   some problem with people -- with there being multiple

18   requests for the same records, that would be a problem

19   for Congress to solve.       And Congress has all sorts of

20   creative ways of solving problems when it thinks that

21   they are, in fact, problems.

22                It can channel all litigation into one court

23   or into one court of appeals like it does for patent

24   cases to more easily create precedent, or it didn't have

25   to create FOIA to create this statutory, individual


                                       14

 1   entitlement to begin with.

 2               It could have sent up FOIA more like a qui

 3   tam case in which one person did represent the whole

 4   public or the government in requesting records.

 5               But that's not what Congress did.          Congress

 6   did give every person the right to records and the right

 7   to seek judicial review when they were denied records.

 8   And we can disagree about whether that was something

 9   Congress should have done, but that is what Congress did

10   and Congress's chosen scheme should not be altered

11   through the back door of preclusion doctrine.

12   The amorphous factors used by the lower courts to hold

13   Taylor bound also have their problems in terms of

14   judicial efficiency and people coming into court.         Those

15   factors do not give guidance either to lower courts or

16   to litigants themselves about who can be bound.

17               I mean, a -- in a threshold area like res

18   judicata, it is particularly important to have clear

19   rules about who can be bound, to move on quickly to the

20   merits of the case, without having to go through a lot

21   of collateral litigation; but the factors used by the

22   court of appeals do not provide those clear rules.         And

23   they also don't provide clear rules to litigants about

24   when they will, in fact, be bound by -- when, in fact,

25   they will be bound by a case.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             What are your clear rules?

 2   Give me -- set it forth clearly, what you think it

 3   takes.   Number one, do -- do you have to know you're

 4   going to be bound at the time the first suit is brought?

 5   That isn't the requirement, is it?

 6                MS. ROSENBAUM:          No.      There are certain legal

 7   relationships that would not require someone to be -- to

 8   know even of the case at the first suit.                 For example, a

 9   successor in interest to property can buy the property

10   --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Right.

12                MS. ROSENBAUM:          -- after the first suit, yet

13   is nonetheless bound by the --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So what are your tests?

15   How many?   Five?   Four?       It is not a totality of the

16   circumstances, test though, right?

17                MS. ROSENBAUM:          No, it's --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You have some criteria.

19   What are they?

20                MS. ROSENBAUM:          There are an --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Agency?

22                MS. ROSENBAUM:          Well, agency would fall into

23   a larger category of, that there are certain Legal

24   relationships that treat people as the same person for

25   res judicata purposes and often for other purposes; and

 1   those are substantive relationships created by

 2   underlying substantive law.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

 4                MS. ROSENBAUM:         People can also be bound

 5   when they have -- have had their full and fair

 6   opportunity to litigate in the prior case, through some

 7   involvement in that case.          So for example, in Montana

 8   versus United States this Court held that the government

 9   was bound because it had controlled the contractor who

10   brought the prior case.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

12                MS. ROSENBAUM:         And then people can be bound

13   when they were represented in the prior case.                   And in

14   that case, they did have their opportunity to be heard

15   in the prior case just through a representative.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            A representative that they

17   agreed to?

18                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Exactly.            Someone who had

19   the authority --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            As in a class action, where

21   they have the -- the ability to bow out if they want,

22   right?

23                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Well, a class action is a

24   very good example of that representational relationship,

25   and the court of appeals in this case used language that


                                       17

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is very similar to the rationales used for class

 2   actions, talking about identity of interests and

 3   adequacy of representation, but it did not include any

 4   of the protections that are inherent in class actions:

 5   the factors that need to be looked at to make sure that

 6   class treatment is appropriate.                The specification of

 7   who is and is not in the class.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.     I mean, and the

 9   individual's ability to withdraw from the class, if he

10   doesn't want to be bound by this suit, right?

11                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes.

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That is crucial.

13                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         That is crucial in class

14   actions.

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the judge's

16   obligation to look out for the trial to see, for

17   example, any settlement has to be approved by the judge

18   to make sure it is fair to the absent class members.

19                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes.       That was absent here

20   also.   In this situation, no one understood that first

21   case to be litigating the rights of anyone but

22   Mr. Herrick.    Mr. Herrick did not understand that that's

23   what was happening.       The Tenth Circuit did not

24   understand that was what was happening, and Taylor did

25   not understand what was happening.

 2   in which were notice, before the suit was filed -- or at

 3   the outset of the suit, and some encouragement to go

 4   ahead with the suit, would that have fit your, I guess,

 5   second category of adequate representation, adequate

 6   opportunity to have your -- a case heard?

 7                MS. ROSENBAUM:         The category of having the

 8   full and fair opportunity --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

10                MS. ROSENBAUM:         To litigate to the --

14                MS. ROSENBAUM:         That is because that would

15   basically be setting up a system of mandatory voluntary

16   intervention.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But why doesn't that fit

18   at least the semantic version of the category you gave

19   us?

20                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Because that person still is

21   not receiving -- is not fully and fairly litigating that

22   case.   They are not involved in that case, under that

23   hypothetical.   And they're not in control of that case.

24                Merely knowing about a case, knowing that

25   one could voluntarily intervene is not enough.

 1                  And this Court has stated --

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Your list of factors is

 3   cumulative?    They are not independent categories?                   Your

 4   category number 2 then is not a stand-alone category for

 5   barring -- for barring the second plaintiff?

 6                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         It can be in certain

 7   circumstances.    Just because a --

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The word that we use is

 9   privity.   If you are in privity with somebody else, you

10   can -- that's a pre-existing legal relationship.

11                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            As the beneficiary and

13   the trustee.

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but that's not

16   what -- that's not what your second category was.                     I

17   understand privity, but you didn't -- you weren't just

18   trying to restate the concept of privity in your second

19   category, were you?

20                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         The category talking

21   about --

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

23                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Full and fair litigation?

24                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Right.          Otherwise you

25   would have just said privity.

 1                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Well, the problem with the

 2   term "privity" is that privity is often used as somewhat

 3   at the conclusion --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

 5                MS. ROSENBAUM:         -- to mean that someone is

 6   bound by the prior case.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

 8                MS. ROSENBAUM:         What is generally meant by

 9   the privity, or often -- the way the word is often used

10   to mean that a substantive legal relationship, but lower

11   courts have sometimes put the control cases in the

12   category of privity.      They have sometimes put the

13   adequate representation cases in the category of

14   privity.   So just talking about privity, it -- doesn't

15   really give the bounds of who would be bound by --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            We can use it accurately,

17   bring it back to what it really means --

18                (Laughter.)

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can we?

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if you have a

21   situation where a client has retained a law firm to do

22   something and the law firm as part of its normal

23   activity files a FOIA request?              They think something

24   useful is going to come up there, and it's denied, and

 1   retained by the company files a FOIA suit?

 2               In that case, is the company bound by the

 3   determination in the case?         Or can they then file

 4   another action?

 5               MS. ROSENBAUM:         Who would -- if the company

 6   filed its own FOIA case, we request on behalf --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, the law firm --

 8   the law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is

 9   denied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and

10   the company brings a FOIA action.

11               MS. ROSENBAUM:         And the law firm brought it

12   on behalf of the law firm --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.

14               MS. ROSENBAUM:         But the company is bringing

15   it on behalf of the company?

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

17               MS. ROSENBAUM:         Then they are separate

18   requestors who each have -- who have their own

19   opportunity to be heard on their own FOIA claim.

21   represented by the same law firm?

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But in the case of the

 3   Chief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up,

 4   if the client sends another lawyer to bring this.                     But

 5   there's no automatic preclusion in that relationship as

 6   there is in the traditional relationship.

 7                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Well, people are not

 8   generally precluded because of their lawyers' actions in

 9   prior cases.    And this Court --

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But -- I guess to be

11   fair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was

12   paying for what the law firm was doing.                   It just wasn't

13   the -- the filing of the suit.                The law firm went off on

14   it own.    Maybe it does it all the time when they have a

15   case, they think this might be helpful and they are

16   filing a FOIA request.

17                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         The question there would

18   come down to whether the company was representing the --

19   whether the law firm in that instance was representing

20   the company with the authority to be representing the

21   company.   In that --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is it purely a

23   formal inquiry?    In other words, let's say the company

24   is paying the law firm to represent, but the law firm

25   just filed in its own name?               Does that make a

 1   difference?

 2                 MS. ROSENBAUM:          I think it would go to the

 3   underlying agreement between the law firm and the

 4   company and whether the company had somehow given the

 5   law firm authority to be filing this FOIA request and

 6   then filing the lawsuit.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why isn't that not like

 8   Montana, where the government was not a party to the

 9   case but it was in control of what the contractor was

10   doing?

11                 MS. ROSENBAUM:          Right.         Again, if the

12   company was in control, and I think there would have to

13   be that sort of agreement that it was represented --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think you'd also say that

15   if the company paid for the suit.                  The company just --

16   "I don't want to be in control of it.                     I don't want you

17   to sue in my name, but I think this is a good thing for

18   you to do, so I'll pay for it."

19                 MS. ROSENBAUM:          I think that could be an

20   indicator that the company was -- that the law firm was

21   representing the company.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             No.    No.      The company says,

23   "absolutely I do not want you to represent me."                    That is

24   in -- in a letter.      Okay?

25                 So it's clear that the law firm is not


                                         24

 1   representing the company, but the company thinks that

 2   it's a good idea to have this lawsuit and yeah, I'll

 3   bankroll it.

 4                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         If the law firm does not

 5   have the authority to represent the company, then it's

 6   hard to see how the company could be bound by a

 7   decision --

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You don't think that

 9   somebody who finances -- who solicits a litigation,

10   recruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and

11   then says, "I recruited a very good law firm, so I can

12   stay out of it.    I'm not going to try to -- I don't know

13   anything about the law, I'm not going to try to manage

14   this case."    But someone who recruits the firm and pays

15   for it wouldn't be bound.

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I think you've got to give

17   that one away.

18                  (Laughter.)

19                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         I think that that's a harder

20   instance.   And that really goes back to why it means

21   to --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it's a company

23   --

24                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         -- control a case.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Let's say some

 1   group, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a

 2   fundraising thing around saying we think all our members

 3   ought to contribute to a special fund so that we can

 4   bring a lawsuit under FOIA.             Are all of those individual

 5   contributors then bound by the result?

 6                MS. ROSENBAUM:         No.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it make as

 8   difference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?

 9                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Well, again it comes back to

10   whether those people have given the person bringing the

11   case the authority to represent them in that lawsuit.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, then in the

13   previous hypothetical there was no authority to

14   represent.   They just said, "I think this is a good

15   idea, here's the money.        Here."

16                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes, and I still think in

17   that situation there also would not be preclusion.

18                But the questions of when someone controls a

19   prior case are very different from what happened here

20   where there was no notice of that prior litigation, but

21   --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, controls.   So

23   there are three companies, and they each have -- you

24   know, they can vote.      They each have 33-percent control.

25   Are they each bound, or because they didn't control it

 1   none of them are bound?

 2               MS. ROSENBAUM:           If they had not given the

 3   law firm the authority to represent them in that

 4   particular case, then they are not bound.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, they said,

 6   yes, you can represent us, and we're three different

 7   companies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to

 8   what you can do.

 9               MS. ROSENBAUM:           Well, then that is sort of

10   standard representation by a law firm of a company, and

11   those people would be legally represented in that

12   lawsuit, have had their day in court and would be bound

13   by that decision.

14               Unless there are further questions, I would

15   like to reserve the rest of my time.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

20          ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

21                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Mr. Chief Justice,

23   and may it please the Court:

24               Although the precise formulation adopted by

25   the court of appeals may be somewhat novel, its holding

 1   of a finding of privity here is consistent with

 2   well-established principles of res judicata.                   Where

 3   multiple persons engage in coordinated successive

 4   litigation to vindicate a joint interest with respect to

 5   which a judgment in favor of any of them will benefit

 6   all, then a judgment in the first litigation in which

 7   that interest is adequately represented finds the others

 8   as well.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would you explain to me

10   how that could possibly work?

11               I can understand that you're making an

12   argument that the second case, there was a recruitment,

13   there was collusion or whatever.              But for all we know

14   from this record, how could Taylor possibly be bound

15   when Herrick's suit is over?           Because as far as we know,

16   Taylor never heard of that first case.                   How can somebody

17   be bound by a litigation in which they had no notice, no

18   opportunity to be heard?

19               So if we freeze the situation at the of case

20   one, how could Taylor possibly be bound?

21               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, I think it's

22   important to start by recognizing that even Petitioner

23   acknowledges that there can be circumstances in which

24   Taylor would be bound, even though at the time, at the

25   end of Herrick's litigation, he had no notice, he had


                                      28

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not participated.    And that is, on their view and ours

 2   as well, that if Herrick had thereafter created an

 3   agency relationship with Taylor, and Taylor then as

 4   agent went and brought the second FOIA suit --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Because he's asking for

 6   Herrick who is bound by the first case.

 7                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    That's right.

 8   And -- but all of that can exist or be created after the

 9   first litigation is over.           And so the absence of notice

10   in the first case --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Because what you're

12   saying is the person who is really in the second case is

13   the same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is

14   simply acting as an agent to give Herrick another

15   chance?

16                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    That's -- that's

17   right.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But we're talking about

19   binding Taylor.

20                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well -- but Taylor

21   in the second suit that he brings as agent to advance

22   the interests of Herrick would be bound.                     Taylor would

23   be barred.   His suit would be --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There was no finding of

25   that.    There was no finding here of agency relationship.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   There was no finding of collusion.                   That would be a


 2   different case.


 3                  MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, I don't --

 4   the court certainly did not find that there was no


 5   collusion.   I agree that the court didn't reach --

 6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            No.      It said it wasn't

 7   reaching that question.

 8                  MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    It didn't reach the

 9   question of what they called "tactical maneuvering."

10                  I think that there is a -- a strong argument

11   could be made that Taylor was Herrick's agent; but I

12   don't think that it's critical to find that he was his

13   agent in the very technical sense of the Restatement of

14   Agency.

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            If he -- if he was his

16   agent -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of

17   inquiry -- suppose in the second case Herrick tells him

18   I want you to bring a suit on my behalf.                       He says fine,

19   I'll do that.    He brings that suit.                     And then Taylor

20   says, you know, I also want to bring a suit on my own.

21   And he brings another suit, not as agent for Herrick.

22                  I suppose he could do that, couldn't he?

23   The first would be thrown out because it's Herrick's

24   second suit.    But the -- Taylor's own suit would remain

25   Taylor's own suit, wouldn't it?

 1               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     No.   No, Taylor --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So long as there's no more

 3   collusion or anything else, he's --

 4               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     If Taylor brought

 5   the second suit in his own name and it was found to be

 6   barred by res judicata, a third suit in Taylor's own

 7   name would likewise be barred.

 8               And there's a case that I think illustrates

 9   this point perhaps better than any of those we cited on

10   our brief, unfortunately.          But I think it's helpful --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I hope so.

12               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     -- because --

13               (Laughter.)

14               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Well, Your Honor, I

15   think that it proves the point that has been the sort of

16   underlying concern of many of the questions:                     What

17   happens when you're just shy of a true agency

18   relationship?

19               And the case is United States versus Des

20   Moines Valley Railroad.        It's an Eighth Circuit case, 84

21   F.40 from 1897.   But importantly, this Court quoted it

22   at length in the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific

23   Railroad versus Schendel case --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Did you make your

25   friend on the other side aware that you'd be --

 1                  MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Yes.   Yes, I did,

 2   Your Honor.

 3                  The Schendel case is 270 U.S. 611.                     And they

 4   discuss Des Moines Valley at page 619.

 5                  And what had happened in Des Moines Valley

 6   was that the United States had granted some land to the

 7   State of Iowa, which in turn passed to the railroad,

 8   which in turn sold to one claimant.                       There was another

 9   person who claimed directly from the United States as a

10   homesteader.    There had been litigation between the

11   person claiming via the railroad and the homesteader as

12   to who had title to the land.               And the judgment in State

13   court was adverse to the homesteader.

14                  And what happened later, about 10 years

15   later, was that the United States brought suit to have

16   declared invalid the title of the person claiming via

17   the railroad.    And the district court actually initially

18   questioned whether the United States had standing to

19   bring the case at all.         They viewed it as Fairchild's

20   case.   That was the homeowner -- the homesteader, a

21   little coincidence with this case, which also has a

22   Fairchild.

23                  But the court of appeals specifically said

24   it wasn't deciding whether the United States had

25   standing to bring the case in its own name -- the case

 1   was litigated by the United States attorney -- they

 2   looked to the purpose that the United States sought to

 3   vindicate.   They said that the United States does not

 4   seek to obtain title to this property for itself again.

 5   They are, in a sense, lending their name to allow

 6   Fairchild a second bite at the apple.

 7                Now, there was no control that Fairchild had

 8   over the United States.        Fairchild didn't direct the

 9   United States attorney who was representing the United

10   States.   But the United States had taken up the interest

11   of Fairchild, taking advantage of the fact that it had

12   standing to sue itself --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's a -- it's a standard

14   privity case.   It is privity in reverse.                   I suppose a

15   subsequent owner of real estate is in privity with, and

16   therefore, bound by a judgment concerning the real

17   estate rendered against the prior owner.

18                But it's probably also true that when

19   there's a suit by a later owner, the prior owner cannot

20   then bring in court a claim based upon the same -- the

21   same matters that the subsequent owner relied on.

22                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's up privity instead of

24   down privity.   Wouldn't that --

 1   Honor is reacting to is the reality of the situation

 2   seems to be that there's a sufficient relationship

 3   between these two that they ought to be barred.                   But

 4   there is no section of the Restatement (Second) that

 5   specifically governs this case.             And Petitioner's view,

 6   which is that somehow the Restatement (Second) has

 7   become codification of res judicata law would not permit

 8   it.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There is in the -- in the

10   Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the

11   examples involve a representational relationship that

12   existed at the time of the first litigation.                   There's

13   nothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion

14   would be proper here.

15               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, Your Honor, I

16   agree that the Restatement (Second) does not, for

17   example, state the law which we all know and which

18   Petitioner concedes is the case, and that is that the

23   relation was concluded.

 1   the first case is concerned, no evidence that Taylor

 2   even knew that Herrick was -- Herrick was bringing that

 3   suit?

 4                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    What the evidence

 5   shows is that Herrick made Taylor aware of the -- of the

 6   outcome of the litigation, but we don't have --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But -- and while the

 8   litigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it,

 9   right?

10                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    There's no evidence

11   of that.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Okay.          And is there any

13   evidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA

14   request --

15                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, the --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- after Herrick lost his

17   case?

18                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    The evidence is

19   that Herrick asked Taylor to help him fix the plane, the

20   plane and its restoration being the object of Herrick's

21   own FOIA case.   Taylor, in order to get those documents,

22   which were essential --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that wasn't my

24   question.

 1   restoration of the plane --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            My question,

 3   Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is:             Did Herrick ask Taylor to

 4   file that FOIA suit?      And I think your answer is no.

 5   There's no evidence of that.

 6                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    There is no

 7   evidence that Herrick asked Taylor specifically to file

 8   the --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is there any evidence

10   that Herrick financed the litigation?

11                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    The -- there is no

12   specific evidence of that.          The counsel on the other

13   side --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is there any evidence

15   that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?

16                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, counsel on

17   the other side filed an affidavit that said -- it was

18   very carefully crafted, I think -- that there was no

19   attorney-client relationship with Herrick with respect

20   to this --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            In any case, the decision

22   that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.

23                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No, that's right.

24   What the court of appeals relied on was the fact that

25   Taylor had made Herrick's interest his own and brought


                                       36

 1   the suit in order to vindicate the exact same interests

 2   that Herrick, himself, had already litigated and lost.

 3   And that was to get the documents to restore Herrick's

 4   plane.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So if another member of

 6   the club, let's say another member of the aviation

 7   association who's interested in antique planes, just

 8   files a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who

 9   is -- who knows that Herrick brought a suit and lost?

10   He's just a member of the club.               He doesn't want to help

11   Herrick restore the plane.

12                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No, that person is

13   not barred.   And --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if he's the

15   individual that brought the case with club standing,

16   associational standing?

17                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    I think in -- Your

18   Honor's first question to opposing counsel was such

19   that, yes, I think that if that was the individual whose

20   interest was relied upon to give an association

21   standing, that it would bind the individual whose name

22   and interest was relied on.              And this is in some ways

23   the reverse situation where --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But my question was just

25   a member of the association, whether --

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No, the court of

 2   appeals was clear that just a common membership in an

 3   association or just a common interest would not be

 4   enough.    They -- they distinguished the situation of a

 5   common interest in a -- in the same objective --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But why does there have

 7   to be any interest?      Going back to a question I think

 8   Justice Scalia asked, we're dealing with a most unusual

 9   statute.    You don't have to have any reason for a FOIA

10   request.

11                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    That -- that's

12   true.   We think that that, in fact, makes FOIA even more

13   susceptible to this kind of vexatious litigation that

14   Petitioner seems to think is entirely permissible.                        And

15   the courts have held that the --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me ask a general

17   question here.    Why isn't the defense of stare decisis

18   adequate to take care of all your problems?

19                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, because FOIA

20   allows --

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Repeated requests --

22                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    -- a number of

23   defendants --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- but if they're all the

25   same, wouldn't they say, well, that's the same case we

 1   had last week?

 2               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       Well, FOIA allows

 3   the case to be brought in a number of different venues.

 4   It can be brought in the venue of the -- where the

 5   requestor lives, where the documents are located, or in

 6   the District of Columbia.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:              All right.

 8               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       And so a person

 9   such as Herrick could ask for assistance on his project,

10   the project of rebuilding the plane, of people scattered

11   throughout the country.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Correct, and he's the one

13   who raised the suit.

14               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       And they could

15   maintain it throughout the country.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But did any -- defeat the

17   suit by claiming there was preclusion because of a suit

18   in another jurisdiction, rather than stare decisis?

19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       Well, Your Honor,

20   the fact is that in FOIA, especially an exemption 4

21   case, there are special burdens on the government.                         The

22   government has the burden of proving that the exemption

23   is warranted.    So the plaintiff can just sort of lob

24   anything in there.      The government -- there is the

25   burden of persuading the court in each case that the


                                         39

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exemption is warranted.

 2                 Fairchild, a private party that wants to

 3   protect its own property interests in the trade secret,

 4   is forced to go around the country litigating this over

 5   and over and over again as well.                And the courts that

 6   have considered the question recognize that the

 7   public-right nature of the interest is one that makes

 8   application of the rule particularly appropriate because

 9   both the interests of the individual litigant, the

10   plaintiff, is reduced, but also the opportunity for

11   vexatious relitigation is increased multiple times

12   because of the almost infinite number of potential

13   plaintiffs.

14                 This case was decided by the lower court on

15   the basis of the relationship between Herrick and

16   Taylor.    It was the fact that Taylor had taken up

17   Herrick's own interest.         There was the interest in the

18   project.    The project was the restoration of the plane.

19   Herrick owned the plane.          Herrick had brought suit based

20   on that interest and lost.           He asked Taylor to help him

21   in that project.    Taylor then brings the suit to get the

22   same documents for the same purpose.

23                 And we think that the U.S. versus Des Moines

24   Valley Railroad case is an example where, just shy

25   perhaps of an actual agency relationship, because


                                        40

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there's no control in Des Moines Valley, that still the

 2   fact that the second litigant has volunteered to take

 3   their name to, in a sense, take advantage of the fact

 4   they have independent standing --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Counsel, you have described

 6   for us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your

 7   proposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow.

 8               You're going to solve just the case of, you

 9   know, two people building an airplane.                   You agree,

10   anybody else in the association can file a lawsuit.

11   Anybody else in the United States can file a lawsuit,

12   even if they're not in the association.

13               It seems to me that, you know, in order to

14   cut off an eyebrow, I'm not willing to make a whole lot

15   of incursion upon our traditional rules of who's bound

16   by a lawsuit.

17               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, Your Honor --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why should we stretch for

19   that?

20               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    We are not

21   advocating a broad rule.        We, in fact --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.

23               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    -- think that's one

24   of the virtues of our argument:              That where there is a

25   document that is of true public interest such that


                                      41

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   multiple individuals on entirely independent grounds


 2   might well seek it, they would not be barred.


 3               But where a document has commercial value


 4   like this one does to Mr. Herrick, so that he can


 5   restore his plane without going to the incredible

 6   expense of developing another manner to prove to the FAA

 7   the airworthiness of that plane, there is that

 8   commercial value that gives him the incentive to try to

 9   relitigate over and over again.               And on Petitioner's

10   view, as long as he stops just shy of an agency

11   relationship, he can do that throughout the country.

12   And this is --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              That sounds like --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is this an approach

15   that only applies in FOIA cases?                I would assume in

16   every other case you have the normal Article III

17   requirements of injury, which limits exactly who can

18   sue.

19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Well, the rule is a

20   broader rule.    And we've pointed out that it has in

21   common with the rule with respect to co-beneficiaries

22   that existed since the 1800s at the very latest, the

23   rule as stated in section 48 of the Restatement, which

24   is an example, a counter-example, Justice Ginsburg, to

25   your question about whether it always had to be a


                                        42

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   pre-existing legal relationship, because section 48

 2   deals with a particular situation where there are

 3   multiple individuals who can claim for personal injury

 4   of one of them.    And the section is stated in terms of

 5   another person, not a family member.                     And the commentary

 6   to this section makes clear that although most

 7   situations where it would apply would be family members,

 8   it also applies to -- and I want to quote it:                     "A de

 9   facto connection may sometimes suffice as well as a

10   formally valid one."

11                So the law of --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I'm not sure what the

13   hypothetical is.    I mean it is certainly not the case

14   that -- let's say you have a whole busload of people who

15   get injured in the same accident.                 Plaintiff one sues

16   and loses.   Two sues and loses.              Three is not precluded.

17   Four is not precluded.

18                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     But it recognizes

19   there could be a close-enough relationship between the

20   two such that the purposes of the rule would be

21   satisfied, but there is no legal, familial relationship.

22   And --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And if all that has been

24   proved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said:

25   We're not going to look into what they call strategic


                                        43

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   whatever.

 2                 We're going to take it just as it is, with

 3   none of -- no showing that these two are in cahoots.

 4                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    They didn't need to

 5   because of the fact that Taylor had voluntarily taken up

 6   Herrick's interests to get a second bite at the

 7   litigatory apple, as the First Circuit put it.

 8                 And it is not the fact, as Petitioner would

 9   argue, that every time another person has an individual,

10   standing right to sue under a statute, that it means

11   that that person necessarily gets to relitigate where a

12   person with whom they have a close relationship such as

13   this has already litigated and lost.

14                 And so, getting back to Your Honor's

15   question --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is sort of a

17   totality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right.

18                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            We look at the whole thing,

20   and we say, you know, close enough relationship.                     It is

21   not close enough; close enough.               You need a better rule

22   than that for something that, you know, is a threshold

23   issue in a case.

24                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, Your Honor,

25   it is interesting that the restatement with respect to

 1   the third category in the reply brief -- they called it

 2   the third category of control perhaps.                      It is described

 3   in the restatement in comment to section 62 as where the

 4   person falls short of becoming a party but which justly

 5   should result in his being denied an opportunity to

 6   relitigate.

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's just as bad.         You're

 8   absolutely right.     That's just as bad.

 9                  MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    That is the nature

10   -- that is the nature of res judicata principles.                      That

11   it is not:    Can you avoid this by avoiding the legal

12   technicalities?    It is the substance of the relationship

13   that counts.

22   question that you posed earlier regarding privity and

23   what it really means, because that's what has given

24   rise, I think, to all of these vexing hypotheticals and

25   to your concern about this being nothing more than a


                                         45

 1   completely freewheeling, totality-of-the circumstances

 2   test.

 3                The problem, I think, that you're

 4   confronting is that you don't have the usual place that

 5   you point your foot whenever you try to develop a

 6   categorical rule.    You don't have a statutory text.       You

 7   don't have a constitutional text.

 8                This is a Federal common-law issue; and, as

 9   this Court unanimously acknowledged in 1996, what our

10   notions are of privity are changing, and they continue

11   to change.

12                In 1942, when the first restatement was

13   issued, "privity" was defined as control, or successor

14   in interest, or representation.

15                In 1982, when the second restatement was

16   issued, "privity" was defined generally as

17   representation, legal relationships, or that section 62

18   category that Mr. Hallward-Driemeier just mentioned,

19   which we can call "shenanigans."

20                The notion of privity is underpinned in

21   every single one of those contexts by a couple of basic

22   inquiries, and this is what makes it something much more

23   confined than a freewheeling,

24   totality-of-the-circumstances test.

25                The inquiries are:              What are the

 1   relationships between these two litigants, these two

 2   serial litigants, and how have they conducted themselves

 3   in this litigation?

 4                 And this in turn, I think, gets to the

 5   dialogue that, Justice Souter, you were having with my

 6   colleagues.   Your first question was -- posited the

 7   situation where one plaintiff sues and loses and comes

 8   to another and says:        Please try again for me.

 9                 That is precisely this case.                And we don't

10   have to get into --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was no showing that

12   Herrick ever asked Taylor -- well, there is a showing

13   that they're interested in rebuilding this plane or

14   restoring the plane.        But we don't have -- and the D.C.

15   Circuit said it was not relevant to its analysis.                 Yes,

16   I would totally agree with you if we have a recruiting

17   situation, if we have a financing situation.                 But the

18   D.C. Circuit said:      Well, that's irrelevant.

19                 MS. STETSON:         I agree with you the D.C.

20   Circuit didn't find collusion, looking at Petitioner's

21   appendix 17-A at two things:              The timing of the suit and

22   the sharing of discovery.            But we don't need to get into

23   the evidence of collusion because what the D.C. Circuit

24   concluded as a predicate finding for its close-

25   relationship holding was that there was a request from


                                         47

 1   Mr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to assist in the repair of his

 2   plane.

 3                And you can see this play out very tellingly

 4   at joint appendix 31 to 32.             If you look there, this is

 5   the motion to allow discovery.              Joint appendix 31 is

 6   where Mr. Taylor relays at length the Tenth Circuit

 7   argument and the Tenth Circuit ruling.

 8                The first full paragraph on joint appendix

 9   32 begins:   "Mr. Herrick has now requested Mr. Taylor to

10   assist in the repair of his plane."

11                Now, Mr. Herrick, you can see from the first

12   exhibit to Fairchild's summary judgment motion in

13   district court, page 161, Mr. Herrick has six full-time

14   mechanics.   He lives in Jackson Hole.                  His mechanics

15   work in Minneapolis.      He doesn't need Mr. Taylor, who

16   lives in Iowa, to actually, physically assist with the

17   repair of his plane.

18                What he needs is someone with whom he

19   doesn't have an extant employment relationship, who

20   lives in a different circuit, to get those documents.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Look, I concede we can all

22   see where you're going, but isn't the problem this:                     In

23   effect, you're asking us to infer a finding of fact, and

24   we're not the trial court.

25                You've raised a good circumstantial


                                       48

 1   suspicion case; but, either because it wasn't raised by

 2   your predecessor counsel as well or because the -- for

 3   some reason the district court just would not buy it,

 4   that's the -- the conclusion that you want us to draw

 5   isn't before us.   And I don't see that we're the

 6   appropriate court to draw it.

 7               MS. STETSON:         Two responses, Your Honor:

 8   The first is that conclusion was precisely the

 9   conclusion that was drawn by the D.C. Circuit on the

10   close-relationship point.

11               If you look at joint appendix 17-A, the

12   conclusion on close relationship was predicated on,

13   among other things, the critical fact of the request

14   from Mr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to repair the plane.

15   That is what made --

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.      But at no point did

17   the D.C. Circuit or the district court, as I understand

18   it, say that request, in effect, was a request to

19   relitigate this matter so that we both, the owner of the

20   plane and the repairer of the plane, would have what I

21   was seeking in my first lawsuit.

22               They never actually crossed the line and

23   drew that conclusion; did they?

24               MS. STETSON:         The district court, in fact,

25   held precisely that.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What did it --

 2                 MS. STETSON:        In joint appendix 35-A -- in

 3   Petitioner's appendix 35-A the district court concluded

 4   as a factual finding that there was deliberate

 5   maneuvering based on two things.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's out of the case

 7   because the court of appeals said:                  We do not need to

 8   determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering.

 9   We do not do so.

10                 MS. STETSON:        Well, I'm going to resist you

11   slightly, Justice Ginsburg.              I'm not sure that that is

12   the case.   It is very curious.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It could be remanded.        It

14   could be remanded with instructions that the collusion

15   question is still open.         Prove it.           It hasn't been

16   proved.

17                 MS. STETSON:        What the district court found

18   constituted collusion was identical interests and the

19   request.    What the D.C. circuit found did not constitute

20   collusion was the timing of the FOIA action and the

21   sharing of discovery.

22                 So they're operating on the collusion front

23   on two completely parallel paths.                 But on the --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what the opinion

25   said is to review the bidding.               There is record evidence


                                        50

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that:   One, Taylor and Herrick had identical interests;

 2   two, Taylor's interest was adequately represented in

 3   Herrick; three, Herrick and Taylor had a close working

 4   relationship relative to these successive cases.

 5                And that's enough.             That's enough to show

 6   collusion.

 7                MS. STETSON:        The discussion that precedes

 8   the reviewing of the bidding references with respect to

 9   the close-relationship finding the request from

10   Mr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to assist in the repair of his

11   plane, the request that is featured in joint appendix 32

12   as the preceding factor to the filing of the FOIA

13   action.

14                And I grant you, that does make this case

15   quite unique.   It does make it quite similar to the 1897

16   case from the the Eighth Circuit, and I think it is

17   quite telling that we haven't found another analogue.

18                That doesn't mean that this doesn't fall

19   well within the wheelhouse of privity cases that this

20   Court is quite comfortable with.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what about the

22   associational cases:      The association brings a suit in

23   the interests of the members?             Are those members bound?

24                MS. STETSON:        Well, it depends on -- it

25   depends on a couple of things, Mr. Chief Justice, but


                                       51

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the first thing it depends on is a finding that the

 2   interests of the association and of the members is

 3   identical.   Not just common, not just --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Association standing

 5   cases we talk about germane, right?

 6                MS. STETSON:        Right.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is that enough?

 8                MS. STETSON:        I think -- I think the

 9   interests need to -- to be identical.                   I'm not sure that

10   it's enough just to have a common cause.

11                The interests were found in this case to be

12   identical because one was literally factually derivative

13   of the other.   And I want to make a point clear about

14   the difference between FOIA standing such as it is, and

15   the interest that's being represented in this case.

16                The fact that Mr. Taylor, after learning of

17   Mr. Herrick's defeat, decided to perfect his FOIA rights

18   and sue in Federal court gave him standing.                  That was

19   all it gave him.   What it did not do is give him a free

20   pass from a res judicata inquiry.                And Justice Scalia

21   and Justice Ginsburg, to your points about FOIA not

22   requiring a motive, that's absolutely right at the

23   agency level.

24                But at the point where a disappointed FOIA

25   requestor comes into court and asks to be heard on the


                                       52

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   same claim representing somebody else's interest, on its

 2   face, at joint appendix 32, that's the point where the

 3   judicial doctrine of res judicata kicks in.

 4                That's --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Anyone --anyone in this

 6   audience, and anyone in the association would be a

 7   proper FOIA plaintiff; is that right?

 8                MS. STETSON:         That is right.          That is

 9   absolutely right.    The reason that Mr. Taylor is barred

10   is not just because he's asking for these same

11   documents.   These are incredibly unusual documents; they

12   don't have great public appeal; but the reason he's

13   barred is because Mr. Herrick requested his assistance

14   in the repair of the airplane.               Mr. Taylor sought the

15   same documents for exactly the same reason to be used to

16   exactly the same end purpose.              That should -- I think --

17   give the Petitioner a great deal of comfort in this

18   regard.

19                We are not advocating nor is the government,

20   a privity rule that is going to result in the widespread

21   preclusion of FOIA plaintiffs who seeks the same

22   documents for independent reasons; but when someone

23   comes to the Court pressing someone else's interests,

24   that is a square privity issue, and he should be barred.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 2                  Ms. Rosenbaum, four minutes.


 3           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA H. ROSENBAUM,


 4                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 5                  MS. ROSENBAUM:         Thank you.

 6                  First, I want to address the two cases

 7   brought up by the government.               In Des Moines Valley

 8   Railroad that was someone who had the right to the land

 9   because of a grant from the government.                   In that case,

10   specifically, the Court pointed out that the

11   government -- that Congress had passed a law that had

12   the government give up all interest, that showed that

13   the government had given up all interests in the land.

14   And in the Rock Island Railroad case, that had to do

15   with a beneficiary and the administrator of an estate.

16                  These are legal relationships that give rise

17   to privity, and that's exactly the point.                   There are

18   relationships that do give rise to privity, but the

19   relationship between Taylor and Herrick is not one of

20   them.

21                  The government also pointed out that FOIA

22   requestors can bring suit in different venues, and that

23   is the case.     They can bring it in the District of

24   Columbia, where the records are, or where they are.                     But

25   as they pointed out, that is the way that FOIA is set


                                         54

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   up.    Congress allowed requestors to bring suits in

 2   different places, and that's not the way Congress needed

 3   to establish FOIA.      It could have made one place the

 4   sole venue for bringing suit under FOIA but it did not.

 5   And --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if two people

 7   get together who want the same documents for the same

 8   purpose, which is they think they're going to make money

 9   off of it.    And they say which ever gets it we'll share

10   with the other and we'll split the money we're going to

11   get?

12                 MS. ROSENBAUM:          So they bring --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Separate -- separate

14   suits, separate requests, separate suits.                  They just

15   want to double their chances of getting the documents,

16   but they agree to split.           They think they're going to

17   make a hundred dollars off of this and agree to split it

18   50-50, regardless of who wins.

19                 MS. ROSENBAUM:          I think what would have to

20   be looked at there is control or representation.                  But

21   again, the facts here do not show that there is any

22   agreement between Taylor and Herrick to -- there's no

23   agreement either to repair the plane; but more

24   specifically, there are no agreements to bring this

25   lawsuit.


                                         55

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               So this Court does not need to reach the

 2   question of exactly what sort of agreement would lead to

 3   preclusion, and the problem with the lower court's

 4   decision here is that they did just look at a grab bag

 5   of amorphous factors to hold Taylor bound.               They talk

 6   about a close relationship without it being the sort of

 7   relationship under which one party is representing the

 8   other or under which they have a legal relationship.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Ms. Stetson said that the

10   district court unlike the court of appeals, did find

11   collusion, and she referred to a page that I didn't

12   check.

13               MS. ROSENBAUM:         The district court did think

14   that there was tactical maneuvering happening here.               But

15   the court of appeals specifically said that the district

16   court had erred in concluding that there had been an

17   agreement between them.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you think we need

19   to remand this for consideration of whether or not there

20   was an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from

21   the court of appeals opinion isn't enough?

22               As I understand, the court of appeals didn't

23   think an agreement was necessary.               So regardless of what

24   the district court said, al thought that was an issue

25   that was litigated, it was not passed on by the court of


                                      56

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   appeals.

 2                MS. ROSENBAUM:         Yes.       The court could remand

 3   it and then the district court would have the discretion

 4   to allow the case to go forward as it saw fit.

 5                And the problem - the problem with the

 6   factors looked at by the lower courts, with -- basing

 7   privity on just amorphous facts and basically just

 8   having courts check their gut about whether or not that

 9   relationship is sufficient, is that it ends up with

10   people being found in privity when they did not actually

11   have their right to be heard, the way Taylor did not

12   here.   Instead, privity should be based on underlaying

13   rationales that protect the litigant's right to be heard

14   and ensure that they do have their day in court.

15                Unless there are any further questions.
