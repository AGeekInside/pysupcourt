 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL NACHMANOFF

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. NACHMANOFF:                Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              Derrick Kimbrough's case is about what a

11   district court may consider when imposing sentence in

12   conformity with Section 3553(a).

13              That statute directs sentencing courts to do

14   exactly what Judge Jackson did in this case.                  He

15   properly calculated and considered the advisory

16   guideline range, the Sentencing Commission's reports,

17   Mr. Kimbrough's personal history and background, and the

18   offense itself, as directed by the statute. He then made

19   case-specific findings to impose an appropriate

20   sentence, and he did not make any categorical

21   determinations.

22              The Fourth Circuit reversed, applying a

23   per se rule prohibiting disagreement with the crack

24   cocaine guideline.      The government, on the other hand,

25   argues that Congress has implicitly directed sentencing


                                          3

 1   courts to adhere to the crack guidelines.

 2              Both of these positions are wrong.

 3              With respect to the Fourth Circuit, the

 4   Fourth Circuit applied a rigid rule that prohibited any

 5   disagreement with the crack guideline, which is

 6   determined solely by drug type and quantity. They then

 7   prohibited the imposition of any sentence outside the

 8   guideline range, either above it or below it, unless the

 9   court identified facts specific to the defendant or the

10   offense.

11              This ruling is inconsistent with the Court's

12   holdings in Cunningham and Rita, which hold that the

13   courts must be free to disagree with policies.

14              Finally, the Fourth Circuit required that

15   those facts be atypical, which mirrors the exact

16   language that was excised in 3553(b)(1).

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:                Could the Congress have

18   mandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth

19   Circuit used here?

20              MR. NACHMANOFF:                Your Honor, Congress can

21   certainly speak explicitly through its statutes to

22   impose further refinements on the penalty structure that

23   it set out in 841.

24              Section 841, on its face, does no more than

25   set mandatory minimums and maximums at two triggering


                                          4

 1   quantities.    If Congress wanted to specify further

 2   triggering quantities which would cabin the discretion

 3   of sentencing courts, they could do so, but they have

 4   not done so and there is no canon of statutory

 5   construction that the government identifies or that I'm

 6   aware of that would justify the notion of the implicit

 7   binding directive.

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:          If Congress made a finding

 9   that crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed

10   a statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every

11   district judge shall treat cases involving these two

12   substances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth

13   Amendment problem with that?               Or do you think every

14   district judge gets the right to make that policy

15   decision individually?

16                 MR. NACHMANOFF:             Justice Alito, Congress

17   certainly can cabin the discretion of judges.                  But once

18   they set a floor and a ceiling, pursuant to this Court's

19   remedial holding in Booker, judges must be free to

20   consider the entire range of punishment.                  And Booker

21   relies on the notion that the Guidelines are now fully

22   advisory and, therefore, judges without having to

23   identify specific facts have to have the discretion to

24   disagree with policies or identify things unique to the

25   case in order to fashion an appropriate punishment.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:             What's your answer simply

 2   to the very simple argument that because the floor was

 3   set on the assumption of a 100 to 1 ratio, set by

 4   Congress, that any other sentencing assumption,

 5   regardless of the particular justifications in a given

 6   case, is simply incoherent with the statutory scheme and

 7   for that reason should be regarded as unreasonable?

 8              MR. NACHMANOFF:             Yes, Your Honor.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:             It is the coherence problem

10   that is bothering us.

11              MR. NACHMANOFF:             Yes.     There are several

12   answers to that question, Justice Souter.               The first is

13   that this Court has recognized with the same statute

14   which has the same structure that the government argues

15   can only logically be understood one way, that with

16   regard to the weight for LSD in the case of Neal versus

17   United States, it is perfectly appropriate for there to

18   be two different methods of calculating weight for

19   purposes of punishment.       The Guidelines calculate weight

20   based on a presumed weight of the combination of the LSD

21   and the blotter paper or the carrier medium.               And the

22   statute defines the method for calculating the mandatory

23   minimum by the combined weight of the LSD and the

24   blotter paper, regardless of whether it is heavy or

25   whether it is light.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But is that an argument for

 2   saying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of

 3   incoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do

 4   it across the board?      I mean, there is still an argument

 5   here on the merits regardless of Neal that there is an

 6   incoherence between the minimum and the kind of

 7   discretion that you're talking about.

 8              MR. NACHMANOFF:             Well, Your Honor, I think

 9   what Neal reflects is that there's no implicit binding

10   policy directive in 841 itself that requires either the

11   Commission or sentencing courts to follow in lock step

12   on a graduated proportionate scheme, whatever it is that

13   Congress decided with respect to two specific triggers

14   should be the case.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Did we have the cliff

16   problem in the LSD case?

17              MR. NACHMANOFF:             Yes, Your Honor.        The Court

18   recognized that, in fact, cliffs are the inevitable

19   results of mandatory minimums.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:             So we are in the same boat,

21   then, you say with Neal in that respect, too?

22              MR. NACHMANOFF:             Yes, and Your Honor, if I

23   could also point out that there really is a myth here

24   with regard to the 100 to 1 ratio as it stands now and

25   as the Commission created it in 1987.                  The 100 to 1


                                       7

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ratio describes the relative weight of crack cocaine and

 2   powder cocaine with regard to the levels in the

 3   sentencing table; so that if you compare, for example,

 4   the 10-year mandatory minimum trigger, 50 grams of

 5   crack, that gets you to a level 32 in the sentencing

 6   table and it requires 5 kilos of powder cocaine or 5,000

 7   grams.   That's the 100 to 1 ratio.

 8               And it is true that if one compares the low

 9   end of that table -- 5 kilos to 50 grams, you end up

10   with the same punishment, or likewise, if you compare

11   the top of the range, 15 kilos to a 150 grams.

12               But the way the guidelines have been

13   written, there are a multitude of ratios that get

14   applied right now and were applied in the pre-Booker

15   guidelines scheme.

16               In other words, 14.9 kilos of powder

17   compared to 51 grams of crack results in a 292 to 1

18   ratio.   You get the exact same punishment, it is a level

19   32.

20               Likewise if you flip it, and you compare 149

21   grams of crack to 5 kilos of powder cocaine, you are

22   still within a level 32, and it is a 34 to 1 ratio.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Maybe that was wrong.

24   Maybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to

25   be faithful to the Congressional determination, should

 1   have done it quite proportionately.                      I mean, I'm not

 2   hung up on what the Sentencing Commission said.                      I'm

 3   hung up on what the courts should do now.

 4                 MR. NACHMANOFF:            I agree, Justice Scalia.

 5   And of course, the Sentencing Commission taken to the

 6   ultimate extreme would have had to have a proportionate

 7   sentencing table by gram or fraction of a gram in order

 8   to preserve the 100 to 1 ratio, which simply points out

 9   in combination with Neal the fact that this was a choice

10   made by the Commission, a choice, by the way, not

11   grounded on any empirical evidence or any other reason

12   other than what 841 originally indicated.

13                 It could have been done differently.                   It is

14   done differently with regard to other drugs in 841, such

15   as LSD or such as marijuana plants, which have a

16   different method for calculation under the Guidelines as

17   they do for purposes of mandatory minimums.                     And, of

18   course, what that means is that there is no implicit

19   directive, which is the only rational --

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That just goes back to

21   Justice Scalia's point.         There may very well be an

22   implicit Congressional directive that the Commission did

23   not follow.

24                 MR. NACHMANOFF:            Well -- Your Honor,

25   Congress has a method --

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           It did not reject them, you

 2   are saying?    So, therefore, in effect, there was a

 3   Congressional ratification?

 4                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Well, Congress did not

 5   reject the original table that was created by the

 6   Commission in 1987.      That is correct.                But Congress also

 7   did not at any time in Section 994, which is where it

 8   has given other explicit directions to the Commission to

 9   fashion guidelines in a particular way, say anything

10   about how to fashion the punishment for crack cocaine or

11   any of the other drugs in Section 841.

12                 So Congress understands if it wants to give

13   further guidance to the Commission how to do it.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Nachmanoff, in the

15   absence of anything further from Congress, and accepting

16   your argument that there's no -- that the Guidelines did

17   not have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the

18   mandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I

19   see that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs

20   are a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for

21   powder as high as for crack?

22                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Justice Ginsburg, our rule

23   certainly contemplates the fact that there may be

24   circumstances in which district judges may come to

25   conclusions about the appropriate sentence, taking into

 1   consideration the purposes of sentencing and the

 2   parsimony provision --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But if we throw out the

 4   100 to 1, what is the range open to the district

 5   judge -- hundred to one is okay, but I have to use

 6   the -- I'm going to use the crack for both?                 Or say

 7   there is a difference between the two, so I'm going to

 8   set it at 20 to 1 and another judge 5 to 1.

 9                 What is -- are all those reasonable within

10   the position that you take in this case?                 Would all

11   those have to pass muster at the court of appeals level?

12                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Well those certainly are

13   positions that judges could take.                 In this particular

14   case, the judge was presented with information that led

15   the court to conclude that reducing the sentence for

16   crack based on the Commission's overwhelming empirical

17   evidence and penological evidence and the statistical

18   evidence that was submitted was relevant to the various

19   factors in 3553(a), in particular the purposes of

20   sentencing.    And that the Guidelines would not be

21   appropriate and, therefore, a lower sentence would be

22   appropriate.

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What if the Fourth Circuit

24   sees a number of absolutely identical cases exactly like

25   Mr. Kimbrough's, and it is apparent in one, the

 1   sentencing judge either explicitly or implicitly has

 2   used a 1 to 1, and the next one used 20 to 1, the next

 3   one has used 50 to 1, the next one has used 80 to 1, and

 4   the next one has used 100 to 1, what is it to do under

 5   reasonableness review?

 6                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           The court of appeals has

 7   been given explicit instruction by this Court that it is

 8   to review all of those sentences under an abuse of

 9   discretion, which means that its job is not to

10   substitute its judgment for the lower court.

11                 And if those sentencing courts have

12   articulated reasons and have relied on relevant and

13   reliable --

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But the cases are absolutely

15   identical.    Everything is absolutely identical about

16   them, except for the sentences.               Can't introduce any new

17   variables.    What is the court of appeals to do?

18                 This is not a hypothetical situation,

19   really.   This is what courts of appeals who have to see

20   dozens of these cases have to do.                 There's a policy

21   question there.    How severely should crack be treated?

22   What is the substantive review that the court of appeals

23   is supposed to provide in that situation?

24                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Justice Alito, sentencing

25   courts now are free to consider the full range of


                                        12

 1   punishment and to consider the purposes of sentencing in

 2   both issue-specific to the defendant and the offense and

 3   also general policy issues.           That is the clear holding

 4   of the Booker remedial opinion and reaffirmed in

 5   Cunningham and in Rita.       When judges have that full

 6   discretion to consider the guidelines and follow the

 7   mandates of 3553(a), but then impose a sentence that

 8   meets the purposes of sentencing and is consistent with

 9   the parsimony provision, there may well be judges that

10   come to different conclusions, as your hypothetical

11   posits, about what people with similar or even identical

12   records and identical circumstances may -- may do.

13              I would say that the reality is in the

14   lower courts no two cases are alike, and so there are

15   always reasons for judges to make reasoned distinctions

16   in imposing sentences, even where, for example, the drug

17   type and quantity is identical.

18              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I take it your answer

19   is that all or most of those cases would be affirmed

20   under reasonableness -- under abuse of discretion

21   review?

22              MR. NACHMANOFF:            If -- yes.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:            If you were representing

24   the one who got the 80 to 1 ratio you would file an

25   amicus brief, no error in judgment?

 1                 MR. NACHMANOFF:            Well, Justice Souter, if

 2   the court followed the procedural requirements of

 3   3553(a), if the information was subjected to the

 4   adversarial process, and if the court imposed a sentence

 5   consistent with the parsimony clause, it would be hard

 6   to imagine a basis upon which to object.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The basis is that that

 8   would be the end of the Guidelines.                       I mean, that --

 9   every judge has his own view of policy and there is a

10   vast range.    No   point having advice -- I mean, fine,

11   but I don't think this Court said it, and I think that

12   the test is supposed to be reasonableness, and I think

13   3553(a) does have a lot of instructions, and one of the

14   major thrusts is follow the Guidelines.                      It doesn't make

15   them mandatory.     But they're in there.

16                 All right,       so the problem for me is just

17   what Justice Alito was saying:                Is there a path here

18   between saying, well, judge, leaving everything special

19   about your case out of it -- we're only talking about a

20   judge who says there's nothing special about my case --

21   I disagree with the policy of the commission.

22                 In such a case, is there a choice between

23   saying that no matter what the commission says, the

24   court of appeals must insist that their district judges

25   follow in terms of a policy; and the opposite, which is


                                         14

 1   to say they don't have to do anything that the

 2   commission says, because the commission is always

 3   choosing among reasonable choices.                  Very rarely -- maybe

 4   you have one in this case -- but very rarely is it

 5   totally unreasonable.

 6                 How do we thread the channel?

 7                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Justice Breyer, the Booker

 8   remedial opinion makes it crystal-clear that to avoid

 9   the Sixth Amendment problem with the mandatory

10   Guidelines, judges must be free to disagree with the

11   Guidelines.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           To the extent that it's

13   reasonable, and where we're talking about individual

14   cases we've already said, given the history of our legal

15   system, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion

16   to the district judge.

17                 Now we're talking about what's reasonable in

18   the context of 3553(a); and I don't think Booker says

19   one way or the other on that, nor I do believe Rita says

20   one way or the other.

21                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Your Honor, 3553(a) is

22   driven by the purposes of sentencing.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Driven by a Congress that

24   wrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate

25   matter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the


                                        15

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   initial draft added the word "mandatory."               So the

 2   history of 3553(a) is a history of a statute that is

 3   seeking uniformity through guidelines.

 4                At least that's my view of it.              And for

 5   purposes of the question, which is an important question

 6   to me, let's assume that.

 7                MR. NACHMANOFF:           Well, Your Honor, the

 8   appellate courts still have a role to play and that role

 9   is to ensure that the sentencing courts have followed

10   the mandate of 3553(a), and that --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Indeed, it may be quite

12   impossible to achieve uniformity through advisory

13   guidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory.

14                (Laughter.)

15                MR. NACHMANOFF:           That very well may be,

16   Justice Scalia.   In -- this Court even in the remedial

17   opinion in Booker recognized that uniformity as it was

18   understood in the pre-Booker days would be reduced, and

19   that there might be more sentences that have different

20   results --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:           In other words, I'm

22   assuming now you have not -- you don't have a good

23   answer to my question.       You're saying either we have to

24   make it unconstitutional, which I don't think they are,

25   or you have to say anything goes, and that my question

 1   has no answer in your view?

 2                 MR. NACHMANOFF:            Well, Justice Breyer, your

 3   question certainly is a difficult one.                     Let me say this:

 4   With regard to uniformity, Congress has the power to

 5   make sentences more uniform.              They can do it in a

 6   variety of ways and they have done it where they've

 7   thought it was important.            They haven't done it with

 8   regard to the 100 to 1 ratio beyond the mandatory

 9   minimum or the statutory maximum.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you don't say -- you

11   don't say anything goes.           I mean, the hypothetical that

12   Justice Alito gave is -- is easy, only because Congress

13   has created the 100 to 1 ratio as presumably reasonable.

14   If Congress enacted it as a statute, it has to be

15   reasonable.

16                 So that enables you to say anything from 1

17   to 1 to 100 to 1 is reasonable.                But your position is

18   not anything goes.      It's anything that's reasonable

19   goes.

20                 MR. NACHMANOFF:            That is correct, Justice

21   Scalia.   And --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And is "reasonable"

23   defined as an appropriate interpretation of

24   congressional intent, or does "reasonable" mean

25   something else, like a just sentence?                     What -- how do we

 1   define "reasonable"?

 2              MR. NACHMANOFF:              Well, Your Honor, I think

 3   that that --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Whether or not the

 5   commission and then the district judge reasonably

 6   interpret the congressional intent, and if the

 7   commission reasonably interprets the congressional

 8   intent is the district court allowed to disregard that?

 9              MR. NACHMANOFF:              Sentencing courts must be

10   able to disagree with the commission's conclusions about

11   congressional intent.

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Assuming the commission

13   was reasonable, can they still disagree?

14              MR. NACHMANOFF:              Yes, Your Honor.      I think

15   that is the essence of the Booker remedial holding, that

16   in order to cure the constitutional problem with

17   mandatory guidelines, judges must be free to reject,

18   must be free to reject those guidelines.                 And in fact

19   Cunningham makes that clear, that in the California

20   determinate sentencing area it was the inability of

21   judges to impose a higher sentence based on the general

22   objectives of sentencing, as opposed to particular

23   factors or circumstances in aggravation, that made it

24   unconstitutional.    So whether the commission concluded

25   that the congressional intent was to import the 100 to 1

 1   ratio or not -- and clearly there is no statutory

 2   construction that can be inferred or understood from 841

 3   by itself.    It is not explicit and the government

 4   concedes that.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So in your case you ask us

 6   to establish the proposition that in any case, a

 7   sentencing judge must always be free to disregard a

 8   reasonable interpretation of the Commission, a

 9   reasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I interrupt before you

11   answer.   The question isn't whether they can justify a

12   reasonable.    It's whether they can justify not following

13   one that creates unwarranted disparities within the

14   meaning of the statute.

15                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           That's -- that's correct,

16   Justice Stevens.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You would go further --

18   you would go further and -- and submit to us the

19   proposition that I -- that I just stated?

20                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Well, Your Honor, if -- if

21   I understood it correctly, the question is whether or

22   not when the commission concludes this is what Congress

23   intended --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Reasonably.

25                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           -- reasonably -- does it

 1   somehow imbue that particular guideline with some

 2   special binding nature.         And my response would be that

 3   the Booker remedial opinion makes it clear that the

 4   Guidelines as a whole must be viewed as advisory.                      The

 5   government tries to argue that if some Guidelines are

 6   special and are binding, and others are advisory,

 7   there's no Sixth Amendment problem.                      But that ignores

 8   the fundamental principle of the Booker remedial hearing

 9   -- holding, which is that the Guidelines as a whole must

10   be advisory and judges must be able to disagree with

11   them.    And of course here is perhaps the paradigmatic

12   example of a time when the commission's original

13   guidelines got it wrong, didn't further the purposes of

14   sentencing; and, of course, they themselves have made

15   that conclusion, and for sentencing purposes --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But -- and I take it your

17   submission is that the district court must be able to

18   make the determination that the commission's policy is

19   to be disregarded in every case to come before the

20   court?

21                MR. NACHMANOFF:            Well, Your Honor, 3553(a)

22   requires individualized sentencing.                      There's no question

23   that judges are required to follow in every case the

24   mandates of 3553(a) and to calculate the advisory

25   Guidelines correctly.

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              Now, there is no reason why judges cannot in

 2   a certain class of cases conclude that the Guideline

 3   gets it wrong; that it overstates the seriousness of the

 4   offense; that it creates an unwarranted disparity; and

 5   that they are going to impose a sentence outside of that

 6   guideline range.

 7                    That does not in any way remove the

 8   requirement that they subject every sentencing to the

 9   adversarial process to give the parties the opportunity

10   to convince them that the guidelines should be followed,

11   or not followed, or to be reconsidered.

12                    JUSTICE GINSBURG:                And Mr. Nachmanoff, I

13   think that you are agreeing, although you don't want to

14   come right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point;

15   that is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to

16   one is open to the district judge; and within that

17   range, there is no abuse of discretion.

18              MR. NACHMANOFF:              Your Honor, I certainly

19   agree that that full range is available to the

20   sentencing court.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Only because Congress has

22   said 100 to 1.   That strikes me as utterly unreasonable.

23   But if Congress has said it, it can't be unreasonable.

24   That's what makes that an easy hypothetical, but that

25   would not be the normal case, that a 100 to 1 disparity


                                        21

 1   wouldn't be -- would not be unreasonable.

 2               MR. NACHMANOFF:            Yes, Your Honor.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             In any case, your answer

 4   is anything from what Congress has said, down to one to

 5   one, would be a reasonable sentence that would be --

 6   that would pass muster on appeal because it is not an

 7   abuse of discretion.

 8               MR. NACHMANOFF:            Well, if I can be clear,

 9   Justice Ginsburg, sentencing courts must have available

10   to them the full range of punishment as defined by

11   Congress.   And that range, for purposes of 841, are

12   broad ranges based on triggering quantities at 5 grams

13   and 50 grams for crack cocaine.              Within those ranges, as

14   long as the court follows the requirements of 3553(a),

15   considers all the purposes of sentencing, engages in an

16   individualized sentencing process, and relies on

17   relevant and reliable information, there would be no

18   basis under abuse of discretion review to reverse the

19   sentencing court in that instance.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you've given me a

21   bunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy

22   for a district judge to say:            Here's my laundry list;

23   and I'm going to go through every one of them; but in

24   the end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's

25   what I'm going to impose.

 1                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Well, again, Your Honor,

 2   Congress certainly has the power to cabin that

 3   discretion.    They just need to do it explicitly, and

 4   they have not done so.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So -- Congress not having

 6   done that, then the range is open to the district

 7   judges, 100 to 1 to 1 to 1.

 8                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           That's correct, Your Honor.

 9   If if may reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

12                 ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

13                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14                 MR. DREEBEN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the court:

16                 The question in this case is essentially,

17   can a district court reasonably disagree with the

18   judgment of Congress concerning the ratio between the

19   quantity-based sentences for crack and powder.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a

21   question right at the outset that is critical for me.                I

22   think this case may well be controlled by the decision

23   in Neal against the United States, which is not cited in

24   the government brief and wasn't cited in the blue brief.

25                 But there the Court held that a policy


                                        23

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   judgment by Congress fixing mandatory minimums on the

 2   basis of the weight of the carrier rather than the drug

 3   did not justify guidelines based on that ratio -- based

 4   on the same principle -- if that would produce

 5   unwarranted disparities.

 6                 And, as I understand the facts of this case,

 7   the Commission has told us actually in some of its

 8   reports that the 100 to 1 ratio does produce unwarranted

 9   disparities.     Therefore, we should disregard the entire

10   guideline as we did in Neal, and the reason the Neal

11   case is controlling in this case.

12                 MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Stevens, let me start

13   with the Neal decision, because I think Neal is

14   fundamentally unlike this case.                In Neal this Court had

15   to determine whether its prior construction of a

16   statute, Section 841, survived the Commission's

17   decision --

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that is a construction

19   of what Congress intended, and for purposes of decision

20   we assumed that Congress intended what we held the

21   statute meant.

22                 MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Stevens, the only

23   question presented in Neal was, did the Commission's

24   weight guideline for LSD require this Court to change

25   its interpretation of Section 841.                   And the Court held


                                         24

 1   no.

 2               There was no question before the Court about

 3   whether the Sentencing Commission had legitimately

 4   adopted a different formula than the mixture or

 5   substance rule that this Court had held governed the

 6   statute.

 7               The LSD guideline was not in play in Neal.

 8   The government never challenged it.                     Its rationality was

 9   not at issue.   All the Court had to hold was that

10   whatever the Sentencing Commission did --

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It does hold that a

12   guideline that does not conform with a congressional

13   judgment merely expressed in a mandatory minimum is a

14   guideline that would survive.

15               MR. DREEBEN:         Well, I disagree with that,

16   Justice Stevens, because no one challenged the guideline

17   in Neal.   There was nothing at issue in the Court to

18   decide about whether that Guideline was valid.                    But even

19   if the Court thought that Neal does involve some sort of

20   a principle that the Sentencing Commission has greater

21   freedom to vary from the procedures laid out in a

22   mandatory minimum sentencing statute, Neal does not

23   control this case, because there is more data about what

24   Congress intended the ratio between crack and powder to

25   be, and because Congress changed the basic, organic

 1   statute that governs the Sentencing Commission's --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but there's also more

 3   data that the Commission has reflected on all this and

 4   still concludes that the 100 to 1 ratio creates an

 5   unwarranted disparity which is contrary to the statute.

 6               MR. DREEBEN:         Well, the statute, itself,

 7   Section 841, establishes the ratio of a 100 to 1.            When

 8   the Commission first considered creating drug

 9   guidelines --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It establishes the ratio

11   for mandatory minimum purposes only, is what Neal held.

12               MR. DREEBEN:         Well I disagree with that,

13   Justice Stevens, and I'm trying to explain why the legal

14   context is different from the legal context in Neal.

15               Let me start with a couple of points about

16   this.   First of all, when the Commission promulgated the

17   drug Guideline initially, it conformed it to the 100 to

18   1 ratio that existed under the mandatory minimum

19   sentencing statute, because it recognized -- and these

20   were the Commission's words -- that a logical and

21   coherent sentencing scheme required that there be

22   consistent proportionality throughout the sentencing

23   process.

24               When the Commission later studied the

25   crack-powder ratio and concluded that Congress had


                                       26
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   gotten it wrong and, therefore, the Commission, itself,

 2   had gotten it wrong by conforming to what Congress did,

 3   it proposed a Guideline that would have changed the

 4   ratio for Guideline's purposes only to one to one

 5   between crack and powder.

 6              And Congress, for the first time in the

 7   history of its review of Guidelines amendments, rejected

 8   that proposal; and it did so with legislation that made

 9   clear that it believed that if the commission wanted to

10   come back with something new, it should propose

11   something that would change both the Guidelines and the

12   sentencing statutes so that they would continue to work

13   in tandem -- that it would preserve a higher ratio of

14   punishment for crack than powder because it believed

15   that crack was more serious, and that it believed that

16   any ratio should apply consistently across the

17   Guidelines and the statute.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And if -- you're

19   talking about Public Law 104-38?

20              MR. DREEBEN:          That's correct.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, they also

22   said, quote, "The sentence imposed for trafficking in

23   crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence for

24   powder cocaine."

25              MR. DREEBEN:          Correct.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's fine,

 2   but that's pretty far from 100 to 1.                    "Generally

 3   exceed," it suggests to me that Congress itself, in

 4   terms -- you are relying on this implicit directive from

 5   Congress.   And that's the latest expression of

 6   congressional implicit direction, and it just says

 7   "generally exceed."     So, you know, two to one.

 8               MR. DREEBEN:         This, Mr. Chief Justice, is

 9   what Congress instructed the Commission to consider in

10   making recommendations to change the existing state of

11   the law.

12               We don't dispute --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well I know, but you

14   are relying on an implicit directive anyway.                   So as you

15   are looking at that vague direction, it seems to me that

16   their last expression on what they wanted the Commission

17   to do is more probative than a much older pre-existing

18   100 to 1 ratio.

19               MR. DREEBEN:         But they have never changed

20   the 100 to 1 ratio.     And what I think is significant

21   about this statute is what it continues to say, and this

22   is on page 124-A of the government's brief -- that "the

23   recommendations concerning an appropriate change to the

24   ratio that the Commission might believe is warranted

25   shall apply both to the relevant statutes and to the


                                       28

 1   Guidelines."    This is on the carryover sentence on pages

 2   24-A to 25-A.

 3               And what I think that this reflects is

 4   Congress' recognition that, so long as the mandatory

 5   minimum statutes are pegged at 100 to 1, the Guidelines

 6   need to follow suit.       Now if they're going to change,

 7   that's fine.    But they should change in a manner that's

 8   consistent so as to avoid unwarranted disparities

 9   between defendants who are governed by the literal

10   mandatory minimum statute and defendants who are not.

11               The alternative is you end up with various

12   serious cliff effects which the Commission itself was

13   trying to avoid, where a defendant who has 50 grams of

14   crack is sentenced to a minimum of 10 years.                   But if you

15   drop the ratio to one to one, a defendant who has

16   49.9 grams --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:             But those are the same

18   cliff effects that are the product of Neal, precisely

19   the same.

20               MR. DREEBEN:          But this Court didn't consider

21   whether those cliff effects were legally valid in Neal

22   because it had no guideline before it.                   And I did went

23   to get to the other point that I think distinguishes the

24   legal context in Neal from the legal context today, and

25   that is, in 2003, Congress amended the organic statute


                                        29
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that governs the Sentencing Commission's promulgation of

 2   Guidelines to require that the commission make AUDIO

 3   STARTS its Guidelines consistent with all pertinent

 4   provisions of the United States Code.

 5                 At the time of Neal, that statute only

 6   required the commission to be consistent with Title 18

 7   and Title 28, and the drug statute is found in Title 21.

 8   And the legislative evolution of this provision reflects

 9   that there was concern that the commission did not have

10   to honor --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           In response to that

12   statute, did the commission revise the guideline that

13   was involved in Neal?

14                 MR. DREEBEN:        It did not, and the government

15   --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Shouldn't it have done it?

17                 MR. DREEBEN:        I think it should have, and I

18   think that the commission's decoupling of its guidelines

19   from the mandatory minimums that Congress has provided

20   produces an irrational disconnect between guideline

21   sentencing and sentencing --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, that's because of the

23   cliff.   But the cliff is undoubledly a negative, but the

24   cliff is not as important as sometimes suggested, for

25   the numbers after all, which relate punishment to


                                        30

 1   amounts of drug, reflect, (a), more seriousness than

 2   what you have -- I mean more people likely to take it --

 3   but also the role that the person is likely to play in

 4   the organization, high or low, and the likelihood that

 5   he is or this -- these groups of people are big deal

 6   offenders or not, and many other things.

 7              Therefore, a system that really is basically

 8   flat or only rises slowly until you get to the cliff,

 9   and then it again rises slowly to the next rise, is not

10   an irrational system.       It depends on what those other

11   correlations are.    I say that because suppose a judge,

12   noticing the horrendous effects of this -- that the

13   commission itself has listed and understanding that

14   cliffs are not the end-all and the be-all of Guidelines

15   that are rough correlations, suppose a judge said:               My

16   system, which we have before us, which doesn't have the

17   absolute numerical progression, is far more reasonable

18   than the commission's system.              There it is.   He's

19   reviewed the commission's policy.

20              Well, Rita says sometimes courts could.                And

21   so what is the law that forbids the judge from doing

22   that, at least on occasion?

23              MR. DREEBEN:           Justice Breyer, as a general

24   matter, the government accepts that a sentencing judge

25   can revisit, challenge the Sentencing Commission's


                                        31

 1   policy determinations as an intrinsic feature of an

 2   advisory guideline system.           It's not because we welcome

 3   that result, but because we think that it followed from

 4   this Court's decision in Cunningham and that was

 5   expressly stated in Rita.

 6                But this is not an area where the sentencing

 7   courts would be merely second-guessing a commission

 8   judgment.    They would be second-guessing a judgment of

 9   Congress itself.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, because Congress has

11   nowhere said that you can't have cliffs.

12                You see, Congress could say, our rough

13   judgment is that 5 Gs of hard -- of crack really is kind

14   of a correlation with a medium-level gang, and 50 Gs is

15   probably a correlation with a fairly high-level gang.

16   And what has Congress actually thought about this?

17   Nothing.    They never thought about it.

18                So I can't find an instruction there that

19   tells the commission that they can't do it this way.

20                MR. DREEBEN:         But, Justice Breyer, the one

21   time when the commission tried to do that --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            They wanted to abolish the

23   whole thing.

24                MR. DREEBEN:         They wanted to make it one to

25   one, and Congress recognized that that would produce

 1   severe cliffs and said not appropriate; if you want to

 2   change the sentencing statutes and guidelines in tandem,

 3   that's fine, make a recommendation.                       And so the

 4   government's fundamental position here is that Congress

 5   has made a judgment that until it says otherwise,

 6   sentencing ratios of 100 to 1 are appropriate to reflect

 7   the increased harms of crack.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Isn't your answer also to

 9   Justice Breyer's question the post-Neal amendment to the

10   statute which in effect says, you know, make your

11   Guidelines consistent with the statute?

12                 MR. DREEBEN:         Yes, it --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Quite -- quite apart from

14   the specific rejection of the proposal they came up

15   with.

16                 MR. DREEBEN:         The two of them work together

17   in tandem, I think.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?      Why?      That's my

19   question.     Everyone's assuming that "consistent with the

20   statute" means a sentencing system that's smooth without

21   cliffs.     And I'm sure every mathematician would agree

22   with you, but I'm not at all certain that prosecutors

23   and defendants who have actual experience in this would

24   agree with you, because there are lots of arguments that

25   it's perfectly consistent with the objective of the stat

 1   tute to have a few cliffs.

 2              MR. DREEBEN:            Well, I think I want to rely

 3   on what the Sentencing Commission itself did before it

 4   concluded that it disagreed with the 100 to 1 ratio in

 5   the statute.     And this is set forward -- forth at page

 6   50A of the same brief, the Kimbrough brief.                    This was

 7   the commission's original commentary where it explained,

 8   in the first full paragraph, how it set the basic levels

 9   for drug crimes.     And it said that it set them because

10   they were either provided directly by Section 841 of

11   Title 21 or, quote, "are proportional to the levels

12   established by statute," and it said, further refinement

13   of the drug amounts beyond those mandatory minimums was

14   essential to provide a logical sentencing structure for

15   drug offenses.    And I think what the commission --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, that's why -- and the

17   1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did

18   indeed require the guidelines to track the -- the

19   statutory prescriptions for sentencing.

20              MR. DREEBEN:            2003, I believe.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Pardon me?

22              MR. DREEBEN:            It's 2003.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:               2003.       Sorry.   I misspoke.

24              But -- but the fact remains that the

25   Guidelines are only guidelines and that still doesn't--

 1   doesn't convert to an obligation for the district courts

 2   to follow that scheme so long as that scheme is only

 3   reflected in the guidelines.             The guidelines themselves

 4   are still just advisory.

 5              MR. DREEBEN:           What distinguishes this area,

 6   Justice Scalia, I believe, from other guidelines is that

 7   the backdrop for sentencing for drug crimes is a

 8   mandatory minimum statute that goes directly to the

 9   sentencing court.    It's not subject to the commission's

10   intervention and it's not subject to a district court's

11   power to disagree with.         The sentencing court must use a

12   100 to 1 ratio in applying the mandatory minimums.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, why don't you just

14   skip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the

15   sentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a

16   sentencing judge -- never mind the Guidelines -- to do

17   anything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription

18   that Congress has established?

19              MR. DREEBEN:           Well, I'm happy to do just --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't know what the

21   Guidelines add to -- to your game except another --

22   another stage.

23              MR. DREEBEN:           Well, if -- if it's sufficient

24   for the Court that Section 841 itself establishes the

25   100 to 1 ratio and that's something that's off-limits

 1   for the district courts to disagree with, I'm content.

 2               I think there is additional data that

 3   indicates that Congress vetoed attempts by the

 4   Sentencing Commission to vary from that range and made

 5   it clear that the Guidelines formulations and the

 6   statute worked in tandem, which together expresses a

 7   notion of quantity proportionality tied to the 100 to 1

 8   ratio.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I would say that that

10   statute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing,

11   whether it's through the commission or not, be based on

12   the 100 to 1 ratio.

13               MR. DREEBEN:         And I agree with that, Justice

14   Scalia.   And the upshot of disagreeing with that, which

15   is what various district courts have done but no court

16   of appeals has endorsed, is that every district court

17   could come up with its own ratio and that that ratio

18   would have to be accepted as reasonable so long as there

19   is a cogent, logical data support for it.               And here --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But is it not true that

21   that only affects about 20 percent of the crack cocaine

22   cases, because they say -- maybe I'm wrong on this --

23   that 80 percent of the sentences are actually fixed by

24   the mandatory minimum?

25               MR. DREEBEN:         There's a floor in the


                                       36
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   mandatory minimum, but I think that there are quite a

 2   few sentences that are above the mandatory minimum and

 3   there are sentences that are below the mandatory

 4   minimum.     And in those cases --

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I was -- and correct me if

 6   I'm wrong.     I was under the impression that 80 percent

 7   of the sentences that are actually imposed are at the

 8   mandatory minimum.

 9                 MR. DREEBEN:         I didn't get that out of my

10   attempt to plumb the data, Justice Stevens.               The

11   Sentencing Commission's most recent report has a chart

12   that didn't, to my mind, break down adequately the

13   figures so I could answer your question.

14                 But I do think that, even if it's true, even

15   if 80 percent were at the mandatory minimum, that would

16   mean that as to those 20 percent that are not governed

17   by a mandatory minimum, you could have one district

18   judge say, I'm going to use one to one, like the

19   commission proposed in 1995.              Another could say I'm

20   going to use five to one, like the commission proposed

21   in 1997.   A third could use 20 to 1, as the commission

22   proposed in 2002.     And each one of those would have a

23   reasonable --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't this another

25   alternative?    If the district judge concluded, as some

 1   scholars have, that the 100 to 1 ratio itself creates

 2   unwarranted disparities, could not a district judge

 3   sentence by just disregarding the guideline for this

 4   particular substance?      And then use just ordinary

 5   principles, what's appropriate sentencing in this case.

 6               MR. DREEBEN:         I don't think so, because I

 7   think here we're talking about a matter of statutory

 8   construction.   Because the courts of appeals are

 9   reviewing sentences for reasonableness.

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            You have a conflict in the

11   statute.   One says await the guideline.                Another says

12   avoid unwarranted disparities.

13               MR. DREEBEN:         That wasn't the two statutes I

14   was thinking of.   What I was thinking of is that

15   Congress itself has said a 100 to 1 disparity --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, Mr. Dreeben,

17   your office used to argue that when Congress wants to do

18   something, there's a way to do it.                 They pass a law

19   through both houses, then the President signs it.

20   That's the only way they can give legal effect to their

21   intent.

22               Now you are arguing that there's some

23   binding intent simply because they set mandatory

24   minimums and mandatory maximums that carry beyond that.

25   I'm wondering how that's consistent with the positions


                                       38

 1   the office has taken before.

 2              MR. DREEBEN:         Our position here, I think, is

 3   consistent with our view that you read statutes both for

 4   what they say and for what they mean.                  And here we are

 5   not relying just on Section 841, although I'm certainly

 6   happy if members of the Court believe that 841 alone

 7   dictates a proportionality rule, I'm also relying on the

 8   fact that Congress vetoed the Commission's attempt to

 9   break apart the Guidelines in the sentencing --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We should read a

11   negative pregnant in the Congress' vetoing of what the

12   Commission wanted to do?

13              MR. DREEBEN:         At least the Court should do

14   this much, that when a court of appeals is reviewing for

15   reasonableness a sentence imposed by a district judge,

16   the court of appeals should refract the Section 3553(a)

17   factors through Congress' existing judgment that a 100

18   to 1 ratio is warranted.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            If Congress passes a

20   statute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of

21   eight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully,

22   does that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun?

23              (Laughter.)

24              MR. DREEBEN:         It doesn't.            But, Justice

25   Breyer, that's, for two different reasons, not an apt


                                      39

 1   analogy for this.    First of all, Congress applied the

 2   100 to 1 ratio at two different points in the sentencing

 3   spectrum.

 4                Then if there was a rational basis for

 5   viewing shotgun culpability as turning on the length of

 6   the barrel, then perhaps there would be a better

 7   analogy.    But I think here what Congress was focused on

 8   was the relative culpability of crack offenders and

 9   powder offenders.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            At the cliff.       But, of

11   course, I've been through -- I hope not being hypnotized

12   by numbers myself -- that these numbers reflect

13   underlying realities that are far closer to the shotgun

14   case than you are prepared to admit.

15                MR. DREEBEN:         No, but I think that Congress

16   doesn't view the Guidelines quantity determinations as

17   being independent from its mandatory minimum

18   determinations.   And that's why it vetoed the

19   Commission's unilateral attempt to impose a one to one

20   ratio --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And then are you saying

22   that either the guidelines are out of it and the statute

23   controls, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has,

24   in effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting

25   the drug quantity, made that mandatory?                  That


                                        40
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   guideline -- I mean, it sounds to me that if you must

 2   adhere to the 100 to 1, then that's a mandatory

 3   guideline.

 4                MR. DREEBEN:        They do come down to the same

 5   thing, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that the guideline

 6   as it exists today incorporates the 100 to 1 ratio.                     And

 7   I believe that Congress well understood that it was

 8   preserving a guideline that maintains fidelity and

 9   consistency with its sentencing statute while sending

10   the Commission back to the drawing board and saying if

11   we're going to change this scheme, let's change it in a

12   consistent coherent way.         And every district court does

13   not get the power to say we're going to change what

14   Congress has prohibited the Commission from changing,

15   even though we can't change the mandatory minimum

16   statute.

17                That is Congress' sentencing policy.                  We

18   have to impose that in cases at the mandatory minimum.

19   But in cases that aren't at the mandatory minimum, the

20   position of the petitioner is basically district judges

21   can say to Congress, you're completely wrong.                    And our

22   position is that under a sympathetic attempt to

23   construct reasonableness review that is consistent with

24   Congressional intent, a district court can't do that.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why doesn't

 1   Congress -- why didn't Congress, in fact, do what you

 2   say they implicitly did explicitly?                     They could impose

 3   the 100 to 1 ratio throughout as opposed to simply as a

 4   minimum and a maximum.       And they did not do that.

 5               MR. DREEBEN:         Because they had no reason to

 6   do it.   Until this Court decided Booker, the Guidelines

 7   were mandatory.   And they fully understood by leaving in

 8   place a crack guideline that mirrored the statutory --

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Congress has legislated in

10   this area after Booker.        They have not imposed the 100

11   to 1 ratio throughout the -- other than as a mandatory

12   minimum and maximum.

13               MR. DREEBEN:         I'm not aware that they have

14   legislated in this area after Booker, Mr. Chief Justice.

15   And I think that since all the court of appeals have

16   agreed with the single position that district courts are

17   not free to substitute their own ratios for the 100 to 1

18   ratio, Congress would not have had a great deal of

19   reason to intervene in this area.

20               And what this case will tell Congress and

21   sentencing courts is within an advisory guidelines

22   regime, can Congress make certain policy judgments and

23   place certain limits on what a district court can do

24   that it otherwise would have freedom to do in an

25   advisory range.


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that, as you say, in

 2   effect, makes a certain element mandatory.             And why

 3   doesn't that come up against the same Sixth Amendment

 4   judgement that we made in Booker?

 5              MR. DREEBEN:         The only requirement, I

 6   believe, that exists under Booker is that judge not in

 7   all cases be required to find a fact in order to exceed

 8   the guidelines range that would be based on the jury

 9   verdict alone or the admission of guilt alone.

10              Booker did not say that Congress had to

11   tolerate every single policy judgment that individual

12   district courts might make to vary upward.             For example,

13   socioeconomic status.     If a particular judge felt in my

14   courtroom college students and white collar

15   professionals deserve an automatic bump up in their

16   sentences above what I would give anyone else because

17   they betrayed the advantages that they have, I think

18   Congress could come along and say that's not right.              We

19   don't want socioeconomic status to be a variable that

20   affects how long someone goes to prison.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It seems to me that the gap

22   in your argument is that whatever Congress legislated,

23   it did not legislate the manner in which you transferred

24   this 100 to 1 ratio onto the sentencing chart.

25              And as your opponent points out, it isn't


                                      43

 1   done proportionally.        It could have been done in a lot

 2   of different ways.

 3               MR. DREEBEN:           It is done in a logically

 4   proportional manner --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Maybe.           But there are other

 6   logically proportional manners of doing it.                       Why would

 7   the district court be bound to the particular one that

 8   the Sentencing Commission chose?

 9               MR. DREEBEN:           The Sentencing Commission at

10   least started where Congress did.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's fine.          I'm granting

12   that they got a start where Congress did.                      I'm assuming

13   that.   But why do they have to follow it through the way

14   the Sentencing Guidelines did?

15               MR. DREEBEN:           I don't think they do have to

16   follow it through exactly the way the Sentencing

17   Commission did it, because they don't -- sentencing

18   courts today which are sentencing under advisory

19   guidelines need not use exactly the same base offense

20   levels when they come down to final sentences after

21   they've considered what the Commission has done.                      But

22   what they cannot do, I submit -- and it is more of a

23   negative -- they cannot say fundamentally the Commission

24   has pointed this out and Congress has enacted, but the

25   crack and powder guidelines are way out of whack.                      I

 1   think that they're wrong.

 2               I think Congress was wrong.                 And I'm going

 3   to do everything I can to try to eliminate that degree

 4   of disparity.   And I may not be able to do everything I

 5   want to.   This judge here was limited by the 120 months

 6   that was the mandatory minimum.              But essentially, he, as

 7   I read the sentencing transcript, thought it was crazy

 8   for Congress to treat crack and powder differently.                   For

 9   a judge to say Congress is crazy, I think, is a sort of

10   textbook example of an unreasonable sentencing factor.

11               The ultimate sentence will turn on how the

12   judge applies all of the facts of the case to the

13   particular --

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is it not a fact that this

15   guideline is also unique in that it was not based on a

16   history of other similar crimes like all the other --

17   most of the guidelines were?            There's no expert

18   interpretation of the history of sentencing in this

19   particular area?

20               MR. DREEBEN:         True.       But this is an area

21   where I don't think Congress chose to rely on the

22   administrative expertise of the commission.                It made its

23   own policy judgment on crack.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I understand.      This

25   guideline is pretty much unique in that regard.                   It is


                                       45

 1   not based on experience in sentencing in comparable

 2   cases.

 3                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, the drug guideline was

 4   based on --

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           The 100 to 1 ratio is not

 6   based on history?

 7                 MR. DREEBEN:        No.      But entire drug --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Therefore, none of the

 9   sentencing guidelines relating to crack are based on

10   history.

11                 MR. DREEBEN:        They are based on the fact

12   that Congress made a supervening policy judgment.                And

13   in our system, the policy judgments ultimately

14   pertaining to sentencing belong to Congress.

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So there is really an

16   entirely different rationale for defending these

17   guidelines than any other guidelines in the system?

18                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, there are some other

19   guidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but

20   my fundamental point here is that so long as Congress

21   has made a determination that it has not changed, that

22   it wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point,

23   district courts should not be free to say I think

24   Congress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a

25   different paradigm.      The Commission didn't think that


                                        46

 1   was appropriate when it promulgated the original drug

 2   guideline, which is why that guideline is not based on

 3   the same sorts of empirical data that other guidelines

 4   might be deemed to be responsive to.                    But that only

 5   reflected that the Commission in its original guideline

 6   respected that its role was to carry out congressional

 7   policy, not to disagree with or supplant congressional

 8   policy, and so long as the Commission was operating in

 9   that vein -- which I think was correct -- it follows a

10   fortiori that sentencing courts should do the same

11   thing.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Does the Guidelines

13   supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony

14   provision is general and the Guidelines -- the ratio is

15   specific?

16               MR. DREEBEN:         Well, I would put it

17   differently, Justice Kennedy.             I would say that Congress

18   has made a legislative judgment that for crack purposes,

19   this ratio is what is needed to have a sufficient

20   sentence, and the Congress that decided that might be

21   wrong.   And if the present-day Congress decides to

22   change that, a new policy will be established, but I

23   think that reading the two statutes together, Section

24   3553(a) and Section 841, produces the conclusion that

25   this is a legislative judgment of reasonableness; and


                                       47

 1   even if every judge in the Federal system holds a

 2   different personal view, that doesn't mean that the

 3   statute has validated their position over the one that

 4   Congress expressed in Title 21, in a manner that binds

 5   sentencing courts irrespective of how the Commission

 6   sorts out its policy judgments.

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose experience shows

 8   that the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony

 9   provision -- we find that over a course of time?

10              MR. DREEBEN:         Well, I don't think that the

11   Court can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make

12   unreasonable what Congress did in Section 841.                 I think

13   reading all of the statutes together would produce the

14   conclusion that Congress deemed that this was the way to

15   achieve the purposes of sentencing.

16              Crack is more corrosive in the inner cities.

17   It has different kinds of problems than powder.                They

18   should be addressed in this more severe sentencing

19   manner, and if that's a policy judgment that warrants

20   being revisited, the appropriate body to do it is

21   Congress, not each individual sentencing judge,

22   formulating his or her own ratio, subject to blanket

23   affirmance by the court of appeals.

 4         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL S. NACHMANOFF

 5                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 6                 MR. NACHMANOFF:           Thank you, Mr. Chief

 7   Justice.

 8                 If I can respond, Justice Stevens, I think

 9   -- you asked about the percentage of cases in crack that

10   are at the mandatory minimum or near it.                 I would point

11   the Court to page 33, footnote 10 of our opening brief.

12   It is approximately 70 percent or just over that that

13   hit at the mandatory minimum or just one or two levels

14   above that.

15                 So the large majority of cases involving

16   crack cocaine end up being subjected to the mandatory

17   minimum.

18                 With regard to the Government's argument

19   regarding Section 994(a) and the fact that direction was

20   given to the Commission to be consistent with pertinent

21   statutes, of course, that's reflected in Section 5(g)

22   which says that mandatory minimums trump the Guidelines,

23   and the Commission recognizes that and of course

24   sentencing judges recognize that, and Judge Jackson

25   recognized it here.


                                        49

 1              To suggest that Judge Jackson concluded that

 2   Congress was crazy, I think is unfair.                 What Judge

 3   Jackson did was, in a very reasoned opinion, explained

 4   that the information from the Sentencing Commission,

 5   which has been persuasive not just to Judge Jackson, but

 6   to judges across the country and to many others, was

 7   that the 100 to 1 ratio overstates the seriousness of

 8   the offense, and he understood that Congress had spoken

 9   clearly with regard to mandatory minimums, and he

10   honored them.

11              Finally, Mr. Chief Justice, you point out

12   the heart of the problem with the Government's case.

13   Congress has not spoken explicitly in the way the

14   Government suggests.     They are --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I was wrong that

16   they legislated after Booker.

17              MR. NACHMANOFF:            Well, Your Honor, Congress

18   has failed completely to address this particular

19   problem, and they have understood since Booker that if

20   they wanted to address the issue of the discretion that

21   sentencing courts must have with regard to the advisory

22   guidelines, they have a way of fixing the problem.                  They

23   can change the statute.       And so long as they then

24   require the Government to include in the indictment and

25   prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the specific

 1   drug type and drug quantity over and above the current

 2   mandatory minimum and maximums, they're free to do that,

 3   and there would no Sixth Amendment problem and there

 4   would no problem with the advisory guidelines.

 5              In other words, right now, the Government

 6   simply alleges that a person engaged in the distribution

 7   of either 5 grams or 50 grams of crack cocaine -- that's

 8   what they have to do to meet the thresholds for the

 9   5-year and the 10-year mandatory minimums -- in

10   virtually every case the Government will present

11   evidence or a court will find under relevant conduct

12   that there was some greater quantity.                  And if the

13   Government's theory were to be accepted, those

14   guidelines would be mandatory, and it would be in direct

15   conflict with the remedial holding in Booker to require

16   courts to adhere to that, absent the procedural

17   protections which are not currently in place.

18              Judge Jackson did it right in this case.                 He

19   imposed a sentence consistent with the parsimony

20   provision and the purposes of sentencing and all of the

21   factors in 3553(a).

22              He imposed a long sentence, 15 years, but he

23   honored Congress's explicit mandate, and we would ask

24   the Court to reverse the court of appeals and affirm the

25   district court.
