 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. DREEBEN:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 In Neder versus United States, this Court

12   held that the omission of an offense element from petit

13   jury instructions can be harmless error, even though

14   that omission violates the Sixth Amendment right to a

15   jury trial.    Our submission is that the same analysis

16   applies to the omission of an offense element from a

17   grand jury's indictment.       Such an error violates the

18   Fifth Amendment, but it is harmless when the petit jury,

19   having been properly instructed on all of the elements

20   of the offense, returns a verdict of guilty beyond a

21   reasonable doubt.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not quite sure if this

23   works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an

24   opportunity for counsel to object.                There isn't an

25   opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment


                                      3

 1   comes down.     Now, I guess you could move to quash.

 2                 MR. DREEBEN:      That's correct, Justice

 3   Kennedy.     In fact, parties do move to dismiss

 4   indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of

 5   the offense.     That happened here.          The motion was

 6   erroneously denied by the trial judge.             The trial judge,

 7   under Ninth Circuit law, under the assumption that the

 8   Ninth Circuit has properly interpreted the law, should

 9   have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the

10   substantial step that was part of the attempt.            And if

11   the judge had done that, then the Government would have

12   gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding

13   indictment.

14                 Instead what the judge did was deny the

15   motion, finding that the indictment itself was

16   sufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the

17   elements that the Ninth Circuit requires as part of this

18   offense.     And so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond

19   a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve

20   a substantial step towards the completion of the

21   offense.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:          Isn't the problem that the

23   motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on

24   his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the

25   trial?     And we want to induce the court to look very


                                       4

                                    Official


 1   carefully at it at that point, because if the court is

 2   wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a

 3   result of it.     And the way to induce the court to be

 4   very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not

 5   harmless error, and you've got to take this very

 6   seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in

 7   effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error

 8   analysis later.

 9               MR. DREEBEN:        Well, first of all, Justice

10   Souter, motions like this are typically made long in

11   advance of trial, as this one was.                 Waiting until the

12   day of trial is far from the optimum practice.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, I'm sure that's

14   right.   But that simply reinforces my point.

15               MR. DREEBEN:        Well, I think what it

16   reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at

17   it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right

18   without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand

19   of automatic reversal.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you concede that the

21   error would always be harmless if you have a trial

22   before a petit jury, and all of the elements are

23   instructed to be found by the jury?

24               MR. DREEBEN:        Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is

25   our position.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That doesn't

 2   necessarily make sense.       You can imagine a situation

 3   where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that

 4   supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the

 5   prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that

 6   evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but

 7   indict anyway without it.

 8               In other words, what's your response to the

 9   situation where there's no probable cause on an element

10   at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is

11   later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?

12               MR. DREEBEN:       My response, Mr. Chief

13   Justice, is the same response that this Court gave in

14   United States versus Mechanik, where it was confronted

15   with an analogous problem.        And that was in that case, a

16   violation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to

17   testify at the same time before the grand jury.

18               And the Court was specifically confronted

19   with the question:    Was this harmless error because the

20   petit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable

21   doubt?   And it answered that question yes.              And en route

22   to that answer, it said, we could logically be persuaded

23   that what we're supposed to do is compare the evidence

24   in front of the grand jury to the error and see whether

25   the error was prejudicially consequential for the grand


                                      6

 1   jury's decision.    But we're not going to do that, the

 2   Court explicitly said in Mechanik, because once there is

 3   a finding of beyond a reasonable doubt, the question of

 4   probable cause is shown a fortiori and --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me, you mean you can

 6   never decide this question until after the trial is

 7   completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a

 8   reasonable doubt?

 9              MR. DREEBEN:        No, Justice Scalia, the

10   district court should decide this question in advance of

11   trial when it's properly raised and, if the indictment

12   is defective, dismiss it.        And this Court has recognized

13   that trial judges don't need incentives of an automatic

14   reversal rule to get them to comply with the law.

15              And I want to amend --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did the U.S. Attorney in

17   this case oppose the motion to quash the indictment?

18              MR. DREEBEN:        In this case?

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.

20              MR. DREEBEN:        Yes.       And the Ninth Circuit's

21   ruling that this indictment was defective was really --

22   bolt out-of-the-blue might be too strong.            But it was an

23   extension of its prior precedents in a way that wasn't

24   directly foreseeable.     The United States Attorney's

25   office had every reason to believe, based on language in


                                      7

 1   prior Ninth Circuit cases, that alleging an attempt to

 2   enter was adequate to allege the offense.

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:         Mr. Dreeben, this touches on

 4   what troubles me about this.              I wonder whether we can

 5   answer the generic question that you presented, whether

 6   the omission of an element of a criminal offense from

 7   the indictment can constitute harmless error, without

 8   considering the nature of the alleged defect here.

 9               I don't know how you can answer -- if you

10   look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible

11   to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to

12   agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can

13   answer those questions without reaching a conclusion

14   about whether there was any defect in the indictment in

15   the first place.

16               MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Alito --

17               JUSTICE ALITO:         And it doesn't seem to me

18   that there's any defect in this indictment.             It charges

19   -- it recites the language of the statute, it uses the

20   word "attempt" which has a very well-settled meaning in

21   the law.   Any lawyer would understand exactly what is

22   required for an attempt.        It sets out the factual basis

23   of the charge.     So I don't know how you would get to

24   the -- how you can answer the second question without

25   getting into the first question.

 1               MR. DREEBEN:      We did not challenge in our

 2   certiorari petition, which this Court granted, the Ninth

 3   Circuit's holding that in order for an attempt to be

 4   accomplished there needs to be a substantial step, and

 5   in an indictment under section 1326, there needs to be

 6   an allegation of what that substantial step is.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I have the same problem.

 8   It's such a difficult requirement to get a hold of.              I

 9   mean, he drives the car, he walks, he breathes.            I mean,

10   all of these things enable him to get into the country.

11   I just don't understand the basis for the rule.

12               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, it is common law --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            He wasn't forced to go

14   over.   He did it on his own.           It seems to me that's --

15               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, that's certainly the

16   Government's position, Justice Kennedy.            But it is well

17   settled in the common law that attempts require a

18   substantial step towards the completion.            There are

19   variations that different jurisdictions use.            That's the

20   Model Penal Code formulation.            The Ninth Circuit I think

21   has gone beyond where some other courts have gone, as

22   Justice Alito was noting, by saying that the indictment

23   needs to spell out the factual basis for that

24   substantial step.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What would that be here?

 1   That he drove the car to the border?               That he got out of

 2   the car?   That he presented a document?              What -- if you

 3   could do it over again, what would the indictment say?

 4               MR. DREEBEN:      The indictment would have to

 5   say that he attempted to enter the United States and

 6   took a substantial step towards the completion of that

 7   crime, to wit he approached the border and came to the

 8   guard and presented false identifications to the guard

 9   and lied about his intended destination.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:       If you went back to the --

11   if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth

12   century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws,

13   they would say that where you use a legal term that has

14   a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't

15   need to spell out the definition of that, of that

16   concept.   It's enough to use the term.             So what the

17   Ninth Circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go

18   back to something that's more demanding than would have

19   been required in a nineteenth century indictment and

20   frame that as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

21               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, Justice Alito, I'm not

22   going to defend what the Ninth Circuit did here, but I

23   will be clear about the following:               There is a generic

24   legal issue at stake in this case that we face in the

25   Ninth Circuit and in other courts around the country


                                    10

 1   because indictments are not always written perfectly.

 2   And whether it's an element that the Ninth Circuit has

 3   improperly read into it or an element that a court has

 4   properly read into a statute, we do face the situation

 5   where --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:          As to the element, I

 7   thought that what the Ninth Circuit talked about was

 8   overt act.     They didn't use the words "overt act."

 9                MR. DREEBEN:       They did, Justice Breyer.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, all right.   I thought

11   that comes out of conspiracy law; it doesn't even out of

12   attempt law.     Then I thought it's unlikely -- but here

13   you can correct me.     The U.S. Code is filled with the

14   word "attempt."     Just opening it at random, there are

15   attempts to assault and steal mail matter, there are

16   attempts to steal the mail matter, there are attempts to

17   rob a bank, attempts here, attempts there.

18                Is it the Government's practice whenever

19   they charge a violation of any of these provisions to

20   not just use the word "attempt," but to use the words

21   "substantial step"?

22                MR. DREEBEN:       No.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:          I would have thought the

24   answer was no.     And therefore, this isn't just a small

25   error of a technical sort.         The Ninth Circuit is

 1   completely wrong and not even close.               And therefore, if

 2   they're not even close, can the Government come up here

 3   where there's an obvious error and they decide, the

 4   Government, that it would like to have a declaration by

 5   this Court on a matter that they think is quite

 6   interesting and important to them in a lot of other

 7   cases where they can't win the cases easily?

 8                 That's, I'm putting it a little pejoratively

 9   because I'm trying to get you to see what I'm driving

10   at.     It's like a hoked-up case.          Why not?   I'm using it

11   pejoratively only so that you can see what I'm worried

12   about.

13                 MR. DREEBEN:      We didn't really have a lot of

14   choice about it.     I mean, the Ninth Circuit decided to

15   read the statute this way and it reversed the

16   conviction.     There's not a circuit split under section

17   1326.     We have to bring thousands of indictments in the

18   Ninth Circuit, so we're not exactly going to set up test

19   cases to risk our convictions based on the Ninth

20   Circuit's rule.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But you're making the

22   concession only for purposes of this case.              That is, in

23   another case you would be free to say the word "attempt"

24   is good enough; you don't have to spell out in the

25   indictment a particular overt act.

 1              MR. DREEBEN:       Justice Ginsburg, it's not

 2   unusual for this Court to decide a case where the

 3   Government does not challenge the underlying

 4   constitutional ruling and make some remedial argument.

 5   Two very notable examples are United States versus Leon,

 6   where the Government did not challenge the underlying

 7   Fourth Amendment claim that was found to be valid by the

 8   lower court, but instead simply asked for a modification

 9   of the exclusionary rule; and another example is Rose

10   versus Clark, which involves a fairly analogous issue to

11   this one, whether it can be harmless error to fail to

12   incorporate into the jury instructions the actual

13   element and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable

14   presumption.   In that case the State did not challenge

15   whether the instruction violated the Constitution.              This

16   Court didn't decide it.      Instead, what it decided was

17   the remedial question of harmless error, which is an

18   important question and I submit doesn't change in

19   character depending on the nature of the underlying

20   error.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:             We've done it before,

22   there's no doubt about it.       But the better practice

23   usually is to have a case in which the issue really

24   presents the hard question.         And you're asking us to

25   make a ruling in this case that would govern failure to

 1   allege an aggravating circumstance in a death case, for

 2   example, which has a different atmosphere to the whole

 3   case when you're facing that kind of an issue.

 4               MR. DREEBEN:      It may have a different

 5   atmosphere, but I don't think that it has any different

 6   legal analysis behind it.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            A judge's reaction to a

 8   case is often affected by just exactly what's involved.

 9   And here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim

10   any particular prejudice out of the error in this

11   particular case or, really, it's arguable that there's

12   no defect in the indictment at all because it was

13   adequate notice to the defendant of what he's charged

14   with.   This is much like a case in the State systems

15   where you have notice pleading.           It doesn't seem very

16   prejudicial.

17               But you put it in a different context, you

18   might have a different reaction to the case.

19               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, I think our fundamental

20   submission here is that with respect to the probable

21   cause determination, there is no prejudice because of

22   the petit jury's verdict.       With respect to notice, we

23   would acknowledge that a defendant could argue that the

24   defect in a grand jury indictment in a particular case

25   could fail to give him adequate notice such that he


                                    14

 1   might have a case-specific claim of prejudice and be

 2   able to overturn the conviction.           On the facts of this

 3   case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that would not

 4   be a very strong argument.       There really is no reason to

 5   think that there was any notice problem with this very

 6   discrete transaction which was alleged in the indictment

 7   as occurring on a particular date in a particular place.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:         Does this come up very

 9   often?   I think the case -- the issue you want to raise,

10   because I would think normally there's a motion before

11   the trial, well before the jury is empanelled.          The

12   defendant says:   I want you to dismiss this; the

13   indictment's inadequate.      And if that's even close, I

14   would think normally the prosecutor would go back and

15   say:   Fine, I'll get a superseding indictment, and that

16   would end the problem.     And it seems to me so likely to

17   happen that the chances of the judge wrongly ruling

18   against the defendant and then it goes through a whole

19   trial almost never happens.

20               MR. DREEBEN:      Justice Breyer, I think that

21   an empirical perspective might be helpful here.          And I

22   think an empirical perspective, if you look around the

23   circuits and you see the number of issues, cases, in

24   which this issue is raised, it becomes clear that there

25   are a large number of situations in which mistakes get

 1   made.

 2              I mean, we're talking about a Federal system

 3   here in which 70 to 80,000 cases are indicted a year.

 4   Mistakes will happen, and they will happen both by the

 5   trial judge and by the prosecutor.

 6              And there will be situations in which the

 7   circuits change the law or the interpretation of the law

 8   after the decision in question.         I think that this is a

 9   good example of that, where the Ninth Circuit extended

10   its prior precedents to find that an indictment that

11   didn't allege the overt act was inadequate.

12              And then the Government is stuck, and the

13   rule of automatic reversal, which the Court may appear

14   to think in this case is particularly disproportionate

15   since the indictment looks fine, functions identically

16   even if there's a conceded violation that every member

17   of the Court would say yes, there's a missing element

18   here.

19              The fundamental problem is that the grand

20   jury sits to decide probable cause.              It does not decide

21   whether the defendant is actually guilty.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, it sits to

23   decide whether people should be indicted, and yes,

24   they're supposed to determine whether there's probable

25   cause, but historically a significant role for the grand

 1   jury has been not to indict people even though the

 2   Government had the evidence to indict them.

 3              MR. DREEBEN:       Well, I actually do not agree

 4   that there's any stronger evidence, Mr. Chief Justice,

 5   that grand juries didn't indict when the Government had

 6   adequate evidence than there is historical evidence that

 7   petit juries did not convict when there's proof beyond a

 8   reasonable doubt.   In both instances, you can point to

 9   historical instances in which grand juries and petit

10   juries played a role of in effect nullifying when there

11   was adequate evidence.

12              But it's clear from the Neder decision that

13   that history has not led to the conclusion that this

14   Court cannot evaluate petit jury defects for

15   harmlessness, and the same conclusion ought to be true a

16   fortiori for the grand jury.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:          The trouble with your a

18   fortiori argument it seems to me is this:         If we accept

19   your argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on

20   a motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the

21   judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the

22   motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial.

23   And if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove

24   the element, then it can either be thrown out because an

25   element has not been proven or he can go back and revive


                                    17
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the motion to quash.

 2               If on the other hand the Government gets its

 3   act together at that point and does put in evidence on

 4   the element, it's going to be harmless error.         And so

 5   the price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that

 6   someone will always be put to trial if there is any

 7   question about how the judge should rule on the motion

 8   to quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will

 9   grant the motion to quash and the Government can go back

10   to the grand jury and get another indictment.

11               It seems to me that something is seriously

12   lost in that situation if we go your way.

13               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, Justice Souter,

14   experience doesn't show that, in fact, district courts

15   don't grant these motions.       They grant them, as Justice

16   Breyer indicated, when the indictment is not sufficient.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:         I'm sure they do grant

18   them.   But I'm concerned about the, we'll say, the

19   doubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind.

20   Under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always

21   going to be to subject somebody to trial.

22               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, I do think we can assume

23   that Article III judges are a hearty enough species so

24   that they can make up their minds and they can rule.

25   But to the extent that there is a risk here that judges


                                    18
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   might reserve the motion, that is the same risk that the

 2   Court fessed up to and acknowledged in the Mechanik

 3   case, where in fact the judge did reserve the motion.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:         And it seems to me that the

 5   prejudice to the defendant in the two -- as between the

 6   two situations simply is not comparable.

 7              In Mechanik you had a situation in which two

 8   witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting

 9   in were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence

10   the other, et cetera.   Here, we're talking about a

11   situation in which it may very well be that the

12   defendant should never be put to trial at all.          And your

13   rule says if there's any question about it, put him to

14   trial, judge.

15              MR. DREEBEN:      Well, given that this issue

16   arises only when you have a petit jury verdict of guilty

17   beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems overwhelmingly

18   likely that any grand jury would have found probable

19   cause.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Do we know -- do we have

21   the grand jury transcripts, so do we know that, in fact,

22   evidence was put before the grand jury that false

23   identifications were presented at the border?

24              MR. DREEBEN:      The grand jury transcript is

25   not in this record, Justice Ginsburg, and we do not

 1   suggest that the Court adopt a rule in which it reviews

 2   the adequacy of the evidentiary showing before the grand

 3   jury.   There are important values in grand jury secrecy.

 4   They will, of course, be compromised at the trial stage

 5   if witnesses testify and the testimony is turned over in

 6   that context.

 7               But more important than the practical aspect

 8   is exactly the logic that the Court used in Mechanik.

 9   The point of the grand jury indictment is to determine

10   is there enough to take this person to trial.         Once the

11   person has been taken to trial and been found guilty

12   beyond a reasonable doubt, we know that if the

13   Government went back to the grand jury it would be able

14   to get an indictment.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:         How far would you go with

16   the Mechanik logic?     Suppose that someone is charged by

17   information with a felony without the person's consent

18   and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss

19   the information and then the person is convicted.         Would

20   you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict

21   that the fact that the person was charged with a felony

22   by information calls for no remedy?

23               MR. DREEBEN:        No, I would not go that far,

24   Justice Alito.   I would draw the same line that this

25   Court drew in the Midland Asphalt case where it was


                                      20

                                   Official


 1   looking at a somewhat analogous problem of an

 2   interlocutory appeal and the same line that it drew in

 3   Neder itself.    In Neder the Court said if the judge

 4   directs a verdict of guilty, that's an impermissible act

 5   and it cannot be rendered harmless no matter how

 6   overwhelming the evidence is.

 7                 In the Midland Asphalt case, this Court

 8   dealt with whether the language of the Fifth Amendment

 9   created a right not to be tried.             And it does say "No

10   person shall be held to answer absent an indictment

11   issued by a grand jury," and the Court said if you have

12   a defect that causes an indictment not to be an

13   indictment or, as in your hypothetical, Justice Alito,

14   no indictment at all, or if you have a defect that

15   causes the grand jury not to be a grand jury, those are

16   the kind of fundamental errors that would give rise to a

17   right not to be tried such that you could take an appeal

18   before trial, an interlocutory appeal.

19                 And I would submit that the same kind of

20   principle would apply here.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So it's just a

22   metaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an

23   indictment?    It's not some other standard of what's

24   fundamentally unfair or, from the Sixth amendment,

25   whether or not there's notice?

 1               MR. DREEBEN:       I'm borrowing the language

 2   from the Midland Asphalt opinion, but I think that it

 3   was a poetic way of putting the point that if you don't

 4   have --

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You say poetic, I said

 6   metaphysical.   When is an indictment not an indictment?

 7               MR. DREEBEN:       When you don't have one.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Now why would there be any

 9   difference then?    That's a question I was about to put

10   to you.   What if there is no indictment at all?             Why

11   couldn't you say the same thing?            Well, you know, the

12   only purpose of getting it is to see if there was

13   probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a

14   reasonable doubt.

15               MR. DREEBEN:       You could push the logic of

16   that argument that far.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I don't think it's pushing

18   it, I think it's there.

19               MR. DREEBEN:       Just as in the Neder case, you

20   could say that it would be harmless error if a judge

21   directed a jury verdict when the evidence was

22   overwhelming on all of the elements.              But the Court did

23   draw a distinction between those two situations.              And I

24   think that it's one that responds to a kind of common-

25   sense view of how fundamental an intrusion is there.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:          Doesn't an indictment have

 2   as its purpose in part to tell the defendant what crime

 3   he's being accused of committing?             Isn't that -- so

 4   that's why I thought it would be quite clear, wouldn't

 5   it, or helpful to say that to the Ninth Circuit?               And so

 6   an error is when it doesn't do that?               And an error is

 7   when it leaves out an element, and he doesn't know what

 8   crime is being committed, he's accused of.               So suppose

 9   you had an indictment that really did that.               Now he

10   doesn't know what crime he's accused of.              And then you

11   go to the trial and so forth and now we have to go into

12   at what point did he work out what crime he was being

13   accused of, rather hard to say.

14                MR. DREEBEN:       Well, chances are he did know

15   what crime he was accused of.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, yes, of course the

17   chances are.     But there's a possibility he didn't.

18                MR. DREEBEN:       And we submit --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          So if he didn't and

20   therefore the indictment was faulty in that respect,

21   then what?     Are you going to say we have to track

22   down -- I mean what it's reminding me of is like trying

23   to say whether he got an adequate lawyer, didn't get an

24   adequate lawyer, who knows, that kind of problem.

25                MR. DREEBEN:       Well, it isn't quite like

 1   that, I hope, Justice Breyer.             I mean, notice defects

 2   are very commonly alleged by defendants and courts know

 3   how to look for prejudice.         They know how to say whether

 4   the defendant was denied an opportunity to prepare his

 5   defense or misled by the indictment in some fashion or

 6   another.     And that's a very common case by case sort of

 7   prejudice inquiry that fits with the nature of the

 8   violation.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:         -- me until halfway through

10   the trial that it was robbery I was being accused of

11   because they left robbery out of the indictment.

12                 MR. DREEBEN:      Well, what you get are cases

13   where there needs to be an effect on interstate commerce

14   and it's not alleged and then the Government comes up

15   with proof.    I'm not saying that there is going to be a

16   vast pool of cases in which defendants would validly be

17   able to show prejudice from lack of notice; and that's

18   because we do have many other means in the criminal

19   justice system to alert the defendant to what he's

20   facing.

21                 There's discovery, there's the opportunities

22   for a bill of particulars to be filed.             Those are the

23   kinds of conventional harmless error inquiries that are

24   appropriate when you have a claim that the indictment

25   fails to give adequate notice.            But what is not

 1   appropriate is for the Ninth Circuit to impose a rule on

 2   the Government and on the system of justice that says we

 3   will automatically reverse, because there are important

 4   values at stake here whenever a rule of automatic

 5   reversal is contemplated.       And this was true in the

 6   Mickens versus Taylor case where the Court rejected a

 7   rule of automatic reversal when a judge didn't ask a

 8   question in response to an obvious conflict --

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm still not sure of your

10   test.   It's whether or not it's fundamentally unfair,

11   whether or not there's notice, which sounds like more

12   Sixth Amendment than Fifth.         Or whether it's not an

13   indictment, a rose is a rose type of thing.

14               MR. DREEBEN:      There are two aspects to our

15   rule, Justice Kennedy.     The first is that to the extent

16   that the claim of a defective indictment goes to the

17   question of was there probable cause, that error and

18   that constitutional value is not a basis for reversal

19   once a petit jury has found guilt beyond a reasonable

20   doubt on the same point.

21               To the extent that the defect in the

22   indictment goes to inadequate notice, a defendant can

23   make such a claim post trial that the indictment

24   prejudiced him because it was inadequately framed.           But

25   that should be done on a case-specific basis rather than

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Dreeben, if we disagree

 3   with you here, could this defendant be retried?                 Could

 4   he be reindicted?

 5                 MR. DREEBEN:     Yes, Justice Scalia.             I don't

 6   believe there would be any double jeopardy bar to

 7   reindicting him since he is the one who's challenged his

 8   conviction.

15                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. ATMORE L. BAGGOT

16                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17                 MR. BAGGOT:     Mr. Chief Justice, if it please

18   the Court:

19                 The structure created by the Constitution of

20   this country provides a single means of charging a

21   person with a Federal criminal offense.                The intention

22   of the framers of the Constitution was that a group of

23   ordinary citizens would take time away from their

24   families, their businesses, and their other concerns for

25   the purpose of deciding whether the requirements of the

 1   Fifth Amendment have been met by a Government

 2   prosecutor, and in, in a few words, whether a trial

 3   should proceed.    Or not.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You could say the same

 5   thing about a petit jury.        And in Neder we use the

 6   harmless error standard.

 7                 MR. BAGGOT:     Absolutely, but the proceedings

 8   before a grand jury are secret.             We never know what

 9   happened inside a grand jury.             It's a closed door

10   proceeding.    It is an independent body.          It is not

11   subject to any appeals or reviews by the trial judge.

12   The only thing that we know what happened behind those

13   closed doors was the document that emerges, which is the

14   indictment which becomes public knowledge.            Nothing else

15   is known about what happened in that jury room.

16                 Now, I'll take a guess as to what happened.

17   The Government told the grand jury that the overt act

18   requirement was not necessary, or perhaps, I'll take

19   another guess, they stated to the grand jury what they

20   stated to the district judge, that the indictment does

21   in fact state the overt act when plainly it doesn't.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Suppose -- suppose we found

23   out.   Somebody told what happened, and it was a crime of

24   bank robbery or it's an assault of a mailman, a postman.

25   And you know, it turns out they didn't present one word


                                     27

 1   of evidence, not a word that says that this individual

 2   who was assaulted had anything to do with the mail.

 3   There's complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a

 4   major element of the offense.            And now, suppose we get

 5   finished with the trial.       Plenty of evidence.

 6   Conviction.    Can you go back and raise that?

 7                 MR. BAGGOT:     I believe it would be raised --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:        No.     No.   I mean can you

 9   win.

10                 MR. BAGGOT:     Oh, can you win.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yeah.

12                 MR. BAGGOT:     You can always raise it.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:        I mean, you see, I'm saying

14   is that error?    Is that correctible error?           I'm saying

15   there is an absolute error.          It is far worse than here.

16   We know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever

17   presented to the grand jury on a major element of the

18   crime.

19                 MR. BAGGOT:     You're assuming somehow the

20   transcript has been disclosed.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes, I assume we know that.

22   Take that as a given.       We know.

23                 MR. BAGGOT:     The doors are open, they're not

24   closed.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yeah, we know.

 1              MR. BAGGOT:      We know what happened and

 2   basically there's zero evidence.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.    Zero.

 4              MR. BAGGOT:      Your Honor, the history of this

 5   Court's treatment of grand jury is that they may

 6   consider any evidence; they may consider --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes, but what is the answer

 8   to my question, yes or no?      I'm saying after the --

 9              MR. BAGGOT:      I believe in that situation the

10   petit jury's verdict would stand.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:         That's right.   So the

12   answer is no?

13              MR. BAGGOT:      The answer is no.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:         And if you can't raise

15   that, which is a major area because there's a harmless

16   error is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same

17   true here where the error is far more likely to be

18   simply technical and make no difference given the

19   adequacy of the evidence?

20              MR. BAGGOT:      Because the Constitution

21   contemplates that the grand jury be independent, that

22   its decision --

23              JUSTICE BREYER:         It does as well in my case.

 1   the grand jury did behind its closed doors, whether we

 2   open the doors or not.

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:       What if it's perfectly --

 4               MR. BAGGOT:      Sir?

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:       I'm sorry.      What if it's

 6   perfectly clear that the error is simply a clerical

 7   error?   Let's take a case where somebody is charged with

 8   possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.           And

 9   before the grand jury, we look at the transcript, we see

10   that the prosecutor introduced evidence of five

11   judgments of convictions for felony offenses.           And the

12   jury is properly charged that they have to find that

13   this individual was a convicted felon.           And there's

14   simply -- and then when the case is tried at, when the

15   case is tried the defense even stipulates that the

16   person is a convicted felon.

17               But there's a clerical mistake in preparing

18   the indictment.   And it doesn't recite the fact that the

19   defendant was previously convicted of a felony.           It's

20   your position that there must be a reversal there?

21               MR. BAGGOT:      Your Honor, if there is a

22   clerical error, Rule 36 gives the trial judge the

23   ability, and the power, and the authority to correct an

24   error which is purely clerical.          I refer you to the case

25   of Contreras-Rojas, which was this exact defense.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:        But what if it comes up on

 2   appeal?   Nothing is done until it comes up on appeal.

 3               MR. BAGGOT:       Well, I believe --

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:        Which is exactly in the

 5   posture of this case.

 6               MR. BAGGOT:       Well, Rule 36 says the court

 7   may correct clerical errors at any situation.             But that,

 8   your question presupposes that we know what happened in

 9   the grand jury room, that it should have been an

10   indictment, they intended it to be in the indictment --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How do you distinguish

12   the mail -- the letter carrier case that Justice Breyer

13   posed, because there you said even though there was no

14   evidence at all of what this person was, if the petit

15   jury found it, that would not be subject to review.                I

16   don't think you answered Justice Breyer and he said if

17   you concede that, the failure to introduce any evidence

18   that this person was a letter carrier.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I would like to even

20   sharpen Justice Breyer's hypothetical.             Let's assume

21   that the indictment did set forth what the overt act

22   was.   It did.   But there was no evidence of that overt

23   act introduced before the grand jury.             What would the

24   result of that be?

25               MR. BAGGOT:       The result --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:          Then the trial occurs --

 2              MR. BAGGOT:       And he's found guilty.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:          He's convicted.     And I

 4   think you're going -- your position is that conviction

 5   would stand.

 6              MR. BAGGOT:       My position is the conviction

 7   would stand, yes, sir.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:          That doesn't seem to me to

 9   make a lot of sense.

10              MR. BAGGOT:       Well, the grand jury is

11   independent.   There is no review from the grand jury.

12   The petit jury is an independent institutional body.

13   The function of the grand jury is not only to find

14   probable cause, rightly or wrongly, but the function of

15   the grand jury is also to select the charge.            And

16   specifically since your decision in Recuenco versus

17   Washington that sentencing enhancements are to be

18   treated the same way as basic elements of the offense to

19   be charged also, the grand jury's role is going to be

20   even better.

21              My position is simply that there is no

22   review whatsoever from the grand jury.            If you're

23   unhappy, you're a defendant, you're unhappy with what

24   the grand jury did, you say there's no evidence, you go

25   to trial, you get acquitted.            That's the only review


                                    32
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   there is of the grand jury and what they did.                If

 2   there's an error the case must go back to the same grand

 3   jury or conceivably another grand jury.                There's no

 4   jeopardy at that stage.        There's no constitutional

 5   complications.     And the Government is free to go back.

 6   Quite frankly, I'm very surprised the Government did not

 7   just go back and amend the indictment -- not amend it,

 8   but supersede the indictment and allege an overt act.

 9              The basic problem we have here is that there

10   are so many acts committed by everybody which could be

11   in furtherance of a crime.         And the problem is going to

12   trial that we don't know which act the Government was

13   talking about.     They told us in motion proceedings that

14   the entry itself was the overt act.                But the court of

15   appeals ruled that that cannot be an overt act.                So

16   possibly Mr. Resendiz was entitled to judgment as a

17   matter of law.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:            Can't you ask for a bill of

19   particulars?

20              MR. BAGGOT:         I could have done that, yes.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, then you would have

22   had no problem.

23              MR. BAGGOT:         But bill of particulars are not

24   favored motions.     And what is to -- that would still be

25   the Government speaking on behalf of the grand jury.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Were you, were you

 2   surprised at trial by the evidence that the defendant

 3   had submitted two false identifications?           Was the first

 4   time you heard about that at trial?

 5                MR. BAGGOT:     Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, I

 6   would submit that the prejudice to the defendant at the

 7   jury trial, the petit jury, was a slight prejudice.              The

 8   real problem I feel was on appeal, that if the

 9   Government had alleged --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But were you, was there

11   any element of surprise in this trial?           Did you not know

12   beforehand that the Government was going to present

13   evidence of two false identifications?

14                MR. BAGGOT:     No, I knew that, Your Honor.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So there was no lack of

16   notice; there was no surprise.

17                MR. BAGGOT:     In our court we have complete

18   discovery.   They copy the file for it and hand it to us.

19   So we know everything they know.           But what we did not

20   know is what the Government would rely on as their overt

21   act.   They said it was the entry itself.          The court of

22   appeals ruled as a matter of law, rightly or wrongly,

23   that that cannot be an overt act, because it simply --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, surely submitting

25   false identification could be a overt act.

 3   that?

 4                 MR. BAGGOT:     It could be an overt act.             It

 5   could be, lying could be a overt act, tying your shoes

 6   in the morning with intent to go to --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but you knew that --

 8   you had the file.    You knew the Government was going to

 9   prove this.    And you also knew it was an overt act.

10                 MR. BAGGOT:     It could have been.             But there

11   are many acts.

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:        But your point is not that

13   there was any prejudice here.            Your point is that he was

14   entitled to a grand jury?

15                 MR. BAGGOT:     He was entitled to a grand jury

16   as an independent institutional body.                And the problem I

17   have with the Government's point of view is that it

18   places a judge as a reviewing authority over what a

19   grand jury has done, regardless of the standard that's

20   applied.   And of course in -- it's a rare case when you

21   even know what a grand jury did.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You don't have

23   any -- you're not suggesting to us that the grand jury

24   that indicted him for intentionally attempting to enter

25   the United States at or near San Luis would not have

 1   indicted him if the indictment had gone further and

 2   said, and he submitted false IDs?

 3              MR. BAGGOT:       There are, there certainly are

 4   scenarios under which they would have indicted him, yes,

 5   sir.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:        You think that the -- that

 7   the indictment had to specify which of the many things

 8   that he did, or the several things that he did when he

 9   approached the border constituted the overt act that the

10   Ninth Circuit -- he walked up to the border and he did a

11   number of things to try to get into the United States.

12              MR. BAGGOT:       Sure.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:        And you think that the

14   indictment has to specify that walking up wasn't a

15   substantial step, but presenting the documents might

16   have been, whether it was walking up, presenting the

17   documents, lying to the agent?          You have to go into that

18   level of detail in order to satisfy the Fifth Amendment?

19              MR. BAGGOT:       Rule 7(c)(1) of the Rules of

20   Procedure states that the indictment must state the

21   essential facts.   It need not be a memorandum of law

22   just spelling out the elements of the crime in a general

23   sense, but it must state the essential facts.          In the

24   Court's case of Hamling it says very clearly, the

25   language of the statute must be accompanied by such

 2   accused of the specific offense coming under the general

 3   description which is charged.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:           That's a separate

 5   requirement.     I don't know if it's constitutional or not

 6   constitutional, but I didn't think that requirement was

 7   at issue here.

 8               The requirement of stating the facts is not

 9   the requirement of setting out the elements of the law.

10   At least that's my understanding.             Now, you can correct

11   me if I'm wrong.

12               MR. BAGGOT:        Well, Your Honor, based upon

13   your Hamling decision, I believe that's what the Court

14   said, that there must be an allegation of facts under

15   the decision in United States versus --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I'm not denying that.

17   I just didn't think that had anything to do with this

18   case.   I mean, I thought that the object of the

19   indictment initially was to set forth what crime the

20   person was accused of and inform him of that.

21               You are saying, and then there is another

22   requirement, which seems a little vague.             It's been hard

23   for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one

24   you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule

25   you have to have facts.

 1                 I don't know if those are the same.            I

 2   thought they were two separate things.

 3                 MR. BAGGOT:      Well, Your Honor, one of the

 4   functions of the grand jury indictment is to provide

 5   notice to the accused of the exact offense with which he

 6   is charged.    Here, clearly we knew he was charged with

 7   1326, with attempting.       What we did not know is which of

 8   the many, many acts that the Government suggested at

 9   various times, which of the many acts they proved at

10   trial, would be the overt act.              As I say, the appeal was

11   unfair.   It's not so much the trial was unfair.             It was

12   the appeal that was unfair.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Does the Government have

14   to pick one overt act and say that's it, when it

15   introduces evidence of a whole string of them?

16                 MR. BAGGOT:      Well, I don't see how we can

17   really address it unless they tell us what they're

18   talking about.     And I would point out as of today the

19   Government has still not identified a single act that is

20   their overt act.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, can't you allege

22   that the means by which it was done are unknown, but

23   that it was by one or more of the following?

24                 MR. BAGGOT:      Yes, you could.        Many times in

25   conspiracy indictments they will allege any of the

 1   following overt acts.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:        That's exactly what I -- I

 3   tried to read some treatises on this, and the more I

 4   read, the more confused I got.

 5                 I started out thinking, well, it's

 6   sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October

 7   14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of

 8   such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant

 9   walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by

10   force or threat of force, take property belonging to

11   someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be

12   sufficient.    And that you don't have to say, and in

13   addition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did

14   it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist.          Can you

15   give me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's

16   relevant here?

17                 MR. BAGGOT:     I don't think that's relevant

18   because that's going into excessive detail.          The

19   requirement is that the essential fact --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:        If it's excessive detail,

21   the central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date

22   at such and such a time he attempted to?

23                 MR. BAGGOT:     Because he did many things in

24   furtherance of the attempt according to the Government's

25   proof, and we had a right to know, to have notice of the

 1   accusation, what is the Government talking about?

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.           Then why, if

 3   that's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said

 4   he attempted to and committed an overt act in -- that is

 5   a substantial step.     And then you're saying in addition,

 6   they have to list the particular facts.

 7                MR. BAGGOT:       The essential facts.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:          I couldn't find any case in

 9   this Court that said that.         I mean, I found in Hamling a

10   case that went the other way, a general statement.                    They

11   said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have

12   to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et

13   cetera.

14                MR. BAGGOT:       But in the Russell case they

15   said that you have to provide the essential facts, what

16   was the nature of the committee hearing, what was the

17   subject --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yeah.        Yeah.    Yeah.   And

19   then Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or

20   isn't followed a lot.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you come back and you

22   tell Justice Breyer, well, that's because we had no

23   notice.   But that's a different argument than the fact

24   that there was no indictment.              Notice can be cured by a

25   bill of particulars, by the fact that you've had a

 1   chance to contest the evidence at trial, that there was

 2   no error.   That's a quite different rationale than

 3   saying that this is not an indictment.

 4               MR. BAGGOT:      Well, it's not an indictment

 5   because it did not allege the essential facts.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that, it seems to me,

 7   is your argument, not lack of notice.

 8               MR. BAGGOT:      Well, it didn't provide a

 9   notice of what the essential facts was.            Those are

10   overlapping concepts, certainly, but we did not know

11   what the facts --

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question.

13   Should the test for the missing element be different for

14   the test for the wrong element?            In other words, suppose

15   the indictment alleged he walked up to the border and

16   the evidence showed he rode a bicycle.            There's a

17   variance.   Would that present a different legal issue

18   than if they just leave the overt act entirely out?

19               MR. BAGGOT:      That presents a different legal

20   issue because a variance means they alleged A, they

21   proved B.   Here they did not allege A.           Nothing was

22   alleged.

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why should the test for

24   judging the two be different?

25               MR. BAGGOT:      Between a variance --

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Between a variance and an

 2   omission?

 3                MR. BAGGOT:      Well, when you have a variance

 4   the question is how much is the variance, how far off is

 5   the variance.

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, it's clearly

 7   different.   He rode a bicycle instead of walking.

 8                MR. BAGGOT:      Well, he's given notice that

 9   he's approaching the border with intent to commit this

10   crime.

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:            So here you've got notice

12   he made an attempt, but you didn't tell us whether he

13   rode the bicycle or he walked.

14                MR. BAGGOT:      But then the question becomes

15   is it material, is the variance material, is it far off

16   from what alleged?     Here nothing was alleged.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:            See, the problem I'm

18   trying to think through is why should there be a

19   different rule between those two situations.             It seems

20   to me they're equally likely to produce prejudice or

21   lack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter

22   of the Constitution.

23                MR. BAGGOT:      Well, the prime variance case

24   is Stirone versus United States in the 1960s, where the

25   Court very simply said that where nothing is alleged

 1   this cannot be treated as a simple variance.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:         But why isn't your answer

 3   to Justice Stevens that in the case in which there is no

 4   allegation of an element at all there isn't a sufficient

 5   indictment to charge him for anything, whereas in the

 6   case of the variance on your theory, as I understand it,

 7   there is an indictment and the question is simply

 8   whether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced?

 9              MR. BAGGOT:      Right.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:         So why isn't the answer is

11   in one case there's an indictment, and in the other case

12   there isn't?

13              MR. BAGGOT:      Well, the extent is -- it's a

14   question that can't be answered in the abstract.           It's a

15   question of how material the variance was.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:         No, but why isn't your

17   answer to him that in the case in which there is a

18   variance you have an indictment; in the case that you're

19   talking about there is none?           And the reason I press you

20   on that is that I thought the essence of your case was

21   that there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury

22   function has not been performed and he is entitled to

23   the grand jury function before he goes to trial.

24              MR. BAGGOT:      Correct.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:         And if that is the nub of

 1   your position, then I would have thought your answer to

 2   Justice Stevens was what I suggested.                If that's not

 3   your answer to Justice Stevens, then I'm not sure that I

 4   understand your case.

 5                 MR. BAGGOT:     Well, Your Honor, our case is

 6   simply that where a material element is omitted the

 7   grand jury -- something went wrong in the grand jury

 8   proceeding, and the only remedy for that is to return

 9   it, the case, to the grand jury and let them have a

10   second go --

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:        What is the result of what

12   went wrong?    How do you characterize the grand jury

13   product in the case in which, as you put it, something

14   goes wrong?

15                 MR. BAGGOT:     Constitutionally deficient and

16   did not fulfill the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:        An insufficient -- in other

18   words, there is no indictment charging a crime?                Is

19   that --

20                 MR. BAGGOT:     That's correct, Your Honor, no

21   crime, and the reason for that -- I'll go one step

22   further -- is because there's no way of knowing whether

23   the Government --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But that's not an

25   element.   You talk about essential facts and material --

 1   I mean, the statute makes it a crime to intentionally

 2   attempt to enter the United States having previously

 3   been deported and all that.           It doesn't say anything

 4   about presenting false identification.             So why are those

 5   essential facts when they're not part of what the

 6   statute prohibits?

 7              MR. BAGGOT:         Because that is -- there must

 8   be facts to show what the overt act was.             Just providing

 9   a legal memorandum of what the elements of the offense

10   are doesn't do any good.        What the Constitution

11   contemplates is that the essential facts be laid out.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Suppose this indictment

13   charged not an attempt to enter, but unlawful entry.

14   Then the indictment would be sufficient, right?                There

15   wouldn't be any problem with it?

16              MR. BAGGOT:         Well, if it --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It charged, not an

18   attempt, but an unlawful entry.             Anything missing from

19   the indictment?

20              MR. BAGGOT:         No, because that's a general

21   intent crime.     There's no specific intent and no

22   requirement that he perform any overt act.

23              JUSTICE ALITO:          And the defendant could be

24   convicted of an attempt under such an indictment, could

25   he not?

 1                 MR. BAGGOT:      Under such an indictment, under

 2   this case he could not, because he was under the

 3   constant surveillance of the INS at the time and in law

 4   that is not a legal indictment, not a legal reentry, an

 5   illegal reentry.     It's one of those quirks in the law,

 6   and that's why they charged the attempt, to avoid these

 7   questions of whether he was under the constant control

 8   and surveillance of the immigration authorities, which

 9   he was.     He never got by secondary.             So that's why the

10   charge was attempt as opposed to unlawful entry.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:       But in that situation, you

12   wouldn't know what the substantial step was, would you?

13                 MR. BAGGOT:      No, and --

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:       The indictment wouldn't tell

15   you what the substantial step was.

16                 MR. BAGGOT:      And there wouldn't be any need

17   either because it's not a specific intent crime and

18   there's no requirement --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:       If the defendant was

20   convicted of the lesser included offense of attempt

21   under an indictment charging the completed offense?

22                 MR. BAGGOT:      Attempt is not a lesser

23   included.    The Congress has intended to make attempt on

24   the same level as the substantive offense.               That is the

25   way the case law has been coming out.               So whether he


                                      46

 1   enters, whether he attempts, or whether he's found in

 2   the United States are all on an equal par.          It's not a

 3   lesser included.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, I don't understand

 5   that.    You're saying it's a separate offense, but a

 6   lesser included offense is a separate offense.          It just

 7   happens to be embraced within some other offense.

 8                 MR. BAGGOT:     Well, it has the same guideline

 9   punishment.    It has the same treatment as the unlawful

10   entry.   And they're treated -- we have case law in our

11   circuit that says, I think it is Corrales Beltran, that

12   says the attempt is a substantive offense, even though

13   it sounds contradictory.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        What does that mean, if

15   you're tried for illegal entry and the Government

16   doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under

17   supervision when you get in, the jury could not convict

18   of attempt?

19                 MR. BAGGOT:     If he was charged that way,

20   they probably could, yes.        There could be a two-count

21   indictment or there could be alternatives.          But that

22   wasn't this case.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        And that would be okay,

24   just charge with attempt without setting forth the overt

25   acts for the attempt?

 1                 MR. BAGGOT:      Well, they would have to set

 2   out the overt act and the essential facts that

 3   constitute the overt act.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Suppose that it's an

 5   assault and the indictment says on such and such a day,

 6   at such and such a time, he assaulted the postman,

 7   right?     You also have to say what, that he waved his

 8   fist or that he had a knife?              You have to say that in

 9   the indictment?

10                 MR. BAGGOT:      No, I don't think so.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:         No.    All right.   So I

12   thought normally essential facts means simply the

13   facts -- you can state the essential facts by writing

14   the statute and normally that tells you.             Now, is that

15   true?    One case that seems to go the other way is

16   Russell.

17                 MR. BAGGOT:      Normally, yes, sir.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Normally, yes.

19                 MR. BAGGOT:      That's correct.       However, in

20   this case there is a peculiar meaning to the word

21   "attempt" that when Congress used the word "attempt"

22   they meant to bring with that word its requirements

23   under the common law.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Why more than any other

25   word in the statute?      "Attempt," people know what that

 1   means.

 2                MR. BAGGOT:       Well, they do and they don't.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:          And they also know what

 4   "assault" means.   And if you tried, you could spell out

 5   "assault."   They know what "robbery" means, but you

 6   could spell it out.

 7                So why does the Ninth Circuit think this one

 8   you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't

 9   have to?

10                MR. BAGGOT:       Well, that's why they had an en

11   banc determination, because the judges were in disarray

12   over that question.     But at the time of this trial of

13   the en banc decision in the Ninth Circuit,

14   Gracidas-Ulibarry, had established concretely that the

15   intent of the legislature was to incorporate the common

16   law meaning of the word "attempt."

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. Baggot, could I come

18   back to your answer to my earlier question.             You said

19   you could only be convicted of the lesser included

20   offense if the lesser included offense is set forth

21   explicitly in the indictment.             Are you sure of that?

22                MR. BAGGOT:       No, sir.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Are you sure that's the

24   law?

25                MR. BAGGOT:       No, but here under 1326 it's


                                      49

 1   quite different.   The intent of the legislature was that

 2   the attempt would itself be a substantive offense.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            As I said in my previous

 4   question, every lesser included offense is itself a

 5   substantive offense.      That doesn't distinguish attempt

 6   from anything else.     And my understanding is if you're

 7   charged with a greater offense, the lesser can be a

 8   subject of conviction even though it's not explicitly

 9   set forth in the indictment.

10              MR. BAGGOT:         Yes, that's correct.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And if that is the case

12   here, then it seems to me he could have been convicted

13   of attempt without ever having had set forth in the

14   indictment the overt act that you demand.

15              MR. BAGGOT:         Well, that's a good point.       But

16   under our -- all I can tell you, Justice Scalia, is that

17   under our case law the attempt is considered a

18   substantive offense.      That's been the law --

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But substantive offense

20   is one thing.   Lesser included, I think you said earlier

21   it couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to

22   the same punishment.      So it is not lesser?

23              MR. BAGGOT:         Under this statute, under 1326,

24   that's the ruling of our circuit.

25              Your Honor, in conclusion, I'd just like to

 1   emphasize that if the Government's position is adapted,

 2   what you will have is judges reviewing the decision of

 3   the grand jury whether or not to allege certain

 4   elements, essential elements of offenses.                 That is

 5   challenging the independence of the grand jury, which is

 6   part of the structure set up by the Constitution, that

 7   the grand jury is a separate institution.                 Anything that

 8   the grand jury does, any mistakes that are made, need to

 9   be returned to the grand jury and not be reviewed by a

10   single judge, a panel of judges, or an en banc or any

11   court.

12              Are there any other questions by the Court?

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Mr.

14   Baggot.

15              MR. BAGGOT:         Thank you, sir.

18              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

19                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20              MR. DREEBEN:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Dreeben, is attempt a

22   lesser included offense of the substantive offense of

23   illegal reentry?

24              MR. DREEBEN:         It's a substantive offense.

25   It is an attempt offense.         I wouldn't necessarily


                                      51
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   describe it as lesser included, but Rule 31 of the

 2   Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does allow a trial

 3   judge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury

 4   when attempt is a violation of the substantive law.

 5               I should say that the Government's position

 6   is that there does not need to be a separate charge of

 7   attempt in the indictment in order to permit Rule 31 to

 8   operate, but there is a circuit split over whether

 9   lesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury

10   unless they are included in the indictment.

11               So we're not operating under a uniform rule

12   that would always allow us to do that, and I'm not sure

13   which way the Ninth Circuit goes on that, although I

14   could hazard a guess.

15               (Laughter.)

16               The problem that we have here is that we are

17   living under a rule of law in the Ninth Circuit and in

18   at least one other circuit that forces the Government to

19   pay a tremendous penalty when a mistake is made in an

20   indictment, and it does happen.         Justice Souter, I can

21   assure you that judges dismiss plenty of indictments for

22   failure to dismiss -- state elements, but they don't get

23   them all.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:        But Mr. Dreeben, isn't the

25   point that the tremendous cost that you refer to is a


                                   52
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   tremendous cost that the Government pays by its choice

 2   to go to trial, as opposed to going back to the grand

 3   jury and making sure that it has an adequate indictment?

 4                 MR. DREEBEN:     Well, the Government is often

 5   quite confident that it's correct.                And I think if you

 6   put yourself in the position of the prosecutors in this

 7   case, you can see why that's true.                But there are myriad

 8   rules and sub-rules of substantive law that this Court

 9   will never review, that require the Government to

10   conform with various pleading obligations.               They're all

11   below the radar screen.       But when you have a rule of

12   automatic reversal like this, they jump up to

13   prominence.    And the reason that they do is because the

14   entire criminal justice system, victims, witnesses, the

15   judge, the prosecutors, the defense bar, jurors,

16   everybody is being asked to go through a trial that was

17   conducted on an error-free basis by hypothesis, simply

18   because there was a mistake at the charging phase.               And

19   the petit jury's verdict we submit makes it clear that

20   that mistake does not entitle the judicial system to say

21   let's throw it all out and start again simply as a

22   prophylactic mechanism.

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If you concede there was

24   an error, is there anything to prevent us from saying we

25   don't accept that concession, and have you rebrief and


                                     53

 1   argue the question of whether or not an overt act is

 2   required?

 3                 MR. DREEBEN:      Well, I hope that if the Court

 4   does not choose to decide the question on which it

 5   granted certiorari, that it does hold that the Ninth

 6   Circuit's substantive rule of law here is incorrect, and

 7   that there was nothing wrong with the indictment.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But can we do that in the

 9   face of your concession without having reargument?

10                 MR. DREEBEN:      Oh, I think this Court can do

11   anything it chooses, regardless of the Government's

12   concession.

13                 (Laughter.)

14                 But we're not conceding that the Ninth

15   Circuit was correct.      We simply didn't challenge it

16   because the important question for us is the rule of law

17   on harmless error.     This pleading rule is something that

18   we can comply with.     It may be wrong, but it's

19   something, like many wrong rules of law, we live with.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

21   Mr. Dreeben.    The case is submitted.
