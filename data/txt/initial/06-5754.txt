 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN

 8                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 9              MR. COCHRAN:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              Under the system described in

12   Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges

13   would no longer be tied to the sentencing range

14   indicated in the guidelines.              That, of course, was a

15   passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham

16   versus California.      Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this

17   case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it

18   meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are

19   merely advisory provisions.               The Government's assertion

20   that the guidelines deserve a presumption of

21   reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim

22   put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the

23   Booker decision.

24              The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the

25   Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued

 1   a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that

 2   they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek

 3   sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary

 4   cases.

 5              The district court below in this case did

 6   not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a

 7   33-month within guideline sentence.                     The district court

 8   did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact

 9   that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How can you say that,

11   given that at the sentencing hearing, that military

12   record was brought out, his physical ailments were

13   brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that

14   was brought out?   And indeed, the judge was assisting

15   the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it

16   was presented.

17              MR. COCHRAN:          In the district court,

18   Mr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military

19   records, health concerns, he -- the district court

20   received that information.          The district court did not

21   consider that information because there's nothing in the

22   record where the district judge weighed any of that

23   information to determine what -- what effect to give any

24   of it.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, you know, you don't

 1   get a summary judgment case all the time.                    I used to get

 2   them, and the district court would hear all the

 3   arguments and write down the word denied.                    Does that

 4   mean he didn't consider the arguments?                    That's a very

 5   common thing.     Here we have a district judge, he hears

 6   all the arguments.      The attorneys brought it out.                It's

 7   in the file.     He reads the presentence report.                 It's all

 8   there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go

 9   apply the guidelines.        So how can you say he didn't

10   consider them?

11                MR. COCHRAN:          Justice Breyer, the district

12   judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the

13   stuff, and I --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:              No, he doesn't in a summary

15   judgment case either.        I mean, I've had quite a few of

16   them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied.

17   That was the opinion.

18                MR. COCHRAN:          Well, in the instance of a

19   summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that

20   requires the district court to state in open court in

21   front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of

22   sentence.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:              Now, he says the reasons

24   are these.   I think that the guidelines sentence is a

25   reasonable sentence.        Would that be sufficient?

 1               MR. COCHRAN:         It would not, Your Honor.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             Why not?        What in the

 3   statute or the law or the Constitution says that a

 4   district judge, although it might be good form in a

 5   difficult case to write more, but I've often written

 6   opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we

 7   feel are not sufficient to change the result.                   That

 8   means I don't think they're that great an argument, and

 9   I don't answer every single one.

10               MR. COCHRAN:         With regard to the first

11   question Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the

12   district court to simply state conclusions, which is

13   what happened in this case, that --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             Where in the law does it

15   say that?

16               MR. COCHRAN:         Well, in 3553(c), it requires

17   that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of

18   the particular sentence.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Where -- I'm looking at

20   that.   It says shall consider.             Am I missing something?

21               MR. COCHRAN:         The preamble states --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can you give me your page

23   cite?

24               MR. COCHRAN:         I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page

25   3-A of Petitioner's brief in the appendix.                  It states,

 1   "the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open

 2   court the reasons for its imposition of the particular

 3   sentence."   And that's what we contend requires the

 4   district court to explain the facts that the court is

 5   relying on to impose the particular sentence in the

 6   case.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            So it isn't sufficient, in

 8   your view, that the judge just says, the reason I

 9   imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence,

10   and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?

11                MR. COCHRAN:        That's correct, Your Honor.

12   Because the guidelines don't take into account all the

13   myriad facts, and in this case, did not take into

14   account the military record, the employment record,

15   Mr. Rita's health concerns.             The guidelines specifically

16   did not take those into account.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            I think these other factors

18   that have been brought out, while they're serious

19   factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a

20   different sentence.     Suppose he adds those words?

21                MR. COCHRAN:        Your Honor, I think the --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            What I'm worried about

23   basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special

24   category that requires a judge to give special reasons

25   in a guideline case.      I think it's the same as any other

 1   matter.     Judges do normally give reasons.              And I'd worry

 2   a bit about creating a special situation where district

 3   judges have to do something unusual.

 4                 MR. COCHRAN:         I don't think that this is

 5   unusual, Your Honor.        I think the court has to explain

 6   the rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only

 7   does it have to do so in court, in front of the

 8   defendant, so the defendant understands the sentence

 9   that he is receiving --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, I get where you're

11   going.     Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy

12   you?     And of course, like any other matter, judges do

13   normally give reasons.         They do normally reject

14   arguments with reasons, and it's the same here.                Would

15   that satisfy you?

16                 MR. COCHRAN:         I think it would have to be

17   specific to the issues raised by the parties.                And in

18   this case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address

19   the three issues that Mr. Rita put forward and discuss

20   those:     His military record, his employment, his health

21   concerns.     It would have to address any issues that the

22   Government would raise, and any issues that the district

23   judge was considering that maybe neither party had

24   raised to the court as well.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             How do you reconcile the

 1   language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court

 2   shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if

 3   the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range

 4   described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall

 5   state the specific reason for the imposition of a

 6   sentence different from the guidelines?

 7               Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy

 8   between giving reasons and giving the specific reason.

 9   Where does that line fall in your estimation?

10               MR. COCHRAN:         Well, I think foremost, Your

11   Honor, is that that provision came about prior to the

12   Booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory.               And

13   what that addresses and what it was meant to address was

14   if the court were to depart, then it was -- it needed to

15   explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the

16   sentencing commission to take that information into

17   account in revising the guidelines.

18               That is still a purpose with the sentencing

19   commission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still

20   use that information.      But it -- at the very least, we

21   need information from the sentencing judge about each of

22   the matters that he or she --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You haven't answered my

24   question.   I mean, you explain why it's put in there,

25   but I want to know what is the difference between giving


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the reasons and giving the specific reason.

 2               MR. COCHRAN:         The specific reason I think,

 3   Your Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can

 4   take that information into account in later revisions of

 5   the guidelines.   That was the purpose at the point that

 6   statute was passed.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But are you saying now that

 8   that distinction should be ignored?

 9               MR. COCHRAN:         I don't know, Your Honor, if

10   it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the

11   district court needs to give as many reasons, or as

12   clear a reason for the imposition of the particular

13   sentence.   That will help --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But it sounds to me as

15   though you want all the reasons to be specific.             I mean,

16   I understand your argument.            But if we accept that

17   argument, then the distinction between reason and

18   specific reason basically is going to be a matter of

19   history, and perhaps it should be.

20               MR. COCHRAN:         It, it may, Your Honor.        And,

21   and because that provision predated this Court's Booker

22   decision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the

23   relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So your position would

25   be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed


                                       10

 1   would have to -- that the trial judge would also have to

 2   go through -- now this defendant maintained his

 3   innocence.   He didn't express any remorse.             He accused a

 4   Government agent of perjury.            All that, he would have to

 5   take into account, just as specifically?

 6                MR. COCHRAN:        Your Honor, I think that the

 7   Court certainly could consider all of that; and -- and

 8   if pressed by the Government would need to consider

 9   that.   But certainly at a minimum, the Court needs to

10   --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Isn't that what the

12   Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?

13                MR. COCHRAN:        It did, Your Honor, and again

14   the district court never came out with any specifics

15   regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion

16   that it felt that the guideline range was not

17   inappropriate.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose the district court

19   says I give these following -- I've considered these

20   following specific factors.            But in my view, the

21   consistency and nationwide uniformity that the

22   guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and

23   for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?

24                MR. COCHRAN:        I don't --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is that an inappropriate

 1   judgment for the district court to make?

 2                 MR. COCHRAN:        I think it's inappropriate,

 3   Your Honor, because while there should be uniformity in

 4   an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not

 5   the end all and be all.         3553(a) addresses

 6   individualized sentencing of the defendant before the

 7   court.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's not the end all.

 9   Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great

10   importance.    You don't think that the Booker opinion --

11   or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity

12   and consistency as an important factor?

13                 MR. COCHRAN:        I don't believe the Booker

14   decision rejected that, Your Honor.                      What I believe the

15   Booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory

16   guidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing

17   practices, then uniformity is going to have to give way

18   to some extent.    At least at the very beginning.

19                 Once the district courts apply the 3553(a)

20   factors, and go through the statute, and consider the

21   guidelines, the district courts will then explain their

22   rationale; and then that rationale will be -- in our

23   opinion, will show where the shortcomings of the

24   guidelines are.

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Mr. Cochran, are you arguing

 1   the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth

 2   Amendment?

 3                MR. COCHRAN:        Not as it was applied.      It

 4   came close in the sense that the district court was

 5   laboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the

 6   guidelines held some control.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:         If it didn't violate the

 8   Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the

 9   Sentencing Reform Act?

10                MR. COCHRAN:        Well, it came -- it may have

11   violated the Sixth Amendment.             I don't know that I would

12   concede that.   But to avoid any constitutional issue, if

13   we analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district

14   court didn't comply with the statute.

15                JUSTICE ALITO:         You can't say whether it did

16   or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?

17                MR. COCHRAN:        The district court held the

18   guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.

19                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, was your client's

20   sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been

21   submitted to the jury?

22                MR. COCHRAN:        Well, under -- under a pure

23   advisory system -- and I think Your Honor is addressing

24   the cross-reference in this matter -- in a purely

25   advisory system, the guidelines were calculated


                                       13
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   correctly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely

 2   advisory system, the district court could look at that

 3   cross-reference, understand that it came about from

 4   uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it.

 5                 But by not doing so in this case, and that

 6   cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range,

 7   then this case may very well be unconstitutional because

 8   of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Mr. Cochran, you do

10   contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been

11   mandatory, there would have been a violation of the

12   Sixth Amendment.

13                 MR. COCHRAN:        No question, Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Because of the, the

15   accessory after the fact point.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's right, Your Honor,

17   absolutely.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Then the question

19   ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to

20   say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in

21   the guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate

22   court judge.    And you think it does violate the Sixth

23   Amendment?

24                 MR. COCHRAN:        Our position is that the

25   presumption does violate the Sixth --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Then I guess the argument

 2   of the other side, which I would like you to address, is

 3   that, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the

 4   of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied

 5   3553 -- uh, 3553(a).       And of course, 3553(a) includes

 6   all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make

 7   a big point of that in 3553(a).

 8                 So why -- why couldn't you say, you know,

 9   all these factors are taken into account by the

10   commission?    They start with an effort to a apply them

11   in typical cases.    This is their judgment in typical

12   cases.   So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and --

13   at least in a typical case.

14                 MR. COCHRAN:        Your Honor, the guidelines

15   should be consulted.       No question --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no, not consulting

17   them.    What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a

18   judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth

19   Amendment?    All I'm trying to do here is not whether the

20   guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent.                Congress

21   wanted to apply them.       We excised the mandatory to

22   comply with the Sixth Amendment.                Now, what else do we

23   have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment?                Because

24   I would think unless we have to do something else, we

25   shouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.

 1              MR. COCHRAN:            I would contend, Your Honor,

 2   that the Court needs to very clearly explain that the

 3   guidelines are, are a reference.                 They are --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               The guidelines are what?

 5              MR. COCHRAN:            Are a reference.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Can you say it is an

 7   initial benchmark?

 8              MR. COCHRAN:            I don't -- when we start

 9   establishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's

10   where we, we --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               So benchmarks are bad.

12   Presumption is bad.       Great weight, that's bad?

13              MR. COCHRAN:            That's bad, too.          And I think

14   it's just another thing to consider.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Does it matter what

16   judge did in other cases?            I mean, if we look on the day

17   before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I

18   think this case is different, so I'm going to depart,

19   and the day after he says I know what the guidelines

20   are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence?

21              I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says

22   I looked at the guidelines and I think they're

23   appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by

24   something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed

25   to what he said?   Which is, well, I cannot find that


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they're inappropriate?

 2              MR. COCHRAN:         And what that tells me,

 3   Mr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt

 4   that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the

 5   judge was bound -- in other words, shifted the burden to

 6   the defendant to say, well, I -- unless you can show

 7   that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a

 8   benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that

 9   that is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits.

10              If the guidelines are advisory, if they are

11   but one of many factors to be considered, together with

12   all of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use

13   that information, can use that reference.              But once it

14   starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines --

15   and the statute doesn't admit to that.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about the point that

17   Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been

18   taken into account by the sentencing commission because

19   Congress told them to consider those same factors?

20              MR. COCHRAN:         Well, Your Honor, the

21   sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken

22   into account all of the factors.              In the very first

23   guideline manual, 1987, the sentencing commission itself

24   said it could not take into account all of the facts

25   that play into human conduct.


                                      17
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           There are two separate

 2   things there.   The general aims of sentencing, the four

 3   basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission

 4   certainly took into account.            A separate thing was the

 5   rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has

 6   not been fully considered by the guidelines.

 7                And there the original version, I believe,

 8   said that we've considered nothing thoroughly.                   Except

 9   for certain specific matters that had been mentioned

10   like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily.                   Now,

11   that is what you're thinking of?               I mean, if that's what

12   you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what

13   your present point is.

14                MR. COCHRAN:        I'm not, Your Honor.            First of

15   all, I don't know and would contend that the initial

16   sentencing commission did not take into account all of

17   the four purposes of sentencing.               They centered on crime

18   control --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:           That's because when they

20   looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the

21   rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into

22   account, it was there was a consensus among experts that

23   there isn't much you can do about it.                   That's different

24   from not taking into account.

25                MR. COCHRAN:        The other point I think with


                                       18
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   regard to that, Your Honor, is in looking at 3553(a)

 2   that statute gives the district court the dual commands

 3   of first considering all of those factors and then

 4   imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than

 5   necessary.     The statute does not give to the sentencing

 6   commission that obligation.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Cochran, I have this

 8   concern:     If we accept your submission that the district

 9   court should just consider the guidelines together with

10   everything else, give them a presumption of validity,

11   anything else, just something to consider, that would

12   presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with

13   the district court's findings of fact.

14                 But the district court's sentence is going

15   to go on appeal.    And the appellate court in reviewing

16   it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the

17   appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this

18   person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the

19   record, military service, you know, which we think

20   should have been taken into account.                      And, therefore, we

21   set it aside.

22                 Now, the next case that comes up, which

23   doesn't have the element of military service, in all

24   other respects the same as your client's case, it comes

25   up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals


                                         19

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here

 2   and therefore we affirm the sentence.

 3               Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of

 4   a fact necessary for the process of judicial review,

 5   even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the

 6   district court's determination?                He would not get that

 7   sentence but for this fact.

 8               MR. COCHRAN:           That's correct, Your Honor.

 9   And --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:              So you haven't shown us a

11   way out of the problem.

12               MR. COCHRAN:           In a purely advisory system,

13   the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and

14   maximum.   And as this Court has said in Cunningham, if

15   the Court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and

16   maximum, then the factual finding as to where within

17   that is up to the district court.

18               It's only when we establish thresholds as

19   the guidelines do we run into the constitutional

20   problem.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, even if you don't --

22   don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline,

23   you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review,

24   guidelines or not.

25               If the -- if the appellate court says, oh,


                                         20
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below

 2   was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact

 3   does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the

 4   sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is

 5   made a necessary condition for giving the higher

 6   sentence.

 7               So you haven't -- you haven't solved the

 8   problem of the, of the apparent conflict between --

 9   between Booker and the advisory guidelines.

10               MR. COCHRAN:          Well, I think so long as the

11   district court can evaluate and consider and potentially

12   reject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can

13   consider the effect of -- of the person's military

14   record, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which

15   is separate and apart from someone who may have been an

16   Army recruiter --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're not focusing on my

18   point.   I concede that the district court is free as a

19   bird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review.

20   And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness

21   is going to make a particular fact determinative of

22   whether this sentence can stand or not.                  Isn't that

23   right?

24               MR. COCHRAN:          It is.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And that's going to be a


                                        21
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   problem.

 2              MR. COCHRAN:          I think what the court would

 3   have -- the appellate court would have to do is evaluate

 4   all of that through the prism of 3553(a).                     Is the

 5   sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction

 6   that the court below could have imposed.                     And if not,

 7   for whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to

 8   the district court.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, what if

10   there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court

11   said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other

12   judges have done; he presses a button on the computer,

13   give me what the sentences were looking at these facts,

14   and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the

15   sentence was.   And he says this seems to me no different

16   than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose.

17   Is there any problem with that?

18              MR. COCHRAN:          There is.              And again, because

19   3553(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Yes, well, he looks

21   at all the individual factors and he says they seem not

22   terribly different from these 100 other cases and the

23   range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7

24   years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.

25              MR. COCHRAN:          If the district court


                                       22
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   considers all those facts and considers what may have

 2   been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than

 3   necessary given those facts, then the court can do that.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How is that

 5   different than the -- how is that different than looking

 6   at the guidelines, which did that in a much more

 7   comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything

 8   different in this case from the normal guidelines case

 9   and so I'm going to impose that sentence?

10                 MR. COCHRAN:        Well, the guidelines didn't

11   take everything into account, and the sentencing courts

12   were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of

13   being required to follow this book that necessarily

14   didn't incorporate all of the human factors in

15   sentencing.    And they have held to that.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, it did incorporate

17   them in that district judges were free to depart from

18   the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one

19   of these human factors not considered by the guidelines

20   which existed in the particular case.

21                 MR. COCHRAN:        In theory, yes,

22   Justice Scalia.    But in practice, no, because what

23   happened in the very cases as United States versus Foy

24   out of the Ninth Circuit, the defendant in that case

25   argued to the district court that he should have a


                                        23
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   departure based upon lack of mutual guidance, and it was

 2   a reasoned decision.       It went to the Ninth Circuit.             The

 3   Ninth Circuit found it to be a reasoned decision; and

 4   within the next amendment process of the Sentencing

 5   Commission, it was eliminated as a departure basis with

 6   no discussion at all.

 7                 So yes, there may have been departures, but

 8   they were systematically removed, and in fact chapters

 9   5(h) and 5(a) show that very clearly.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, if they were

11   systematically removed then all of these other human

12   factors that you're complaining about were considered by

13   the guideline commission and were simply rejected.

14                MR. COCHRAN:         They weren't considered, Your

15   Honor, and in the history of those amendments that's

16   borne out.

17                And if the Court has no further questions,

18   I'd like to reserve some time.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 1   presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence

 2   imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that

 3   this Court announced in United States versus Booker.

 4   The guidelines represent the integration of the multiple

 5   purposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that

 6   the district court is obligated to consider.             The

 7   commission also represents an expert body that has

 8   considered the various parameters of sentencing and the

 9   fact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has

10   made an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Isn't it true, just to get

12   one thought out on the table, that there are factors

13   that the guidelines don't -- did not consider, such as

14   military service?

15              MR. DREEBEN:           Justice Stevens, the

16   commission considered that factor and then determined

17   that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence

18   outside the guidelines.

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:              But isn't it true that

20   under the guideline no weight is given to military

21   service?

22              MR. DREEBEN:           The guidelines specifically do

23   not give weight to it.        They permit a judge --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:              What should a judge do if

25   he thought some weight should be given to military

 1   service?

 2               MR. DREEBEN:         Under Booker the judge should

 3   do that.   That is the difference between an advisory

 4   guidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system.

 5   The judge can give weight to factors That the commission

 6   decided should not have weight in the sentencing

 7   process.   That is the essence of what it means for the

 8   guidelines --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And presumably cannot give

10   weight to factors that the commission decided should

11   have weight.

12               MR. DREEBEN:         He can do that, too,

13   Justice Scalia.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            Are we back to the original

15   version, which I'll read what it says.                  It says:   "With

16   a few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin,

17   creed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those

18   exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the

19   kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else

20   in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for

21   departure in an unusual case."              That's what it said.        A

22   part of the guidelines in the heartland.                  If it's not

23   the heartland, depart.

24               Now, what I wonder is are we not back under

25   your theory of it just to where we were when it started

 1   out, before the commission started ruling all these

 2   things out and began to make all its -- the judge could

 3   do that.

 4                MR. DREEBEN:          I think we're back,

 5   Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first

 6   set of guidelines, because even under the first set of

 7   guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory

 8   unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating

 9   circumstance that wasn't taken into account.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:             We said we took nothing

11   into account and therefore any circumstance that makes

12   the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an

13   exception.

14                MR. DREEBEN:          I understand that,

15   Justice Breyer.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:             You're saying more than

17   that is necessary.

18                MR. DREEBEN:          I think that the

19   reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker

20   and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the

21   judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's

22   different from what's described in the guidelines.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             He could do this:   He could

24   set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline

25   itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take

 1   account of sentencing.        But suppose he doesn't do that.

 2   Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption

 3   in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an

 4   unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the

 5   guideline?

 6                MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Breyer, I think we

 7   have to distinguish between what the job of the district

 8   court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and

 9   in this case, the Government is arguing for a

10   presumption of reasonableness on appeal.                 Once the

11   district judge has determined that the guidelines

12   sentence aligns with his own application of the section

13   3553(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of

14   appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable

15   sentence.    The defendant of course has the opportunity,

16   or the Government if the Government has appealed, to

17   show that that presumption is overcome.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But unless there is a way

19   to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no

20   clear way to distinguish the presumption from the

21   mandate.    The mandate is gone.             You say yes, they

22   consider other things.        But unless we can calibrate the

23   presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate

24   was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something

25   like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in

 1   practice.

 2               MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Souter, I'm not sure

 3   that that would be true even if what we were talking

 4   about was a direction to the district judge to presume

 5   that he would impose a guidelines sentence.                    But that's

 6   not what we're talking about.            The district judge does

 7   not operate and does not have to operate under the

 8   position that we're arguing for with a presumption that

 9   the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless

10   persuaded otherwise.     The judge's obligation is to --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:           He doesn't have to do it

12   unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.

13               MR. DREEBEN:        I would think that what the

14   judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his

15   statutory obligations.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, perhaps I

17   misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this

18   concern, and I thought it was his concern as well.                    At

19   the appellate level, is the presumption something that

20   can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing

21   or is it just an initial benchmark?                    We're playing with

22   standards and words here.

23               MR. DREEBEN:        Well, we are.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And when we talk about

25   presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a


                                      29
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   little strange in any event.              You usually talk about

 2   presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.

 3              MR. DREEBEN:            That's true, Justice Kennedy.

 4   But I think what it reflects at the appellate level is

 5   that the court of appeals enters the case with an

 6   attitude that, our job is to decide whether what the

 7   district judge did was reasonable.                   We can operate --

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               So we write that this is

 9   an additive thing?

10              MR. DREEBEN:            Yes, I think that it's not so

11   different from the court of appeals saying we can enter

12   this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a

13   guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges

14   that shows us a good reason otherwise.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, is your view -- on

16   your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind

17   of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to

18   engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence

19   only if it is shown to be unreasonable?

20              MR. DREEBEN:            The latter, Justice Souter.

21   And I think that in that regard there is a range of

22   reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a

23   given set of facts.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, if you -- if

25   you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with

 1   the same identical background and everything else, one

 2   judge says, I think military service should be taken

 3   into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines

 4   by 3 years.    The judge next door says, I don't think it

 5   should be taken into account so I'm going to impose the

 6   guideline sentence.      Both cases are appealed.               They're

 7   consolidated for argument.           What is the court of appeals

 8   supposed to do?    Uphold both of them?

 9                 MR. DREEBEN:        The court of appeals can

10   uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual

11   sentence that's imposed is reasonable.                   And in the

12   second case that the Court is going to hear today the

13   Government argues for a proportionality principle that

14   should govern the review of sentencing.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           What is reasonable is -- is

16   not merely a sort of number within a spectrum.                   It seems

17   to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of

18   the reasons that are given.             And in the Chief Justice's

19   view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for

20   two different sentences.          Does the, does the appellate

21   court in his example say, well, I think reasonable

22   people could go either way on that, so however it comes

23   out it's fine on appellate review?                  Isn't that what the

24   court would have to do in order to affirm both

25   sentences, other things being equal?

 1              MR. DWYER:          You're right, Justice Souter,

 2   and I can't say that that would be the first choice of

 3   the Congress that enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Isn't it clear that it

 5   would have been the last choice of the Congress?

 6              MR. DREEBEN:            It is, and it's not the first

 7   choice of the Government, either.                  But it strikes me

 8   that it is something of an inevitability once this Court

 9   has declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible

10   under the Constitution if judicial factfinding --

11              JUSTICE ALITO:             What does the Sixth

12   Amendment have to do with the selection of the

13   sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed?                 How can

14   there be a Sixth Amendment violation if either the

15   guidelines or our case law says military service is or

16   is not a relevant factor?            I don't see how that has

17   anything to do with anything that you can get out of the

18   Sixth Amendment.

19              MR. DREEBEN:            It probably does not,

20   Justice Alito.     But what happened in the first part of

21   Booker is that the Court declared that the guidelines

22   are advisory and advice.           It's advice that can be

23   accepted or rejected.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:               I know, but Booker says

25   what we're trying to do is to come close to what

 1   Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment.

 2              Now, what I think we're talking about now --

 3   I think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you

 4   clarified something very well for me, which is that in

 5   this case we're talking about the situation where the

 6   district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then

 7   what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the

 8   attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission

 9   thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you

10   have to -- you better show me a good reason to think to

11   the contrary.   Fine.

12              But the interesting problem is the problem

13   of the next case which you're now talking about, is,

14   well, what happens if the district judge and when should

15   be the district judge and how free should the district

16   judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence

17   even if it's not an unusual case.

18              MR. DREEBEN:          Let me try to address that and

19   try to address Justice Alito's point about the question

20   of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the

21   sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth

22   Amendment problem arises.

23              As I understand this Court's sequence of

24   opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent

25   decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts

 2   found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may

 3   not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that

 4   fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the

 5   Court has announced and must be found by a jury.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Or some fact, not

 7   necessarily a particular fact.

 8              MR. DREEBEN:         Any fact at all, as a matter

 9   of fact is what the Court has said, although I

10   understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense

11   and the offender, not facts about the world such as the

12   prevalence of crime.

13              Now, what that leads me to conclude is that

14   in order to escape the bright line rule that's been

15   announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker

16   itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be

17   able to look at the set of facts that the jury found,

18   determine what level of punishment would be advised by,

19   say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose

20   that level of punishment if the judge feels that a

21   different level of punishment is appropriate.

22              If that is a correct understanding of what

23   this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge

24   does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory

25   guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing


                                      34
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then

 2   is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of

 3   that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to

 4   a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's

 5   imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and

 6   not an arbitrary one.

 7              Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not

 8   necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be

 9   able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission

10   said, that would be very good from the Government's

11   perspective.    But as I understand the complementary

12   rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory

13   guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be

14   treated as advice rather than mandate.                   So while the

15   guidelines have determined that military service is not

16   ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge

17   may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I ask you, this is the

19   hypothetical:    Supposing a judge thinks military service

20   is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a

21   little below the guidelines.             But then he says, I

22   recognize that in this circuit there is a strong

23   interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has

24   adopted a rule where they will presume a within

25   guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in

 1   those cases.    And I think with respect to the court of

 2   appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the

 3   guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own

 4   judgment is that it should be slightly lower.                 What

 5   should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?

 6              MR. DREEBEN:           I think the court of appeals

 7   should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of

 8   law, which is that the judge --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Should reverse the judge

10   then, within a -- a within guidelines sentence?

11              MR. DREEBEN:           In the circumstance,

12   Justice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two

13   different types of review.           In the circumstance in which

14   a district judge operates with what I'll call legal

15   blinders on that prevent him from complying with --

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:              No.      He operates with

17   total candor.   He's saying exactly what he feels like

18   saying.

19              MR. DREEBEN:           I'm hoping that it's a

20   misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said,

21   because the court of appeals should not have told the

22   judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, they didn't say

24   you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be

25   affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.

 1                 MR. DREEBEN:         Judges are still obligated to

 2   comply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise

 3   discretion.    Now if a judge decides I might as a

 4   personal matter if I were writing the guidelines write

 5   them differently, and I might give great weight to

 6   military service, but one of the things that I'm

 7   required to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the

 8   need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants

 9   who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and

10   have similar records.        And therefore, I am going to

11   moderate my own personal preference and not impose a

12   significant outside the range sentence, in order to

13   ensure that I fully have taken into account the fact

14   that we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal

15   district judges, and we cannot have all our own personal

16   guidelines systems.

17                 Now if a judge does that, I don't think

18   there's anything wrong with that.                  I think that judge

19   has actually complied with --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if the court of

21   appeals does that?      What if the court of appeals says

22   we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of

23   them do not take military service into account, one

24   does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the

25   interest in uniformity.          And so even though that one

 1   judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to

 2   depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?

 3              MR. DREEBEN:         Mr. Chief Justice, I think

 4   there's a difference between a sentence that varies from

 5   what other judges would do and a sentence that is

 6   unreasonable.

 7              If the sentence that is different from what

 8   other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and

 9   coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of

10   disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like

11   this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says

12   in my view military service means that this defendant

13   gets probation.

14              Or to take an example that's on the other

15   side, suppose that the judge says this defendant

16   actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal

17   history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted

18   before of lying to the Government about his gun charges.

19   I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or

20   near it and give him eight years.               I think in those

21   circumstances a court of appeals can and should say,

22   hold on, this is a view that the district judge is

23   entitled to take on the merits.             He's entitled to give

24   greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating

25   or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to

 1   this extent, or we're going to be left with a system in

 2   which disuniformity is the main principle.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:              It's not that complicated.

 4   All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in

 5   the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33

 6   percent of the defendants in the typical case have been

 7   in the Army.    And therefore, we think that just ordinary

 8   armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed --

 9   services in the military is not a reason for a

10   diminished sentence.       That's all, period.                Or they can

11   say it the other way, the absence of a military service

12   is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any

13   way you want.   And by the way, district judge, if you

14   disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because

15   we think it's unreasonable.             Okay.       What about that?

16              MR. DREEBEN:           That to me sounds identical to

17   the system that pre-existed Booker's holding.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:              It did.          But is there

19   anything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?

20              MR. DREEBEN:           This Court hasn't specifically

21   addressed --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, what do you think?

23   Because I would think that if you're going to answer

24   that question yes, you are saying that not even the

25   court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness

 1   among different defendants in respect to sentencing.

 2                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, Justice Breyer, I would

 3   like to be able to answer the question yes and say that

 4   courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal

 5   rules as --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's not sub-legal rules.

 7   What it's called is precedent.               What you do is you

 8   decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then

 9   the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you

10   decide it the same way.         And if a district judge doesn't

11   follow that, you reverse it.

12                 MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Breyer, if do you

13   that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning

14   as a sentencing commission.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Exactly.         You've simply

16   substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the

17   district court following circuit law for the guidelines.

18   And --

19                 MR. DREEBEN:        Exactly.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           If the guidelines are

21   unconstitutional because they make facts automatically

22   determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional

23   because it makes facts automatically determinative.

24                 MR. DREEBEN:        I assume too under the

25   rationale --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well then, in other words,

 2   the Constitution of the United States prevents the

 3   courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences

 4   who are -- that individuals who are in similar

 5   positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in

 6   similar ways.   That to me is possible, but of course

 7   I've been in dissent in these cases.                    But it seems to

 8   me --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So long as the jury

10   determines the facts that make them similar.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:             We're back --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:             The problem here is what

13   makes them similar.

14              MR. DREEBEN:          I understand this dialogue.

15   And what we have --

16              (Laughter.)

17              I too have been with the dissenters in these

18   cases, and what I'm trying to argue for here is a set of

19   principles that appellate courts can apply and that

20   district courts can look to when sentencing, that will

21   come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving

22   Congress's aims in the Sentencing Reform Act without

23   crossing over the bright line rule that this Court has

24   announced --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I don't know how

 1   terribly different it is than the normal review for

 2   abuse of discretion.      I mean, you don't even need two

 3   judges in my earlier question.              Let's say you have the

 4   same judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant

 5   who comes before him he says, I think if you have

 6   military service, you should get a reduction.              And then

 7   all of a sudden he says, I see you have military

 8   service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction.                I

 9   mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard

10   to be a little bit consistent?              And if that's the only

11   type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure

12   some degree of consistency in how similar individuals

13   are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises

14   any concern.

15               MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm

16   not arguing for any proposition that I think would raise

17   concern.   I do think that a general tenet of abuse of

18   discretion review is that the court of appeals can

19   affirm a result that it would not necessarily have

20   reached itself.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Dreeben, may I ask

22   you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised?

23   I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption

24   for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates

25   a district court sentence, that there is no presumption


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that binds the district judge.

 2                But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran

 3   made in his presentation was the district judge has to

 4   give reasons.   He -- this was just a summary paragraph

 5   at the end of the sentence hearing.                      He has to respond

 6   to what defendant presented.             He has to respond to what

 7   the Government presented.           There is an obligation

 8   stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's

 9   what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that

10   the court of appeals has used.               Reasons weren't given

11   for it.

12                MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Ginsburg, I don't

13   think there was anything problematic with what this

14   district judge did.      As Your Honor noted, this was a

15   sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing

16   hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with

17   defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive

18   bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward

19   departure.   The judge at least four times in this

20   transcript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the

21   judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the

22   purposes of sentencing and the factors that were

23   presented to him.     Now he did that and he made comments

24   along the way that indicate why he did not find physical

25   condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability


                                        43
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this

 2   defendant a lower sentence.

 3                 And in his ultimate explanation, though it

 4   is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors

 5   explicitly.     He pointed to the seriousness of the

 6   offense and he pointed to the need for public

 7   protection.

 8                 Now if you look at the legal obligations

 9   that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain

10   himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of

11   three different levels of explanation.                    First, in any

12   case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence.

13   Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24

14   months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular

15   reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end

16   of the range.    And finally, if the sentence is outside

17   the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for

18   a sentence outside the range.               That statutory framework

19   makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge

20   imposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no

21   reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met

22   his burden of explanation without having to respond

23   literally and in sequence to each argument that the

24   defendant has made.

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question?

 1   The district judge is reviewed under an abuse of

 2   discretion standard, which I take it means there's a

 3   presumption he got it right.              Is that correct?   There's

 4   a presumption the district judge sentence is correct?

 5              MR. DREEBEN:            Well, Justice Stevens, our

 6   position is more complicated than that, because within a

 7   guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the

 8   Government --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Why shouldn't there be

10   also the same presumption when it is outside the

11   guidelines range?

12              MR. DREEBEN:            Because sentences that are

13   outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the

14   cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a

15   sentence within the range.            And that is why that if the

16   court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what Booker

17   said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to

18   iron out sentencing differences, there is more

19   reason for the --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Well, do you think the

21   interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the

22   board is stronger than the interest in getting the

23   correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in

24   court at the time?

25              MR. DREEBEN:            Well, there isn't any one

 1   correct sentence usually.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:              No, there isn't.          But if

 3   you say the district judge has broad discretion, which

 4   he does, and the review is under abuse of discretion,

 5   why should there not always be a presumption that the

 6   district judge got it right?

 7              MR. DREEBEN:           Because there are more legal

 8   elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review

 9   than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens.

10   Section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for

11   review, mandates that the district court consider the

12   guidelines, consider the policy --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Yes, but it's sort of like

14   findings of fact.    They must take into consideration all

15   sorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong

16   presumption that the findings of fact are accurate.                       Why

17   don't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate

18   judgment on the sentence is also accurate?

19              MR. DREEBEN:           What happens when a sentence

20   is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater

21   risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing

22   Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities;

23   and in contrast to a sentence within the range which

24   does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a

25   sentence outside the range may well.                     It's different


                                        46

 1   from what the sentencing commission with its expertise

 2   and its experience has recommended as the appropriate

 3   sentence, given those facts.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you're -- I mean,

 5   this is a self fulfilling prophecy.                    You're saying if

 6   you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going

 7   to have uniformity.     Well, I -- my goodness.                 Is that

 8   consistent with the notion that the guidelines are

 9   advisory?

10               MR. DREEBEN:        I wouldn't put it as strongly

11   as that, Justice Scalia.        What I would say is that the

12   further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines

13   range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted

14   disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals

15   should look more critically at the reasons that the

16   district court gave and ensure that the constellation of

17   reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to

18   be a disproportionate sentence than --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that's just

20   inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct,

21   that the district judge can simply disagree with the

22   basic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply

23   disagree with the fact that the commission considers

24   white collar crime, for example, something that should

25   justify incarceration.

 1               MR. DREEBEN:           But Justice Scalia,

 2   reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals

 3   will review the reasons that the district court gave for

 4   that disagreement.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:              So doesn't your presumption

 6   argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently

 7   comprehensive statement of reasons, with a more

 8   extensive statement required the further the court gets

 9   from the guidelines?        Isn't that what it boils down to?

10               MR. DREEBEN:           It does for an out of range

11   sentence, Justice Souter.            I think that for a sentence

12   within the range, the judge's statement that I have

13   considered the guidelines range and I think it's

14   appropriate does explain why that judge has given the

15   sentence that he's given.            It's consistent with the

16   statute and it's consistent with the Constitution.              Now

17   when --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Is there -- may I interrupt

19   you?   Because your time is getting short.

20               Is there a difference between a presumption

21   of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and

22   a rule that says the further you get from them, you can

23   get as far as you want to, but the further you get from

24   them, the more extensive your explanation has to be?

25               Is there a distinction between those two,


                                         48

 1   two rules?

 2                MR. DREEBEN:        There is a distinction between

 3   them but I think they are complementary rules and in the

 4   next case the Government will argue for a presumption

 5   that is precisely what you have articulated,

 6   Justice Souter.   A greater and more extensive and more

 7   persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go

 8   from the guidelines range.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Or presumably the

10   further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from

11   the guidelines range?      If you've got a submission here

12   18 compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the

13   guidelines, and you get one sentence from the district

14   court saying -- you know -- I followed the guidelines,

15   presumably that would be the same as a significant

16   departure without further justification?

17                MR. DREEBEN:        It wouldn't be identical but I

18   agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence

19   within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a

20   compelling case for a sentence outside the range because

21   the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance.

22                The sentencing commission itself recognized

23   that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved

24   out a heartland in the language of the sentencing

25   commission's first set of guidelines, and that there

 1   will be circumstances that would justify different

 2   sentences.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is the system that you're

 4   describing any different for mandatory guidelines that

 5   are subject to departure when the district judge finds a

 6   significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines

 7   had?

 8                 MR. DREEBEN:        Yes, Justice Scalia.          It is

 9   quite --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wherein is it different?

11                MR. DREEBEN:         It is different precisely on

12   the area that, that you yourself articulated.                  The judge

13   can disagree with the sentencing guidelines and

14   determine that on the basis of the facts that the jury

15   found, the judge would impose a different sentence, and

16   that conclusion is then subject for reasonableness

17   review and we submit based on a proportionality

18   principle.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Dreeben.

20   Mr. Cochran, you have three minutes remaining.

21              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN

22                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

23                MR. COCHRAN:         That you, Mr. Chief Justice.

24                I would like to return first to the across

25   the board reasonableness review that this Court


                                        50

 1   established in Booker.         That in and of itself shows why

 2   there cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on

 3   appeal.     Because you are holding the presumption to a

 4   different standard at that point.                  It is not a

 5   reasonableness across the board.                 You are putting the

 6   burden on one the parties, most likely the defendant, to

 7   come forward and explain why the presumption should be

 8   rebutted.

 9                 That flies in the face with the across the

10   board reasonableness this Court set forth in Booker.

11                 The guidelines are fraught with disparity.

12   That why is they are advisory.                That's why they can only

13   be advisory.    And the district courts must be allowed to

14   look at them, to see them, to consider them, but

15   ultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid

16   reasons.

17                 In Mr. Rita's case, the court didn't.              The

18   court felt the guidelines held some undue weight.                It is

19   indicated in the record in two places, first and

20   foremost on page 49 of the joint appendix, where the

21   court at the beginning of the sentencing hearing states:

22   Other than the motion for downward departure that you

23   submitted, do you have any other objections; and what

24   I'm trying to do now is determine where your client fits

25   within the sentencing guidelines.

 1              Clearly the judge was rooted in the

 2   guidelines and that's why he gave a sentence of 33

 3   months at the low end.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The, the judge also

 5   pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he

 6   thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant

 7   protested his independence, and the jury had found him

 8   guilty of false statements.

 9              MR. COCHRAN:          That's correct.          That's --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The judge was bound by

11   those.

12              MR. COCHRAN:          That's correct, Your Honor,

13   but interestingly the court found very dubious the

14   additional information regarding the cross-reference.

15   And on page 87 of the joint appendix, the court states

16   it was not able to evaluate the seriousness of that

17   other investigation; and yet that was the

18   cross-reference that doubled his guidelines sentence.

19              We would ask the Court to rule in this case

20   that the presumption of reasonableness cannot be

21   accorded to the guidelines.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Mr. Cochran, you've

23   started out by saying there were two places in the

24   record that you thought showed the judge was bound by

25   the guidelines.   49, what was the other one?

 1                 MR. COCHRAN:           Your Honor, the other one was

 2   page 87.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Of the one -- oh,

 4   that point?    Okay.

 5                 MR. COCHRAN:           And that would be in the

 6   second paragraph, Mr. Chief Justice, where the court

 7   found it was unable to stray or found the guidelines

 8   were inappropriate; and I suggest that that is a, a

 9   giving of greater weight and too much so in this case.

10                 Your Honor, Mr. Rita asks the Court to find

11   that a presumption cannot be accorded to the guidelines,

12   that his sentence was unreasonable in this case, and

13   that his case be returned for resentencing.                     Thank you.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you,

15   Mr. Cochran.    The case is submitted.
