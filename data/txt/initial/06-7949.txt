 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear argument

 4   first today in Case 06-7949, Gall v. United States.

 5              Mr. Green.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

 7                       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. GREEN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              When Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern

11   District of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27,

12   2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had

13   fully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily

14   withdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by

15   remaining crime-free throughout that period, by having

16   rid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from

17   college, by having learned a trade, by having built a

18   successful and thriving business.

19              Judge Pratt carefully weighed the Section

20   3553(a) factors and in a ten-page sentencing memorandum

21   set forth cogent reasons why a sentence of probation

22   would better fit the purposes and factors specified in

23   Section 3553(a) than a sentence of incarceration.

24              The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed

25   that judgment on the basis of the extraordinary


                                         3

 1   circumstances test that we would ask the Court to

 2   overturn today.

 3              The Eighth Circuit substituted its judgment

 4   for that of Judge Pratt, saying that Judge Pratt had

 5   placed too much weight on Mr. Gall's voluntary

 6   withdrawal from the conspiracy and in so doing had not

 7   satisfied or overcome the extraordinariness barrier.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              If it had been the other

 9   way around and the district court had said what

10   appellate court said and the appellate court had said

11   what the district court said, what would you be arguing?

12              MR. GREEN:         Certainly, Justice Kennedy, I

13   would probably be arguing something of the reverse.

14              (Laughter.)

15              MR. GREEN:         It is -- it is an abuse of

16   discretion --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, you can see the

18   systemic concern.    I mean, it's just not always going to

19   be the case that the district judge is the one to give

20   more leniency.

21              MR. GREEN:         Yes, that's certainly true, but

22   in this instance an abuse of discretion standard

23   applies.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:            I thought it was your

25   argument that if any rational judge could impose the


                                         4

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sentence that's imposed, then that sentence has to be

 2   sustained.    So you're saying that either the district

 3   court or the Eighth Circuit here was irrational?

 4                 MR. GREEN:      No.        I wouldn't say -- well, let

 5   me -- the district court was certainly not irrational in

 6   our view.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:         No.      But in answer to

 8   Justice Kennedy's question, you hesitated in saying

 9   that, if the district court had taken the approach of

10   the court of appeals, that would also have to be

11   sustained.    But under your analysis wouldn't it have to

12   be unless you're going to argue --

13                 MR. GREEN:      Yes.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         -- that that approach is

15   irrational?

16                 MR. GREEN:      It would have to be.        I

17   hesitated because there -- there might be instances in

18   which, as indeed the government admits in its brief,

19   that the reasons and the facts and circumstances don't

20   logically cohere with the sentence that's given.

21                 In other words, if all of the circumstances

22   and facts point a certain way -- in this instance, for

23   example, they point to a downward departure -- and

24   suddenly the judge goes up to the statutory max, that

25   might be an instance in which a court of appeals could


                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   say no reasonable judge would have imposed that

 2   sentence.   There doesn't seem to be a reason for doing

 3   so.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the Eighth

 5   Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances

 6   test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit

 7   for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the

 8   whistle, so the conspiracy continued.                   He could have

 9   stopped the conspiracy.

10               And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated

11   himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug

12   business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe

13   there's some kind of obligation to pay back.

14               So could a court of appeals try to instruct

15   district judges and say:         Now, in this factor, leaving a

16   conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the

17   difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle

18   and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who

19   uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.

20               MR. GREEN:       Justice Ginsburg, when someone

21   leaves the conspiracy and blows the whistle, typically,

22   that individual is not charged.              The Department of

23   Justice, for example, in its Antitrust Division says

24   that if a corporation or individual comes to it and

25   blows the whistle on, say, a price-fixing conspiracy,


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that individual is never charged to begin with.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I'm sure

 3   that's not always true.       I mean, if the leader of some

 4   vast conspiracy is the one who blows the whistle, I

 5   suspect he may well be charged anyway.

 6              MR. GREEN:       That's true, Your Honor.               There

 7   are instances in which --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Lex Luthor might.

 9              (Laughter.)

10              MR. GREEN:       Yes, but the point is that

11   blowing the whistle is -- is not only a voluntary

12   withdrawal, but also something so far beyond the bounds

13   of what prosecutors typically see that that individual,

14   typically or generally is the individual that receives

15   immunity or amnesty in the case.

16              To respond to the second part of your

17   question, with respect to the amount of money that

18   Mr. Gall made, he did not use it, and there's no

19   information in the record that indicates that he built

20   his business on the basis of the use of that money.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There is no indication

22   that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to

23   it.

24              MR. GREEN:       No, there was not, and in part

25   because, as the sealed volume of the appendix


                                       7
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   demonstrates, Mr. Gall did not at that point have money

 2   to pay a fine.

 3              Remember that he was -- he left the

 4   conspiracy in September of 2000.              He was not approached

 5   by agents until late 2003.         He was not charged until

 6   2004 and was not sentenced until 2005.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you don't -- you

 8   don't have to answer all of these things for your case,

 9   do you?

10              MR. GREEN:       No.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're not saying that a

12   reasonable person couldn't have found the opposite.

13   You're just saying that a reasonable person could have

14   found what this district judge found.

15              MR. GREEN:       That's exactly right, Justice

16   Scalia.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So why don't you just

18   swallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the

19   court of appeals could say that, but --

20              MR. GREEN:       I -- I --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- but my point stands?

22              MR. GREEN:       Yeah, well, I'm happy to swallow

23   in that sense.

24              (Laughter.)

25              MR. GREEN:       There's no doubt about the fact

 1   --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well then, what's

 3   left of the appellate review?              I mean, under your theory

 4   is there any substantive review for the appellate court

 5   or is it all just procedural under -- putting aside your

 6   logical coherence point, which --

 7               MR. GREEN:        There is -- there isn't much

 8   left besides the fact that it is abuse of discretion

 9   review.   That there is no robust substantive component

10   to -- to reasonableness review of sentences, is really a

11   complaint about abuse of discretion review.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:              And that's the problem.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  In a typical abuse

14   of discretion review, you still have -- for example, if

15   you have a judge in -- well, let's say you have a judge;

16   in one case he says because this is a -- a young

17   defendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and

18   in the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a

19   factor that I should consider in the case; in the next

20   case he says it is and then not.                Each -- all of those

21   cases, I take it, are upheld under your view on

22   appellate review.

23               MR. GREEN:        Not necessarily.            I think if --

24   if a judge --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So there can be


                                         9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   substantive review for consideration of age?

 2              MR. GREEN:       Not necessarily for

 3   consideration of age, but a court of appeals could say

 4   to -- to such a judge -- and I am sure that one of the

 5   parties would point this out, would say you considered

 6   it last time; you didn't consider it.                  You've been

 7   seesawing back and forth on this.               The court of appeals

 8   could say --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay, so at the same

10   time --

11              MR. GREEN: -- explain why --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But if you have two

13   district judges in the same courthouse and the one says,

14   when I have a young defendant I always -- I forget

15   whether the term is "vary" or "depart" -- but I always

16   go down, and the next judge says, I never consider age.

17   Those -- both of those are upheld under your view, I

18   take it?

19              MR. GREEN:       Yes, both -- both would be

20   upheld.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Now, why --

22              MR GREEN:      If somebody said --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why wouldn't the judge in,

24   as it were, the second case give some consideration, be

25   required under abuse review to give some consideration,


                                      10
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to what is sort of the norm in that circuit so that he

 2   doesn't stand out as either a "let-them-loose" judge or

 3   a hanging judge?   Doesn't abuse of discretion at least

 4   require a broader view than simply the -- literally the

 5   case before the court?

 6              MR. GREEN:        Well, it does require a broader

 7   view, and certainly a judge could --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And wouldn't there be at

 9   least under the Chief Justices's hypothetical, wouldn't

10   there be a possibility of looking to those other cases

11   rather than just automatically affirming on -- on abuse

12   review?

13              MR. GREEN:        There would be.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

15              MR. GREEN:        And I was about to add --

16              JUSTICE ALITO:           Would the judge have to

17   consider the cases from the judge's district or from the

18   circuit or from the whole country?

19              MR. GREEN:        I would -- I would imagine a

20   judge would want to look at -- at cases from the whole

21   country.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Isn't that exactly

23   --

24              MR. GREEN:        Certainly they have --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Isn't that exactly

 1   what the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the

 2   Guidelines?

 3                 MR. GREEN:       It did in establishing the

 4   Guidelines.     There are disputes about whether the

 5   commissioners actually modified the guidelines on the

 6   basis of what judges have actually done.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It looked at them.   It

 8   didn't necessarily follow them.

 9                 MR. GREEN:       Exactly.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            With white collar crime,

11   for example, it went vastly higher than what had been

12   the practice.

13                 MR. GREEN:       That's -- that's exactly right,

14   Justice Scalia.    So there is a component to this in

15   which a judge might want to look through legal database,

16   for example, or even a blog or something like that, and

17   look and see --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Going back to the Chief

19   Justice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him

20   with the hypothetical, the two different judges in the

21   statement district or the same circuit that treat age

22   differently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress

23   be able to say anything about that, do anything about

24   that to stop the disparity?

25                 MR. GREEN:       Certainly.

 2   Sixth Amendment?

 3              MR. GREEN:        Certainly.            And one of our

 4   responses, Justice Kennedy, to the issue of there not

 5   being a robust component of substantiveness -- or --

 6   excuse me -- of substantive review of sentences if that

 7   Congress can fix that.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How?

 9              MR. GREEN:        If the unwarranted --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How can it fix the --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:             One question.      Why

12   couldn't, if there is some kind of substantive standard

13   of reasonableness, why couldn't a court of appeals in a

14   particular circuit say that -- if one judge relies on

15   age, 19, and the other judges do not, why couldn't the

16   court of appeals say that one of those two positions is

17   unreasonable?

18              MR. GREEN:        A court of appeals could, yes, I

19   think it could that.      They could ask an explanation.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             There could be a common --

21   sort of a common law of reasonableness developed through

22   the public process?

23              MR. GREEN:        I think that's correct.             A

24   common law --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And another circuit would

 1   develop the opposite.     I mean, this circuit would say

 2   that 17 is unreasonable.        The other circuit would say

 3   that 19 is unreasonable.        And we would have to sort out

 4   all those things ultimately, right?

 5              MR. GREEN:       That's -- that's correct Your

 6   Honor.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:            In kind of a sentencing

 8   review court?

 9              MR. GREEN:       Yes.       Yes, and that is -- that

10   is one danger of the extraordinary circumstances test.

11   In fact, there's two dangers in that --

12              JUSTICE ALITO:          Could Congress pass a

13   statute that says age is not relevant in sentencing

14   except in extraordinary circumstances?                 Would that be a

15   violation of the Sixth Amendment?

16              MR. GREEN:       I believe that Congress could

17   pass such a statute, yes.         But -- but -- I hesitate to

18   add that, to the extent that there is a constitutional

19   grounding for individualized sentencing and age is a key

20   factor with respect to individualized sentencing, I -- I

21   want to hesitate and I want to waver.                  I'm not sure --

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you said -- you said

23   before that, and very definitely, that Congress could

24   fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient

25   on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at


                                      14

 1   him.   You said yes, Congress could fix that.             Well, how

 2   other than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?

 3               MR. GREEN:       Well, in response to that

 4   question and your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg,

 5   certainly Congress could, to fix the entire problem

 6   here, could adopt the solution that we proposed in

 7   Booker and in Fanfan that to say that -- that in order

 8   to enhance a sentence at all, that has -- it has to be a

 9   fact found by the jury, what's so-called Blakelyizing of

10   the Guidelines.   That's one way to do it.

11               Congress could also, as has been suggested

12   and I believe legislation has been introduced on this,

13   they could make the Guidelines essentially topless, so

14   that there -- so that there was complete --

15               JUSTICE ALITO:          If Congress can pass a

16   statute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age

17   is ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate

18   to an expert agency the authority to make that decision

19   without violating the Sixth Amendment?

20               MR. GREEN:       No, I don't think that it could.

21   Any time Congress --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          Based on what?      Why could it

23   -- why can't it delegate the authority if it can do it

24   itself?

25               MR. GREEN:       Well, it could delegate the

 1   authority.   There's no doubt about it.                   And this Court

 2   has said it's all right for Congress to delegate the

 3   authority to the commission.              But the problem, Justice

 4   Alito, comes whenever we limit the statutory continuum

 5   from zero to the statutory maximum sentence, if we

 6   overlay a consideration.           If on the extraordinary

 7   circumstances test we make the Guidelines the benchmark

 8   and we tether or we measure from the Guidelines, we have

 9   then set a kind of statutory range.

10                If Congress says to a commission, we want

11   you to develop a kind of mini-guideline based upon age,

12   we think that there might be departure in some

13   circumstances but not other circumstances, that might be

14   an instance where we are setting a kind of ceiling and a

15   floor and a range within the otherwise broader statutory

16   continuum.   That's --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Mr. Green, I

18   understood you to respond to Justice Souter's question

19   that courts of appeals could consider a broader range of

20   cases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in

21   a particular case.

22                MR. GREEN:        Certainly.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Now, if they can

24   consider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about

25   suggesting that if a particular case is way out of what


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   their broad review shows, if the broad review shows that

 2   in most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in

 3   this particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or

 4   gave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is

 5   a factor they should at least start with in saying

 6   something's unusual about this case, we ought to take

 7   closer look?

 8              MR. GREEN:       In that instance, though, we run

 9   into the problem that Justice Scalia identified and that

10   problem is we start to get limitations based upon

11   certain factors, and the courts of appeals --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well then, what's

13   the point of looking at the broad range of cases if they

14   can't do anything about it?

15              MR. GREEN:       To see whether -- the point is

16   to see whether or not the reasons that are offered in

17   those cases turn out to be valid, cogent --

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So is it right to

19   say if the broad range shows that most of these

20   defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in

21   this case the person got probation, that the court

22   should look for some reasons to explain what the

23   difference, to justify the difference?

24              MR. GREEN:       Certainly the court should look

25   at the reasons and should look to see whether or not the


                                      17
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reasons are rationally grounded in Section 3553(a).                But

 2   our position is once they are, that's -- that's the end

 3   of the matter.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Of course, all these

 5   questions only -- only apply to departures downward from

 6   the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with

 7   regard to departures upward you do run into

 8   constitutional problems when the -- when courts of

 9   appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be

10   found in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts

11   that justify moving upward.

12               So you end up with a quite skewered system

13   in which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of

14   departures downward, but -- but very, very slight review

15   of departures upward.

16               MR. GREEN:       That -- that's correct, and

17   that's essentially the kind of system that we've got

18   now.   This is not a fulsome abuse of discretion review

19   throughout the range of sentencing.

20               What we have now is a -- on this

21   extraordinary circumstances test is a -- and this case

22   is a perfect example of substitution of judgment.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What in your view would

24   be -- would fail the abuse of discretion test?             If we

25   have a sentence of -- what was the guideline range?

 1                 MR. GREEN:      30 to 37 months, Justice

 2   Ginsburg.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the judge gives no

 4   prison time, three years probation.                      What would it take

 5   to be -- describe what an abuse of discretion would be?

 6                 MR. GREEN:      Well, there are a couple of

 7   examples out there.      One, this case Poynter out of, out

 8   of the Sixth Circuit, where the judge went all the way

 9   up to the absolute statutory max in a child

10   pornography -- or rather, a child molestation case, on

11   the ground that, first, the statutory max will take care

12   of any unwarranted disparity.              That's not -- that's not

13   really a cogent reason and that would be an abuse of

14   discretion.

15                 We have another case out of the -- recently

16   out of the Eleventh Circuit, Valdes, in which -- in

17   which the court departed upwards on the ground of the

18   fact that the check that had been written that -- the

19   fraudulent check that had been written, had been written

20   to the district court.        And so the court was angry that

21   its own court had been -- or the neighboring court had

22   been duped.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You think that's

24   unreasonable?

25                 MR. GREEN:      I do think that's unreasonable,

 1   Your Honor.     I'll go that far.             I'll admit that much.

 2   Certainly that's not like the famous Yankees and Red Sox

 3   example.     That's not rationally grounded in Section

 4   3553(a) factors.

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask, we've been

 6   talking about a lot of hypotheticals.                     Is there any

 7   dispute, any claim that any of the facts on which the

 8   district judge relied in this case were improper --

 9                 MR. GREEN:       No.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- that they were out of

11   harmony with what's done throughout the country?

12                 MR. GREEN:       No, none whatsoever, Your Honor.

13   In fact, we pointed at the end of our merits brief, page

14   35 and 36, we point to other cases where courts have

15   given lenient sentences because of a voluntary

16   rehabilitative effort by the defendant.                    And the Eighth

17   Circuit Court of Appeals said in no way -- or indicated

18   in no way did Judge Pratt rely on improper factors in

19   deciding the sentence.         It had a complaint about his

20   reliance on age, but really that was a --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What in your opinion is

22   supposed to happen if we have Guidelines, a part of

23   3553(a), a part of it -- voluntary or not, they're

24   referred to, so -- and I understand how you would deal

25   with this.    If the district judge's sentence rests upon

 1   his view of the facts, the appeals court is supposed to

 2   say it's the district judge that counts here.

 3              MR. GREEN:          That's right.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:               I can understand if it's a

 5   question of judgment, a matter of judgment about this

 6   case the court of appeals is supposed to say:              District

 7   judge, it's your view that matters here.

 8              Now, the difficult matter is, suppose that

 9   this district judge says:            I don't approve of the way

10   Guidelines treat a certain class of people and I am

11   going to have a different sentence because I don't like

12   what they do.     And now there are several situations:

13   one, different from his fellow judges in the same court;

14   two, different from other judges across the country;

15   three, different from what the Guidelines did initially;

16   four, different from what the Guidelines say after the

17   commission has over and over and over reconsidered the

18   same matter.

19              All right, that I find difficult and I'd

20   like your view.

21              MR. GREEN:          I would find such an absolute

22   policy disagreement difficult as well, Justice Breyer.

23   And the reason why it's difficult is because it is not

24   sentencing in accordance with Section 3553(a).             Section

25   3553(a) requires consideration of the individual

 2   circumstances surrounding the crime.

 3                 In Koon, this Court --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Wait, wait, wait, wait.

 5                 I think what you're saying is that -- which

 6   is the subject of the next case, really --

 7                 MR. GREEN:        Exactly.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:             But I want to know your

 9   view of it.    Too.    I want to know your view of it, too,

10   because what I want to figure out here by the end of

11   today is what are the words that should be written in

12   your opinion by this Court that will lead to

13   considerable discretion on part of the district judge

14   but not totally, not to the point where the uniformity

15   goal is easily destroyed.

16                 That's what I'm asking your view on, and I'd

17   like your view and the SG's view and everyone else who's

18   arguing today.

19                 MR. GREEN:        The words should be these with

20   respect to policy judgments:               The district court may

21   consider policy disagreements with the Sentencing

22   Guidelines or may disagree with the policies stated in

23   the Sentencing Guidelines or underlying those

24   Guidelines, as long as that disagreement is rationally

25   or reasonably grounded in the facts of the case, that it

 1   fits the circumstances of the case.

 2                 And in so doing --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Excuse me.           You're saying

 4   they can't disagree with the policy.                      They can only --

 5   only say there are special facts in this case that were

 6   not taken into account in the policy.                      But you're saying

 7   they are bound by the policy set forth in the

 8   Guidelines.    That's not my understanding of either

 9   Apprendi or Booker.

10                 MR. GREEN:      Yes and no.                The yes part is --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Which yes and which no?

12                 MR. GREEN:      Okay.        The yes -- the yes part

13   is that -- that it is in accordance with the -- the

14   majority opinion in Rita and other cases, there is an

15   invitation to district courts to reconsider if they

16   find -- if they so find it necessary, the facts -- or

17   rather, excuse me, the policies as articulated in the

18   Sentencing Guidelines.        They are free to do that.

19                 But under Section 3553(a), Justice Scalia,

20   that has to be rationally grounded in the case before

21   them.   This --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It has to be relevant to

23   the case, Of course.

24                 MR. GREEN:      Certainly.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course.

 1                 MR. GREEN:      Relevance and rational --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't know what you mean

 3   by rationally grounded in the case before them.                      Let's

 4   take the question of whether you should give higher

 5   sentences for crack cocaine than for powder cocaine.

 6   Why can't the district court simply disagree with the

 7   fact that the Guidelines said you should give a 100

 8   times more for the one than for the other?                      Why can't

 9   the district court just say, that seems to me a very

10   erroneous judgment by -- by the Sentencing Commission?

11                 MR. GREEN:      If the district court applied

12   that as a policy across all cases that come before it

13   involving crack or powder cocaine, Justice Scalia, that

14   is an abdication of the district court's duty under

15   Section 3553(a).    And under this Court's opinion --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I see.           It must follow the

17   Guidelines,

18                 MR. GREEN:      No, no, I'm not, I'm not saying

19   that.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It just has to consider

21   them.   It did consider them and said:                    I disagree with

22   that judgment of the Guidelines.

23                 MR. GREEN:      Yes, it has to -- it does not

24   have to follow the Guidelines and it can disagree, but

 1   case.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               This case involves cocaine.

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:               You're saying -- you're

 4   saying two things.      You're saying it's got to follow the

 5   Guidelines -- it can depart from the Guidelines, but

 6   it's got to do so based on the facts of this case or in

 7   some way relevant to the facts of this case.               And when

 8   you put that latter criterion in there, what you're

 9   saying, and I think this was Justice Scalia's concern,

10   you're really saying you've got to find that this case

11   is somehow an outlier to the broad range of cases so

12   that the policy does not fit.               And that's a different

13   thing from a general disagreement with the policy

14   itself.

15              Isn't that what you are saying?

16              MR. GREEN:          No, because I don't think a

17   district judge would have to find that the case was

18   somehow an outlier.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Then what is it in the

20   facts of this case that is crucial to the appropriate

21   determination?

22              MR. GREEN:          Well, the facts of a case where

23   there's a disagreement with a policy might be, for

24   example, the policy might be -- let's take embezzlement

25   because I don't want to tread on my colleague's

 1   argument.   Let's take embezzlement --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:          Maybe you could take age.

 3   What is there about the age of this defendant?                    He was a

 4   21-year-old college student?            Now maybe age is generally

 5   a factor that should be considered as a basis for

 6   leniency.   Maybe it's not.         But it's a policy question.

 7   What is there about the facts of this case that -- that

 8   changes that?

 9               MR. GREEN:       Age is a good example.               Justice

10   -- or, excuse me -- Judge Pratt in his sentencing

11   memorandum, said -- cited studies that show that young

12   people's risk inhibition behavior is not quite as well

13   developed as people later on, and that recidivism drops

14   remarkably as you move forward into your 20s.

15               Now, he did not rely on that argument in

16   order to impose the sentence he did.                    He used that as a

17   contrast to say this where is Brian Gall was when he was

18   a member of this conspiracy and look at where he has

19   gotten to, having fully rehabilitated himself.

20               So that is a means by which a judge can say,

21   you know, the policy of the Guidelines may be that age

22   should be a discouraged factor, but it could be relevant

23   in cases.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Sure.       But if the reasoning

25   that you just articulated is reasoning that should be


                                       26
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   accepted, it's reasoning that should be accepted in

 2   every case.    And it -- i.e., the mind is less -- the

 3   brain is less developed in the case of everyone under a

 4   certain age.

 5                 And that amounts, in effect, to a rejection

 6   of the policy for a certain swath of individuals,

 7   relatively young individuals, for whom the judge is

 8   saying age is relevant, the policy says age is not.

 9                 That's rejection of the policy.

10                 MR. GREEN:      But not necessarily, because a

11   district judge who is looking the defendant in the eye,

12   and is the best placed judicial actor to make that

13   decision, may say I see a 21-year-old in front of me who

14   is uniquely mature.      That is a -- that is a

15   quintessential multifarious, pleading, narrow, shifting

16   fact; the district judge may make the decision.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You're saying that if a

18   judge disagrees as a general matter of policy, once in a

19   while he could make an exception to his disagreement.

20   But it's still, it seems to me, on your reasoning, that

21   he has rejected the policy with respect to a certain

22   class of defendant.

23                 MR. GREEN:      Well, he -- he may have rejected

24   it -- if -- I wouldn't even -- dare say that in a

25   multiplicity of cases.        He may have rejected it in this

 1   particular case and said, I see a defendant in front of

 2   me who is immature, as mature as the other defendants,

 3   and this study backs me up.

 4                And I'd like to reserve the reminder of my

 5   time for rebuttal.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll give you

 7   rebuttal time, Mr. Green, but I just have one question.

 8                I think we've gotten off the track a little

 9   bit.    The question presented is about the extraordinary

10   circumstances test and proportionality review.                   We've

11   been talking a lot about what district court judges can

12   do.    What's wrong with, whatever you want to call it,

13   saying if something is out of the norm, you ought to

14   have some good reason for being out of the norm?

15                MR. GREEN:        I --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That's the only

17   question presented in this case.

18                MR. GREEN:        Because it -- because it sets a

19   presumptive sentence and that presumptive sentence is

20   exactly like -- is the Guideline sentence.                   And it says

21   to the district court:         You must overcome a presumption

22   against a sentence that is some unspecified distance

23   from -- from the Guidelines.              We don't know because we

24   can't estimate exactly how far it's from.

25                But what happens, and what will quickly

 1   happen, is that there's going to be a kind of -- maybe

 2   in the Eighth Circuit it's one standard deviation; maybe

 3   in the Second Circuit it's two standard deviations.                 But

 4   pretty soon we are going to have a kind of Guidelines

 5   with a penumbra beyond which you can't go.

 6                It is, as was indicated in the Rita opinion,

 7   a presumption of unreasonableness.                 It says to the

 8   district court, you're making a risk if you go outside

 9   the Guidelines.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

11   Mr. Green.

12                MR. GREEN:      Thank you.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Dreeben.

14                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN,

15                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16                MR. DREEBEN:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

17   and may it please the Court:

18                Appellate courts confronted with the task of

19   conducting reasonableness review need some benchmarks

20   for how to distinguish between sentences that are

21   outside the Guidelines and reasonable and sentences that

22   are outside the Guidelines and are not.

23                The question presented here is whether an

24   appellate court can reasonably decide that it should

25   take a harder look at a case that is significantly or


                                       29
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   extraordinarily outside the Guidelines and look to see

 2   whether that sentence is supported by --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Excuse me, may I ask this

 4   question because it comes up throughout your brief, and

 5   you've used percentages to decide when a case is

 6   sufficiently outside the Guidelines to justify a special

 7   hard look.   You used the term "dramatically" in your

 8   brief.   At what percentage point is the threshold that

 9   this standard of review kicks in?

10                MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Stevens, we don't have

11   a fixed percentage.     We don't endorse that kind of

12   analysis.

13                I think that the appropriate way to look at

14   it is to see all different factors converging in order

15   to determine whether it warrants this harder look.                  It

16   could be a different type of sentence.                  Here you have a

17   probation sentence as opposed to a prison sentence when

18   the Guidelines call for up to three years of

19   imprisonment.

20                It could be couched in the number of levels

21   that the judge has --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:           So you do not rely on a

23   percentage as kind of the magic basic test?

24                MR. DREEBEN:        I don't.          But I would say --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I think some of the courts


                                       30
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of appeals seem to.

 2              MR. DREEBEN:         The courts of appeals have

 3   generally relied on a "I know it when I see it" kind of

 4   approach, which I think is reasonable in this area of

 5   the law, because you see sentences that are simply out

 6   of kilter with what the Guidelines range is, and it

 7   raises a question in the court's mind, why?

 8              If you saw a judge who said the Guidelines

 9   range here is 30 to 37 months for petitioner and I'm

10   going to sentence him to 24 months and the judge gives

11   the same reasons as he gave here, no court of appeals is

12   going to think this requires a particularly hard look or

13   any greater justification than what the judge did.                   The

14   court will understand that that's what abuse of

15   discretion review means in an advisory system.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if -- what if the

17   sentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines?

18   He just simply disagrees with the severity of the

19   sentence that the Guidelines impose?                   He's free to do

20   that, isn't he?

21              MR. DREEBEN:         He is, Justice Scalia.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And so long as that

23   disagreement is reasonable, so long as another

24   sentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower

25   sentence -- for antitrust violations, if indeed all the

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Federal Courts before -- before the Guidelines came into

 2   effect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how

 3   could you say it would be unreasonable for a district

 4   judge to say, I simply agrees with what the

 5   Guidelines -- with what the Sentencing Commission did,

 6   and I agree with all of those sentencing courts before

 7   then, which thought -- which thought only in a rare case

 8   should there be jail time?          How could you possibly say

 9   that that's unreasonable?

10               MR. DREEBEN:         Because, Justice Scalia, I

11   start with a fundamentally different concept of

12   reasonableness review than merely is it possible to

13   articulate a reasoned basis for sentencing the defendant

14   that way.

15               I start with the proposition that this Court

16   adopted reasonableness review in Booker as a means of

17   helping to achieve Congress's objective of increased

18   uniformity without attempting to attain the degree of

19   uniformity that had prevailed under the mandatory --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But we also made it very

21   clear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is --

22   there is no way to a maintain that with the -- with the

23   kind of approach that you're offering.                  They aren't

24   advisory.   They're pretty much mandatory.                 You depart

25   too much and you'll be called to account.

 1              MR. DREEBEN:          I think there's a difference,

 2   Justice Scalia, from saying that the Guidelines are

 3   advisory and therefore a court can give a different

 4   sentence than what the Guidelines call for, and saying

 5   that basically advisory guidelines means the judge can

 6   do whatever policy judgment the judge wants, without

 7   regard to what degree of variance you achieve.            From --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You cannot disagree on

 9   policy with the Guidelines, then, at least not

10   fundamentally?

11              MR. DREEBEN:          No, you can disagree

12   fundamentally, and I think at one level every variance

13   is a disagreement with the sentence that the Guidelines

14   would produce.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't know how that --

16   that fits in with your prior statement.

17              MR. DREEBEN:          It fits in with my prior

18   statement because what'S at issue in a case like this is

19   not whether the judge can disagree with the judgment of

20   the Guidelines and say youth matters, but whether the

21   judge can do so to such an extent that the result is

22   unwarranted disparity beyond what needs to be tolerated

23   in order to achieve a system that complies with the

24   Sixth Amendment.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:             You're saying that there's


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   a fairness component to the Guidelines in reasonableness

 2   review.

 3               MR. DREEBEN:          I'm saying that --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:             When you start talking

 5   about disparity, you're talking about a fairness across

 6   a range of sentencing that is actually imposed.

 7               So you're saying -- I think you're saying,

 8   there's got to be a kind of substantive fairness

 9   component to it.

10               MR. DREEBEN:          There has to be a substantive

11   fairness component, Justice Souter, and I think that

12   there has to be a substantive excessiveness component.

13   In other words --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, that's kind after

15   subset, isn't it?

16               MR. DREEBEN:          I actually view it as the

17   broader category but I think the two of them work

18   together.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

20               MR. DREEBEN:          This is the fundamental

21   difference that I think exists between what Petitioner

22   is offering and what the government is offering.             We all

23   agree that irrational sentences and procedurally

24   defective sentences are to be set aside on

25   reasonableness review.        But where we disagree, I think,

 1   is whether a judge on a court of appeals panel can look

 2   at the results reached by the district judge and

 3   conclude, this is an excessive sentence on the facts of

 4   this case.

 5                 We think that the judge can do that on a

 6   court of appeals and that in order to determine whether

 7   a sentence is excessive, a starting point is to compare

 8   what the judge did to what the Guidelines range does.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then -- then you're

10   just blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are

11   advisory.     What you're saying is the criterion for

12   fairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one

13   side or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being

14   fair.   That -- that's not -- that's not advisory.

15   That's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing.

16                 MR. DREEBEN:         Unless, Justice Scalia, the

17   judge offers sufficiently cogent, persuasive reasons so

18   that the court of appeals concludes that this is indeed

19   a reasonable sentence, given the reasons that the judge

20   has articulated as a matter of policy and the facts

21   before him.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, he did that here.   He

23   said, you know, I think a young person like this --

24   other people may feel differently, but I think somebody

25   at 21 really is -- is not -- his brain isn't fully

 1   formed and we should give him another chance.

 2                 MR. DREEBEN:        He -- he did say that Justice

 3   Scalia.   But appellate review is conducted through the

 4   lens of 3553(a) and 3553(a) directs the judge to

 5   consider a variety of things in addition to the history

 6   and characteristics of the defendant, which is where

 7   youth comes in.    It also directs the court to consider

 8   the severity of the offense and the need for just

 9   punishment.    It directs the court to consider deterrence

10   considerations, and it directs the court to consider the

11   need to avoid unwarranted disparities between similarly

12   situated defendants, and that's where this court fell

13   down.

14                 It's not that what the court said was wholly

15   unreasonable, although in one respect, I think, with the

16   emphasis on withdrawal for the reasons that Justice

17   Ginsburg mentioned, the judge did overstate the point.

18   But the judge lost sight of the fact that this is a

19   defendant who over a 7-month period engaged in a

20   sustained drug conspiracy at age 21, not as an

21   adolescent, and made 30 to $40,000 for that.

22                     And the result is that this judge

23   concluded that defendant --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Dreeben, do you think

25   there are any facts that would have justified probation

 2              MR. DREEBEN:         Yes.       I think that there are

 3   cases throughout the Federal system that have resulted

 4   in probation for defendants who committed similar crimes

 5   to this, maybe not as severe as this defendant.             I'm not

 6   sure --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:            What is the difference

 8   between the facts in this case and the ones which you

 9   would find acceptable?

10              MR. DREEBEN:         Well, the ones that, I think,

11   have been the most appealing for probation sentences are

12   cases in which the defendant's culpability is very low.

13   The defendant played a minor role in the offense,

14   perhaps assisting a boyfriend or a friend --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm asking about whether

16   in cases exactly involving the crime we have here,

17   whether any such cases would justify probation, where

18   the culpability was exactly the same as there was here.

19              MR. DREEBEN:         The only cases that I can

20   think of -- and I was trying to get to this point,

21   Justice Stevens -- are ones in which courts conclude

22   there are compelling family circumstances where

23   individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's

24   family if no one is available to take care of them, and

25   the defendant has really devoted his activities to doing

 1   that, and there's no replacement; and the costs to

 2   society would be too high in those circumstances, courts

 3   have concluded, to justify a sentence of imprisonment.

 4                 I'm not saying that Petitioner is the most

 5   culpable defendant that could be sentenced under this

 6   statute.     This is a statute that carries a range --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            This is exactly the kind of

 8   case, though, that I think would give tremendous

 9   discretion to the district judge.                  Because, as I just

10   listened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features

11   of it that are very case-specific, that require thorough

12   knowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of

13   judgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that

14   sentencing judges are supposed to do.

15                 And that's what's worrying me about the test

16   that the circuit court gives here.                   It lumps together

17   things like what you just talked about with other things

18   like:     I don't agree with the policy of the guideline,

19   itself.    And this is a typical case and, therefore, I

20   think we should look to try to find ways to unpack the

21   sentence that it used, the statement -- you know, the

22   worse it is, the worse the harder you look, et cetera,

23   because that doesn't tell us much at all.

24                 It suggests a proportionate test,

25   mathematical, which must be wrong.                   It must be wrong

 1   because the same degree of departure could result from a

 2   view of an abuse of a vulnerable victim as could result

 3   from a total misunderstanding of what robbery is about.

 4                 Now, it's not the percentage there that

 5   matters.   It's the rationale.              It is what the judge did.

 6   And can you unpack it?         We just did in the last

 7   discussion try to unpack that, and we continue in the

 8   next case to try to do it.

 9                 What we want -- I think what we want -- is

10   to interpret that word "reasonable" so that we get back

11   to a situation where judges do depart when they have

12   something unusual and maybe occasionally when they think

13   the guideline wasn't considered properly, and then the

14   iterative process takes over, going back to the

15   commission.    Now, how do we get there?

16                 MR. DREEBEN:         Let me try to draw one

17   distinction and make a point about proportionality that

18   I think is not encompassed within what you said.

19                 There is a distinction between a judge

20   forming a view based on the defendant's character and

21   behavior in front of the court and the history as

22   revealed in the presentence report where the judge has

23   an institutional advantage over an appellate court for

24   obvious reasons.     And this was recognized in Koon versus

25   United States.     It hasn't changed today.

 1              On the other hand, a district court has a

 2   disadvantage, really, in formulating broad policy as

 3   compared to the Sentencing Commission.                 Because the

 4   Sentencing Commission has the ability to absorb vast

 5   amounts of data and to consider the views of all

 6   segments of the criminal justice community and to

 7   respond to Congress.     And it is really the component of

 8   the sentencing process where you would expect broad

 9   policy to be, as an initial matter, best formulated.

10   Now --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            We should probably make

12   them mandatory.

13              MR. DREEBEN:         As I said to Justice Scalia,

14   they're not mandatory, and the judge does have the

15   freedom to challenge the judgment that the Sentencing

16   Commission has drawn.     But on appellate review, the

17   normal factors that go into which institutional actor is

18   best situated to decide a question tilts in favor of a

19   more rigorous form of review for pure policy

20   disagreements for not only the reason that the

21   Sentencing Commission is better, but for the reason that

22   if you license all district courts to come up with their

23   own broad, abstract policies, you end up with 474

24   sentencing commissions who are operating --

25              JUSTICE BREYER:            So, on that ground I

 1   understand perfectly, and were we to write that into a

 2   paragraph in the opinion, this case still, would it not,

 3   be the strongest case imaginable for discretion to the

 4   district judge?

 5               MR. DREEBEN:         I hope not, Justice Breyer.

 6   And I hope to --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            You did, but I wanted to

 8   know what you were going to say.

 9               MR. DREEBEN:         As I said, the Section 3553(a)

10   process is a holistic one.          There are seven different

11   factors listed in Section 3553(a); and the commission,

12   when it formulated the Guidelines, looked at the same

13   sorts of factors and attempted to balance them.

14               This judge here did not devote particularly

15   significant consideration at all to the fact that

16   Petitioner sold 10,000 ecstasy pills, which have the

17   potential for causing significant harm.

18               And he earned a great deal of money out of

19   it.   He didn't give the money back.                    He may have

20   invested it in the house that he bought.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I'm sure that the

22   prosecutor argued that, and the judge heard it, and he

23   listed what thought were the key factors.

24               You made a distinction between a sentence

25   could be rational but not reasonable.                     And I'm

 1   accustomed to understanding rationality review as

 2   equivalent to reasonableness review, but you made a

 3   distinction between those two.                So I get your idea of

 4   rationality passes the lunatic test.                      What is

 5   reasonableness?

 6                MR. DREEBEN:          Reasonableness requires more

 7   of a balance of the policies and a consideration of the

 8   overall goal of the system of achieving uniformity.

 9                And I think perhaps the best way to

10   illustrate the point is through a hypothetical similar

11   to the one that Justice Kennedy posed.                     Suppose that a

12   district judge, confronting Petitioner, said:                       You were

13   a college student.      You had every advantage in life.

14   You were 21; you weren't a kid.                You made $40,000 over

15   seven months.   And when it suited you, you pulled out,

16   and you did nothing to disrupt the conspiracy.

17                Now, I have a statutory range here of zero

18   to 20.   And, although the guidelines call only for 30 to

19   37 months, I think you should go to jail for 15 years.

20                I don't see Petitioner as really offering a

21   court of appeals or the criminal-justice system as a

22   whole a way for someone to step in and say that's

23   excessive.   It doesn't leave room to make reasoned

24   distinctions among the kinds of defendants who violate

25   this statute, and it doesn't provide any check on

 1   aberrant or outlier outcomes.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           We're trying to development

 3   a rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the

 4   courts of appeals when they are reviewing the

 5   innumerable sentences of federal district judges.

 6                And you have -- you haven't given me a rule.

 7   I have no idea -- if I were sitting on the court of

 8   appeals, I would have no idea when I can do it and when

 9   I can't do it.

10                The notion of reasonableness, you know,

11   whether a reasonable person could have given a sentence

12   of this sort despite the fact that it is not what the

13   Sentencing Commission did, that's -- that's something

14   you can work with, but I don't understand what your rule

15   is.

16                MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Scalia, the competing

17   rule of mere rationality or the judge did something

18   that's reasonable is pretty much a one-way ticket to

19   disparity.   Because it means that every district judge

20   would get the opportunity to say:                I've seen the

21   guidelines, but I don't agree; and, as a result, I'm

22   giving the 15-year sentence to Mr. Gall versus all the

23   way down to probation, and the courts of appeals would

24   have to affirm both.

25                Now, I am trying --

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I wouldn't say -- I

 2   wouldn't say that.      There are -- there are certain --

 3   certain limits where you would -- the example you gave

 4   of that kind of an acceleration of the penalty, and I

 5   can see giving this person no jail time whatever would

 6   be extreme.

 7                 But if you are trying to get a narrow range

 8   of sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me

 9   you're just working in opposition to what our opinions

10   have said which is that the guidelines are advisory.

11   And they're not mandatory.

12                 MR. DREEBEN:         Well, the question I think

13   here is how advisory do they have to be in order to

14   comply with this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence

15   and the remedial opinion in Booker, as I understand it,

16   answered that question by saying they're not mandatory,

17   but the features of the appellate review and continued

18   existence of the sentencing commission are going to work

19   significantly to achieving Congress's objectives of

20   increased uniformity.        And the nine courts of appeals

21   that have adopted proportionality review, even if they

22   may have used slightly different words to express it,

23   are -- I think, responding to a fundamental intuition,

24   which is how do I know if the sentence in front of me is

25   likely to be significantly outside the norm.

 1              And second, if it is, should I not look for

 2   more to sustain it than a sentence that's co-extensive

 3   with the guidelines sentence.

 4              I think this case is really the counterpart

 5   case to the Rita case that the Court decided last term

 6   when that judgment of the sentencing court and the

 7   district judge -- the sentencing commission and the

 8   district judge coincide, courts of appeals can assume

 9   it's likely, although not definitely true -- but likely

10   that the sentence is a reasonable one.                  But when the

11   sentence is significantly outside what the guidelines

12   would call for on an average case of that type --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Dreeben, you are

14   saying that you admit there's no presumption of

15   unreasonable merely because it is outside but there is a

16   presumption of reasonable if it dramatically or

17   significantly is outside and you don't define

18   dramatically or significantly?

19              MR. DREEBEN:          I am not able to give the

20   Court a rigid definition of it.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:             You are not able to give

22   any definition.   You disavow a percentage.                 You just

23   come up with nothing else.          Just the word dramatically.

24   You do say it is a presumption at that point by --

25              MR. DREEBEN:          I don't treat what I'm arguing


                                       45

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   for as a presumption, but if the Court wants to conclude

 2   that it does function like a presumption, I would still

 3   submit it is a perfectly valid presumption under these

 4   circumstances.

 5                It is not that the court of appeals --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you should --

 7   I'm sorry.   But I mean -- the only purpose of the

 8   presumption under your view is to trigger some inquiry

 9   into the reasons.

10                MR. DREEBEN:         Correct.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under 3553(a),

12   district courts have to provide reasons anyway, right.

13                MR. DREEBEN:         They do.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So if there is no

15   explanation of the reasons it is going to be invalid

16   under the statute, quite apart from any presumption of

17   unreasonableness.

18                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, the presumption of

19   unreasonableness goes a little bit farther than that,

20   Mr. Chief Justice, because it allows the court of

21   appeals to take notice that this is a sentence that if

22   upheld holds the potential for unwarranted disparity.

23   And it may be that the sentence doesn't pose that risk

24   at all.   But the reasons that the judge gave to justify

25   that sentence should be somewhat commensurate or


                                        46

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   proportionate to the degree of the variance, otherwise

 2   you're basically back to a system where so long as the

 3   judge can go through the facts of the case and give a

 4   rational explanation of why a sentence should be at that

 5   level, there's nothing for the appellate court to do but

 6   to affirm.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Why isn't that always true?

 8   A judge should always give reasons commensurate with the

 9   problem.     So what if we added by saying remember give

10   reasons commensurate with the problem?                      I see something

11   we've lost.    What we've lost is we've sort of pulled

12   across the screen here a rather murky curtain called

13   "something of a presumption," which we can't quite

14   define, which will lead to lawyers making endless

15   arguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on

16   one side of it or the other.              So let's sweep its aside.

17   Let's get to the underlying facts.

18                 MR. DREEBEN:         What you'd be doing I think,

19   Justice Breyer, is sweeping aside the approach that nine

20   circuits have taken.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's correct.

22                 MR. DREEBEN:         Which have usefully

23   facilitated their appellate review.                       They didn't select

24   the standard because they drew it out of an opinion from

25   this Court.    They selected the standard because they

 1   considered it essentially a rule of reason.               The rule

 2   being that under an advisory guideline system, we must

 3   accept that there will be considerably less uniformity

 4   than under a mandatory system.               That's appropriate.     But

 5   we don't have to accept the proposition that materially

 6   outlier sentences that are not supported by an adequate

 7   explanation should stand.           And if the courts of appeals

 8   are told, you go back to the drawing board now, you

 9   can't use any kind of proportionality test, I think

10   unless the Court gives them something that will allow

11   them to distinguish between a materially out of

12   guideline sentence that is reasonable and one that is

13   not, the ultimate result will be every district judge

14   knowing that in their courtroom, they can decide

15   whatever they like about the fundamental policies of

16   sentences, and it will stand.

17                 The reason why the sentencing guidelines

18   system was originally adopted was to eliminate each

19   district judge operating purely on that judge's

20   philosophy.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           We were making progress?      I

22   thought our last discussion -- we were making progress

23   on this very point, where we have the judgmental

24   matters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy

25   matters, and we distinguished the latter from the first

 1   two?

 2              If you were a district judge, wouldn't you

 3   find it more enlightening to talk in those terms?

 4              MR. DREEBEN:            No.      I think that what the

 5   district judges need to understand is that they're not

 6   bound by the guidelines, but the guidelines remain

 7   something that is a reference point, that if deviations

 8   or variances are warranted, they should be explained,

 9   and they should be explained in a way that's consistent

10   with the degree of the variance.                 Because the

11   alternative of wholesale abdication to the district

12   judge to assess the individual facts of the case means

13   that one district judge can conclude that a defendant

14   like Mr. Gall warrants probation, and another one can

15   conclude that he warrants 10 or 15 years, and there'll

16   be no remedy on appeal because it will all be very

17   case-specific.   It won't be policy driven disagreements.

18   Most of what goes on in Federal sentencing is not

19   fundamentally a deep-rooted policy disagreement of the

20   nature of the kind that Justice Scalia and I were

21   discussing, about whether white collar defendants should

22   go to jail at all.

23              Most of it is about how do the particular

24   features of this individual defendant match up with the

25   policy considerations --

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Dreeben, can I ask

 2   another question?    I go back to percentages for just --

 3   to illustrate the point.          You say that the justification

 4   has to be responsive to the extent of the departure.

 5   And you -- you kind of disavow percentages that trigger

 6   -- you say substantial.         But how do you measure the

 7   strength of justifications?             For example in this case,

 8   there were four or five justifications -- withdrawal

 9   from a conspiracy, youth, that he got over alcoholism,

10   so forth.   Is the judge supposed to put a percentage

11   value on each of those justifications and see if they

12   add up to the percentage?           And if not, aren't you

13   comparing oranges and apples?

14                MR. DREEBEN:         It is more of a wholistic and

15   judgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice

16   Stevens.    And I am reluctant to offer percentages

17   because I don't want to be mistaken for saying there is

18   some litmus test with superguidelines, ranges -- but I

19   can say that courts of appeals that find a variance to

20   warrant a substantial or extraordinary justification are

21   typically looking at 40 to 50 to 60 percent away from

22   the guidelines range, not sentences that --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Does that call for a 40 to

24   50 percent justification?

25                MR. DREEBEN:         It calls for one that makes

 1   sense given the degree of the various --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But don't you read the

 3   court of appeals opinions as in effect saying we've got

 4   to get a percentage that matches the percentage of

 5   departure?

 6                MR. DREEBEN:         Linguistically, the words used

 7   are, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary

 8   departure -- an extraordinary reason for an

 9   extraordinary departure or variance.                     So in that sense,

10   I agree with you.    But the court of appeals have not

11   attempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an

12   exercise would be both contrary to the notion of

13   advisory guidelines, and also one that is inherently

14   arbitrary.   And that's why I said that it is

15   unfortunately more in the nature of, I know it when I

16   see it, but I don't think that this is as bad as the

17   predicament the Court found itself in in obscenity

18   cases, because it really isn't that hard to tell the

19   difference between a variance that is a few months

20   outside the range or even a variance in the facts of

21   this Gall case, say down to 15 months, and a sentence

22   that just wipes out all prison time altogether.

23                I don't think the Court should have any

24   difficulty saying that if a judge is just going to wipe

25   out all prison time --

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Can I ask you -- if it

 2   wipes it out entirely, does that make this case

 3   different or like a case in which the maximum was say --

 4   was 30 years instead of 30 months?                   Are they both to be

 5   judged by the same standard on the justification?

 6                MR. DREEBEN:          Well, in this case, because

 7   the government believes that the guidelines provide a

 8   reference point for proportionality review, a sentence

 9   --

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Supposing the guidelines

11   provided 30 years?      Would the justification for

12   probation in that case have to be just as strong as in

13   this case?

14                MR. DREEBEN:          Stronger, I would say, because

15   if the guidelines --

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Because the percentage is

17   really irrelevant --

18                MR. DREEBEN:          Excuse me.

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             It would -- then the

20   percentage is irrelevant, if you said it has to be

21   stronger in that case.

22                MR. DREEBEN:          Yes, I think that -- that's

23   why I don't think you can confine it to percentage.                  I

24   think if the guidelines are calling for a very

25   substantial period of imprisonment, and a judge says, I

 1   just don't think the culpability of white collar

 2   offenders ever warrants sending them to jail, I think

 3   the better approach is you have them go out and make

 4   speeches to fellow potential defendants about how

 5   terrible their experience was, that is something that's

 6   going to produce a very widespread potential for

 7   disparity.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Dreeben, you're --

 9   you're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was

10   downward, but you're -- the principle you apply, you

11   would apply for upward departures as well?

12                MR. DREEBEN:        Yes.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Doesn't there get to be a

14   constitutional problem where -- where the court which is

15   establishing these -- these ranges that you want has

16   held, after a series of decisions, that basically you

17   cannot get 30 percent over -- over the guideline range

18   unless particular facts exist?              And it has specified

19   those -- those facts in prior decisions.                At that point,

20   in order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the

21   guidelines, that fact becomes necessary for the

22   conviction and -- or for the sentence, and, therefore,

23   you would need the jury to find it.

24                MR. DREEBEN:        No, Justice Scalia.         I don't

25   think that courts of appeals conducting reasonableness

 1   review should in effect construct their own guidelines

 2   system.   They should respond to the reasons and the

 3   facts that are before them.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's what common law

 5   adjudication always amounts to.              By trial and error, one

 6   case, the next case, you eventually end up knowing what

 7   is necessary in order to give 30 -- 30 percent over.

 8               Unless you're accomplishing that, I don't

 9   know what you're accomplishing.

10               MR. DREEBEN:         Well, I -- I think you're not

11   accomplishing that kind of a common law system in

12   reasonableness review for many of the reasons that the

13   Court has already identified in describing why an

14   abuse-of-discretion approach is warranted.                 The court of

15   appeals will not be saying that this is the maximum

16   sentence you could give on these facts.                 It would say

17   these -- this is an unreasonable or a reasonable

18   sentence based on the policy considerations that the

19   judge articulated and the facts that he relied on.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            He said this fact is okay.

21   You can go 30 percent above with this fact.                 So then in

22   the next case, the district judge says, I find that this

23   fact exists and therefore you get 30 percent above the

24   max, and the court of appeals affirms, but the jury has

25   never found that fact.

 1                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Scalia, I think

 2   that the fundamental question of whether there is

 3   substantive reasonableness review for excessiveness was

 4   settled in the Rita an opinion in which -- Rita

 5   recognized that Booker contemplated --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It left open -- it left

 7   open case-by-case adjudication.               It left -- application

 8   review.    And I'm saying that in the application review

 9   of that case, you'd have to say you needed a jury

10   finding.

11                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, my response -- and if I

12   could answer Mr. Chief Justice -- is that the

13   fundamental point of this Court's Apprendi line of cases

14   is that, so long as the statutory maximum is legally

15   available to the judge, the judge can find facts within

16   that range that justify the sentence, and that's all the

17   Booker remedial opinion authorizes judges to do.

 1               Most bluntly, an I-know-it-when-I-see-it

 2   test or a holistic test is not likely to generate much

 3   in the way of warranted uniformity either.

 4               Justice Scalia, you pointed out, in your

 5   question about whether this sentence was excessive or

 6   not on the basis of the -- of the facts, that the

 7   government is blowing smoke with respect to its

 8   statement that the guidelines is purely advisory.                 Well,

 9   it's not only doing that; it's removing the exercise of

10   discretion by the district judge.

11               It's saying to the district judge, you must

12   demonstrate to us facts.         You must come to us with facts

13   that not only consist of explanations of reasons but are

14   sufficiently persuasive or compelling to overcome our

15   natural resistance to an outside-the-guidelines

16   sentence.

17               That I submit is, as articulated earlier,

18   making the guidelines presumptive.                 And it imposes a

19   fact-finding requirement that is in violation of the

20   Sixth Amendment.

21               Justice Ginsburg, you asked about whether

22   the prosecutor had, in fact, heard all of the evidence

23   with respect to -- or stated all the evidence to the

24   district court with respect to Mr. Gall.                 The answer to

25   that question is he most certainly did.                 And I agree

 1   with my colleague that this case is the mirror of Rita.

 2   In Rita, the district judge was presented with a wealth

 3   of facts about Mr. Rita's prior good works, his military

 4   service, et cetera.

 5              Here, the district judge was again presented

 6   with a wealth of facts with respect to Mr. Gall's

 7   voluntary rehabilitation, with respect to his having

 8   grown, developed, and established a business and rid

 9   himself of crime and drugs.           And this district judge

10   exercised his discretion to go down on the basis of

11   those facts and imposed a sentence of probation.

12              And, Justice Stevens, the Eighth Circuit,

13   even before the Guidelines, even before the Booker case,

14   in 1993, in 1999, in cases called One Star and Decora

15   respectively, went down from even higher levels to

16   probation based upon the particular facts of the case.

17              We would ask the Court to overturn the

18   judgment of the Eighth Circuit and abandon the

19   extraordinary circumstances test.

20              Thank you.
