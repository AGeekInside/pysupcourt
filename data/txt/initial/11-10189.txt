 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We will hear next

 4   this morning in Case 11-10189, Trevino v. Thaler.

 5               Mr. Wolf?

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. WOLF:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has

11   said, repeatedly, "As a general rule, a defendant should

12   not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel

13   on direct appeal," and has recognized that Texas

14   procedure make it, "virtually impossible for appellate

15   counsel to adequately present such a claim."                  Those

16   claims are the choices made by the sovereign State of

17   Texas, and it renders this case just like Martinez.

18               This case well illustrates the consequences

19   of that choice.    The transcript in this case was not

20   ready -- available for 7 months.                 That's 4 1/2 months

21   after the trial lost -- trial court lost jurisdiction on

22   any new trial motion.

23               The State itself argued, quote -- in

24   Sprouse -- "Without access to that record, new counsel

25   would have little basis for attacking the performance of
                                3

 1   trial counsel."

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Suppose the State's

 3   position were not as you accurately have stated the

 4   Texas Court of Criminal Appeal.                It didn't say

 5   collateral review is the preferred route.                It said

 6   either way will do.      You can bring it up on direct

 7   appeal, or you can bring it up on collateral.

 8                 Would you say that Martinez applies in that

 9   situation?   Or does it depend on having the -- the State

10   highest court in the matter saying, this is the

11   preferred way to go?

12                 MR. WOLF:      Texas systemically channels

13   ineffective assistance claims to collateral -- to State

14   habeas.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And if it didn't, if it

16   just said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize

17   these limitations because the transcript won't be ready,

18   so you can wait and bring it up on habeas.

19                 I'm just asking how far -- the rule that you

20   would like us to adopt -- you say this is just like

21   Martinez.    Is that where you would draw the line, that

22   the -- the State's highest court has to say, we prefer

23   this matter to be brought up on collateral review?

24                 MR. WOLF:      It's not just them saying it in

25   words, but it's also saying it in the legislation and in
                                4

 1   the rules that the State of Texas has adopted.

 2                  In order to expand the record in a Wiggins

 3   claim -- which is what's the basis of Mr. Trevino's

 4   claim, in order to expand that record, you have a 30-day

 5   window to file a motion for new trial, and 75 days --

 6   75 days to have a hearing on it or else the court loses

 7   jurisdiction by operation of law.

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The district court,

 9   the trial court?

10                  MR. WOLF:      That's correct.             And so you

11   couldn't expand the record.             And, in order to present a

12   Wiggins claim, especially, it takes a considerable

13   amount of extra record investigation.

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Has the Texas --

15   have the Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim

16   back for an evidentiary hearing?

17                  MR. WOLF:      After 75 days, the -- the

18   district court loses jurisdiction, and I realize there

19   are some jurisdictions around the country that have that

20   opportunity.    But Texas has a finality where there is no

21   provision to expand the record after that 75-day period.

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So far as you know,

23   the court -- the appellate court's never done that?

24                  MR. WOLF:      That's correct.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.   Why does

 1   Texas afford people in your client's position a new

 2   appellate counsel?

 3                MR. WOLF:        Well, there's two -- actually,

 4   Texas has a dual-track system.                It was developed in

 5   1995, a year before the Federal system was developed in

 6   AEDPA.   And the concept -- and the reason for it -- the

 7   rationale, was to expedite these type of claims,

 8   especially in death penalty claims, under

 9   Section 11.071.

10                But the -- and the purpose is that there is

11   two counsels that are appointed.                 One counsel is

12   appointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's

13   done on direct appeal.         The other counsel is appointed

14   in all cases -- there's no question -- on habeas.

15                And that attorney -- that counsel is

16   appointed with the understanding that he's going to have

17   the time to do the extra-record-based claims.                 In a case

18   like this, the record wasn't even prepared for 7 months

19   after the date of the judgment.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Counsel, I don't know

21   that you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question, and so

22   I'm going to take it up because it interests me.

23                Let's assume, as she did in her

24   hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case

25   law like Texas does, that says, we prefer you to go that

 1   way, for non-record-based claims.

 2                Is the difference between that hypothetical

 3   State that says, you can do either, and the Texas

 4   situation, is that Texas, in your mind, puts up

 5   procedural impediments to using the direct appeal

 6   mechanism and so that, if the other State hasn't done

 7   that, has made the development of evidence, has provided

 8   a full opportunity for you to develop a record before

 9   the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be

10   subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only

11   because it has the procedural impediments?

12                MR. WOLF:      That's correct because the -- the

13   scheme that Texas has developed systemically channels

14   the habeas claim, the IAC claim, the ineffective

15   assistance claim, into habeas.              There is no -- to say

16   that it could be done is really an illusion.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           How -- how do you want us

18   to formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your

19   favor?   If a State does not give a realistic

20   opportunity -- a feasible means for expanding the record

21   on direct review, then Martinez applies because it is

22   the collateral proceeding that is the meaningful one --

23   and then we go through 50 States to see if that rule

24   applies?

25                MR. WOLF:      Well, it wouldn't really affect
                                     7

 1   50 States because some States provide a mechanism for an

 2   abatement to go back on direct appeal and -- and expand

 3   the record.    Other States require that it go to direct

 4   appeal, and each -- and those States made -- have made a

 5   choice.

 6                  And Texas has made a choice by developing

 7   this scheme.    And as far as the other States, they would

 8   have to compare themselves to the situation that -- that

 9   we would -- that would come out of this.                  This --

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, I have the same

11   questions that my colleagues have asked.                  Could you give

12   us, in a sentence or two, the test that you would like

13   us to apply?    Where a State does not, like Arizona,

14   prohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal,

15   Martinez, nevertheless, applies where the State does

16   blank.    Fill in the blank.

17                  MR. WOLF:      When it makes it impracticable,

18   in the vast majority of cases, to raise the claim on

19   direct appeal.

20                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Impracticable, in the vast

21   majority of cases.      Now, that really would require a

22   case-by-case determination in every other State that

23   doesn't fall within the Martinez category, wouldn't it?

24                  MR. WOLF:      Well, not necessarily --

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:            No?

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. WOLF:      -- Justice Alito, because

 2   there's -- some States require that their -- their cases

 3   are directed back to -- to direct appeal, and there's a

 4   mechanism to expand the record.              There is some -- there

 5   is -- some require it to go to direct appeal.

 6               But, in Texas, what we have is a limitation

 7   that's the rules that the Texas Supreme Court has

 8   devised, with Texas --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I understand that.

10   But -- so -- so the State says, you have to raise this

11   on direct appeal, but you have to comply with our time

12   limits on direct appeal.        And they don't appoint -- you

13   know, you don't get a new -- you don't get a new

14   attorney on direct appeal.          It's the same attorney who

15   represented you at trial.         So that attorney is in the

16   position of arguing that he or she was ineffective at

17   trial.

18               And that would be okay?

19               MR. WOLF:      If the -- let me make sure I

20   understand the question.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          You have to raise it on

22   direct appeal or it's lost.          You can't wait until

23   collateral -- until the collateral proceeding, and, by

24   the way, you don't get a new attorney.                 You get the same

25   attorney that represented you at trial.                Would that be
                                9
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   all right?

 2                 MR. WOLF:      No, because the new -- the old

 3   attorney -- the trial attorney is in the worst, really,

 4   position to understand his ineffectiveness.                  There is a

 5   disincentive for him --

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:          All right.         So you have the

 7   same system where you get a new attorney, but you have

 8   to comply with the time limits.

 9                 MR. WOLF:      And that --

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:          And then you say, well, I

11   can't do all of this social background research that

12   Wiggins requires within the time limits, so that's

13   impracticable.   Is that State okay?

14                 MR. WOLF:      No, because that's --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:          That's not okay, either.

16                 MR. WOLF:      Because that State is -- in the

17   Texas scheme -- in the Texas scheme, the -- Texas gives

18   us another attorney in this dual track -- this system,

19   and it's understood that that attorney is the habeas

20   attorney.    And he doesn't -- he doesn't have that time

21   limitation that the direct appeal attorney has,

22   that's -- that 75-day limitation.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But is your point that he

24   has to have one full and fair opportunity to make the

25   Wiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct
                               10

 1   or collateral?   I think you mentioned that at least one

 2   State requires you to do it on direct, but does provide

 3   for developing the record.

 4                MR. WOLF:      But the -- the bottom line in --

 5   in our situation, in Texas, is that we have a scheme.

 6   We have a set of -- of laws and -- and rules that

 7   channel these type of claims.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What are the rules other

 9   than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said, in

10   several decisions, the preferred route is collateral

11   review?

12                MR. WOLF:      Well, first of all, the -- the

13   Rule -- the Rules of Appellate Procedure 21.8 talk about

14   the limitations of -- the number of days that you have

15   to expand the record in a motion for new trial.

16   75 days, the -- the district court loses jurisdiction,

17   they cannot hear anything else on this case.            The record

18   in this case wasn't even available for 7 months after

19   the date of the trial.

20                So, even with a new attorney that's

21   appointed -- first of all, that new attorney is a

22   stranger to the case.       He doesn't know anything about

23   the case.   He's not in a position to talk to the client.

24   The client is not the best person to understand the

25   Rules of Appellate Procedure.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  So he's got to wait on that -- on that trial

 2   record, first of all, to see what's there.                  And then --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm -- I'm not sure

 4   exactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I

 5   didn't -- I don't understand why you didn't say, oh,

 6   yes, that's right, there has to be one full fair

 7   opportunity to raise the issue.                 And that's what we are

 8   arguing here.

 9                  MR. WOLF:      I'm sorry if -- if I missed that,

10   but that's exactly the point.               And that's what --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then the next -- then my

12   question is:    Does this apply just to capital cases?

13                  MR. WOLF:      No.

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could we in a -- oh.      So

15   this doesn't apply just to capital cases, in your

16   opinion?

17                  MR. WOLF:      Not necessarily.            But the -- in

18   the capital arena in Texas, we have the dual-track

19   system, where you get an attorney appointed

20   automatically in a habeas setting, where, in a non-death

21   penalty setting, there is a possibility of getting an

22   attorney in the interest of justice, but it's not always

23   guaranteed.    And, in that case, the appeal is done in a

24   successive way, not in this dual-track way.

25                  And in -- in the death penalty arena, it

 1   manifests -- it makes it even more manifestly obvious

 2   that there is a systematic channeling by the State

 3   referring these type of claims into habeas, while the

 4   State attorney, the district appeals attorney, focuses

 5   on the record-based claim, and the habeas attorney is

 6   dealing with all of the case, not just the trial, but

 7   the -- the appeal, to make sure that there was no

 8   ineffectiveness on his part, that -- and also to do the

 9   investigation on the extra-record-based claims, which

10   takes a substantial amount of time.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, you -- you

12   started to answer this question, but it is something

13   raised by many of the amici opposing your position,

14   which is that, by adopting your position, we're

15   essentially having to examine the 49-plus -- because we

16   have territories that have collateral and direct review

17   as well -- plus systems to see which apply -- to which

18   Martinez applies and to which -- to which Martinez

19   doesn't apply.

20               And so the question is:                    How do we write

21   this to sort of give enough guidance, so that we're not

22   examining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems -- or maybe

23   48, after we've decided Martinez?

24               MR. WOLF:      Right.        Well, I would suggest --

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             And -- and why should we
                               13
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   not fear that outcome?

 2                MR. WOLF:       Okay.       I would suggest the rule

 3   to be that Martinez applies when a State channels

 4   ineffective assistance of counsel claims to State habeas

 5   and makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases

 6   to raise the claim on direct appeal.

 7                And, in answer to your question about all of

 8   the States, many of the States do make it -- do make

 9   habeas available in the direct appeal arena.                 So it's --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:           So the reason why -- the

11   reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective

12   assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is

13   that it is often -- maybe in the great majority of

14   cases -- impracticable to adjudicate them on direct

15   appeal.   So, under your standard, it seems to me that

16   covers every State.

17                MR. WOLF:       Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito,

18   for this reason:    Many States have a mechanism, unlike

19   the Texas scheme, which permits the expansion of the

20   record.   Some States, like Utah, who authored the amicus

21   brief, has a Rule 21.3, which permits the claimant to go

22   back and expand the record.            We don't have the -- that

23   ability in Texas.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, your friend

25   says, page 18 of his brief, that you do.                 He says,
                               14
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "Under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 21, direct

 2   appeal counsel can supplement the record with evidence

 3   developed by investigators and experts, the ones that

 4   are appointed and paid for by the State on appeal."

 5               Now, is that just wrong?

 6               MR. WOLF:      Yes.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.

 8               MR. WOLF:      And the reason I say that is, in

 9   order to obtain a record, one, you need to -- when you

10   file your motion for new trial, you have to specifically

11   set out the factual basis for the claim; and, two, the

12   affidavit has to identify the evidence that any further

13   investigation would have revealed.

14               So you've got that 30-day window when you

15   file that motion for new trial that you have to do all

16   of those things, and that's not enough time.

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:          So if everything -- if

18   everything in Texas's system were the same, but you had

19   a year, would that flip Texas into a different category?

20               MR. WOLF:      If the --

21               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Is the problem -- is what

22   makes this impracticable just the amount of time?

23               MR. WOLF:      Yes, because the time -- the

24   time -- especially in a Wiggins claim, is prohibitive in

25   order to be able to prepare and -- not just the time
                               15
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there, but the time that is imposed by the Rules of --

 2   of Appellate Procedure.

 3                That 75-day window, in order to expand the

 4   record, is part of this whole system, that it's

 5   understood that the habeas claim is the -- the IAC claim

 6   is channelled into habeas.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, let me try this one

 8   more time.   You -- you seem to say, in your brief, that

 9   the Kansas procedure and the -- the Michigan procedure

10   take those States outside of the Martinez category; is

11   that correct?

12                MR. WOLF:      Yes.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:          All right.         Now, as I

14   understand the procedure in those cases, it is the

15   following:   On direct appeal, the attorney can make a

16   motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance

17   of counsel, and, if some threshold is met, the appellate

18   court can remand the case to the trial court for a

19   hearing on ineffective assistance.

20                Is that correct?

21                MR. WOLF:      Yes.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:          Okay.       And that would -- in

23   most of those cases, the attorney on direct appeal is

24   going to be the attorney who represented the defendant

25   at trial and is probably not going to be in a very good
                               16
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   position to argue that he or she was ineffective at

 2   trial, but that would still be okay?

 3               MR. WOLF:      Well, but it's a --

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:          And if you don't do that,

 5   you've lost it.

 6               MR. WOLF:      Well, there's a problem with

 7   declaring yourself ineffective.              One, it's -- it's kind

 8   of counterintuitive.     In Texas, if you declare yourself

 9   ineffective, there's repercussions.                    You're no longer

10   available to -- you know, be taken off the list to get

11   appointments on these type of claims.

12               And -- and it's also against the Bar rules

13   to -- to have that adverse interest against your client.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, if that is the

15   system in Kansas and Michigan, then why -- why is it

16   outside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively

17   present the ineffective assistance counsel when you've

18   got the same counsel who was alleged to have been

19   ineffective and is not going to condemn himself?

20               MR. WOLF:      Well, that -- as far as their

21   State -- you know, other States are concerned -- you

22   know, those are problems within those States.                    But as

23   far as Texas is concerned -- you know, we are in a

24   situation that we find ourselves in -- in a Martinez

25   situation, where there was no ability to -- to raise --
                               17
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the system that we have prevents you from raising this

 2   claim.

 3                 And, as far as the other States are

 4   concerned, some of the States have a more liberal

 5   opportunity to -- to expand the record, but that's not

 6   the system that we have in Texas.                 And this --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Explain why the time that

 8   you have on direct appeal isn't adequate.                 So you say

 9   you need -- need to investigate.                Well, some of the

10   things, like school records, his prison records, it

11   doesn't take a long time to get those, does it?

12                 MR. WOLF:      Well, it -- it takes a while.

13   I'm not going to say a long while, but releases are

14   required.   Sometimes, there's opposition to releasing

15   those records.   But the biggest part of -- of this whole

16   problem is getting the record, is also, in our

17   situation, to have Mr. Trevino evaluated regarding

18   his -- there was never a psychological or sociological

19   study done in his case, and to have a psychological eval

20   done, that doesn't happen in 30 days.

21                 And one -- you've got to get the records,

22   and, in some of these situations, one record leads to

23   another record and finding one witness leads to another

24   witness.    And, by the time you start developing all

25   these other avenues and when you put all that together,
                               18
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then you're in a position to present that to an expert,

 2   in order to make that sort of evaluation.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, surely --

 4   surely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new

 5   trial motion within 30 days, and the new counsel on

 6   appeal says, well, I have reason to believe -- well, we

 7   can see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of

 8   mitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I

 9   would like the time to conduct -- you know, the

10   psychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses,

11   is the trial court going to say no?

12                MR. WOLF:      That's correct because the

13   30 days is -- is a limit; it's a bar.                   That's all he

14   has.   And, in addition, the -- the direct appeal

15   attorney has his own responsibilities.                   There's a

16   division of labor that's here, that the direct appeal

17   attorney is supposed to review the entire record, to

18   look for all of whatever errors that might be there.

19                And while -- and that's why, in Texas, where

20   you have this dual-track system in order to expedite the

21   appeal, there is a new attorney that's appointed to do

22   the habeas work.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And because of the rather

24   sharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual

25   facts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State
                               19
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Bar of Texas in support of neither party.

 2                Can you tell me -- and that they are

 3   critical of having new counsel work simultaneously on a

 4   simultaneous timeframe concurrently with the -- with the

 5   new direct appeal counsel.

 6                Can you tell me how anything that's said in

 7   the Texas Bar briefs helps your case?

 8                MR. WOLF:         Well, it helps our case because

 9   it recognizes the dual-track system, and it recognizes

10   that the extra record under Section 12.22 of the

11   guide -- of the Texas guidelines that -- that were

12   formulated that the State Bar was -- one of their

13   committees on indigent defense helped develop.

14                They recognize the fact that extra record

15   investigation is the responsibility of the habeas

16   counsel.

17                I would like to reserve the balance of my

18   time.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

24   the Court:

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ineffectiveness claims are some of the most generous in

 2   the country.    Those procedures offered Petitioner two

 3   bites at the apple.

 4                  The first bite came in a constitutionally

 5   protected direct appeal proceeding.                       And any deficiency

 6   in that proceeding would have been the source of cause

 7   under existing cause and prejudice standards to excuse a

 8   subsequent default.

 9                  Allowing the Petitioner to assert cause on

10   the basis of a second bite at the apple -- that is, a

11   State habeas proceeding -- would create an unwarranted

12   and unworkable extension of Martinez.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why is it a second bite

14   when the Texas Supreme Court -- court of criminal

15   appeals, has said, again and again, as a general rule,

16   defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of

17   trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on

18   collateral review?

19                  MR. OLDHAM:       Justice Ginsburg, the very next

20   sentence of that opinion, Mata v. State, states that the

21   lack of a clear record, usually, will prevent the

22   appellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland

23   test as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and

24   motivations during trial can be proven deficient only

25   through facts that don't normally appear in the
                               21
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   appellate record.

 2                So the only question presented by those

 3   instructions that are quoted over and over again in the

 4   Petitioner's briefs is whether and to what extent

 5   newly-appointed counsel -- as Justice Alito was pointing

 6   out, Texas provides newly-appointed counsel on direct

 7   appeal in capital cases -- can supplement the appellate

 8   record with an explanation from the trial -- trial

 9   counsel.

10                And where the new counsel gets an

11   explanation of the strategies of the trial counsel, the

12   record is then complete --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I don't -- does the

14   statement "defendants should not raise ineffective

15   assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal" doesn't

16   mean what it says?

17                MR. OLDHAM:         Oh, yes, ma'am.          It does mean

18   that.   It's just that what -- what the Court is

19   saying -- the very next sentence following the ones that

20   are quoted in the Petitioner's brief, says, "The reason

21   that one should not raise an issue of ineffective

22   assistance of counsel on direct appeal is because, in

23   cases where there is no explanation from the trial

24   counsel, it will be impossible to adjudicate the first

25   prong of the Strickland test."
                               22

 1                It doesn't say that, as a general rule, you

 2   should just never do it.            It just says, if you are

 3   actually going to raise a claim of ineffective

 4   assistance, you should create the proper record before

 5   you do it.   And --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But then -- but the

 7   comment is that the record has to be done within a very

 8   short period of time, and the -- and the trial record

 9   isn't even available for -- the transcript, for some 7

10   months.

11                MR. OLDHAM:          Yes, Justice Kennedy, and that

12   is why Texas has a procedure for abating and remanding

13   appeals that is materially identical to the one that

14   Kansas provides and the Petitioner concedes is

15   sufficient to satisfy this Court's inquiry in Martinez.

16                So the way that the procedure in Texas would

17   work, as it does in Kansas, is that the newly appointed

18   direct appeal lawyer -- who has no conflict and is,

19   therefore, free to accuse trial counsel of being

20   ineffective -- would file a motion to stay the appeal,

21   abate it, and remand it to the trial court.

22                The showing in both States is roughly the

23   same; it's a facially plausible claim of

24   ineffectiveness.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the new counsel on
                                23

 1   direct waits for 7 months, gets the transcript.              In the

 2   meantime, let's assume has made some investigation, and

 3   he said -- and he tells the appellate court, we have

 4   some very important material that we want to introduce

 5   and we need to supplement the record; please remand this

 6   case.

 7                MR. OLDHAM:       Yes, Your Honor.         And one

 8   point --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That -- that has never

10   happened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take

11   it?

12                MR. OLDHAM:       I'm not aware of a capital

13   case, but it has been done in many, many noncapital

14   cases.   And the Court of Criminal Appeals has

15   specifically blessed it, especially -- particularly in a

16   case involving a Wiggins type ineffective assistance of

17   counsel at punishment phase.

18                That is a case called Cooks v. State.                It's

19   cited on pages 32 and 34 of our brief.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the Fifth Circuit was

21   wrong, the circuit that ruled in favor of Texas, but

22   said, in the Ibarra case, the Texas Court of Criminal

23   Appeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions --

24   and the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle

25   for developing ineffective assistance claims?

 1               Was that wrong?

 2               MR. OLDHAM:        I believe it just needs to be

 3   taken in the context of -- it is the preferred vehicle

 4   if you have not developed the record to bring a claim --

 5   or to bring a claim appropriately on direct appeal.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Let me understand what

11   you are suggesting.      Counsel doesn't have a record.            He

12   or she is newly appointed.          Can they go into court and

13   say, I don't know if there is an ineffective assistance

14   of counsel claim, but I need to protect my client and

15   abate this hearing now, until I get the trial record,

16   whether it takes 6 months, 7 months, or a year.

17               What will the court do with its rule that

18   requires counsel to provide affidavits setting forth the

19   good-faith basis for a claim?

20               MR. OLDHAM:        Well, Justice Sotomayor,

21   many -- many prisoners in Texas, in capital and

22   noncapital contexts alike, have done that within the

23   30 days, but I want to emphasize --

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How many were given an

25   indefinite stay until they got the trial record to set
                               25

 1   forth the affidavits?

 2                MR. OLDHAM:        Well, if it's done within the

 3   first 30 days, you don't need a stay, indefinite or

 4   otherwise.   You can just file --

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So what do you do with

 6   the 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says,

 7   if the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within

 8   75 days, the matter ends?

 9                MR. OLDHAM:        I think the easiest way to

10   think about it is there are basically three stages.

11   There is the first 30-day window, and, as I say, many

12   capital and noncapital prisoners have effectively

13   brought their claims in that 30-day window.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Some of them have the

15   information, and some don't.

16                MR. OLDHAM:        That's correct.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              All right.   So --

18                MR. OLDHAM:        So that's the first box, but

19   it's certainly not the last.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              The guys who do it, it's

21   because they have the information, and so they've

22   exhausted their claim.        But we are talking about the

23   people who don't.

24                MR. OLDHAM:        So to the second -- the second

25   box.   After the new trial motion has been denied by an
                                26

 1   operation of law, you can make, effectively, a factual

 2   proffer of -- so the -- the trial court no longer has

 3   jurisdiction to grant your motion, but you can make a

 4   factual proffer of what you would have shown and what

 5   you want to show to the court of appeals.

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That assumes you get the

 7   transcript.

 8                 MR. OLDHAM:       Well, we are still prior to the

 9   transcript because this is still -- this is still --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             No, the 75 days has

11   passed.

12                 MR. OLDHAM:       And then, after that, there is

13   no briefing that has been done in the appellate court at

14   this point because the appellate briefing schedule and

15   the transcript production are tied to one another, so it

16   would never be a case where you're actually litigating a

17   direct appeal without the transcript.                    You -- the latter

18   doesn't start until you get the former.

19                 And, at that point, you can make a motion to

20   stay and abate to return to the district court and to

21   supplement the record with evidence of your trial

22   counsel's ineffectiveness.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even beyond the

24   75 days?

25                 MR. OLDHAM:       Yes, Your Honor.             It

 1   effectively restarts the 30-day clock, so the -- the old

 2   75 days is obviously gone, and you get a new 35 days on

 3   the stay and abate motion.          So, in that sense, it's

 4   materially identical to the procedure that Kansas

 5   applies, although, as I mentioned earlier, in capital

 6   cases, the State of Texas guarantees its prisoners a new

 7   conflict-free lawyer, who can help with that proceeding.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            So he can do this -- I

 9   didn't understand this.       I'm sorry.

10               Joe Smith is convicted on day 1.                 The

11   transcript appears 9 months later.                Okay?   9 months

12   later his new lawyer, who is supposed to proceed on

13   appeal, reads the transcript.            He thinks, hmm, I think

14   there was a problem with his lawyer at the trial, and I

15   would like to raise this claim and get a new trial.

16               And you are saying what he does is he goes

17   back to the trial court, and he says, Judge, I just read

18   this, it raises some factual matters; will you please

19   give me an evidentiary hearing with the old lawyer there

20   and me there, so we can develop this?

21               Now, that is what -- how Texas works?

22               MR. OLDHAM:       Your --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            Because I did not get that

24   impression from the State Bar brief, but you are saying

25   that is how it works?

 1               MR. OLDHAM:       Almost exactly, except that you

 2   go to -- you go to the court of appeals and --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:          You go to the court of

 4   appeals, and what do you say?            You say, court of

 5   appeals, will you please direct the trial court to have

 6   an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of trial counsel

 7   before you hear the appeal?

 8               MR. OLDHAM:       You ask for --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:          Is that yes or no?

10               MR. OLDHAM:       Yes, although it's called a new

11   trial motion.

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Even if you haven't made

13   the new trial motion within the 30 days, initially?

14               MR. OLDHAM:       That's right.            This is the --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.        So you are just

16   saying that they are all wrong about how Texas works, so

17   I guess you -- you could refer to a case where that

18   happened.

19               MR. OLDHAM:       Yes, Your Honor.


20               JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, in what case did that


21   happen?

22               MR. OLDHAM:       It's called Cooks vs. State.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:          Cooks vs. State.        And they

24   got the transcript, months later, and they looked back,

25   and they said, oh, dear, there was something wrong with

 1   the trial performance.         So we go to the Federal

 2   appeals -- the State appeals court, and we say, State

 3   appeals court, please direct an evidentiary hearing.

 4                  And they directed an evidentiary hearing,

 5   and they had an evidentiary hearing before the trial

 6   judge -- really, what would have happened on State

 7   habeas?

 8                  MR. OLDHAM:       Except that they didn't get

 9   actually get the evidentiary hearing in Cooks because

10   there was no facially plausible showing of the claim

11   that they would have raised.              But --

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.        Now, I am

13   puzzled about what I'm supposed to do because I would

14   have thought that the standard's fairly easy, that this

15   individual must always have one full and fair

16   opportunity to present his claim of inadequate

17   assistance at trial.

18                  There are certain things that could deprive

19   him of that.    One, his lawyer in the habeas State could

20   be incompetent -- all these lawyers could be

21   incompetent.    Or the State, at a certain stage, didn't

22   give him enough proceeding.             All right?

23                  Well, what do I do, where people are

24   disagreeing about how the State procedure works, as to

25   whether it was full and fair?               What do I do?     What is

 1   your suggestion?

 2                By the way, if he doesn't get the full and

 3   fair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge

 4   that he has a substantial claim, that that trial was

 5   not -- so what do you suggest?

 6                MR. OLDHAM:        Well, Your Honor, where he

 7   doesn't get a full and fair opportunity, whether it's

 8   because his new lawyer is ineffective, his old lawyer

 9   was ineffective, the transcript wasn't available, the

10   very case that we're talking about, the Cooks case,

11   recognizes that that is a violation of the United States

12   Constitution.

13                And you have -- that prisoner would have a

14   constitutional claim to assert for the failure of his

15   counsel, the failure of the circumstances --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           Right now -- but I'm saying

17   what I would like you to sympathize with my problem.           My

18   problem is I have seen -- I have a bunch of briefs.           And

19   they seem to me that what you have just described is a

20   full and fair procedure to develop all these evidentiary

21   matters before the appeal even takes place.

22                It exists in Texas, and, therefore, unless

23   he could say his lawyer there was incompetent, he's out

24   of luck.   Okay?   The other side seems to say, no, it

25   doesn't exist in Texas.         And, now, what am I supposed to

 1   do, since I am not an expert on Texas procedure?

 2                MR. OLDHAM:       Well, Your Honor, I think you

 3   could do one of two things.           You could always certify

 4   the question with the Court of Criminal Appeals if you

 5   thought that the question -- that the answer turns on

 6   what the Texas procedures are and that the parties

 7   disagree with them.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:          I tried that once in a case

 9   involving Pennsylvania, and the result was such that I

10   resolved never to do it again.

11                (Laughter.)

12                JUSTICE BREYER:          But -- but don't say never.

13                All right.      So one thing we got --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:          That was a case in which --

15   that was the case in which the Court unwisely reversed a

16   certain Third Circuit decision.

17                (Laughter.)

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do we have a clue,

19   Mr. Oldham, if the information is correct, that direct

20   appeal counsel in the county involved here gets a very

21   limited amount of money -- gets, they said it's $1,500

22   fixed fee.

23                But, if counsel who's appointed as

24   collateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest

25   that the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is

 1   expected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets

 2   all this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a

 3   sociologist, whoever is going to give us a profile on

 4   this person?

 5                  MR. OLDHAM:       No, Your Honor.          And that is

 6   because the funding thresholds that are cited for the

 7   first time in the reply brief are wrong in two respects.

 8   One is those -- those only came into effect after the

 9   filing of the State habeas and after the filing of the

10   direct appeal in this case.

11                  But the second -- and perhaps I think more

12   relevant sense in which they're wrong, is it does apply

13   to the amount of money that are given to the lawyers;

14   whereas the subsection (l) provision that we've cited in

15   our brief applies to the money for investigators and

16   experts.

17                  It's reimbursement for investigators and

18   experts.   It's not the amount of money they give to the

19   lawyer.

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is it true that it's the

21   county that reimburses the direct appeal counsel and the

22   State reimburses the habeas counsel?

23                  MR. OLDHAM:       Yes, Your Honor, after 1999.

24   But the State habeas application in this case was filed

25   a month before that statute went into effect.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but you -- you say

 2   it's before, but this -- this indicates how Texas views

 3   its system.   And, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, Texas

 4   views this system as being one in which the collateral

 5   appeal -- or the collateral proceeding counsel is in the

 6   best position to raise IAC claims.

 7                 That's -- that's just where it is.          And

 8   the -- the State Bar says -- agrees with the

 9   Respondent -- pardon me -- with the Petitioner on this

10   point.

11                 MR. OLDHAM:       Justice Kennedy, the court of

12   criminal appeals has said that the -- that claims of

13   ineffective assistance of trial counsel properly can be

14   brought on direct appeal.

15                 The Texas State legislature has said it by

16   authorizing a new direct appeal attorney and stating,

17   throughout the legislative history -- and I think in the

18   text and structure of the statute -- that they intend

19   for these claims to be able to be brought on direct

20   appeal -- not that they are channeled on direct appeal;

21   they're not channelled either way.

22                 JUSTICE KAGAN:          Well, able -- able to be

23   brought, Mr. Oldham, but, as Justice Ginsburg started

24   off by saying, many times, the court of criminal appeals

25   has said the preferred method is to bring it on
                               34

 1   collateral appeal.

 2               And, more to the point even, when attorneys

 3   try to bring these kinds of claims on a motion for a new

 4   trial, the typical response is to say, no, this is not

 5   the proper venue for that, go back and do it again on

 6   collateral review.

 7               So we have -- you say that there's a formal

 8   mechanism that could be used.               But it seems as though

 9   the courts and the lawyers, both, in Texas, are being

10   told continually, don't use that form of mechanism;

11   instead, do this on collateral review.

12               MR. OLDHAM:          Justice Kagan, I am aware of no

13   case where someone's brought a new trial motion that --

14   in the procedurally proper way -- and been told not to

15   do it that way.   I think what we --

16               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, isn't the usual

17   response just to dismiss it without prejudice and to

18   say, we don't have time to deal with this, go away, come

19   back again on collateral review?

20               MR. OLDHAM:          No, Your Honor.          That's --

21   that's the usual response when the record is

22   insufficient.   That is, when you haven't -- you haven't

23   given your trial lawyer --

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, because, mostly, the

25   record isn't sufficient for a Wiggins claim.                 So anytime
                               35

 1   somebody brings a Wiggins claim on this 30-day window,

 2   the Court says -- you know, there's only 30 days, the

 3   record is insufficient.          Go away, do it again.

 4                  MR. OLDHAM:       Your Honor, that's not what

 5   happened in the Armstrong case, where someone brought a

 6   Wiggins -- it's not what happened in the --

 7                  JUSTICE KAGAN:          That's your one case, it

 8   seems to me.    You only have one case.                   It's Armstrong.

 9   Armstrong seems to me sort of like proof as to why it is

10   that the Texas courts don't do that generally because

11   what they did in Armstrong was they ended up trying to

12   adjudicate that on the merits and realizing that there

13   was -- that the record wasn't sufficient.

14                  MR. OLDHAM:       Your Honor, it's -- it's not

15   the only case -- you know, we have -- a similar claim

16   was raised in the Motley case, which was cited in our

17   brief.   It was also raised in a Rosales case, also cited

18   in our brief.    Similar to Wiggins kinds of cases.

19                  And then -- in the Motley case, they were

20   able to have school teachers testify.                     There was a

21   neurological examination done.                I mean, it's certainly a

22   practical way to do it, and it -- it is as generous or

23   more generous than a lot of the States in the country,

24   including States that Petitioner concedes are --

 1   that, if you didn't have the mechanism for a new trial,

 2   then you would form under the Martinez rule?

 3               MR. OLDHAM:        With no new trial and no

 4   standing abatement?

 5               JUSTICE KAGAN:          In other words, no

 6   opportunity for factual development.

 7               MR. OLDHAM:        If there was no opportunity to

 8   develop -- to develop the facts and there was

 9   practically no opportunity to -- to raise the claim on

10   direct appeal, I think the question would still turn on

11   whether and to what extent there was a constitutional

12   right to have an effective appeal of that issue.

13               And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has

14   afforded constitutional protection to that new trial

15   window and to the meaningfulness of the record necessary

16   to raise these claims on direct appeal.                And I think

17   that is what is sufficient to move this case out of the

18   Martinez box and into the normal cause and prejudice

19   standards that this Court applies --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can I -- can I go back

21   to what you are proposing, okay, and what you are saying

22   this system stands for?        If an ineffective assistance of

23   counsel claim is brought on direct appeal, with or

24   without a record -- or it says, we don't have a record,

25   it throws it into collateral review, as I have seen it

 1   do dozens of times -- are you saying, in that situation,

 2   that Martinez applies?

 3               Counsel raised it, but was told, we're not

 4   going to decide it.      Puts them into collateral review.

 5   Does Martinez apply there?

 6               MR. OLDHAM:        If it happened in every single

 7   case and there was no opportunity --

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              No, forget it -- that --

 9   when it happens?

10               MR. OLDHAM:        Oh, no, Your Honor.             I don't

11   believe that Martinez would apply in that circumstance.

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Okay.       So they haven't

13   gotten a full and fair opportunity because they

14   presented their case, but Texas has said, we don't want

15   to do it here, do it there.           You are still saying

16   Martinez doesn't apply?

17               MR. OLDHAM:        Precisely, because there is no

18   default upon which to apply Martinez, so there's

19   nothing -- there is no work for Martinez to do in that

20   hypothetical, precisely because the claim can be met --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So because it can, but

22   Texas chose not to, now there's no protection, there is

23   no full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have

24   had that claim adjudicated?

25               That's really the end result of what you're
                               38

 1   saying.

 2                 MR. OLDHAM:       Well, I'm certainly not

 3   suggesting that the rule needs to turn on the

 4   meaningfulness of the opportunity to raise it on direct

 5   appeal.   I think that Martinez was very clear when it

 6   said -- whether it's a complete --

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You raised it, and the

 8   State said, well, go to collateral review.               You're

 9   saying, no -- no Martinez protection?

10                 MR. OLDHAM:       Well, I don't --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             The counsel was

12   ineffective in habeas in that -- in State habeas, you --

13   you can do nothing about it.

14                 MR. OLDHAM:       Well, you don't -- there's

15   nothing to do in the sense that, in that very

16   hypothetical, that very claim could be raised in habeas

17   the first time, but it also could be --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          There's clearly no Martinez

19   protection.   The question you are being asked, I think,

20   boils down to whether we should develop a new case,

21   Martinez plus, in which -- even though there is,

22   technically, the ability to raise it, which is all that

23   Martinez spoke about, the mere fact that the ability to

24   raise it is not effective enough should produce the same

25   result that Martinez produced.

 1               I don't think there is any -- I'm not even

 2   sure the other side claims that Martinez said what --

 3   what he is arguing here.

 4               MR. OLDHAM:        I think that's exactly right,

 5   Justice Scalia, and, in the hypothetical that Justice

 6   Sotomayor was asking, the court's ordinary cause and

 7   prejudice standards would accommodate for that.                There

 8   would be no inequity for the court -- for Martinez to do

 9   anything.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:          What happens -- imagine we

11   have a State supreme court, and it says, okay, you could

12   raise this claim on appeal, we don't advise it, we

13   think -- it's so much easier to do it in State habeas.

14   Please do it in State habeas.            It's not absolutely

15   binding, but do it.      Okay?      That's what they are saying.

16               Now, he raises nine of his ten ineffective

17   assistance of counsel claims in State habeas.                And the

18   State habeas court says, no, you are out on all nine,

19   but he never raised the tenth.

20               Now, we are in Federal court, and the

21   prisoner says -- you know, that tenth claim is fabulous.

22   And the judge says, it is substantial.                 And he says, you

23   know why it wasn't raised before?               Because my counsel

24   was incompetent on State habeas, and they didn't raise

25   it on appeal because that's just how people normally do

 1   things in Texas, they don't raise it on appeal.                   They

 2   wait until State habeas.

 3               Has that person had a full and fair

 4   opportunity to raise this tenth claim in the State

 5   court?

 6               MR. OLDHAM:       Well, if the -- if the Court by

 7   hypothesis is telling the Bar not to bring claims under

 8   any set of circumstances on direct appeal, I think

 9   that --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:          They are not saying never.

11   They are just saying it works so much better.                   What they

12   say is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time,

13   it's easier to develop it.          Please.            We won't say never.

14   We'll just say hardly ever.

15               Now, what's -- what is the -- what is your

16   view about whether that person has had a full and fair

17   opportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance

18   claim in the State courts.

19               MR. OLDHAM:       Justice Breyer, Martinez should

20   not apply, even to that hypothetical.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:          I'm not even thinking about

22   Martinez at the moment because I don't want to get into

23   whether it is an extension or just an elaboration or

24   just a situation covered, but they didn't think of it or

25   just a lot of other things.

 1                I just want to know, given Martinez, what do

 2   you think?

 3                MR. OLDHAM:        I'm not sure how to answer the

 4   full and fair opportunity question because that --

 5   that's certainly not the standard that we are advocating

 6   here.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           What is the standard you

 8   are advocating?

 9                MR. OLDHAM:        We believe that Martinez

10   applies where it said that it applies, and that is where

11   a State makes a deliberate choice to disallow all claims

12   on direct appeal.    We understand the necessity to having

13   a Martinez clause to apply to an eventual default.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           But if, in fact, they say,

15   yes, there is a route, never used, but once, filled with

16   minefields, very hard when compared with the other one,

17   there you say, it isn't Martinez, it is a totally -- it

18   is a new thing because Martinez, after all, had no

19   rationale.

20                MR. OLDHAM:        Your Honor, I think --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm being sarcastic there,

22   but I don't mean to be.         I mean, you see what I'm trying

23   to get to?

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It was the nose of the

25   camel, which is what Martinez was -- which is what the

 2                (Laughter.)

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, the dissent said that.

 4                (Laughter.)

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           This is -- this is very

 6   amusing in a capital case.

 7                Let me ask you this question:              Is there

 8   anything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps

 9   your position?   I'm -- I'm very interested in the State

10   Bar brief.   It's a little hard for me to parse.             It did

11   say there is a conflict of interest in -- between the

12   habeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct.

13                And it also -- it also indicates that the

14   habeas counsel has to file the application in the

15   convicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not

16   later than 45 days after the State's original brief,

17   which seems to help the Petitioner here because the

18   original brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is

19   deemed important for the habeas counsel.

20                MR. OLDHAM:       Justice Kennedy, I don't think

21   there is anything in the State Bar brief that helps

22   either side in this sense because the State Bar agrees

23   that there were no relevant guidelines of any kind at

24   the time of any of the proceedings in this case.

25                The only guideline that any Bar association
                                43

 1   had promulgated at the time of the direct appeal

 2   proceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was

 3   the 1989 American Bar Association guideline, 11.9.2,

 4   which specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this

 5   case to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless

 6   of any State procedures to the contrary.

 7               And, if he had raised a substantial Wiggins

 8   claim or if he had even tried his best to raise a

 9   Wiggins claim that could be -- could be amplified and

10   further developed on State habeas, we wouldn't be

11   standing here today because it would have been properly

12   exhausted and adjudicated on the merits in State court.

13               So I don't think that the Bar association

14   really has anything one way to say or the other, which

15   is maybe why it filed on behalf of neither party.

16               But to return to Justice Breyer's question,

17   I don't think that what -- what we're talking about is

18   to come up with anything new.               I think what we're

19   talking about in this outside-of-Martinez world is

20   actually very old.      We are just talking about the

21   Carrier rule, the normal rule that applies to cause and

22   prejudice for all defaults in States across the country.

23               And I think that the best way to understand

24   it is to imagine, in the very hypothetical that you

25   offered, where there is just one person who could get
                               44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   through, that person would have a constitutional claim

 2   in the State of -- I'm sorry, the other 900 or however

 3   many there were, those people would have constitutional

 4   claims in the State of Texas for the deprivation of a

 5   meaningful opportunity to press their claims on direct

 6   appeal.

 7               And as from the Federal -- and that would

 8   serve as cause, if the State courts denied it, that

 9   would serve as cause to overcome a default in Federal

10   court and to get an adjudication of that claim.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Mr. Oldham, I had thought

12   that Martinez was really an equitable rule.            It was an

13   equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to

14   raise a trial ineffectiveness claim.

15               And if it's true that, although Texas has a

16   technical possibility of doing that outside of

17   collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are

18   told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use

19   that route, that, if they do use that route, the

20   likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using

21   that route, the question is why that -- the formal

22   availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that

23   everybody is told not to use should matter with respect

24   to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?

25               MR. OLDHAM:       Justice Kagan, there is no work
                                    45

 1   for an equitable rule in Martinez to do if you can get

 2   there another way.      And it's not just that you can raise

 3   it on direct appeal, it's also that, if your direct

 4   appeal lawyer doesn't do it, you can, under certain

 5   circumstances, establish cause against your direct

 6   appeal -- direct appeal lawyer to overcome an ensuing

 7   default.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Has there ever been such

 9   a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has

10   been found ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins

11   claim?

12               MR. OLDHAM:          I'm not sure about specifically

13   Wiggins claims, but, yes, it is, in fact, established in

14   the leading treatise on Texas practice cited by both

15   sides that is ineffective assistance of appellate

16   counsel to fail to develop the record to allow any claim

17   to be adjudicated on direct appeal.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But I asked, if there was

19   any decisions that said, you should have raised it on

20   appeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the

21   Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because

22   counsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal

23   Appeals, she was ineffective?

24               MR. OLDHAM:          No, Justice -- Justice

25   Ginsburg, I am not aware of any particular case on
                               46

 1   Wiggins in particular.      But -- but the claims against

 2   appellate ineffectiveness for failure to raise a claim

 3   on direct appeal are -- are raised and adjudicated on

 4   the merits all the time in Texas courts.

 5               And there are specific ones that say that

 6   ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to fail to

 7   develop the record using the procedures which the State

 8   has allowed through the new trial window.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, the -- the Texas

10   Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a

11   general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review,

12   said -- and there's a reason.            The reason why is the

13   undeveloped record on direct appeal would be

14   insufficient to establish claims that must be supported

15   by extra-record evidence.

16               So that seems to be an expectation that

17   extra-record evidence will be developed on collateral

18   review, not direct appeal.

19               MR. OLDHAM:       No, Justice Ginsburg, I think

20   it's an expectation that the extra-record evidence will

21   be developed, either through the new trial proceeding,

22   through a factual proffer following it, or through a

23   stay and abatement procedure, to make sure that, when

24   the claim actually gets to the court -- the court of

25   appeals, that it has a record upon which to adjudicate
                               47
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the claim.

 2                That's all that -- and, to the extent that

 3   the appellate lawyer fails to do that, that can

 4   constitute cause under the ordinary rules of cause and

 5   prejudice without creating another Martinez exception,

 6   which we would submit is going to be highly, highly

 7   unworkable, given that the court is going to have to

 8   determine when is a little bit enough and when is not

 9   enough sufficient for Martinez.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:          The Respondent says that the

11   Kansas and the Michigan procedures are sufficient to

12   take the case -- to take the States outside of Martinez.

13   You say your stay and abate proceeding is the same,

14   essentially, as those procedures.

15                His response is that Texas has used this

16   remedy in only one situation, and that is when a

17   defendant is deprived of counsel during the new trial

18   window and suffers prejudice from the deprivation.

19                Now, is that correct.

20                MR. OLDHAM:       It's when the counsel -- when

21   the prisoner has suffered a deprivation of the

22   opportunity to develop the record in the new trial

23   window.   So, in the Cooks case, for example, that was --

24   there was only a lawyer for 10 of the 30 days, and

25   this -- the court said the new trial window is a
                               48

14                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF

15                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16                 MR. WOLF:      I want to be very clear about

17   this abatement issue.        The abatement issue, as

18   Justice Alito just said, is only available -- as

19   referred in our brief on page 6, is only available when

20   there is a denial of the constitutional right to an

21   attorney.

22                 And those situations is when there's a delay

23   in appointing the direct appeal attorney after the

24   trial.   So, during the 30-day window to file the motion

25   for new trial, that time limitation is -- is -- that
                               49

 1   clock is running, and, if there's no attorney appointed,

 2   the constitutional violation is considered a critical

 3   stage of the trial.

 4                And since there's -- if there's no attorney

 5   appointed during those 30 days, that is the only time,

 6   as Justice Kennedy is correct in saying, that that is

 7   the time that the abatement procedure is permitted.

 8   That is the only time.

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:          So you are suggesting that

10   if -- if an attorney is appointed within a few days or

11   within a week, as happened here, that, in that case,

12   there would not be that opportunity, it would be the

13   30 days, that's it, stop?

14                MR. WOLF:      And when that new -- that's

15   correct.   And, if a new attorney is appointed because

16   there was no attorney appointed, that new attorney, he,

17   himself, also has only 30 days.               The clock starts --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But what about -- what

19   about the 75-day --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Justice Kennedy.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I understood that, if the

22   30-day rule had been complied with, within the 75 days,

23   you can ask the appellate court to please remand because

24   there is some additional evidence to be --

25                MR. WOLF:      That's not true.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- to be determined.

 2                MR. WOLF:      That is not a correct statement

 3   of the law, and -- and I would refer the Court to our

 4   briefs, to the -- to the time that the -- the

 5   authorities that we cite and also the amicus brief from

 6   the State Bar of Texas.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what are --

 8   what are these investigators, experts, they're available

 9   to the new appellate counsel, what -- what are they

10   supposed to be doing?

11                MR. WOLF:      To the direct appeal attorney?

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes, the direct

13   appeal attorney.   You say -- basically, you're saying

14   there's no way they can do anything within these time

15   limits, and, yet, the State procedure provides for

16   investigators and experts.           It seems to me it would be

17   odd for them to provide for people and to pay for people

18   who can't do anything.

19                MR. WOLF:      Well, they don't -- to do a

20   Wiggins claim -- to do -- they're doing things that

21   would -- investigates things that came out of the

22   record because that's what is relegated to the direct

23   appeal.   The habeas attorney has more money available

24   and has more time available to do the things, and it

25   becomes a function of time as well.

 1                 But I want to direct the Court's attention

 2   also to the -- to the statement in Sprouse.               And -- and

 3   the statement --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The statement?

 5                 MR. WOLF:      In the case of Sprouse, in our --

 6   where am I?

 7                 It's page 20 -- 20 of our reply brief, that

 8   the position in Sprouse is that there would be no

 9   constitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have

10   time or the record to raise the ineffective assistance

11   claim, and that's because the habeas proceeding is

12   available to direct -- to develop the claim and is the

13   proper place to do so.        And that's the State's brief.

14   It's on page 20 of our reply brief.

15                 The other thing that I wanted to -- to bring

16   to the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a

17   couple of cases that are aberrant -- they're

18   aberrations, and they really don't -- shouldn't -- since

19   this Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in

20   Martinez and this Court has said this Court's rule

21   sensibly speak to the ordinary case, not -- not the

22   aberrational.   And that's exactly what we have here.

23                 The last thing that I wanted to say is -- is

24   that the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice

25   here that the State has systemically developed a system
                               52
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal

 2   that the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims,

 3   the Wiggins-type claims, and that the -- the claims that

 4   are raised on the record go to the direct appeal

 5   attorney.

 6                That is the system that the State has

 7   developed.   Those are the rules that govern this system

 8   that have been promulgated by the court of criminal

 9   appeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system --

10   the scheme that we are under.

11                And because --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the position

13   of the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if

14   there is an extension of Martinez to cover this case,

15   then at least give the Texas courts the first crack at

16   deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of

17   counsel, instead of having that done in the Federal

18   court?

19                MR. WOLF:      We're just looking for the --

20   because of the procedural default scenario that we find

21   ourselves in, we tried to do that.

22                And -- and because 11.071 also has -- when

23   they -- when that was promulgated in 1995 in order to

24   expedite these claims, it provided three things:            One, a

25   new attorney; two, the money to fund those claims; and,
                               53

 1   three, an abuse of the writ, which is Section 5a, which

 2   is what we met in -- in our case.

 3               The Texas scheme, because of that abuse of

 4   the writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and

 5   that puts us in this quandary, where a person like

 6   Mr. Trevino is unable to get relief because he has an

 7   ineffective trial lawyer.         And, now, he is -- that

 8   ineffective trial lawyer -- his ineffectiveness is being

 9   insulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas

10   lawyer.

11               And that's not what should happen.                It's --

12   it's just not equitable, it's not fair.                And

13   Mr. Trevino, someone in his situation, should have a

14   right to complain about the ineffectiveness of his trial

15   lawyer.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.


17               The case is submitted.
