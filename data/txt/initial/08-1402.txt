 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 08-1402, Berghuis v. Smith.

 5              Mr. Restuccia.

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. RESTUCCIA:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              This is really a case about the law of

11   habeas corpus for this murder conviction that was

12   obtained in the Michigan courts.

13              The issue was whether the Michigan Supreme

14   Court unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme

15   Court precedent in rejecting Mr. Smith's claim that

16   his jury was not drawn from a fair cross-section of

17   the community.

18              The Michigan Supreme Court did not act

19   unreasonably in concluding that there was no

20   unconstitutional underrepresentation and that there

21   was no systematic exclusion.              This Court's decision in

22   Duren did not require a different result on either

23   point, and this Court should reverse the Sixth

24   Circuit.

25              I think it's important to note that there

                                       3

 1   are two prongs at issue:      The fair and reasonable

 2   representation prong and the systematic exclusion

 3   prong.   And it's also significant to understand that

 4   the disparities at issue here are relatively small,

 5   that the time period at issue runs from -- from April

 6   of 1993 to October of 1993, where there was

 7   information -- for those 6 months for which the

 8   processes at play were measured.

 9             And the percentage of African-Americans that

10   appeared in the venires during that time period was --

11   they comprised 6 percent of the venires, where the

12   jury-eligible population was 7.28 percent.       So your --

13   so there was a 1.28 percent absolute disparity during

14   this 6-month time period.       That can also be measured

15   as an 18 percent comparative disparity.

16             Now, if you compare that to the disparities

17   that are issue -- at issue in Duren, they really are a

18   magnitude of difference, that the disparities in Duren

19   involve the exclusion of women in Missouri, where they

20   comprised -- women comprised 54 percent of the

21   population and only 14.5 percent of the venires over

22   an 8-month period of time.

23             JUSTICE BREYER:       The -- I don't know if this

24   is relevant or how to use it, but years ago, I took a

25   course in this kind of thing at the Kennedy School.         I

                                     4

 1   was teaching, and they said the only way you could

 2   figure out what -- what's what here is you use

 3   something called "binomial theorem," and you have to

 4   have, like, urns, and you imagine that there's an urn

 5   with 1,000 balls, and 60 of them are red, and 940 are

 6   black, and then you select them at random, and -- and

 7   12 at a time.   You know, fill 12 -- fill a hundred

 8   with 12 in each.

 9             And when we tried to do that, just for the

10   interest of it, I -- I found that you would expect,

11   with these numbers, something like a third to a half

12   of juries would have at least one black person on it.

13             Now, that may be wrong, because I am not a

14   mathematician, but -- but putting that together, it

15   looks as if there is a pretty big disparity.

16             MR. RESTUCCIA:      Well --

17             JUSTICE BREYER:       On the other hand, that

18   isn't what they testified to, so I guess you're going

19   to tell me just ignore it and forget it.

20             MR. RESTUCCIA:      Well, if you're looking at

21   the Michigan Supreme Court decision, I think it's

22   important to note that it's not just that it would

23   have to be incorrect; it would have to be objectively

24   unreasonable under the AEDPA standard, that what's at

25   issue here is did the Michigan Supreme Court

                                     5

 1   unreasonably apply --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:      Well, you know, maybe it's

 3   the only way to do it, that the statistician stays

 4   with these urns, which I guess they have computer

 5   programs for.

 6               MR. RESTUCCIA:     Well --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:      I -- I don't know, in other

 8   words, and maybe I should just -- I hate to write

 9   something, like, saying 2 and 2 is 6.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:      But we don't have any urns

11   here.

12               (Laughter.)

13               JUSTICE BREYER:      No.     You can skip it, if

14   you want.    If there's any comment, fine.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        I think your point was

16   that Duren was quite different in the numbers --

17               MR. RESTUCCIA:     Yes.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        -- starting out with

19   women 54 percent of the population, and then dwindled

20   to 14.5 percent of the -- of the jurors, available

21   jurors.

22               MR. RESTUCCIA:     Yes, Your Honor.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          I guess the point

24   is, just following up, it's not that you're going to

25   say 2 plus 2 is 6.    I suppose, under AEDPA, all you

                                      6

 1   have to do is say 2 plus 2 is somewhere between 3 and

 2   5, right?

 3               MR. RESTUCCIA:     Right.       That it's not

 4   unreasonable, and I think the best evidence of the

 5   fact that this decision was not unreasonable is I --

 6   in the blue brief, I put together a table of what the

 7   other circuits have done with comparable statistical

 8   disparities.

 9               And it runs -- from the First Circuit

10   through the Tenth Circuit, I have seven circuits'

11   worth of opinions, and of course, there really are

12   additional cases, if you examine this.                And if you

13   look at the kinds of disparities that have been

14   examined by other courts on --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:         May I interrupt with this

16   question that goes both to what Justice Ginsburg asked

17   and the other?    Should we treat all areas the same,

18   depending -- say it's -- the disparity between a

19   jurisdiction which has only 3 or 4 percent of a

20   minority should be treated similarly to a jurisdiction

21   where they have 30 or 40 percent?

22               MR. RESTUCCIA:     Well, the -- in my view,

23   this Court really didn't provide guidance in Duren

24   about how this should be measured.                In fact, Duren

25   doesn't specify what kind of measurement tools should

                                      7

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   be used for examining disparity.

 2             JUSTICE STEVENS:         But isn't it perfectly

 3   obvious that you're going to have dramatic differences

 4   where you only have a very small percentage, as in --

 5   in Grand Rapids, for example, and where you have a

 6   major percentage as you did in Duren.

 7             MR. RESTUCCIA:     Well, I think that's right.

 8   And that's one of the reasons that on direct review

 9   the courts are virtually unanimous in rejecting these

10   kinds of small disparities.         So if you look at the

11   table on pages 32 and 33, the circuits, on direct

12   review, that were most comparable were the Second

13   Circuit decision in which the percentage of the

14   distinct group in the community was 7.08 percent and

15   in the jury pool it was 5.0 percent --

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:         But -- but I suppose the

17   thrust of Justice Stevens's question was that if you

18   have a very small population that we are concerned

19   with, then the disparity can be very substantial,

20   especially if you use the comparative disparity.

21             MR. RESTUCCIA:     That's right.      At the --

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:         And I think -- at least, I

23   was interested in that aspect of his question.

24             MR. RESTUCCIA:     Well, as kind of the first

25   matter, it seems like this Court doesn't have to

                                    8

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   really reach that hard question, insofar as the

 2   Michigan Supreme Court's decision is entitled to

 3   deference under AEDPA, meaning --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes, but we have a half

 5   hour.   I'd kind of like to know how to --

 6              MR. RESTUCCIA:       Okay.       No, I understand.   I

 7   understand.    I just want to make that as kind of a

 8   first point.     Now, for the second point, it seems to

 9   me that the absolute disparity test is the better

10   measure for examining -- examining these questions.

11   And the reason for that is that it objectively

12   captures the number of missing jurors that are part of

13   the venire, whereas the --

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But you -- but your test

15   is 10 percent.     And if you have a minority, what is it

16   here?   7 point -- whatever it is.             7 --

17              MR. RESTUCCIA:       7.28.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It's under 10 percent.

19   That would mean that a district is free to just

20   disregard all the people who are under 10 percent of

21   the population.

22              MR. RESTUCCIA:       The 10 percent test is not

23   really necessarily tied to the absolute disparity.              In

24   other words, this Court could conclude that the

25   absolute disparity test is the better test without

                                       9

 1   using that 10 percent threshold.             The reason I suggest

 2   the 10 percent threshold is that's really what's

 3   happening on the ground in the Federal courts.             It's

 4   very hard to find a case in which there's a --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You would suggest that

 6   in a population that has 9 percent of any group,

 7   protected group, that if they didn't have one person

 8   serve on a jury per year of that group, that that

 9   would not -- under an absolute disparity test using

10   the 10 percent figure, that would not give rise to any

11   kind of suspicion?

12               MR. RESTUCCIA:     That's right.        Under -- if

13   this Court adopted it --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It would not meet the

15   Duren's second prong.

16               MR. RESTUCCIA:     That's right.        If the Court

17   --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Does that make any sense

19   to you?

20               MR. RESTUCCIA:     It reflects the actual

21   practice of the courts because of the -- if you look

22   at the --

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, I don't think that

24   -- that any court has suggested that the complete

25   absence of the protected group in that kind of number

                                     10

 1   wouldn't give rise to a fair representation claim.

 2   That's why this Court, the Michigan court, and many

 3   others have said that the absolute disparity test just

 4   can't be used in every circumstance.

 5               MR. RESTUCCIA:     Well, the -- it seems --

 6   looking at what the Federal courts have done, they've

 7   all -- they've generally used multiple tests.              Now,

 8   there are several circuits that have relied on this 10

 9   percent threshold, but it's not necessary for the

10   State to prevail in order for this Court to adopt the

11   10 percent threshold.

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I don't.   The question I

13   have you for you is -- that's what you have been

14   advocating, or at least your brief suggested we

15   should.    Wouldn't it be better for to us leave this in

16   the hands of the courts to sort of figure out what

17   test is better under what circumstances than us

18   announce a flat rule that would lead to a result like

19   the example that I just used?

20               MR. RESTUCCIA:     I -- I understand that

21   point.    The reason that I'm suggesting a threshold

22   also is it corresponds to a practical aspect of the

23   application of these rules.          The -- if you have a

24   sufficiently small absolute disparity, as a matter of

25   probability, it's not likely to affect the actual

                                     11

 1   composition of the petit jury.

 2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, I agree that if a

 3   protected group is 1 percent of the population, that

 4   it's not likely that their absence is going to give

 5   rise to any flags.

 6             MR. RESTUCCIA:       Right.

 7             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But I think there is a

 8   difference.   I don't   -- I just don't know

 9   statistically where.    And we have to leave this in the

10   judgment of the lower courts as to where between 1 and

11   9 or 1 and 10 a difference makes sense.             And that's

12   what the courts are saying, is:             We can't use one test

13   to determine that.

14             MR. RESTUCCIA:       Well -- and one of the

15   concerns I have is I -- for example, I know in Kent

16   County that if you look at the other distinct groups 

17   - you look at the 1990 census for Kent County, it was

18   comprised of 2 point -- 2.9 percent Latino-Americans,

19   1.1 percent Asian-Americans, and 0.6 percent Native

20   Americans.

21             Now, if you look at the one month that's

22   been placed at issue, in which Mr. Smith is indicating

23   that there was a 35 percent comparative disparity for

24   that one month, if that becomes the threshold, the

25   standard used, which the Sixth Circuit concluded was 

                                     12

 1   - established a violation of the second prong, then if

 2   you think about the practical application that -- for

 3   Michigan, for Kent County, if you take your 158 jurors

 4   in that jury pool, you'd expect for that one month for

 5   there to be four or five Latino-Americans, two Asian-

 6   Americans, and one Native American.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:       What's wrong --

 8               MR. RESTUCCIA:      What's missing -- I'm sorry.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes.      What's wrong with a

10   rule?

11                MR. RESTUCCIA:     What's wrong with what?

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:      With a rule?       With picking

13   a number, rather than leaving it up to the courts of

14   appeals or the district courts to use different

15   numbers, different times?         I don't have to review all

16   of these cases all the time.              Why don't we pick a

17   number?     You want 10, right?

18               MR. RESTUCCIA:      That what was I --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes --

20               MR. RESTUCCIA:      That has been the practice

21   of the courts below.     That's why I'm -- I'm advocating

22   it.     But it does correspond to this idea that below a

23   certain point, absolute disparity will have no

24   practical -- for example, in this case, the venire at

25   issue, according to the State trial court, included 60

                                      13

 1   prospective jurors, and there were three African-

 2   Americans, which would then constitute 5 percent.

 3             Now, in order for that percentage to

 4   correspond exactly to the jury-eligible population,

 5   there would had to have been one or two more African-

 6   American jurors as part of that venire.             Well, as a

 7   matter of probability, if you have 12 being selected

 8   from 60 -- this is kind of your point, Justice Breyer

 9   -- that it's not -- it's more likely than not that

10   would have no effect on the actual selection of the

11   petit jury --

12             JUSTICE BREYER:        I don't know.       The one

13   thing I learned from the urn business is it never

14   turns out the way you think.

15             (Laughter.)

16             JUSTICE BREYER:        For example, it had the

17   example of, like, the eight:             There are eight out of a

18   hundred, and you run this thing a thousand times, and

19   you'll discover that there is one black juror on about

20   half the juries, or a third, anyway.              That's much more

21   than I would have thought intuitively.             And I might

22   not have even read the example correctly.              So you see

23   why I -- I'm at sea, as soon as you tell me to be a

24   statistician.    I even got a book called Statistician

25   for Lawyers.    That didn't help me very much.

 2             JUSTICE SCALIA:      That's why Las Vegas makes

 3   a profit, right?

 4             (Laughter.)

 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Well, it does

 6   depend, doesn't it, on the size of the -- the urn?              In

 7   other words, if it's a smaller --

 8             (Laughter.)

 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          If it's 10,000 of

10   these balls and you are going to go through it 10,000

11   times, it's more likely that you are going to get a

12   sample that reflects the overall percentage, correct?

13             MR. RESTUCCIA:     I think that's right.        One

14   of the -- one of the reasons, also -- talking about

15   this 10 percent as a rule -- is that if you look

16   through these cases, you'll see a lot of -- a lot of

17   the courts, on direct review -- and I think -- I'm

18   going to come back to this point, that this, of

19   course, is an AEDPA case, so the question is whether

20   the Michigan Supreme Court acted unreasonably.            And so

21   I think there's a different standard, that it doesn't

22   have to have gotten it right; it had to have been

23   objectively unreasonable.

24             But setting that aside, you'll find many

25   cases in which there are disparities of 5 percent and

                                   15

 1   7 percent which have been rejected.                And the reason is

 2   you have neutral processes, processes that everyone

 3   would agree are reasonable on their face, which result

 4   in disparities for distinct groups.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Are you -- are you saying

 6   that systematic exclusion -- and we are assuming good

 7   faith, no intent to discriminate --

 8                MR. RESTUCCIA:     Right.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:       -- that systematic

10   exclusion is always proven or disproven by statistics?

11                MR. RESTUCCIA:     No.        I'm making just the --

12   the opposite point, that under the third --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Well --

14                MR. RESTUCCIA:     I'm sorry.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:       And I'll -- I'll allow you

16   to answer, of course, but --

17                MR. RESTUCCIA:     Please.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:       If not, how do we show

19   systematic exclusion?      Again, assuming good faith, no

20   intent to discriminate.

21                MR. RESTUCCIA:     The Duren case involved a

22   categorical distinction, meaning women were exempted

23   in a different way than men.              Women had an automatic

24   exemption.     This Court didn't delineate in Duren that

25   if you had just a disparate impact based on a neutral

                                      16

 1   process, that that would be sufficient to give rise to

 2   systematic exclusion.    And that's really been the way

 3   the Federal courts have applied it on direct review,

 4   that there --

 5             JUSTICE ALITO:     The statistical issue is

 6   very interesting, but I -- I wonder, if we were not

 7   looking at this through AEDPA, why we -- why a court

 8   should necessarily have to start with the question --

 9   with the elements of the prima facie -- with the

10   question of whether there is unconstitutional

11   underrepresentation, when in the end, as I understand

12   Duren, the defendant has to identify some aspect of

13   the jury selection process that has a disproportionate

14   impact on the group involved and is unreasonable?       And

15   unless that can be done at the outset, why struggle

16   with these statistics?

17             Now, here, to illustrate, the aspect of the

18   jury selection process that the Sixth Circuit thought

19   was unreasonable was the prior practice of choosing

20   the jurors first for the district courts, the

21   misdemeanor courts, rather than the circuit courts,

22   the -- the felony courts.      But the -- the trial judge,

23   it seemed to me, address this in -- in a very

24   thoughtful way, and he said there just isn't any proof

25   that this old system had that effect.

                                   17

                                 Official


 1             And it's hard for me to see how it could

 2   have that effect, unless the -- the number of jurors

 3   chosen for the district courts in Grand Rapids was

 4   disproportionate to the number chosen for the district

 5   courts in the other jurisdictions within the county.

 6   So that seems to me to be the end of the case.

 7             And why does it make sense to -- to struggle

 8   with this rather complicated statistical problem, if

 9   at the end of the day, it's going to come down to

10   something of that nature?

11             MR. RESTUCCIA:     I think that may be the

12   easiest way to resolve this case, because under the

13   third prong, the Michigan Supreme Court on the

14   question of jury assignment concluded that Mr. Smith

15   had failed to factually show that there was any

16   underrepresentation that arose from that process.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Didn't the Michigan

18   Supreme Court do essentially what Justice Alito

19   suggested, that they said:       We'll give you the benefit

20   of the doubt, go on to the third.

21             But on that third, it seems to me there's

22   nothing that shows us what was the representation in

23   the district before they made the change vis-à-vis the

24   circuit courts, was there?

25             MR. RESTUCCIA:     The -- the information that

                                   18

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Mr. Smith's expert provided is he -- he had -- there

 2   are two jury terms that were described, one for 6

 3   months, in which this juror assignment to the local

 4   courts first occurred, and then 1 year for the

 5   following year, in which the jury assignment did not

 6   send them to the local courts first.             So you have two

 7   different pools that are being compared.

 8              The -- if you look at page 13 of the blue

 9   brief, it outlines what the disparity was according to

10   Mr. Smith's expert for the time which the assignment

11   to local courts occurred.       And in that diagram, it

12   shows, at the end, that there was an 18 percent

13   comparative disparity.     And that's the final column in

14   the totals.

15              Now, that's what occurred at the time of

16   which the jury assignment to the local courts occurred

17   first.   The following year, the comparative disparity

18   was 15 percent, where the -- where the jurors were not

19   sent to local courts first.         In other words, there was

20   a difference of a 3 percent comparative disparity.

21              Now, no one suggests that a 3 percent

22   comparative disparity could -- could justify a claim

23   of a violation of Duren.      It's -- it's not

24   statistically significant, because when you talk about

25   3 percent comparative disparity or 4 percent

                                    19

 1   comparative disparity, you are talking about two or

 2   three jurors over the entire time period --

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        That -- that's in the --

 4   in the circuit court.      Do we know what the figures

 5   were just for the district court?

 6                MR. RESTUCCIA:     No.       There -- there was no

 7   information -- the reason -- the Michigan Supreme

 8   Court ultimately rejected the claim on the jury

 9   assignment process because there was no evidence other

10   than anecdotal testimony about how sending jurors to

11   local courts would result in a deficiency of African-

12   Americans in the circuit court or the felony court --

13   courts.    So that was the basis.

14                They -- so in a way, this touches on Wood v.

15   Allen.    It was a factual determination, whether it's

16   under 2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1).             The Michigan Supreme

17   Court's conclusion that Mr. Smith had failed to show

18   factually that there was any underrepresentation that

19   arose from the jury assignment process is entitled

20   deference.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:       But isn't it possible --

22   it's awfully hard to get these percentages when you

23   get small numbers, as you do.             But doesn't it seem

24   intuitively obvious that if you give the district

25   courts first crack of -- of the size of the pool that

                                      20

 1   has more of the African-American potential jurors in

 2   it than the other, that it's -- it's bound to have an

 3   impact?

 4             MR. RESTUCCIA:       No.       There's -- there's no

 5   logical necessity that sending courts -- because you

 6   understand that you have the entire county, and the

 7   county is then broken up into districts?

 8             JUSTICE STEVENS:         Right.

 9             MR. RESTUCCIA:       And the districts are the

10   local courts, and they are misdemeanor courts.

11             JUSTICE STEVENS:         But -- but there's a much

12   higher percentage of African-Americans in Grand Rapids

13   than there is in the county as a whole.

14             MR. RESTUCCIA:       That's right.       But all those

15   other outlying areas also have to send their jurors to

16   the district court first, too.            It's not like it's

17   just one segment gets sent to the district court.              All

18   of the jurors get sent to the district courts first.

19   The only -- the -- the proof required to show that

20   somehow the district court for Grand Rapids went

21   through more jurors than did the other local courts

22   proportionately --

23             JUSTICE STEVENS:         But -- but the jurors that

24   served on the district court, were they -- were they

25   taken from the entire county, too, or just from Grand

 3   -- all of the district courts -- Grand Rapids,

 4   Rockford, all of these small municipalities -- drew

 5   from the circuit court pool.

 6             JUSTICE STEVENS:        So the district court

 7   jurors could -- could include as many jurors who are

 8   not from Grand Rapids as they could from Grand Rapids?

10             JUSTICE STEVENS:        I see.

13   I'm confused.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           I thought it was the

16   other way around.   I thought Grand Rapids gave however

17   many -- you know, 30 percent to the pool and then took

18   Grand Rapids people back?

19             MR. RESTUCCIA:      It does take Grand Rapids

20   people, that's right.    That's how it happens.          You're

21   drawing from the entire county.

22             I'm sorry if I -- if I've -- if I've stated

23   it in a way that's misleading.          I apologize.

 1                MR. RESTUCCIA:     All of the jurors from the

 2   entire county are drawn into one pool.

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:       Right.

 4                MR. RESTUCCIA:     And then the -- the local

 5   courts can identify those people that came from within

 6   their jurisdiction and draw them out.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:       So the --

 8                MR. RESTUCCIA:     Everyone does it.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:       So the jurors who served

10   on the district court were primarily from Grand

11   Rapids, rather than Kent County as a whole?

12                MR. RESTUCCIA:     The -- there's no

13   information to -- in the record             --

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:       Well, let me just ask you

15   --

16                MR. RESTUCCIA:     -- that indicates that.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:       -- a factual question.

18   Could they put on the district court jurors who did

19   not come from Grand Rapids?

20                MR. RESTUCCIA:     No.       The -- the district

21   court for Grand Rapids had to be Grand Rapids

22   residents.     You're exactly right.

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:       So, then, inevitably, if

24   you give the district court jurors first, a pool of

25   African-American jurors are going to be larger serving

 1   in the district court than in the -- in the felony

 2   court.

 3             MR. RESTUCCIA:        It all depends on the local

 4   courts and their usage of jurors.              If -- if Grand

 5   Rapids actually required fewer jurors, it would -- it

 6   would result in a larger number of African-Americans

 7   being present on the circuit court.

 8             The whole concept underlying the claim that

 9   -- that this had a disproportionate effect is the idea

10   that Grand Rapids must have needed proportionately

11   more jurors than the other local courts might.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:         Okay.       So, is there anybody

13   who said whether -- if all -- they all take their

14   jurors first, the districts, and Grand Rapids uses a

15   higher percentage of jurors.              So now there -- and they

16   have more of the black jurors, so that there are fewer

17   left over --

18             MR. RESTUCCIA:        That would be the argument.

19             JUSTICE BREYER:         That could be.       Now, is

20   there any -- in this record, does anybody say whether

21   that's okay or not?     I mean, to -- to have people

22   serve jury duty near where they live or nearer where

23   they live, on its face, is not so bad.              Did -- did

24   anybody say whether this is good or bad?

 2   anecdotal information was that it -- it took African-

 3   American jurors out of the larger pool.            The anecdotal

 4   information from the court administrator was:            We were

 5   afraid this process was draining -- "siphoning" was

 6   the language -- siphoning jurors from the circuit

 7   court.

 8             JUSTICE BREYER:       Are you --

 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Do you have to be a -- a

10   resident of the district in order to serve as a juror

11   in the district court?

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:       So then if this system were

17   jurors from other counties as opposed to a larger

18   percentage of black jurors from Grand Rapids, then

21   Grand Rapids.   That's right.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, you -- you'd have a

23   jury pool in Grand Rapids that wouldn't reflect the

24   larger number of blacks in Grand Rapids.

 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:      So you're damned if you do

 2   and damned if you don't, right?

 3             MR. RESTUCCIA:     I think that's right.

 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          So -- so do we have

 5   any evidence in the record that -- I gather this whole

 6   claim depends upon Grand Rapids having more need for

 7   jurors per capita than anywhere else?

 8             MR. RESTUCCIA:     That's exactly right.

 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          So do we have any

10   evidence in the record that that's the case?

11             MR. RESTUCCIA:     Nothing other than the

12   anecdotal testimony.   Like, for example, the court

13   administrator said it is believed that this process

14   results in a reduction in the number of jurors -- of

15   African-American jurors --

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          I would suppose

17   that's something we can find out pretty easily, right?

18   I mean, you look and see how many jurors are pulled

19   for -- how many jurors Grand Rapids needs in a

20   particular period --

21             MR. RESTUCCIA:     That's right.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          -- compare it to how

23   many jurors Rockland needs.

 1   Michigan Supreme Court rejected the claim factually,

 2   that it had not been demonstrated.

 3               And, in fact, if you look at the information

 4   that Mr. Smith's expert put forward, it really

 5   confirms that the -- even the best showing for Mr.

 6   Smith is a very small correlation.                 I mean, you're

 7   talking about a 3 or 4 percent comparative disparity

 8   difference.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:        Let me get that.         If -- if

10   a procedure routinely results in statistical

11   underrepresentation that is significant, is that not a

12   clear showing of systematic exclusion?

13               MR. RESTUCCIA:      It would have to be

14   significant, and I don't think there's --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:        Well, yes -- no, that's --

16   it's a hypothetical.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:        Routinely results in

19   significant underrepresentation, then that is

20   automatically systematic exclusion?

22   of Duren.     I don't think that would be -- I don't

23   think that's the -- the proper rule.                 And I -- the

 2   the disparity was so marked, just on the -- just on

 3   the numbers?

 5   numbers were sufficient to justify --

 7   trying to think about the third prong of -- of --

 8              MR. RESTUCCIA:      Right.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:        -- of Duren.    Isn't -- if

10   it's routine and it's predictable and it's constant,

11   isn't that always due to systematic exclusion?

12              MR. RESTUCCIA:      And that's the argument

13   being raised by Mr. Smith.         No, I think the answer is

14   no.   And the reason I say that is this:          You have --

15   the Federal courts, on direct review, have looked at

16   voter registration and challenges to voter

17   registration.    Voter registration may have a disparate

18   -- or affect distinct groups differently.

19              In the same way that the Second and Tenth

20   Circuit have looked at cases where they failed to

21   follow up on non-returns, that -- if you don't follow

22   up on non-returns, it may affect distinct groups

23   differently.    The analysis of the Federal courts on

24   that issue has been that the decisions to exempt

25   yourself from jury service or the failure to respond

                                     28

 1   to an invitation for jury service is outside the

 2   system.   Even if it occurs regularly and is

 3   persistent, it's still not inherent in the process.

 4              That's what the Michigan Supreme Court said

 5   here about the excuses for hardship and transportation

 6   -- for the excuses.     But it's also true that the

 7   process by which you select jurors in district courts

 8   is not something that is a systematic exclusion of

 9   anyone.   It's -- on its face, it is neutral, and if

10   you -- if this Court concludes that neutral practices

11   like sending out -- using a certain body, whether

12   voter registration or if it's driver's licenses and

13   Michigan identification cards, or not following up on

14   non-returns, or allowing excuses for hardship, or --

15   or assigning jurors to a district court first, if that

16   is -- can result in systematic exclusion, what's going

17   to happen is that all these neutral processes that

18   Michigan has may result in disparities.

19              And so, as it stands now, Kent County

20   doesn't identify the race and ethnicity of all of its

21   jurors.   Well, it's going to have to if it's going to

22   have to have this perfect correspondence of the jury

23   eligible population.     It will no longer have this kind

24   of blind neutrality --

 1   systematic doesn't mean that the defendant wins.              It

 2   just means that the State has to -- has to justify the

 3   -- the mechanism that's causing -- that's causing this

 4   -- this situation.

 5              MR. RESTUCCIA:      That's true.        There is --

 6   there is then the rebuttal.          But then what happens is

 7   you are subject to these challenges.              The question is:

 8   Does the court -- does the State ever wish -- ever

 9   wish to be in a position of having to be subject to

10   the challenge?

11              But -- but I think I want to come back to --

12   one of the prevailing points of all of this is that

13   this is also the Michigan Supreme Court.             There's no

14   question that it had reached the merits and was

15   entitled to AEDPA deference.             And the -- the question

16   was:   Was there adequate guidance to the State of

17   Michigan to know that this was both systematic -- that

18   this was systematic exclusion and inherent in the

19   process?   And Duren was not clear on that point.

20              The -- the analysis of the Michigan courts

21   really corresponds quite closely to what the Federal

22   courts have done, so it cannot be objectively

23   unreasonable.    And if there --

20               MR. LAWRENCE:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22               If the annual jury call of minorities at the

23   courthouse in Grand Rapids is down by 7.28 percent of

24   the total number of jurors called, that means if it

25   happens in Detroit, that means almost nothing, but if

 1   it happens in Grand Rapids, that's every minority.

 2   The Petitioner's goal is to have this Court enshrine

 3   into law a rule that the two situations are exactly

 4   the same.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          If you had a

 6   community with one African-American, your argument

 7   would be the same, if that's the disparity?            That

 8   means every -- every minority is left off the jury.

 9               MR. LAWRENCE:    Well, I think that certainly

10   if you adopt the Petitioner's test for 60 percent of

11   the country, Duren would not apply regarding African-

12   Americans; 90 percent of the country, wouldn't apply

13   to Hispanics; and Duren protections would never apply

14   to Native Americans anywhere.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          I guess I'm -- I

16   guess I'm echoing Justice Stevens's question of

17   whether or not this type of statistical analysis

18   really works when you're dealing with relatively small

19   numbers.

20               MR. LAWRENCE:    Well, I would make this

21   observation:    That in Duren v. Missouri, on page 366,

22   the Court stated, "His undisputed demonstration that a

23   large discrepancy occurred, not just occasionally, but

24   in every weekly venire for a period of nearly a year,

25   manifestly indicates that the cause of the

                                     32

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   representation was systematic -- that is, inherent in

 2   the particular jury selection process utilized."

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Yes, but there you were

 4   dealing with an express exemption.                There was an

 5   exemption for a woman, and also in the record was that

 6   the jury clerk was sending out notices saying:                   Women,

 7   if you do not wish to serve, return the summons to the

 8   judge named on the reverse side as quickly as

 9   possible.    And then, further -- systematic -- if the

10   card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was

11   not returned, it was automatically assumed that she

12   did not wish to serve.      There was no follow-up.

13               So there was all kinds of evidence of

14   systematic problems in Duren that are not present

15   here.

16               MR. LAWRENCE:    Well, first of all, that's

17   completely correct; however, the rule in Duren, the

18   U.S. Supreme Court stated that the numbers alone prove

19   systematic.    Then the Court --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Where did the Court say

21   that?

22               MR. LAWRENCE:    On page 366.            And then in --

23   the Court went on to say that the State is arguing

24   that there's various neutral, benign reasons for the

25   underrepresentation --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:      Excuse me.          You -- if that

 2   statement is true, then -- then there is -- there's no

 3   third part to the three-part test.                 I thought Duren

 4   established a three-part test.

 5                MR. LAWRENCE:     It did.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:      And the third one was that

 7   you had to establish -- after having already

 8   established the disparity, you had to establish that

 9   there was a selection process which caused the

10   disparity.     And you are telling us that you don't have

11   to proceed to step 3.        Once you show the disparity, it

12   is assumed that it is the product of the system.

13                MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, Justice Scalia, my

14   reading of Duren does indeed include that third test,

15   but the problem is, is that Duren puts the burden of

16   proof on that test on the State.             They said at pages

17   368 to 369 that the State is claiming there were all

18   sorts of neutral, legitimate reasons for the

19   underrepresentation --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Oh, that was after --

21   that was after showing the systematic factors.                 It was

22   the plaintiff's burden -- or the defendant in the

23   case, Duren -- burden to show there was a systematic

24   factor.   That was the automatic exception for a woman

25   and how it worked in practice.            After all of that,

                                      34

 1   then Justice White tells us, the State could still

 2   come back and say yes, that's true, but there were

 3   other reasons why women didn't show up.            Maybe they

 4   were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were

 5   involved with child care.

 6                That's what -- that's what Duren said, that

 7   the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's

 8   burden, and then the State could justify why the

 9   numbers came out that way.

10                MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, we did show a number of

11   systematic factors, but if you look at Duren itself,

12   on page 366 it says, the numbers alone proved it.           On

13   -- further on 366, they stated that Duren --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:      How do you reconcile that

15   with the third test?     Please tell me how you reconcile

16   that statement with the fact that it did set forth a

17   three -- a three-prong test.

18                MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, I believe that we met

19   the three-prong test, but I feel that it is an error

20   in reading Duren to say anything other than that:           The

21   State must show how this came about, not the

22   defendant.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Where does it say that?

24                MR. LAWRENCE:     -- did show it, and --

 1                MR. LAWRENCE:    It says that at pages 368 to

 2   369.   And the --

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:     It says that the State has

 4   to show that it has a reason, a good reason, for --

 5   the aspect of the selection process that has been

 6   identified as causing the disparity.

 7                But does it say that it's the State's

 8   obligation to go through every factor that may cause

 9   the disparity and justify every one?               Or is it the

10   defendant's obligation to point to some aspect of the

11   selection -- of the -- of the system that causes the

12   disparity?     Then once the defendant identifies that,

13   then the State can show if it -- can try to show that

14   there's a good reason for it.

15                MR. LAWRENCE:    Well, I would read one

16   sentence from Duren, if I could:             "Assuming, arguendo,

17   that the exemptions mentioned by the court below would

18   justify failure to achieve a fair community cross

19   section on jury venires, the State must demonstrate

20   that these exemptions caused the underrepresentation

21   complained of."

22                And I think that all of the courts, all

23   along the way, including Michigan's supreme court,

24   have overlooked that important principle.

 5   fewer minorities going up to the county court, right?

 6               MR. LAWRENCE:    That's right.        Because those

 8   of them did not serve in district court.            The majority

 9   did not, but they were still removed from --

 2   unconstitutional, but rather, the collective nature of

 3   it, that 15 out of 17 months persistently and

 4   repeatedly came up with substantial

 5   underrepresentation.     You are talking about 34.8

 6   percent here.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:     But that's the only factor

 8   that the Sixth Circuit identified as illegitimate, was

 9   this -- was this siphoning system.

10                MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, I feel that --

11                JUSTICE ALITO:     It rejected everything else,

12   didn't it?

13                MR. LAWRENCE:     I feel that there are a

14   number of factors.     I suppose that we could do it on

15   the basis of height and then be surprised when there's

16   fewer women on the jury.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:      Now, why is it -- I'm just

18   not clear in my mind.        Why is this siphoning bad?       My

19   impression, which may be wrong, is you -- you have a

20   thousand people in the room, let's say, and if you let

21   the district courts choose first, people will serve

22   nearer where they live.

23                Now -- and so most of them would rather

24   serve nearer where they live.             And the result of that

25   could be, for the reasons that were stated, that then

 1   there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors

 2   that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about

 3   the merits of that.

 4               I mean, I see a negative, and I see a

 5   positive.    So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously

 6   bad, nor is it obviously good.            So what should I do?

 7               MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, the record showed --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:       Right.

 9               MR. LAWRENCE:     -- that the people who were

10   actually showing up for the jury panels at circuit

11   court were very heavily overrepresented in the rural

12   areas of Kent County and heavily underrepresented --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, but -- but that's

14   just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing.

15               MR. LAWRENCE:     Right.        Well, I guess --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:       The problem we're seeing is

17   that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization

18   rate and they have a higher minority population, then

19   you will end up with the leftover juries having a

20   lower minority population.

21               Now, the explanation for that is that you

22   choose the district judges -- you choose the district

23   jurors first.    My question to you is:            I -- if you're

24   just a -- I'm not instructed in this area.              If you

25   were just to tell me, what do I think of that, I would

 1   say I'm not sure.

 2             I think you have fewer minorities, that's

 3   true, but people get to serve closer to home.             Now --

 4   now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this?

 5             MR. LAWRENCE:       Yes.        Well, first of all,

 6   Grand Rapids has several district courts, and the

 7   largest one is the district court for the city of

 8   Grand Rapids.   And as one would predict, the judicial

 9   business of a large city is certainly going to be more

10   extensive than the judicial business in rural areas.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Of course.   Of

12   course, but we have to look at this on a proportional

13   basis, right?   Grand Rapids is also sending a higher

14   number of jurors to the pool than -- than the small

15   rural county.

16             MR. LAWRENCE:       Well --

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Your -- your theory

18   depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a

19   proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent

20   and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon

21   Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and

22   drawing 40 percent.

23             MR. LAWRENCE:       Well, I guess I would simply

24   say that the court administrator testified and the

25   district judge found that they had substantial

 1   underrepresentation that was very noticeable, very

 2   visible, a severe problem, and after my client's

 3   trial, they -- they concluded that the best way of

 4   dealing with this was to end the siphoning process,

 5   which they did.

 6              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             And so, what -- what did

 7   it result in?     It resulted over a 6-month period and a

 8   difference between 18 percent underrepresentation and

 9   15 percent.     And your adversary says that's not

10   statistically meaningful difference, that 3 percent,

11   because it only takes a difference of a couple of

12   people to change it from 18 to 15.

13              MR. LAWRENCE:      Well, I --

14              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             What's -- what's

15   unreasonable about that argument?

16              MR. LAWRENCE:      Well, I have two answers to

17   that.   The first one being that what -- one thing that

18   was eliminated was the spikes, like we had in my

19   client's month, 34.8, even though the average

20   underrepresentation was only 18.1.

21              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You can't -- you are

22   comparing apples and oranges, because your pre-spike

23   was over a year and your post-spike was over 6 months.

24   We don't know what would have happened -- or didn't

25   have statistics of a year or longer.

 1             MR. LAWRENCE:     Okay.        Well, in the case of

 2   Duren, you're talking about -- they had a 10-month

 3   period that was involved, but as for the numbers being

 4   small, I can only refer you to cases that I very much

 5   disagree with -- United States v. Sanchez-Lopez, cited

 6   in my brief, where Hispanics comprised 5.59 percent of

 7   the southern district of Idaho -- and the court

 8   basically said:   Since that's less than 10 percent,

 9   who cares if there are Hispanics on the juries?            The

10   same in United States --

11             JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, I wouldn't say that,

12   but I still haven't -- I will try again.            Forget the

13   cases.

14             As I'm hearing this, all I'm hearing is:

15   Well, if you let the -- if you say that the wider area

16   should choose first, you will get a higher number of

17   minorities, but very tiny number; I mean a very small

18   addition, one or two people.            And if you do it the way

19   they're doing it, you'll lose those one or two people,

20   but you will let people serve closer to home.

21             So I just think -- as a person, not as a

22   judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a

23   judge -- but I mean, I'd say, well, it doesn't sound

24   like much of a big deal.      And -- and I do see an

25   advantage in this, of the way they are doing it, so,

                                    42

 1   now, you tell me what's -- what's wrong with that?

 2              MR. LAWRENCE:      Okay.       Well, first of all,

 3   Kent County is not really that big.                It's -- anybody

 4   can drive from the farthest end of the county to

 5   downtown Grand Rapids in approximately 20 to 30

 6   minutes.   It wouldn't be that difficult to get there.

 7   I bet members of this Court have a longer commute.

 8              But, more importantly, the -- the fact that

 9   you're only talking about 25 people out of 2,250

10   people simply means that the problem will be easy for

11   court administrators to solve, if they have an

12   incentive to do it.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            How is that?     Don't

14   those people then have to become professional jurors?

15   They have to serve on every jury, or you're going to

16   have the disproportion that the statistics show.

17              MR. LAWRENCE:      Well, the statistics showed,

18   for example, that African-Americans had a much higher

19   rate of not having an automobile.              And so if you say,

20   well, if you have trouble getting a ride, you could

21   tell somebody, come on down anyway; or you can say,

22   that's all right, take the day off.

23              And if African Americans have a very

24   substantial higher rate of single-parent households,

25   well, then, of course, it's going to be harder to get

 1   a babysitter.     Now, you can tell those people, well,

 2   that's okay, stay home; or you can say, try to get

 3   down here anyway.

 4               And the court -- and if somebody simply

 5   didn't show up, statistics have shown, in the brief --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         May I stop you there for

 7   a moment?    Because one of the things that was in the

 8   Duren opinion was that a child care excuse would be

 9   okay.    I think Justice White said at the end, now, I'm

10   not touching the typical hardship excuses, and one of

11   them was child care, and that is -- certainly, in the

12   early '70s, was going to disproportionately affect

13   women.   You have far fewer women if you give a child

14   care exemption.

15               MR. LAWRENCE:     No doubt that that's true,

16   and I am not saying that it is wrong to give real

17   hardship exemptions.     Here --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But this -- he wasn't

19   talking about individual cases.

20               MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, in this case, one of

21   the things that happened is that, if somebody didn't 

22   - simply didn't show up, that's it.                Now, judges --

23   the court administrator said, yes, we tried.                The

24   judges would issue orders to show cause, but the

25   police department made a decision that they were not

                                      44

 1   going to have anything to do with the serving or

 2   participation in these orders to show cause, orders to

 3   show up.

 4               And isn't that police department decision

 5   part of the system?     It is systematic.              When the

 6   police --

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:        Let me just --

 8               MR. LAWRENCE:     -- tell the courts what to

 9   do, shouldn't the courts tell the police what to do?

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:        Let me make sure I

11   understand your position.         Assume that there is an --

12   an identifiable disparity of 2 percent or 3 percent,

13   or whatever it might be to get to the threshold of

14   being significant, that's entirely caused by the fact

15   that the members of the minority have personal excuses

16   that justify non-service.         What do you do with that

17   case?   Do you find that it was -- it's

18   unconstitutional, or don't you?

19               MR. LAWRENCE:     If you find that it is

20   persistent, month in and month out --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:        It is.         It's assuming --

22               MR. LAWRENCE:     -- then you have a problem

23   because society benefits when jurors are drawn from

24   the broadest spectrum of the system.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:        I didn't --

 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Well, that's policy.

 2   Can't you say that that is systematic exclusion

 3   because it's part of the system?

 4             MR. LAWRENCE:    Well --

 5             JUSTICE STEVENS:       But is it

 6   unconstitutional, is what I'm trying to find out.

 7   Society benefits because -- if you make them serve;

 8   the society benefits if you grant the excuses, too.

 9             MR. LAWRENCE:    Well, overall, there's

10   nothing wrong with granting excuses for genuine

11   hardship; however, when you have this factor and

12   factor 2 and factor 3 and factor 4, and they

13   persistently come up with all-white juries, that's

14   what Richard Hillary testified to, 98 percent of the

15   time, nothing, but all-white juries.

16             And if somebody could --

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Is there -- is there a

18   Federal district that corresponds to this Kent County?

19   Is there a Federal district court that would be

20   calling jurors in -- in the same geographical area?

21             MR. LAWRENCE:    Well, there is the United

22   States District Court for the Western District of

23   Michigan that covers a very large amount of territory,

24   and, frankly, I have not studied their statistics, but

25   I know, from personal knowledge, that the African

 3   the city of Grand Rapids, where --

 4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        But you don't have -- you

 5   don't have comparable -- comparable records for what

 6   was going on in the -- in the district court?

 7             MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, if you mean the United

 8   States District Court --

 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Yes.

10             MR. LAWRENCE:     No, I -- I have not studied

11   that situation, and --

12             JUSTICE ALITO:     Are there -- are there

13   courts that you know of that do what you are

14   suggesting needs to be done?           When a juror does not

15   show up, the judge issues a bench warrant, and -- and

16   the police are sent out to arrest the person and drag

17   the person into court, or somebody says, I am a single

18   parent, and I have children, and I'm too poor to have

19   a nanny or an au pair, and, therefore, please excuse

20   me; and they say, no, you have to find some way of

21   getting here.

22             Are there courts that do that?

23             MR. LAWRENCE:     I don't know of a court that

24   arrests people, and I -- in this case, it wasn't a

25   question of arresting.     The local judges made a

 1   decision:    We are going to issue orders to show cause;

 2   people will be required to come in.               The police

 3   decided, no, we're not going to have anything to do

 4   with that.

 5               And I feel that that's part of the system

 6   because the police are part of the system.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Mr. Sterling, I don't --

 8   you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you

 9   have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the

10   pool a disproportionate number of people.

11               Why -- why do you have to prove that?              If

12   Grand Rapids contributes to the pool an inordinate,

13   disproportionate number of the minority -- blacks in

14   this case -- even if Grand Rapids simply took back a

15   proportionate number from the pool, it would still

16   have a disproportionate effect on reducing the number

17   of blacks in the overall pool, wouldn't it?

18               MR. LAWRENCE:     In order to solve this

19   problem, all that Kent County would have to do is to,

20   if you take people to district court, put back the

21   ones that aren't being used.             That would certainly

22   help, but, instead, they take an excess number, like

23   any court does, but the excess people are totally

24   removed from the system.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Your answer to

 1   Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right?             Because

 2   the idea is, if Grand Rapids sends up a pool that's 30

 3   percent minority and if it takes back the same number

 4   as everybody else, it's going to get -- the county is

 5   going to get the same proportion.

 6             It's only when they take back more.             They

 7   have the more heavily African-American pool, and they

 8   are going to draw from it more than everybody else is

 9   drawing from theirs, so there will be fewer African-

10   Americans to go to the county.

11             MR. LAWRENCE:      That is what's happening, but

12   I don't believe --

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            But you have no

14   evidence that Grand Rapids takes back more than its

15   share, proportionally, than anybody else.

16             MR. LAWRENCE:      We know that the -- as soon

17   as they stopped doing it, this created a substantial

18   increase in the number of African-Americans on the

19   juries, and I think that that's --

 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Where is that in the

 2   record?

 3             MR. LAWRENCE:     Okay.       The -- well, it is in

 4   the testimony of -- well, if you look, it's -- I'm

 5   sorry that I don't have the page number, but right at

 6   the time, it was said, we have two or three African-

 7   Americans within this group, that was either 60 or

 8   100.

 9             And I'm sorry that the record is less clear,

10   but even if it is 3 out of 60, you're talking about 5

11   percent, whereas the population is 7.28 percent.           If

12   it just happens once or twice --

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Help me --

14             MR. LAWRENCE:     -- not a problem, but it

15   happens every month.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Help me -- help me

17   with the math.   If there were one more African-

18   American, what would the percentage be?           Pretty close

19   to what you're saying it should be, right?

20             MR. LAWRENCE:     If there were two more, it

21   would be right on target, just -- it would only be .28

22   percent low, which, if you simply send out a second

23   letter, because the testimony of Kim Foster was that,

24   later on, when they started sending out the second

25   letter, half of the people who did not respond would

                                    50

 1   respond --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Can we go back to your

 3   point about -- that there was a big change when the

 4   draw came from the circuit first, before the

 5   districts.     I thought it was agreed that, before,

 6   there was an 18 percent, on average, comparative

 7   difference and, after, 15 percent.                 That doesn't sound

 8   like a big change.

 9                MR. LAWRENCE:     But it's a step in the right

10   direction, and what we want to do is we want to

11   promote more minority participation on jurors --

12   juries, instead of creating a rule that tells court

13   administrators all over the country, the heat's off,

14   you don't have to do anything.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:      But a step -- a step in the

16   right direction is not enough.            You were adducing that

17   to prove that the prior system had a significant

18   effect, and it turned out, it didn't have a very

19   significant effect.     It doesn't prove your point to

20   say, well, it's a step in the right direction.

21                If it's insignificant, it's insignificant.

22   Whether it's insignificant in the right direction or

23   the wrong direction doesn't matter.

24                MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, one element of the

25   entire system might be insignificant, but you are

                                      51

 1   talking about numerous elements that went together,

 2   and Duren says they have to show what caused the

 3   underrepresentation.

 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:      I still don't -- I don't

 5   understand this problem of -- of you have to show that

 6   they took back more than they contributed.

 7             Let's assume that Grand Rapids is -- is

 8   entirely black, and its entire delegation that goes to

 9   the pool are all black, okay?          And let's assume that

10   those blacks are 10 percent of the -- the totality,

11   and there are no blacks from anywhere else, okay?

12   Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of

13   people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10

14   percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the

15   blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents.

16             All of the other districts would thereby

17   have zero percent blacks instead of 10 percent, which

18   is what they ought to have.

19             MR. LAWRENCE:     Each district, the jurors are

20   acquired from that district --

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:      Exactly.

22             MR. LAWRENCE:     -- and the circuit is

23   acquired from all the districts of the county.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:      Exactly.         So why expect the

25   other districts to have 10 percent blacks simply

                                   52

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   because Grand Rapids contributed 10 percent of the

 2   totality, all of whom were black?            There -- then

 3   there's a requirement for each district to have 10

 4   percent blacks, right?      But if Grand Rapids takes back

 5   its -- its -- the people it sent, there are no more

 6   blacks left to go around.

 7              MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, I don't expect those

 8   outlying districts to have more -- a larger percentage

 9   of blacks than the population; I'm only expecting that

10   from the county.

11              JUSTICE ALITO:     Isn't that the case --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:      So what if --

13              JUSTICE ALITO:     If -- if Grand -- if Grand

14   Rapids uses a disproportionate number of jurors in its

15   district courts, then you are going to have this

16   problem -- the only way to fix the problem would be to

17   have a separate jury system for the district courts.

18   If you have the -- the circuit courts going first,

19   then the people in the district courts are going to

20   have the problem that you identify.

21              If you have a system in which it's all done

22   randomly -- circuit court, district court -- the

23   people who come toward the end are going to have the

24   problem.   So I don't see any way out of this, if in

25   fact there was a statistical basis for it, other than

                                    53

 1   having a separate selection process for the district

 2   courts.     Is that what you think is necessary?

 3               MR. LAWRENCE:     I think that we should allow

 4   a great deal of flexibility to local court

 5   administrators.    As I mentioned in the brief, in the

 6   Parents Involved in Community Schools case, there was

 7   a discussion in the concurrence by Justice Kennedy

 8   about exactly what local governments --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.       So is --

10               MR. LAWRENCE:     -- can do to -- to get an

11   appropriate representation of minorities without using

12   racial classifications.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         That was a question of

14   what was permitted.     Here you're trying to say this is

15   required.    The school's case was, these are measures

16   the district could take if it wanted to.              But you are

17   saying these are measures the district must take

18   because the Constitution requires it.              They are quite

19   different settings.

20               MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, I admit that it is a

21   different setting.    However, I feel -- well, no, I

22   won't say "I feel."     Duren holds that there must be a

23   reasonable connection between the African-Americans

24   that appear on the jury arrays and the population as a

25   whole.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:      What about the -- the more

 2   I listen, the more I think you think there are a lot

 3   of things people could do.         They could send three

 4   letters; they could explain in the letters why it's

 5   important to come; they could try reversing the thing

 6   a little bit with the districts first or not first --

 7   all kinds of things.

 8               But what -- but now you're forcing them into

 9   this legal rubric.     So what about a decision, which

10   you wouldn't like, probably, but it would say we can't

11   say that they're unreasonable in respect to not having

12   all of these, but there -- who knows?              You know, when

13   they get around and others try them, et cetera.

14               In other words, unreasonable/reasonable is

15   one standard, and ambiguity plays a -- a role here,

16   too, that might be helpful.

17               MR. LAWRENCE:     Well, you are certainly

18   correct, and I would simply say that the people of

19   Grand Rapids looked up at the juries; 98 percent of

20   the time they saw nothing but white faces.              I think

21   that Duren requires that the local system do something

22   about it.    There's a lot of options.            So you should

23   give them flexibility.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Thank you, counsel.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Mr. Restuccia, you

 2   have 2 minutes remaining.

 3             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA,

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5               MR. RESTUCCIA:     I just have two brief

 6   points.    One is that -- I want to just remind the

 7   Court that this is a case under AEDPA review, so that

 8   the Michigan Supreme Court has to be not just

 9   incorrect; it has to be objectively unreasonable.

10               And its conclusion, I think probably the

11   easiest analysis here is the conclusion that there was

12   no showing of systemic exclusion, because Mr. Smith

13   failed to show that there was any underrepresentation

14   that arose from the jury assignment process, is

15   probably one of the strongest points, because if you

16   look at the 3 percent comparative disparity, that's

17   less than half of 1 percent absolute disparity.            No

18   one claims that that's statistically significant.

19               So I think whether it's reviewed under

20   2254(d)(2) or 2254(e)(1), this Court should reverse.

21               Thank you.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Thank you, counsel.

23               The case is submitted.
