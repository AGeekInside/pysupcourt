 7         ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9         MR. BROWNING:        Mr. Chief Justice and may it

10   please the Court:

11         The Voting Rights Act should be interpreted in

12   such a way as to encourage a transition to a society

13   where race no longer matters.              In North Carolina,

14   coalition districts have been crucial in moving towards

15   Congress's ultimate goal.           Coalition districts bring

16   races together by fostering political alliances across

17   racial lines.    As a result they serve to diminish racial

18   polarization over time.         Coalition districts help us in

19   reaching the point where race will no longer matter in

20   drawing district lines.         These districts bring us one

21   step closer to fulfilling our Nation's moral and ethical

22   obligation to create an integrated society.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How can you say that

24   this brings us closer to a situation where race will not

25   matter when it expands the number of situations in which


                                         3

 1   redistricting authorities have to consider race?

 2                MR. BROWNING:         Well, Your Honor,

 3   Mr. Chief Justice, it will require somewhat an increase

 4   in the number of districts that would be drawn, there is

 5   no question about that, but that increase is not

 6   substantial.   But it does cause race to be much less of

 7   a factor in the redistricting process.                  Currently, if a

 8   General Assembly has a choice between drawing a

 9   coalition district or a majority-minority district, the

10   50 percent rule that the North Carolina Supreme Court

11   adopted encourages States to draw a majority-minority

12   district, and when you do that it causes race to re-

13   dominate in the process.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It seems to me to be

15   a criticism of the majority-minority district approach

16   in the first place.

17                MR. BROWNING:         Well, Your Honor, it is a

18   recognition of the fact that coalition districts allow

19   us to move away from majority-minority districts and

20   create districts where races are working together.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about influence

22   districts?

23                MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you move --

25   you've moved from majority-minority to crossover

 1   districts.   Should you continue to move to so-called

 2   influence districts?

 3                MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, the decision in

 4   LULAC makes clear that influence districts are not

 5   protected under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But under your definition

 7   of coalition district, race is the key factor.

 8                MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor -

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And you are telling us if

10   we have a rule that makes race the key factor then race

11   doesn't matter.

12                MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, it is a matter of

13   -- under the Voting Rights Act, Congress has made clear

14   that districts should be drawn to protect minority

15   voting rights.    When there are areas of the country

16   where there is racial polarization, districts -- race

17   has to be considered in drawing districts that will give

18   minorities equal opportunity, just as majority --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I thought you were

20   proposing a brave new world of coalition districts.

21                MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, and race --

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Based on race.

23                MR. BROWNING:          Justice Kennedy, you have to

24   consider race in drawing these districts.                There's no

25   question about that.       That's the very thing that section


                                         5

 1   2 of the Voting Rights Act requires us to do.                       And you

 2   do that because there is racial polarization.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What's the authority that

 4   says you must consider race in drawing the districts,

 5   assuming that you don't have an existing majority --

 6   minority-majority district?              What's the -- what

 7   authority do you cite for the fact that you must

 8   consider race in drawing districts?                       What do I read to

 9   find that?

10                MR. BROWNING:           Well, Your Honor, that's

11   certainly the decision in Thornburg v. Gingles.                       Under

12   --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, that's -- that's a

14   majority -- majority district.

15                MR. BROWNING:           Yes, Your Honor.             That was a

16   majority district.      This Court --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Okay.           So then what other

18   case do you have?

19                MR. BROWNING:           Your Honor, this Court, of

20   course, has left open the issue of whether the Voting

21   Rights Act would protect minority --

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, then your statement

23   that you must always consider race in drawing districts

24   is not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new

25   proposition that you are arguing for us here.

 1               MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, my point is when

 2   you are drawing districts under section 2, of course

 3   race has to be considered, but it's considered because

 4   the process is not equally open to minorities.

 5   Unfortunately, North Carolina has a long history of

 6   discrimination, and that discrimination has resulted in

 7   current effects in the voting place.                    There is racially

 8   polarized voting, as has been stipulated to in this

 9   case.   There has been --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I would have

11   thought the possibility of coalition districts would be

12   evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded,

13   rather than evidence that you need to apply it more

14   broadly.

15               MR. BROWNING:          Mr. Chief Justice, the

16   coalition districts are certainly evidence that we have

17   made progress towards Congress's ultimate goal under the

18   Voting Rights Act, but we are not there yet.                   In this

19   district, the expert testimony is that only 15 to 30

20   percent of whites will vote for a black candidate, and

21   that is still very racially polarized.                   But coalition

22   districts help us to move away.              It -- they help to

23   diminish the amount of racial polarization over time, so

24   that eventually we won't need to be looking at race at

25   all in drawing district lines, but where --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I mean, the

 2   obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what

 3   number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates

 4   that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a

 5   coalition district?

 6                MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, in the Gingles

 7   case, this Court stated that it was a district-by-

 8   district determination.        There's no bright-line rule as

 9   to where crossover voting is so great that it doesn't

10   satisfy the third Gingles prong.               Here, however, the

11   district was --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Of course, it could

13   be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular

14   candidate.   At some point you have to conclude that it's

15   based on the candidate rather than on race.

16                MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, at some point

17   that's true, that it would be issues beyond race, but

18   here, the expert report and as stipulated to by

19   Respondents, this voting is racially polarized.                 There

20   is some crossover voting, but not enough to say that the

21   effects of past discrimination have been eliminated.

22   That crossover voting is sufficient for this district to

23   work.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:         You can't say where -- how

25   much crossover voting would be so large as to make a


                                        8

 1   difference?    You can't say where the line is

 2   statistically?

 3                 MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, this Court's,

 4   again, decision in Gingles makes clear that that is a

 5   district-by-district determination.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And that -- that has been

 7   stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles

 8   factor?   So it's not at issue in this case, but the

 9   point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely

10   on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the

11   ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's

12   choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes

13   as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates.                 So

14   there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand

15   and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.

16                 MR. BROWNING:         Justice Ginsburg, I

17   completely agree that, at some point, the crossover

18   voting becomes so great that you no longer have to take

19   into account district lines.             Unfortunately --

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         If that's the case, then --

21                 MR. BROWNING:         -- we're not there yet.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:         If that's the case, then

23   your test imposes a statistical standard just as your

24   opponent's test does, doesn't it?                 It's just a different

25   one.

 1                MR. BROWNING:           Yes, Your Honor.             What we're

 2   proposing and what we think is required by the text of

 3   section 2 is you simply take the existing Gingles

 4   factors and you look at the amount of racially polarized

 5   voting, and from that you are able to readily calculate

 6   the size of the minority group that would be

 7   sufficiently large to elect a minority -- a minority

 8   candidate.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:           Suppose there is 40 percent

10   crossover voting, and that's a little bit -- that's not

11   quite enough for the minority candidate to win.

12                MR. BROWNING:           Your Honor, again, whether

13   the third Gingles prong is satisfied obviously is a

14   district-by-district determination.                       Here, however --

15                JUSTICE ALITO:           We can't even say that 40

16   percent would be sufficient in every instance, that that

17   might be -- you know, that might not be enough?

18                MR. BROWNING:           I'm hesitant since this Court

19   has not set a specific limit, and that's, again, an

20   issue that has been stipulated to in this case.                      The --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, you don't suggest

22   that if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we

23   would find white bloc voting within the Gingles

24   condition, do you?      Do you think that is a serious

25   possibility?

 1              MR. BROWNING:            No, I think it would be very,

 2   very unrealistic that you'd have 40 percent --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:              No, but I mean you really

 4   do have an answer to Justice Alito's question.

 5              MR. BROWNING:            Yes, Your Honor.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What is the answer?

 7   What percentage of crossover voting would make this not

 8   actionable under section 2?

 9              MR. BROWNING:            Again, the third prong is not

10   an aspect of this case.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So you don't have an

12   answer to Justice Alito's question?

13              (Laughter.)

14              MR. BROWNING:            If you are saying that 40

15   percent is a very high amount of crossover voting, that,

16   of course, is not our case, where the crossover voting

17   that is necessary to make this coalition district work

18   is 18 percent crossover voting.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Do you have racially

20   polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote

21   as 40 percent?    I mean, you say, we apply the normal

22   Gingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover

23   is fairly high.

24              MR. BROWNING:            40 percent is a high number,

25   and particularly --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you still think that we

 2   can confidently say this is racially polarized?

 3               MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, here, however,

 4   under this case, there's not 40 percent crossover --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you're opening

 6   yourself to this line of questioning about the third

 7   factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in

 8   issue.   But you are opening it by having a test that

 9   looks to the second and third factor and leaves the

10   first factor out of it.        I mean, whether you agree with

11   it or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know

12   what's in and what's out.          You don't have any test for

13   the first factor that's comparable, that would give

14   district courts and attorneys some degree of security

15   about how you determine the first factor.

16               MR. BROWNING:          Well, Your Honor, as the

17   language the Court used in the De Grandy decision is

18   whether the minority group is sufficiently large to

19   elect a minority-preferred candidate.                   There are, of

20   course, limiting factors on the side of the coalition

21   district which could be drawn.              There are practical

22   limiting factors and there are legal limitations.

23               The practical limitation, of course, is in

24   North Carolina, given what has happened in past

25   elections, the North Carolina General Assembly

 1   appropriately concluded that a minority group of less

 2   than 40 percent would simply not work, that it would not

 3   be effective to give rise to a minority -- a district in

 4   which minorities elect a minority-preferred candidate.

 5               There's also a legal limitation.                 In the

 6   Court's decision in LULAC, the Court made clear that

 7   influence districts are not protected by section 2.                   So

 8   as a result, the minority group will by necessity have

 9   to control its coalition partner; otherwise it would

10   simply be an influence district.               And here at a minority

11   group of 40 percent, the minority group in the area is

12   substantially larger than the crossover voting that is

13   needed to have an ability to elect.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under your theory,

15   it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority

16   district on the ground that you could draw a different

17   coalition district, maybe more than one coalition

18   district.   Let's put it that way.

19               If you could draw a majority-minority

20   district and you could draw two crossover districts,

21   does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?

22               MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, our position is

23   that the -- assuming all of the factors under Gingles to

24   be met, that if you have a minority group that was

25   packed in to a -- one district, and in its place two

 1   coalition districts could be effectively drawn, and

 2   those districts would actually work and you could meet

 3   all of the other standards under Gingles -- the district

 4   was geographically compact, there is --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's an easy -- I

 6   suspect that's a common hypothetical.                     You could draw a

 7   district with 80 percent minority voters or you could

 8   have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts.                     And

 9   the Voting Rights Act requires what?

10               MR. BROWNING:            In that situation, assuming

11   you could meet all of the Gingles factors, that, yes,

12   that 80 percent district should be drawn as two 40

13   percent districts.

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Aren't you adopting the

15   principle of maximization?

16               MR. BROWNING:            No, Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Let me ask you this, and

18   correct me if I am wrong, because it has been a long

19   time since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting

20   things.   But I -- I thought when you are given the

21   alternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and

22   two 40 percents, that because there is not a principle

23   of maximization there simply is not an abstract or

24   bright-line answer to the question; and that in order to

25   get an answer to the question, you look at all of the


                                         14

 1   other things that districting authorities look to, and

 2   you see how they add up, whether we are talking about

 3   compactness, congruency with -- with -- with other

 4   political lines, and so on.             And unless you look to all

 5   the other things that reasonably can and should be take

 6   into consideration when districting is done, you simply

 7   cannot answer the question, should there be two 40's or

 8   one 80.

 9              Am I wrong?

10              MR. BROWNING:            Well, Justice Souter,

11   certainly the -- the criteria that you have referred to

12   have to be part of the districting process.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But they weren't part of

14   your answer to the Chief Justice.

15              MR. BROWNING:            Well, my point is that when

16   minorities are basically put in an enclave, in a

17   separate district but yet it is possible to draw two

18   districts, two coalition districts, and the other prongs

19   of Gingles have not been met, so that there is not rough

20   proportionality throughout the State, yes, the

21   districting body needs to consider drawing two

22   districts --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:              It needs to consider it,

24   but I thought your answer was it needs to do it.             Is

25   that your answer?

 1              MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Your Honor, it would

 2   be -- it is our answer that if a district -- if there is

 3   not rough proportionality in a State, there is a

 4   district that is a super-majority and there is no reason

 5   for that super-majority to be in place.

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay if there is no reason

 7   for the super-majority.       My point is that you cannot

 8   answer the question in the abstract.                   And when you start

 9   to answer it, as you are doing now, you are going beyond

10   the abstract and you are getting into facts outside the

11   mere choice between two 40's and one 80.                  And that seems

12   to me to be correct.     At least, if it's not correct, you

13   and I are making the same mistake.

14              MR. BROWNING:          No, Justice Souter, your

15   point is well taken and I agree that with a hypothetical

16   like that it's very difficult, unless you are actually

17   considering the specific situation of the district.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, we -- what you

19   propose is going to inject courts into the drawing of

20   districts much more frequently than they -- than they

21   already are injected.     The reality is that one of the

22   factors -- you mentioned contiguousness and county lines

23   and so forth, but one of the factors that legislators

24   always take into account is incumbent protection and the

25   incumbent is always going to rather be in an 80 percent


                                      16

 1   district than in a so-called 40 percent coalition

 2   district.

 3               I think you are unrealistic to expect State

 4   legislatures to draw districts that way, where everybody

 5   will have a chance.      The whole object of it is that

 6   nobody will have a chance, just the incumbents.                That's

 7   what is going on.

 8               MR. BROWNING:           Your Honor, I think what

 9   Congress has required courts to do is to look at the

10   overall picture of the district.                The Congress, in

11   connection with the section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,

12   used very broad language, phrases like "totality of

13   circumstances" and "opportunity to participate and

14   elect."   So clearly, Congress intended for a broad

15   approach to be taken and a functional one.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, that's fine, but you

17   just can't wave a magic wand.              It -- Congress also

18   intended primarily to leave it up to the legislatures

19   under guidelines, to be sure.              And when you have a

20   choice of one 80 percent or two or even three 40

21   percent, it's clear to me what the legislature is going

22   to -- going to choose.

23               MR. BROWNING:           Well, Your Honor, and that's

24   the very point of the section 2 of the Voting Rights

25   Act, is when minorities do not have equal opportunity to


                                        17

 1   elect their candidate of choice, where they are packed

 2   in to districts --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            We will be injected into

 4   this very political game much more frequently than we

 5   now are.   I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles

 6   thing as simply a self-protection prescription for the

 7   courts, where you can look, you can be clear and say,

 8   you know, close enough for government work.

 9                 But if you want us to figure out whether

10   there could be three districts, two districts instead of

11   just one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing

12   the whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into

13   the courts.    And that is -- that is not something that

14   I, for one, favor.

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            In this case which way

16   does the presumption favoring what the legislature did

17   cut?   Here the court set aside what the legislature did;

18   is that not right?

19                 MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Your Honor, the North

20   Carolina Supreme Court determined that this district

21   should not cut county lines.              Ironically, that county

22   line was a county line that was originally created to

23   segregate blacks in Wilmington, in the southern portion

24   of the county, from whites in the northern portion of

25   the county.

 1                 So that original discriminatory act is now

 2   being used to keep a district from -- from being a place

 3   that is a district that has a proven ability to elect a

 4   minority --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's something new.   I

 6   thought we took the case -- at least I have been

 7   thinking about the case -- on the assumption that there

 8   is a valid State law that is being superseded.             Now, if

 9   you are questioning the validity of the State law,

10   that's something -- that hasn't been raised here, has

11   it?

12                 MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, the government

13   has asserted that there should be a near-50 percent test

14   which includes as part of it a -- either the district is

15   close to 50 percent or there is an element of

16   discrimination.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm talking about, you're

18   indicating to us that the county line standard that the

19   State court invoked as a matter of State law is itself

20   questionable because it was based on a prohibited racial

21   animus.   And I -- I indicated that that's very new to

22   me.   I thought we were taking the case on the

23   proposition that the county line rule is a neutral,

24   valid State law principle.

25                 Now, it may or may not be superseded by

 1   the -- by the requirement of section 2.                   That's what we

 2   are arguing about.      But this is the first time I have

 3   heard that we have to somehow question the underlying

 4   State rule under the Fourteenth Amendment.

 5                 I thought we took the case on the assumption

 6   that the State rule is valid.

 7                 MR. BROWNING:          Justice Kennedy, the decision

 8   of the North Carolina Supreme Court is to adopt an

 9   inflexible 50 percent rule.              That -- that was the issue

10   that was resolved on summary judgment by the --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm talking about the

12   county line rule.

13                 MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Your Honor, that the

14   county line rule -- the North Carolina Supreme Court

15   concluded that this district could not cut county lines

16   because this should not be treated as a section

17   2 district.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We are fighting

19   over -- the district that you want to draw, the

20   crossover district, would have 39 percent

21   African-American voters.           The district that complied

22   with State law of the county line would have 35 percent.

23                 Where the assumption is that you have a

24   significant degree of crossover voting, is that really a

25   difference worth changing the Voting Rights Act

 1   jurisprudence for?

 2                 MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, the plaintiffs

 3   have and the Respondent and the government have referred

 4   to an alternative district that would not cut those

 5   county lines and would have a black voting age

 6   population of 35 percent.            The problem with that is

 7   there is absolutely no testimony that that -- their

 8   alternative district would be in any way workable.                      As a

 9   matter of fact, the undisputed testimony of the joint

10   appendix at page 73-74 is to the contrary.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What do you mean by

12   "workable"?

13                 MR. BROWNING:          That this -- that the

14   district they propose was simply prepared by their

15   attorney, looking at a map.              There is absolutely no

16   testimony that this would be an effective minority

17   district, that there would be an equal opportunity for

18   minorities --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Because it's 4

20   percent less than the district you propose?

21                 MR. BROWNING:          Well, it is a matter of the

22   percentage of voting age population, but more

23   importantly, the district they drew would have put a

24   black incumbent, a black Democrat incumbent, in the same

25   district with a white Republican incumbent.                   If they

 1   were serious about --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it gets back to

 3   the Justice Scalia's point --

 4               MR. BROWNING:          Yes.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- that this is

 6   designed to protect incumbents.

 7               MR. BROWNING:          Well, Your Honor, incumbency

 8   certainly has to be considered in the context of what

 9   the Voting Rights Act requires us to do, which is to

10   look at the total picture.          Is it a functional approach?

11   It is a matter of looking -- undertaking a searching

12   evaluation of the past and present political realities.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Browning, I thought

14   there was something in the record that said never in

15   North Carolina's history have you had African Americans

16   able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of

17   their choice where the minority population was less than

18   38.37 percent.

19               MR. BROWNING:          Justice Ginsburg, there are

20   districts such as Wake County, the seat of government,

21   where a minority has been elected with less than 38

22   percent.   But in areas of the State where there is

23   highly racially polarized voting, 38 percent roughly is

24   the effective floor that the General Assembly recognized

25   as being workable for creating a district such as this.

 1   I will also note that this issue was not presented to

 2   the North Carolina Supreme Court, the issue of whether

 3   there is an alternative district that would somehow be

 4   feasible and workable.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, does that mean a

 6   proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that

 7   question?

 8               MR. BROWNING:            Your Honor, that would

 9   certainly be one possibility, but the North Carolina

10   Supreme Court resolved this straight legal question as

11   to whether the 50 percent rule is in place and is an --

12   is an inflexible rule, and not only did they -- they

13   imposed this rule with respect to this district, they

14   essentially had a mandatory injunction on the North

15   Carolina General Assembly to never draw a district at

16   less than 50 percent if it cuts too many county lines;

17   and that is even inconsistent with the United States'

18   view of section 2.      For that reason, alone the decision

19   should be reversed.

20               If there are no other questions I would like

21   to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 1                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 2              MR. THURMAN:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 3   and may it please the Court.

 4              The rule proposed by Petitioners in this

 5   case would effectively require maximization resulting

 6   in, as the Court has recognized, judicial involvement in

 7   many, many more situations.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:              I don't know why it would

 9   require maximization.       It would -- it would certainly

10   open the door to -- to more districts required by

11   section 2 than if we have a 50 percent rule.                 But I -- I

12   think your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a

13   district, you are bound by our case law as well as

14   tradition to look to something more than maximization,

15   and maximization is in fact not the law.                 So I don't see

16   why it would be required.

17              MR. THURMAN:           Your Honor, in this situation,

18   we take the position that the people of North Carolina

19   and their ultimate authority, their State Constitution,

20   have spoken and said that county lines should be kept

21   whole to the extent practical.               And the State's position

22   is the legislators disregarded that and, based on the

23   cases, based on LULAC, at 25 percent --

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:              What's that got to do with

25   maximization?

 1                 MR. THURMAN:        Well, Your Honor, that would

 2   be the position they would take of every district that

 3   could be drawn regardless of the --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           There is no question that

 5   if they are -- if they win this case, I think there is

 6   no question there will be more claims requiring -- or

 7   potentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines

 8   based on avoiding section 2 violation.                     I would almost

 9   think that was common ground.              But that is a different

10   thing from saying that the result of those claims is

11   going to be a required maximization.                     And that's --

12   that's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick --

13   pick up on.

14                 MR. THURMAN:        Your Honor, it seems that if

15   there are going to be more potential claims, and as

16   every legislative body, school board, city council,

17   whatever it is, has to follow section 2, they will have

18   to take this into account.           They will be facing

19   potential claims and they will have to run the risk of

20   do we look to try to maximize a district that might not

21   otherwise be required, that might violate a neutral

22   criteria --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You are saying they will

24   tend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.

25                 MR. THURMAN:        Your Honor, I think that is

 1   absolutely true.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why in the -- why in

 4   the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a

 5   situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover

 6   voting?

 7               MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, the answer to that

 8   question is we were 20 months into the litigation, we

 9   had just received a partial ruling on cross motions for

10   summary judgment, we were already at the midpoint of the

11   decade.   If this Court should affirm the North Carolina

12   Supreme Court, my client will have one election in which

13   they have a district that complies with the North

14   Carolina Constitution.       We quite simply wanted to move

15   the case along.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but it seems

17   to me you have complicated situations on a rather

18   critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how

19   can you have bloc voting and at the same time have

20   significant crossover voting?             You take one of those off

21   the table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue

22   in the case.

23               MR. THURMAN:         I agree, Your Honor.          The

24   other point that I would point out is, it is not a

25   stipulation that there was sufficient bloc voting within


                                       26

 1   either of the districts that were drawn.                The

 2   stipulation was with reference to bloc voting within the

 3   two counties.   The district that could be drawn -- there

 4   is no stipulation that the alternative district does not

 5   comply and would -- and therefore would require the

 6   creation of the 39 percent district.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, since the district is

 8   drawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with

 9   respect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the

10   absence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc

11   voting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the

12   district?

13               MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, there are very

14   different populations in these two counties, and that is

15   referenced in the record with regards to the growth in

16   population; and there is very different minority

17   populations in the two counties because of the influx --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But regardless, regardless

19   of the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating

20   that there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in

21   county B, and you have got a district made up part of A,

22   part of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of

23   some pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in

24   the district there is probably going to be bloc voting?

25               MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, I would

 1   respectfully submit that it does not follow within a

 2   particular section of a district.               I think we all --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you have evidence in the

 4   record -- did you put evidence in the record that this

 5   particular district is carved from some peculiar section

 6   of county A and county B, so that the general bloc

 7   voting pattern does not apply in the district?

 8              MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, there is evidence

 9   in the record, and it is cited in the brief, that

10   minority candidates, black candidates for judicial

11   office and for State auditor received between 59 percent

12   and 62 percent of the vote in the proposed district.                   We

13   would respectfully submit that that comprises evidence

14   that there is not sufficient bloc voting.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you stipulated.        You

17   didn't want to argue the third factor.                 You wanted --

18   you just started out by saying you were tired of this

19   litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and

20   one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule.                  And

21   now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation

22   really didn't stipulate away the third factor.                 I

23   thought you were giving in on that issue so that you

24   could get the first issue decided.

25              MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, we did make a

 1   stipulation that there was evidence sufficient to

 2   support a finding and that we would stand by.             There was

 3   evidence they had an expert who was willing to so

 4   testify.    I was responding to Justice Souter's question

 5   of was there was evidence in the record to support the

 6   contention that there might not be bloc voting within

 7   the alternative district, and that was -- that meant

 8   that black candidates can receive in excess of 60

 9   percent of the vote in the 35 percent district.

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But just help me on the

11   facts, because I may have misunderstood the facts.

12   You're saying you did not stipulate that there was bloc

13   voting; you stipulated that there was sufficient

14   evidence for a factfinder to find that there was bloc

15   voting.    Is that your position?

16                MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, on page 130a of

17   the -- I believe this is their submission, the --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm sorry, what -- what's

19   the color of the brief -- of the cover on this?             Is it

20   the brown one or the white one?

21                MR. THURMAN:         I believe this is the white

22   one, Your Honor.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, and you're at 130?

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            130a?

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Yes.

 2              MR. THURMAN:            And it starts out that, in

 3   terms of the bloc voting, between the -- and the

 4   evidence presented by the defendant is sufficient to

 5   support a finding of fact that the racial difference in

 6   the presence of those results in the white majority

 7   voting is sufficient as a bloc to defeat the minority's

 8   preferred candidate.        And, again, that comes down to --

 9   the court that it was Pender and New Hanover County that

10   started the action on 29a, and that was the stipulation.

11   And --

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But what do you make of the

13   -- the beginning of the next paragraph?                   "Plaintiffs

14   hereby advise the court that they do not wish to be

15   heard further or to present evidence regarding the

16   remaining issues."      Doesn't -- I'm not sure what that's

17   getting at, but when I looked at it, I thought it meant

18   that the stipulation can control, i.e., it may be found

19   without objection that there is bloc voting or assumed

20   without objection that there is bloc voting.

21              MR. THURMAN:            Your Honor --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:               If you don't wish to

23   present evidence.

24              MR. THURMAN:            Your Honor, first of all, we

25   were not stipulating that it did exist.                   We stipulated

 1   that it was in evidence, that the court defined --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Yes, I realize, but when

 3   you then say "And we don't wish to present any evidence

 4   on it," it sounds to me as though you are conceding the

 5   issue.

 6                 MR. THURMAN:        Your Honor, we do -- we let it

 7   stand on its own, we not wish to be heard further, we do

 8   not wish to take additional time on that, given the

 9   circumstances of the case.

10                 The other factor that I think is perhaps

11   most important in considering this is touched on briefly

12   earlier.   Section 2 clearly applies to all

13   jurisdictions.    And without the guidance of the 50

14   percent rule, the bodies that are drafting are left with

15   an uncertain standard and a standard -- in this case, so

16   far as we know, the State had retroactive -- this Court

17   -- had been used previously, are every local government

18   body requires paying such an expert to proceed simply to

19   redistrict?    That, if you don't have a clear rule to

20   follow, presents a problem for the many government

21   bodies that have to redistrict on a regular basis.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What was wrong with the

23   clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC

24   case?

25                 MR. THURMAN:        I'm sorry, ma'am.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Justice Souter, in his

 2   opinion in the LULAC case --

 3              MR. THURMAN:         Yes, Your Honor.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG: --               he suggested what he

 5   called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is

 6   not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you

 7   met that standard, you're okay.

 8              MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, I certainly am not

 9   criticizing the rule proposed by Justice Souter, but --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:            It's okay.

11              (Laughter.)

12              MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, I think -- the

13   perspective -- and I can't help -- that it is not as

14   clear-edged as it seemed to the Court, at least to

15   Justice Souter, that the 50 percent rule does provide a

16   very clear, very limited sort of a rule that can be

17   followed without getting involved in -- I do believe

18   that -- race becomes very likely the predominant factor

19   in the redistricting decision, because based on the

20   cases that have come before you already, there have been

21   claims that 26 percent, 25 percent --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't see how those

23   claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go

24   back to sort of step 1.       My mind turns a little confused

25   when I start thinking of these cases.                  Are we talking

 1   about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote

 2   dilution?    Is that yes or no?

 3                MR. THURMAN:         Yes, Your Honor.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:            Section 2 -- does vote

 5   dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a

 6   black group, could have elected a candidate of our

 7   choice more likely than the white group, but because you

 8   are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen

 9   anymore?    Is that the form of the claim?

10                MR. THURMAN:         Yes, Your Honor, that is --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the form of the

12   claim.

13                Then, it's our problem here that to see

14   whether that's so, you have to see whether the black

15   group did really vote as a group.                 Did they used to have

16   a good chance to elect the person they want, and does

17   the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp

18   them?    Is that what we are trying to find out?

19                MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, I'm not sure that

20   is entirely what we are trying to find out, because

21   certainly districts are created where there was no

22   minority incumbent, and that can happen because of

23   changes in demographics or a variety --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            There are a lot of reasons

25   that can happen.    But is the evil we are trying to get


                                        33

 1   at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together

 2   in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting

 3   their candidate elected than when the white group does

 4   the same?

 5                 MR. THURMAN:           Your Honor, I believe the

 6   answer is, yes, we are trying to prevent that from

 7   happening.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:              That's what we are trying

 9   to prevent?    Okay.      If that's what we are trying to

10   prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a

11   threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you

12   can't even get in the door -- unless the black group

13   accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the

14   people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense

15   for the reason that Justice Scalia started with.               It

16   doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account

17   for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because

18   they all divide on four different people, or maybe they

19   didn't turn out.    On the other hand, sometimes if they

20   account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate

21   of their choice.    So it looks as if that 50 percent is

22   pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better

23   criterion.    Is there anything wrong with what I've said

24   so far?

25                 MR. THURMAN:           Respectfully, Your Honor, I

 1   believe there is, because you said you look to see if

 2   there is vote dilution.       Well, there needs to be

 3   something to measure that by.            Section 5 is about

 4   retrogression.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            Here what we've -- could we

 6   look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever

 7   they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough

 8   to elect the candidates of their choice?                 Reasonably

 9   compact, politically cohesive?             And then you look to

10   see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop

11   them?

12              MR. THURMAN:         Yes, Your Honor.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:            That's what we should do?

14              MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor --

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            Then I'm back to my

16   problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just

17   doesn't measure that first part.              And so you say, well,

18   any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could

19   invent some that were actually better.                 Suppose you

20   wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example,

21   you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said,

22   you know, if the black group is going to elect their

23   candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're

24   going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only

25   vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out.                 They


                                      35
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   are going to need a lot of crossovers.                     And the more

 2   crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say

 3   that that white group is out there trying to beat them.

 4               So there's a kind of natural stopping place.

 5   When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural

 6   stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.                     It sort of

 7   fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist

 8   that the black group had to be twice as many as the

 9   white group that crossed over.              A little arbitrary, but

10   at least we were getting to the same -- to the right

11   thing.   I mean -- respond as you wish.

12               MR. THURMAN:         Thank you, Your Honor.              It may

13   take me a second to take it all in.                     It seems to me that

14   the reason the 50 percent rule does work is, at 50

15   percent, there is a claim that there is the opportunity

16   and there is voter registration, voter turnout, a lot of

17   factors that can influence at that point, but that

18   doesn't prevent there from being opportunity.                     That's

19   the choice of whatever group is involved.                     You start

20   dropping below 50 percent, and then they're not being

21   denied an equal opportunity.            They have the same

22   opportunity any other group does.                This would require

23   trying to -- because what -- basically the Petitioner's

24   position is -- the State in its -- position is, it takes

25   a minority group, and then you find presumably another

 1   majority group that shares political and partisan goals

 2   with them, and you combine those two together.                   So you

 3   look not only to the race of one group -- that

 4   predominates first.     Then you go find like-minded

 5   members of the majority group to join with them.                   And so

 6   that is what is being required.              At that point you are

 7   not talking about them being treated less equal than

 8   anyone else.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Thurman, can I ask you

10   this question?   It seems to me that a rigid 51 percent

11   rule assumes that the minority communities throughout

12   the country are all alike, and that there is enough

13   variety in every district and every part of the country

14   where we have this problem.            There are variations.

15   Maybe 51 percent would not be enough.                   The minority

16   group might, itself, be divided as is often the case.

17               I -- I think the underlying premise -- the

18   underlying -- the premise underlying your argument is

19   that all minorities are exactly alike.                   That's why we

20   can have this mathematical figure, and that answers the

21   question.

22               MR. THURMAN:         Your Honor, I categorically

23   reject that as a human-rights basis for our argument.

24   That is handled by the third Gingles prong and the

25   second Gingles prong.      And when you look at what the


                                       37
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   coalition is, what it is, and you look at how

 2   politically cohesive it is.              So it could be that 50

 3   percent is arguably not enough under the second Gingles

 4   provision.

 5                 But that until you get to 50 percent, you

 6   are -- again, it is the way it has been described as a

 7   gate-keeping function for us to keep the Court out of

 8   it.   And it is going to -- if this happens, you start

 9   looking at combining a combination of race or other

10   minority status and partisan politics and combining them

11   together for the purpose of electing particular

12   candidates.     And I do not believe it's ever been

13   something that this Court has endorsed for the purpose

14   of the Voting Rights Act.            And if that is the position

15   it takes, it starts to run into the issue:                   Is such

16   supportable under the Solomon case, under equal

17   protection?

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What -- what

19   Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his

20   question.     He said:     Suppose you make it, the threshold,

21   instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the

22   African-American population as in the crossover group.

23   That would be the threshold.

24                 MR. THURMAN:         But, Your Honor, first, I

25   believe as he said, as Justice Breyer said, that's an


                                         38
                              Alderson Reporting Company

 1   arbitrary number that he picked up on, the 50 percent.

 2   The reason we would submit that is not simply an

 3   arbitrary number is that it does deal with them.                At

 4   that point there is an opportunity, regardless of

 5   whether there is the -- what it certainly does not

 6   exist --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But -- but you are saying

 8   it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is

 9   sufficient to provide an opportunity.                    And

10   Justice Breyer's question is:              Isn't the two-to-one

11   ratio something that we should consider as also being

12   sufficient to provide an opportunity?

13              MR. THURMAN:           Your Honor, I would say that

14   that would not be appropriate, because at that point you

15   are looking on -- at the basis of race to give one group

16   a greater opportunity than another, and the Voting

17   Rights Act is the one group being given less opportunity

18   than another.   And so if you are hinting to draw a

19   district that bases itself on race, that attempts to

20   give one group --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, it's -- it's a

22   greater opportunity than -- than would be given to them

23   in -- in the district or a pair of districts that splits

24   the minority population in half.                But how is it in some

25   abstract sense a greater opportunity?

 1               MR. THURMAN:          Your Honor --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:             The opportunities are --

 3   are measured on the ground, not in the abstract.

 4               MR. THURMAN:          Your Honor, my answer to that

 5   would be that the -- what would be proposed is it is

 6   required.   It is no longer left up to the legislature to

 7   decide whether that is appropriate.                      And that since it

 8   is a requirement, that is not part of the political

 9   process; and it goes to whether that is -- they are no

10   longer looking to what they have left, but whether they

11   are, in fact, given more.

18               MR. JOSEFFER:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20               Petitioner has proposed expansion of section

21   2's traditional coverage because of three serious

22   problems.   The first is to provide State and local

23   legislatures, as well as the courts, with a baseline

24   against which to when a section 2 District must be drawn

25   in the first place, when to engage in this race-


                                        40

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   conscious exercise in the first place.

 2              Second, it raises the serious Constitutional

 3   concerns identified in LULAC, especially because it

 4   combines not only racial gerrymandering but with

 5   political-party gerrymandering all at the same time.

 6              And third, it requires difficult predictive

 7   judgments about how people would react, how people would

 8   vote in a future proposed district, something that is

 9   not required under the traditional Gingles analysis.

10              And these problems would exist nationwide

11   because section 2 applies to every districting done in

12   every jurisdiction and every -- nationwide, be it a

13   county, city, or locality or down to the school-board or

14   city-council level.

15              Now, under the first of those points, under

16   the traditional Gingles test, the scope of consideration

17   of race and other things, as well as the majority limit

18   of the districts -- and that provides an -- an easy

19   focal point that anyone drawing a district knows.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought you were

21   conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North

22   Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they

23   could be 48 percent, I think you said.

24              MR.   JOSEFFER:         We have identified two

25   narrow exceptions, neither of which the Court really


                                      41
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   needs to reach in this case.              The first is an inference

 2   of intentional discrimination.                And the important thing

 3   there is, first, that's academic.                  Because if you can

 4   prove intentional discrimination, you can proceed with a

 5   constitutional claim under section 2 and not add

 6   anything anyway.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Intentional by those who

 8   draw the district?

 9               MR. JOSEFFER:            Yes, exactly.            And there --

10   the point here is because it's not an actualization

11   statute, one needs a baseline to determine if there is

12   the denial of an equal opportunity to elect.                      And if, in

13   fact, what the people drawing the district were trying

14   to do was to deprive the minority group of that

15   opportunity, that is a perfectly good alternative

16   baseline.

17               Our other proposed narrow exception, which

18   also is not even close to being implicated here, is

19   basically an evidentiary one:               That there are those

20   cases where, when you are trying to figure out whether

21   the majority population is above 50 percent, you may not

22   be sure because these are estimates.                      They are very

23   reliable, but we would impose about a two percent

24   cushion there to adjust -- to account for the

25   possibility that if there is that much evidentiary

 1   uncertainty, it makes sense to have a -- for purposes of

 2   that test.    However --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:              I don't know if you

 4   litigate whether you are -- whether you are really

 5   talking about a -- a possible two percent variation.                   So

 6   that I mean, I -- I think you have to concede under your

 7   -- under your test that there's going to be more

 8   litigation.     There is going to be more claims than there

 9   are under a 50 percent rule.

10                 MR. JOSEFFER:            Well, because -- I say

11   actually the opposite because -- well, I think that

12   trying to determine 48percent raises no more difficulty

13   than trying to determine 50 percent.

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:              Except that you have a

15   better chance so you are more likely to do it.

16                 MR. JOSEFFER:            There is -- there is a slight

17   narrowing of the -- of the --

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:              Two percent is pretty big

19   in an election.

20                 MR.     JOSEFFER:         Well, in -- in practice -- I

21   mean, remember, the majority-minority rule has been

22   followed in almost every jurisdiction nationwide for

23   more than two decades, and so far I have seen one 48

24   percent case.       There may have been others, but there --

25   there don't seem to have been very many.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:             If you want an absolute,

 2   arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward

 3   which will just -- - the question is whether they get in

 4   the door.     If they are in the door, they have to prove

 5   the three factors.       And you want to keep certain people

 6   out.

 7                 Okay.    Suppose you say, well, 42 percent.

 8   That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead

 9   of 50.     But you are out anyway if the crossover vote

10   from the white majority is more than half of what the

11   whole vote is with the black and white together on that

12   side.     So you have a two-to-one ratio.

13                 Now, the only virtue of that is that there

14   was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you

15   have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit

16   more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is

17   likely to get in more cases that are justified.              But

18   they still have to prove their three factors.

19                 MR. JOSEFFER:           Well, there -- there are a

20   couple of things.      The first is that, textually

21   speaking, what the statute refers to is an equal

22   opportunity to elect the -- the representative of their

23   choice.     And at least the most principal blind is the

24   majority-minority rule.           Because if you have by

25   yourselves the majority of the electorate, you have at


                                          44
                            Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   least in theory the opportunity to elect the

 2   representative of your choice.             When you go beyond that,

 3   there really is at that point --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:            It takes into account the

 5   realistic fact that in every group, including lots of

 6   African-American groups, there is -- it is not

 7   100 percent African American at all.                   There are -- there

 8   are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's

 9   still the candidate of that community's choice.

10              MR. JOSEFFER:          Right.        But that's --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:            So we want -- a little

12   flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.

13              MR. JOSEFFER:          Yes.      The problem is once you

14   go below what is at least in principle a 50 percent

15   line, it's not clear where -- where one would ever stop.

16   And under your approach, I think two exceptions:                  One,

17   you definitely open the door down to potentially below

18   42, especially -- in this case, especially --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            You can't get below 42.

20   I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with

21   your thumb on the scale.

22              MR. JOSEFFER:          I mean --

23              JUSTICE BREYER:            They are -- they are

24   finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they

25   have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.

 1               MR. JOSEFFER:          One problem with what you are

 2   looking for is a principle rule that can be justified.

 3   I understand 50, and I understand the slight evidentiary

 4   cushion.   Forty-two really does -- from what you're

 5   trying to determine is now the equal opportunity to be

 6   coming out of nowhere.

 7               The other advantage the 50 percent rule has

 8   is the advantages of incumbency.               In effect, it has been

 9   a case that has been litigated for more than two

10   decades.   And that has shown that, first, that it's

11   workable; and second, that it does not appear to have

12   left some gaping hole of section 2's coverage.               If it

13   had, Congress likely would have -- statute over the past

14   two decades.

15               And the other thing -- I'm sorry.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I won -- I'd hoped that

17   you could have a brief time to discuss your third

18   rationale because it's going to require determination of

19   how people would vote.

20               MR. JOSEFFER:          Under Gingles one typically

21   looks at what actually happened in the past.                The third

22   Gingles factor looks, for example, looks to whether

23   white bloc voting in actual elections has generally been

24   sufficient to prevent the election of minority group's

25   candidate of choice in the past.               So, it's a

 1   straightforward historic-based inquiry.

 2               Here, however, the state or local

 3   legislature at the outset looking to trade a new

 4   district based on the prediction that it will elect the

 5   minority group's candidate of choice.

 6               So, as a practical matter, you start with

 7   the racial makeup of some people and the political

 8   partisanship of others.        But you can't stop there,

 9   because you have to predict turnout by each group,

10   crossover voting by each group.

11               As a practical matter, those things will

12   vary based on who the candidates are, whether there is

13   an incumbent, whether the incumbent is the minority

14   group's candidate of choice.            And especially in local

15   elections, the -- may not even be available, which was a

16   point that was made in the topside amicus brief filed by

17   the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP Legal

18   Defense Fund and others.

19               If I could turn to the Constitutional --

20   point.   In that perspective, this proposal is really the

21   worst of all worlds, because the way you construct a

22   district is to take some people based on race, others

23   based on political party affiliation, and the race can't

24   dominate and the majority of courts have also held

25   purely partisan gerrymandering, at least -- aside is

 1   also unconstitutional.

 2              But this is both.                What you have is

 3   nationwide in every jurisdiction, every districting a

 4   mandate that requires consideration for both race and

 5   partisanship that goes far beyond what has traditionally

 6   been required under section 2 and I suspected far beyond

 7   what normally happens at the local level.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Do you have a view

 9   on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?

10              MR. JOSEFFER:             I think the easy way to cut

11   through is that a state Supreme Court respond and remand

12   all arguments other than the first Gingles factor.                  So,

13   the first Gingles factor, based on what happened in the

14   state Supreme Court is the only thing that is before the

15   Court.

16              What would remain potentially unremand is if

17   this Court were to would ban the traditional

18   understanding of the first Gingles factor and impose a

19   new understanding.      Then the adjudication of that might

20   be open on remand.      But Respondents have remanded

21   everything else in the state Supreme Court.

22              Finally, I also can't help but mention that

23   there is a great irony here in that Petitioners'

24   essential position is that back when race relations were

25   worse and back when there's much more racial bloc

 1   voting, minority-majority districts worked okay.

 2                 But now that race relations have improved

 3   and there is much more crossover voting, we should now

 4   require greater consideration of race as well as

 5   partisanship than had ever been done before under the

 6   same unamended statute.

 7                 And if I could turn -- Justice's -- at the

 8   outset, a state or local legislature as well as the

 9   court really doesn't know where to start.                 State and

10   local legislatures are the ones who are supposed to be

11   drawing these lines.        That means they need to be clear

12   administrable rules to follow.                And the simpler they

13   are, the better the chance we will have to do it, and if

14   they can figure it out at the outset, the less

15   consideration of race and partisanship becomes

16   necessary.

17                 And the 50 percent rule, as a practical

18   matter, has worked for a couple of decades in this

19   respect.     And if one goes beyond that, there is also no

20   principle stopping point.            Here's 39 percent, which

21   doesn't seem close to me or under Justice Breyer's

22   rationale --

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            You mention how well it

24   worked.    Did you see the graphs -- one of Amicus briefs

25   have the graph showing what the 50 percent rule did for

 1   one gerrymander and how the lesser percentage worked

 2   out -- remember which were much more -- not using the 50

 3   percent rule produced much more compact districts?

 4                 MR. JOSEFFER:          There are two things about

 5   the graphs.     The first is that less compact maps --

 6   those were the districts that would determine the

 7   unconstitutional.

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But they were designed to

 9   produce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so --

10   so grotesque.

11                 MR. JOSEFFER:          Right.        Another thing there

12   seems to be a common misconception that our view of

13   section 2 prohibits the drafting of crossover districts,

14   which is not case of all.

15                 The question here is what if it is required.

16   If a district -- if a jurisdiction wants to draw a

17   crossover district, then at least in principle nothing

18   is stopping it from doing so.               However, if what you were

19   to do was require the drawing these crossover districts,

20   that could create some funny maps of its own, because if

21   you have to reach out to grab jurisdiction wide, look at

22   every significant pocket of minority voters, look at

23   whatever you could put together that would vote alike,

24   which as a practical matter is the same political party,

25   then you are going to be requiring the same dynamics

 1   that led to those very strange maps in the -- in the

 2   first place.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you Mr.

 6   remaining.

 7        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. BROWNING:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10                Let me start first of all with

11   Justice Breyer's question about the arbitrary nature of

12   the 50 percent rule.      The 50 percent rule, let there be

13   no doubt, is extremely arbitrary, even under the

14   government's 2 percent cushion.

15                What would happen is you have a district

16   that is 40 percent -- 46 percent African American, that

17   district could be freely carved off into two districts

18   of 23 percent each, neither of which would provide an

19   equal opportunity to elect.            Even when you are in a

20   situation like this case, where the district is actually

21   functioning and has a proven ability to elect a minority

22   preferred candidate.      Moreover --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:         Wouldn't Justice Breyer's 40

24   percent rule be just as arbitrary?

25                MR. BROWNING:         Justice Alito, it is


                                       51

 1   important to recognize that there are significant

 2   districts that are out there that would not be protected

 3   under the 50 percent rule.            And I understand the Court's

 4   desire to have some sort of limitation on the size of

 5   the district.     We believe it is already in there, in

 6   place as a result of the LULAC decision.

 7                 It's in place because in North Carolina, as

 8   a practical matter, you can't go much below 40 percent

 9   and have a district that will actually work.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But this -- but yours is

11   below?   Just slightly below.

12                 MR. BROWNING:          The voting age population is

13   39.36 percent based upon the census data.                 The

14   government wants to use a 2 percent cushion as their

15   threshold.    But there is some significant problems with

16   that, because when you look at the overcount of white

17   voters, the Census Bureau recognizes the lower count is

18   basically 2 percent there in and of itself, then there

19   are some undercounted black voters is a 1 percent

20   undercount.    So even a 48 percent doesn't even get

21   anywhere close.

22                 Moreover, you have districts where there are

23   a number of eligible -- number of people that are

24   counted in the census that are not truly eligible to

25   vote.    That is reflected in the brief by the States at


                                         52
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   page 28 in footnote 2.        The States make the point that

 2   there are many districts where we have military bases,

 3   we have colleges that cause this to be an extremely

 4   arbitrary rule.

 5              And in North Carolina there are districts

 6   where once you remove the military base where most of

 7   the population will not be voting in that district,

 8   there is a shift of even 12 percent in the minority

 9   voting age population increasing by 12 percent once you

10   just remove the military bases from the equation.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:              The rule I suggested,

12   though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted,

13   more administrable -- or equally administrable or not

14   much worse administrable arbitrary rule.

15              MR. BROWNING:            Justice Breyer, in our view

16   the rule that should be applied is consistent with the

17   rule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially

18   larger than its coalition partner.

19              Here the minority group is 39.36 percent

20   African American.    It only requires an additional

21   roughly 11 percent white crossover voting.               So the white

22   crossover voting that is needed is only a third of the

23   size of the minority group.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:              There must be somebody

25   there to get you over 50 percent.

 1              MR. BROWNING:             I'm sorry?

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:               Thirty-three plus 11 is 44.

 3   So where does the rest come from?

 4              MR. BROWNING:             Your Honor, this district is

 5   39.36 percent African American.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:               That's 40, and then -- oh,

 7   I see, 39 plus 11.

 8              MR. BROWNING:             And you need 11 percent

 9   crossover voting, 11 percent of the electorate --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:               If they vote cohesively.

11              MR. BROWNING:             Yes, Your Honor.         Here the

12   minority group, the expert's testimony is that they do

13   vote cohesively.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But it's a necessary

15   predicate to his very question that the majority group,

16   the white group does not vote cohesively.                   Under your

17   hypothetical at least 11 percent have to swing over.

18              MR. BROWNING:             The -- the white vote does

19   not vote 100 percent cohesively.                 But it is still at

20   such high levels, there is only a limited amount of

21   crossover voting.     It is still very racially polarized.

22   And if district lines are not taken into account, the --

23   the votes of black voters in the district will be

24   drowned out by the white voters that are voting against

25   that minority candidate simply because that candidate is

 1   a minority.

 2                 There is some crossover voting, but not

 3   enough to make the -- for us to lose on the third

 4   Gingles prong.
