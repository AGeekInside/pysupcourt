 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   next in Case 05-1631, Scott versus Harris.

 5                 Mr. Savrin.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. SAVRIN:       Mr. Chief Justice, may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 This case concerns whether a police officer

11   could be held personally liable for using force to

12   terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit.                 The

13   undisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate

14   the Fourth Amendment.       Respondent had led the police

15   officers on a nine-mile pursuit at exceptionally high

16   speeds.   As the videotapes that have been admitted in

17   evidence show, Respondent was driving on narrow two-lane

18   roads at night.    He swerved across the double line to

19   pass cars that were in his path, actually traveling in

20   the wrong lane of travel.           He ran through a number of

21   red lights.    He weaved through a shopping center and

22   collided with Deputy Scott's vehicle.

23                 Deputy Scott at that point had tried to

24   block the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris

25   was successful in using his vehicle to escape.                  At that


                                         3

 1   point, he continued driving at exceptionally high

 2   speeds.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:               Can I ask this question

 4   about the shopping center.            Wouldn't your case be

 5   exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not

 6   occurred?

 7               MR. SAVRIN:          It would, Your Honor.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:               So that we really don't

 9   have to get distracted by the shopping center?

10               MR. SAVRIN:          There is a -- yes, Your Honor.

11   There is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy

12   Scott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or

13   vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a

14   material dispute.     We believe that the fact, the

15   undisputed fact, that Mr. Harris was driving at such

16   exceptionally high rate of speeds -- and to put in

17   context, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed,

18   and of course --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:               I'm not sure why you

20   concede that.     I mean, I looked at the case and it

21   seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of

22   wax.   And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part

23   affected by the fact that he went through the shopping

24   center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is

25   what Scott saw.

 1                MR. SAVRIN:       But Scott -- yes, Your Honor, I

 2   think that is part of the analysis.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            So how do I know whether,

 4   which of these things is directly or not indirectly --

 5   well, you go ahead.     But I mean, are you -- am I not

 6   supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping

 7   center?

 8                MR. SAVRIN:       Absolutely, Your Honor.           My

 9   point was that, the point was that there was a

10   collision, not who caused the collision, whether the

11   deputy pulled into Mr. Harris' line of travel or

12   Mr. Harris pulled towards the deputy.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is the rule that you

14   propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm

15   to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?

16                MR. SAVRIN:       Your Honor -- yes, essentially.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Your brief says that the

18   officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e.,

19   terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of

20   bodily injury or death.

21                MR. SAVRIN:       Yes, Your Honor.         And we

22   believe --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Greater than what?

24   Greater than --

25                MR. SAVRIN:       Greater than not taking action.

 1   In other words, that the harm --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Without reference to the

 3   possible harm to the driver?             I just want to know what

 4   you're testing.

 5                MR. SAVRIN:       I think that -- I think that is

 6   one of the factors to be considered.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't know that I agree

 8   with that.   I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an

 9   hour is responsible for endangering people, you're

10   proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent

11   chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50

12   percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop

13   him, you shouldn't do anything.              I don't agree with

14   that.

15                MR. SAVRIN:       Well, Your Honor --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'd stop him.   I mean, he's

17   the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment,

18   isn't he?

19                MR. SAVRIN:       Yes, Your Honor, I would agree

20   with that.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I think you're giving away

22   too much.

23                MR. SAVRIN:       One thing I did want to point

24   out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour -- and of

25   course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles


                                        6

 1   were at times traveling over 100 miles an hour --

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I didn't mean to put words

 3   in your mouth.   It seems to me your test might be

 4   whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not

 5   stopping him as to other people, without reference to

 6   the risk to himself.

 7              MR. SAVRIN:         Yes, that's probably a better

 8   articulation.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, it's your brief.   I

10   want you to --

11              MR. SAVRIN:         I think that's a better

12   articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the

13   way --

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, isn't the speed also

15   relevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a

16   car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?

17              MR. SAVRIN:         It would, Your Honor.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Isn't it a fair high

19   probability that if you hit someone at that speed that

20   there will be something, either death or serious injury

21   as a result?

22              MR. SAVRIN:         Your Honor, my answer to that

23   question would be that that's always going to be the

24   case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this

25   high rate of speed.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, I suppose there is

 2   also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an

 3   hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow

 4   line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt

 5   somebody else.

 6               MR. SAVRIN:          Yes, Your Honor.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:               I mean, the more you

 8   increase the speed the more likely he's going to be

 9   hurt.   But also the more likely if you let him go

10   somebody else is going to be hurt.

11               MR. SAVRIN:          Yes, Your Honor.           And to put it

12   in a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is

13   mathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But Mr. Savrin, there was

15   an episode in the parking lot where things came to a

16   temporary halt.     If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at

17   that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would

18   have slowed down.     If he was -- he was trying to flee

19   from the police, but if the police weren't after him

20   there is no indication that he would have been speeding.

21               MR. SAVRIN:          Well, Your Honor, I would

22   disagree with that, that in fact --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, he was

24   speeding before the police knew about him, right?

25   That's the whole, where this all started.

 1              MR. SAVRIN:        The initial offense was

 2   speeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or

 3   slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable

 4   person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly.

 5              We would contend that it was Mr. Harris that

 6   was in control of the force that the officers need to

 7   terminate, the risk that he presented.                 At any time, any

 8   time, Mr. Harris could have either slowed down his

 9   vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, do you contend that

11   an officer can always use deadly force to stop a

12   high-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?

13              MR. SAVRIN:        I think it depends on how you

14   define deadly force.     Of course, there can be different

15   --

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Running into him with a

17   high probability that he'll get killed.

18              MR. SAVRIN:        I think that, that would be the

19   case, as I indicated, whenever an officer uses force to

20   stop a vehicle at this speed.            I think there is -- if it

21   is deadly force, and of course this Court has not

22   articulated a test of that particular question --

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Wasn't that acknowledged

24   in the district court, in the trial court?

25              MR. SAVRIN:        In this case?

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes.

 2               MR. SAVRIN:       No, the district court found

 3   that it did not need to resolve whether or not -- -

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But the jury might find

 5   that it was deadly force.

 6               MR. SAVRIN:       The Eleventh Circuit found that

 7   the jury might conclude it was deadly force.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:           And do you conclude that

 9   the jury could not find that it was deadly force?

10               MR. SAVRIN:       I believe, again, Your Honor, I

11   believe that it depends on how broad the test is.                  The

12   Model Penal Code test, which most of the circuit

13   courts --

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, but is your --         is

15   it your view that a jury could not find on these facts

16   that there was deadly force?

17               MR. SAVRIN:       I believe, yes, under, under

18   the test as articulated in some of the circuits, yes,

19   this would not be deadly force.             Of course, what we're

20   saying is --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I thought we had a test

22   for deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there

23   is -- it's more likely than not, whether or not there is

24   a serious risk that death will ensue.                  That's the test,

25   Garner.

 1               MR. SAVRIN:        Your Honor, as I read the

 2   Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a

 3   definition of deadly force because shooting someone in

 4   the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly

 5   force.   The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the

 6   circuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that

 7   Garner did not create a test and have created different

 8   tests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach

 9   that definition.   But the point -- I was going to say a

10   point that I would like to make is that there are

11   degrees even within the continuum that might be within a

12   definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to

13   make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks,

14   using a firearm.   Those have different degrees of

15   potential lethality, so even if they are all considered

16   deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to

17   make.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:          What test, what of deadly

19   force would not be met here?

20               MR. SAVRIN:        A likelihood -- -

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          Considering that it's a

22   summary judgment issue.

23               MR. SAVRIN:        Yes, Your Honor.         I would say

24   that the Third Circuit decision in the Philadelphia

25   litigation case, where the officers dropped a bomb on a


                                       11

 1   building in order to gain access and they ended up

 2   killing 11 people.      The Court found that that was not

 3   deadly force because the officers were trying to gain

 4   access to the building and they reasonably believe that

 5   they were able to do that without the loss of life.                          I

 6   think that if that definition were applied to this case,

 7   then I think that this would not be deadly force.                       But I

 8   think --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Finish that.

10              MR. SAVRIN:           I'm sorry.               I keep interrupting

11   you.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Excuse me.           He reasonably

13   -- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump

14   the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking

15   the driver's life?      Is that why it's like the Third

16   Circuit case?

17              MR. SAVRIN:           Your Honor, his intent was to

18   end the pursuit, not to cause an accident.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, but the Third Circuit

20   case you just described didn't talk about intent.                       It

21   talked about reasonable belief.

22              MR. SAVRIN:           Well, let me cite another case

23   then, the Adams case from the Eleventh Circuit.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Before do you that, will

25   you go back to the Philadelphia case.                      Do you contend

 1   that a jury could find that he reasonably believed that

 2   he would not cause, that he would not raise a serious

 3   risk of death or serious bodily harm by bumping the car

 4   at 90 miles an hour?

 5                MR. SAVRIN:       Yes, Your Honor.            And if I --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I don't understand that.

 7   How could such a belief be reasonable?                  What am I

 8   missing here?

 9                MR. SAVRIN:       Let me cite the Court to the

10   Eleventh Circuit's own reasoning in the Adams case.                 And

11   that case involves a misdemeanant where the officer

12   intentionally made contact with the vehicle several

13   times.   The last contact caused the death of a

14   passenger.   The Eleventh Circuit found that Garner did

15   not apply to that situation and further said that a

16   policeman's use of his vehicle is very different from a

17   policeman's use of his gun.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:           That doesn't answer my

19   question.

20                MR. SAVRIN:       I'm sorry, Your Honor.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why, why would it be

22   reasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90

23   miles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of

24   death or serious bodily harm?             How could such a belief

25   be reasonable?

 1               MR. SAVRIN:        Because there are vehicle

 2   collisions every day, Your Honor, that do not end in

 3   death or serious bodily harm.

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Some people are lucky.

 5   We're talking about creating a substantial risk.              How

 6   would it be reasonable to assume that one would not

 7   create a substantial risk?

 8               MR. SAVRIN:        Your Honor, because Mr. Harris

 9   could have regained control of his vehicle.              The point

10   is that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited

11   options based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was

12   driving.   Even if this would be considered deadly force,

13   we do believe it would be justified under the

14   circumstances.

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, that's a different

16   issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the

17   case.   But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or

18   a reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to

19   me that's clearly a question for the jury.              I mean, we

20   might argue about it up here, but that's classic jury

21   question, isn't it?

22               MR. SAVRIN:        I believe in the context of the

23   Fourth Amendment and the Graham factors and the question

24   of probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a

25   jury question.   But I do concede that if it's not deadly

 1   force it's very close to it.             But I think the important

 2   thing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner

 3   used was limited by Mr. Harris' driving.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Savrin, one technique

 5   that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described

 6   as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb-

 7   sparing measure.    One oddity about this case is that he

 8   called and asked permission to use that less risky

 9   method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do

10   that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask

11   permission to do what he did do, which was

12   life-endangering.

13               MR. SAVRIN:         Your Honor, if I could respond

14   to that in two respects.          First, it is not, it is not

15   the case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called,

16   is safe.   What it does is spin the car out, and if

17   Mr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is

18   more likelihood that he would have lost control.             In

19   other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control.

20               The second response I would have is that the

21   Petitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and

22   the permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr.

23   Faninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use

24   force up to deadly force.           So Mr. --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Where is that?

 1                 MR. SAVRIN:       That's in Mark Faninger's

 2   deposition, and he is the supervisor that was ---

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And he said he gave

 4   permission for more than PIT procedure?

 5                 MR. SAVRIN:       Yes, Your Honor.         His testimony

 6   was that he was giving, he believes he was giving

 7   permission up to and including deadly force.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, the phrase used was

 9   "take him out," wasn't it?

10                 MR. SAVRIN:       Yes.       Yes, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Does a police officer have

12   any obligation in a situation like this to consider

13   other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives

14   might have been available to this officer?

15                 MR. SAVRIN:       Yes, Justice Stevens.         I think

16   the officer had very limited options, two options at

17   that point:    Either use force or let Mr. Harris go.             And

18   I think it was a balancing of --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           And even with letting him

20   go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up

21   ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to

22   catch him?

23                 MR. SAVRIN:       Yes, there always are other

24   potentials.    However, I would submit that a vehicle

25   traveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage

 1   in a very short period of time before the police

 2   officers can figure out what route he's going to take.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Isn't it true that there's

 4   no traffic on the road at that particular time?

 5              MR. SAVRIN:          Deputy Scott took the action

 6   that he did because there was a low likelihood of injury

 7   to third parties other than to Mr. Harris because there

 8   was no one in his immediate path of travel.

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, in that circumstance

10   why wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?

11              MR. SAVRIN:          Because there were -- the

12   videotape shows that Mr. Harris passed approximately 36

13   cars during this period of time.                12 seconds before the

14   contact was made, a vehicle was passed by Mr. Harris.

15   There was a high likelihood, in fact a probability, that

16   this case was going to end in tragedy, and Deputy Scott

17   took the action that he could.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Would that have been

19   likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?

20              MR. SAVRIN:          Whether he discontinued the

21   chase or not, Mr.    Harris could still injure whoever

22   might be around the next corner, Your Honor.

23              If there are no further questions, I'd like

24   to save my time for rebuttal.

 4            FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

 5                     SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 6                 MR. GARRE:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 7   and may it please the Court:

 8                 When a suspect disobeys a lawful command to

 9   stop, races off in a reckless attempt to elude the

10   police, and demonstrates a disregard for his own life

11   and the lives of others in his path, the police may use

12   force, including deadly force, to bring the suspect's

13   vehicle flight to a halt and protect the public safety.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does it matter

15   exactly what the nature of the escape was?                  Are we

16   supposed to evaluate whether this was reckless enough?

17   Well, let's say the driver did not go off 90 miles an

18   hour.   Let's say he obeyed the speed limit.                 He just

19   wasn't going to stop.       Does that make it a different

20   case?

21                 MR. GARRE:      It does, Your Honor.            The key

22   determination is whether the officer on the scene

23   reasonably determines that the vehicle poses a

24   substantial risk to other motorists or the police in his

25   way.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I would think that would

 2   apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?

 3                MR. GARRE:        I agree that it does, Justice

 4   Kennedy.   Here what you have is an individual who's

 5   going extraordinarily high speeds, 80 to 100 miles an

 6   hour.   An individual who has passed cars, crossed the

 7   double, double line; there were numerous motors, motor

 8   vehicles on the night.       And an individual who has ran

 9   red lights, an individual who when three police cars --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes.       But that was while

11   he was being chased, right?            Before being chased he

12   hadn't done any of this.         He was going 72 miles an hour

13   in a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.

14               MR. GARRE:       Well, that's true, Your Honor.

15   But as the Court said in the Sacramento versus Lewis

16   case, we don't blame police for the individual's

17   reckless flight in that context.               We don't blame police

18   that Respondent made a decision to just --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No but if you're thinking

20   of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the

21   chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back

22   to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?

23               MR. GARRE:       Not on this record, Justice

24   Stevens.   In this particular --

25               JUSTICE SC ALIA:            It would might also be

 1   reasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the

 2   police will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.

 3              MR. GARRE:       That's exactly right, Justice Sc

 4   alia.

 5              JUSTICE SC ALIA:            It doesn't seem to me a

 6   very good rule to give to police forces:                    Anybody who's

 7   going 72 miles an hour, let him go.                    Or at least if he

 8   hits 90, let him go.

 9              MR. GARRE:       We agree, Justice Scalia.                As

10   Justice Kennedy put it Sacramento versus Lewis, if

11   there's a real danger --

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:            There isn't a question.

13   There is a question of whether it justifies the use of

14   deadly force, to prevent this -- this situation.

15              MR. GARRE:       The question in our mind,

16   Justice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably

17   believed that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury

18   or death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police

19   on the roadway that night.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:            Why are these absolute?             I

21   mean I looked at Garner and then I looked at Graham and

22   Graham which came later said that all claims that

23   officers have used excessive force, deadly or not,

24   should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its

25   reasonableness standard.        So I guess-- isn't that right,


                                      20

 1   isn't that the law?

 2                 MR. GARRE:       We agree, Your Honor.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right, if that's the

 4   law, then whether -- of course an automobile could,

 5   could kill people.      Of course it can.                   So can a lot of

 6   things.   But an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on

 7   the highway is not a chase through a back yard, though

 8   both could end up with the person being chased dead.

 9                 So aren't we supposed to look at all the

10   circumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one

11   that interests me, one, is that the right standard?

12   Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this

13   person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was

14   he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing

15   away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record

16   could show?

17                 MR. GARRE:       Justice Breyer, to answer the

18   second question first, Scott did not know that he was

19   initially in a chase.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And a reasonable juror

21   could not conclude to the contrary?

22                 MR. GARRE:       Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's

23   testimony was that he did not know.                       What Scott knew,

24   and he was engaged in the chase, was this is an

25   individual who had crossed cars, crossed the double

 1   yellow line.     This was an individual who had ran red

 2   lights.     This was an individual, when three police squad

 3   cars converged on him in the shopping center parking

 4   lot, collided with them and ran off into the highway,

 5   reaching again speeds up to 90 miles an hour.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is it reasonable for

 7   him to suppose that there might be something more going

 8   on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a

 9   speeding ticket?     That presents he presents a danger to

10   the community quite apart from the driving?

11                 MR. GARRE:       Absolutely.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is that a factor

13   that goes into the analysis?

14                 MR. GARRE:       It is, certainly, at a

15   commonsense level.      Statistic show that most vehicles

16   who flee in this fashion, oftentimes there is alcohol or

17   drug abuse involved, oftentimes they are stolen

18   vehicles.     We don't think --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            What if they knew there

20   were drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had

21   got caught.     Would that justify this using deadly force?

22                 MR. GARRE:       I'm not sure that it would,

23   Justice Scalia -- uh, Justice Stevens.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm rather clear it would

25   not, isn't it?     Because that would be no more serious

 1   than the crime in Garner, would it?

 2                 MR. GARRE:      Well -- that's true.            The key,

 3   the key point about this case is the threat that

 4   Respondent posed in the -- suspects who engage in high

 5   speed vehicle chases pose to the public, and that is,

 6   that is fundamentally different from Garner for the

 7   reason that you mentioned.           Garner involved --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But your position would be

 9   the same even if Scott knew that the only reason they

10   were trying to stop him initially was the speeding

11   violation?

12                 MR. GARRE:      Yes.       It doesn't matter why the

13   chase began.    The point is that when Scott made the

14   decision to use force against Respondent, he reasonably

15   determined that Respondent posed a grave threat to other

16   motorists, the police and any bystanders who might come

17   in his way.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why, why wouldn't it

19   matter?   I mean, other things being equal, suppose that

20   he known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles

21   beyond the speed limit.         And Scott knew the whole thing

22   or Scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is

23   a young kid who is frightened and he has his license

24   number and he could get him later.                  I mean, why wouldn't

 1   when all, that's all that's at stake?

 2              MR. GARRE:          Because, Your Honor, regardless

 3   of the reason the chase began, at the moment that Deputy

 4   Scott used the force, this car posed a serious risk to

 5   everyone else on the road that night.                     Someone traveling

 6   90 miles an hour, up to 90 miles an hour, on a two-lane

 7   windy road with numerous cars passing during this course

 8   of the chase, it was that threat that Deputy Scott acted

 9   against when he used that force, and that was a

10   reasonable use of force.           It's reasonable regardless of

11   whether or not this Court determines --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                How do you deal with the

13   Brower case?   That it was a 193 -- 83 action against the

14   police for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder.

15   And the Court said that the roadblock was enough to give

16   rise to a 1983 claim?

17              MR. GARRE:          Justice Ginsburg, the holding in

18   that case was that a roadblock amounted to a seizure.

19   And we don't, no one disputes there was a seizure in

20   this case when Deputy Scott intentionally used force to

21   put Respondents off the road.               So it respect, Brower

22   doesn't speak to the question in this case, which is

23   whether or not that use of force was reasonable under

24   the circumstances.

 1   Lewis case, in his concurring opinion, say that there

 2   was a real danger of adopting a constitutional rule that

 3   suspects are free to disobey lawful commands.

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I just make this one

 5   point?   Is it correct that the issue is whether it's

 6   reasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it

 7   unreasonable?

 8                MR. GARRE:        Well, the -- ultimately to

 9   determine whether this decision could be made at the

10   summary judgment stage you would have to consider

11   whether a jury could find it unreasonable.                   Here, on the

12   relevant undisputed facts, we submit as a matter of law,

13   Deputy Scott reasonably believed that this force was

14   necessary under the circumstances.

15                And the final point that I wanted to make,

16   going back to Justice Kennedy's concurrence, is that

17   there is a real danger in adopting that kind of

18   constitutional rule, that it will encourage more

19   suspects to flee, and will only increase the danger to

20   the public and to police and to motorists in these high

21   speed chases.     I would urge this Court to reverse the

22   decision below.     If there are no further questions --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

 1               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES,

 2                    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 3               MR. JONES:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 4   please the Court.

 5               I'd like to begin by responding to some of

 6   the questions that were asked of Petitioner.                  First of

 7   all, Officer Scott himself admitted in his testimony

 8   that he knew at the time that he was using deadly force,

 9   and he realized at the time that he was likely to cause

10   injury or -- death or serious injury to Mr. Harris.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is there any doubt

12   that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious

13   injury to the other cars on the highway that he was

14   passing?

15               MR. JONES:        Mr. Harris was simply a -- an

16   unsafe driver.   There is always a risk at driving in

17   excess of speed limit, driving in violation of traffic

18   laws.   But that risk in and of itself is not --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We are not talking

20   about driving in violation of traffic laws.                  We talking

21   about 90 miles an hour on a two-lane highway, swerving

22   past cars in the incoming traffic --

23               MR. JONES:        Well, we're talking --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Hitting -- after

25   hitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on.                  That's a

 1   little more than just unsafe.

 2               MR. JONES:         Well, those are not the facts

 3   before the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.                      The facts are that

 4   he was driving fast but he was under control.                      He only

 5   crossed the center line to pass and when he passed, he

 6   used his turn signal when he passed.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              He used the turning

 8   signal.   That's like the strangler who observes the no

 9   smoking sign.

10               (Laughter.)

11               MR. JONES:         When he turned into the -- when

12   he turned into the shopping center he wasn't weaving

13   through a parking lot.         He was going through a private

14   access road in a shopping mall which was closed at 11

15   o'clock at night.     And the collision, the impact

16   occurred when Officer Scott, who was going too fast to

17   make the turn into the shopping center, went up to the

18   next intersection, came around the other way to head my

19   client off at the pass.          And then what happened was that

20   Mr. Harris took evasive action to a avoid collision when

21   Mr. Harris -- excuse me when Officer Scott -- put

22   himself right in Mr. Harris' way.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:            Mr. Jones, I looked at the

24   videotape on this.      It seemed to me that he created a

25   tremendous risk of drivers on that road.                     Is that an

 1   unreasonable way of looking at the -- at this tape?

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:              He created the scariest

 3   chase I ever saw since "The French Connection."

 4              (Laughter.)

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:              It is frightening.

 6              MR. JONES:         As a --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:              A frightening amount of

 8   speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at

 9   night, on a two-lane windy road --

10              MR. JONES:         Well, as the Court below found,

11   and as the tape indicates, Mr. Harris didn't run anybody

12   off the road.    He didn't ram anybody.                  He didn't try to

13   ram anybody.    He was just driving away.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:              The question was whether he

15   was creating a substantial risk doing that.

16              MR. JONES:         He was creating --

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:              And my, my question is how

18   could a jury find otherwise?             Your answer up to this

19   point is that well, he used signal lights and his

20   reflexes were good, and they sure were.                    But the

21   question is whether he was creating a substantial risk

22   of death or serious bodily harm to others.                    And my

23   question is leaving -- assuming that his reflexes were

24   good and he knew how to use the signal lights, how could

25   the jury fail to find that he was creating such a risk?

 1               MR. JONES:         Well, the jury could certainly

 2   find he's creating a risk.            But with regard to the other

 3   Garner factors that must be shown before deadly force

 4   can be used, he had not committed a violent felony, a

 5   crime involving the infliction or threat of infliction

 6   --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Garner was not talking

 8   about someone who at the time the deadly force was used

 9   was himself creating a substantial risk of death or

10   serious bodily harm to others.                That's what we are

11   dealing with here.      And the reasonableness of the

12   officer's action depends on whether, at the summary

13   judgment stage, a jury can reasonably find that, in

14   fact, he was not creating at that moment, a substantial

15   risk of serious bodily harm or death to others.                And my

16   question is, how could a jury find anything else?

17               MR. JONES:         Well, a jury could find that the

18   pursuit by the officer escalated the risk rather than

19   diminishing the risk to others.                And that given a choice

20   between using deadly force to terminate a pursuit where

21   the officer himself had escalated the risk versus

22   backing off, letting the offender escape and then

23   perhaps arresting him an hour later at the house.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:              Did Scott, know that?     Did

25   Scott --   Do you have evidence to show that Scott knew

 1   that the underlying offense was a speeding violation?

 2               MR. JONES:      We have evidence that it was

 3   called out on the radio.        "I'm pursuing somebody."

 4   Whether Scott knew we don't know.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:           And Scott has testified he

 6   didn't know it.

 7               MR. JONES:      Scott has testified he --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, do you think you can

 9   get to the jury on the question of whether he knew it.

10               MR. JONES:      Scott --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:           I'd like a yes or no

12   answer.

13               MR. JONES:      The testimony --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:           That doesn't sound like yes

15   or no.

16               MR. JONES:      I'm not certain I understand the

17   question.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:           The question is, can you

19   get to the jury on the question of whether Scott knew

20   that the underlying offense was for speeding?

21               MR. JONES:      Scott did not know that was it.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       If Scott didn't

23   know it, I mean, my goodness, then I don't see the

24   relevance of whether it was speeding or not.                And I was

25   with you when I read the -- the opinion of the court


                                      30

 1   below.     And I read the other brief.                    I was on the other

 2   side.    Then I've been shifting back and forth.                     Then I

 3   look at that tape, and I have to say that when I looked

 4   at the tape, my reaction was somewhat similar to Justice

 5   Alito's.     And so if it's doubtful and then you can't

 6   even show that the person who did it knew that this was

 7   for speeding rather than for murder, how can you get to

 8   the jury?

 9                 MR. JONES:       Well, there is certainly a

10   credibility issue as to whether Scott says he knew or

11   didn't know.    I mean, certainly the call on the radio he

12   could have acquired.        The thing is that --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, as the Chief Justice

14   indicated through a question earlier, isn't it

15   reasonable for an officer to assume that it is -- he is

16   trying to escape because there is something more serious

17   than speeding at stake?          I mean, that's the assumption I

18   would draw.

19                 MR. JONES:       That assumption would not be

20   based upon probability or based upon police training.

21   Officers in pursuit situations are trying to believe --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You mean just as many

23   people take off in high speed chases for speeding as for

24   serious crimes?

25                 MR. JONES:       The vast majority have committed

 1   minor crimes.   And it's not a rational --

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But at the moment Scott

 3   came into this case, what difference does that make?

 4   Why is that even relevant?          Let's assume Scott knew that

 5   this entire situation had eventuated out of an 18 mile

 6   in excess of speed act by the individual.               Assume that.

 7                What Scott also knew at the point at which

 8   he joined the chase was that this individual was driving

 9   a car at 90 miles an hour.          He was crossing yellow

10   lines, going through red lights, et cetera.              At that

11   point, wasn't the only legally relevant data whether or

12   not Harris was creating the risk of death or bodily harm

13   to others?

14                MR. JONES:      That's the issue.          Was there an

15   immediate risk of death or serious bodily harm --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So you agree that whether

17   Scott knew or didn't know, that this whole scenario had

18   eventuated out of a speeding situation was irrelevant?

19                MR. JONES:      It's not relevant.         It's

20   relevant to that termination.             Yeah, the issue is, is

21   there an immediate risk.         But one of the factors that is

22   significant is what is the severity of the underlying

23   crime.   And if it is a crime of violence, then certainly

24   the officer is entitled to presume --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           That's exactly where I


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   started.     And I wondered -- that's what I'm uncertain

 2   about the standard for this.              Because as you and the

 3   others have been arguing, if the question is one about

 4   rules surrounding the use of deadly force.                But then

 5   when I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed

 6   to me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's

 7   not the standard.     Graham is a standard of simple

 8   reasonableness and Garner is simply an illustration of

 9   that as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as

10   applied to cars which threaten other people much more.

11                 MR. JONES:       Well, that's a good question.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, what is the standard?

13   Am I supposed to apply -- am I not supposed to apply

14   Graham?

15                 MR. JONES:       Well, whether you apply Garner

16   or Graham, the result is the same in this case.               And let

17   me explain why.    What Graham did is it expanded the

18   Garner rule, which you can't use deadly force to stop a

19   fleeing suspect who is merely fleeing, expanded that to

20   include the entire range of use of force, deadly or

21   nondeadly.

22                 And with regard to the factors that are to

23   be considered in determining whether the use of force is

24   reasonable under Graham, the balance with respect to a

25   fleeing suspect who is subjected to deadly force was


                                         33

 1   already drawn by Garner.           Garner created a bright light

 2   rule.     Graham extended that to an ad hoc balancing test

 3   with all use of force applications.                       But with respect to

 4   deadly force and a fleeing suspect, Garner still

 5   provides a bright line rule.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So you're saying I cannot

 7   do the following under the law, which would seem to be

 8   contrary to common sense, to say there is a big

 9   difference between a policeman shooting a person who is

10   running away and threatens no harm to others, and a

11   policeman using a gun -- using a car on a highway to try

12   to get a person to stop who is threatening others.                      I

13   have to treat those exactly as if they were the same

14   thing.

15                 MR. JONES:       Yes.       And Garner, this Court's

16   decision in Garner and this Court's decision in Brower,

17   which was written by Justice Scalia, basically to quote

18   Brower in both cases.        In the Brower versus County of

19   Inyo --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The Eleventh Circuit

21   gave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which

22   if you're looking at what the -- was clearly established

23   law from the point of view of the officer that provides

24   him guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a

25   result in the use of deadly force in the police chase

 1   case involving an automobile.

 2                MR. JONES:      Well, the holding of the Adams

 3   versus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an

 4   incident which occurred six weeks after the Garner

 5   decision and four years before the Brower decision,

 6   there is no way the officers could have known at that

 7   time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent

 8   an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been

 9   considered deadly force in violation of the Fourth

10   Amendment.   As the dissent pointed out in the, in the

11   Adams case, though, certainly as of the Court's decision

12   in 1993, this was now clearly established.                 You had

13   Brower saying that it's a seizure, and then you had this

14   Court saying that now the law was clearly established

15   where it wasn't before --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So when Officer

17   Scott was trying to figure out what the law was, he

18   should have relied on the dissent in the case?

19                MR. JONES:      Well, another case came about

20   later which held that as early as 1998 in another case

21   involving the same department, that there was clearly

22   established law.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Was there any case at the

24   time of the action in this case, any decision that said

25   ramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the

 1   Fourth Amendment?

 2                MR. JONES:       Brower versus County of Inyo

 3   says --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Brower was a roadblock

 5   case.

 6                MR. JONES:       It was a roadblock which

 7   produced a collision, a physical impact between

 8   vehicles.    And that was the -- that was the distinction

 9   which Justice Scalia latched onto in that case, and said

10   that the mere fact that the person was fleeing by car in

11   Brower was no different than the burglar fleeing by foot

12   in Garner.   Either one of them --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But the issue in the case

14   was quite simply whether there had been a seizure.

15   Isn't that the issue?

16                MR. JONES:       That was the first holding.                The

17   second holding was that the Plaintiff had sufficiently

18   claimed a cause of action on the seizure.                  And then it

19   went back to the lower court to be considered under the

20   Garner analysis.    And what I liked about your decision

21   -- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Go ahead.   Finish

23   your --

24                MR. JONES:       What I liked about your decision

25   in that case, Justice Scalia, was that you said that the

 1   officer's culpability for using excessive force is not

 2   diminished by the fact that perpetrator chose to

 3   continue running, whether it was the fleeing burglar in

 4   Garner or the fleeing driver in Brower.                   Excuse me,

 5   Mr. Chief Justice.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If I could just get

 7   back to an earlier point.            You think what the officer

 8   should have done in this case was to let Mr. Harris go.

 9              MR. JONES:          That was one option.            He could

10   have continued the pursuit and simply decided not to mow

11   him off the road at 90 miles an hour, or he could have

12   stopped a pursuit and let him go which often happens in

13   many pursuits.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Even though he

15   doesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to

16   arrest him later.     He doesn't know if it's a stolen car

17   or not.

18              MR. JONES:          That's correct.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And he doesn't know

20   why he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or

21   terrorism or anything else.

22              MR. JONES:          Well, that's correct.            But in

23   the majority of cases -- and this is the only testimony

24   in this record, Your Honors.              Our experts testified on a

25   study -- based on a study which was commissioned for him

 1   by the Department of Justice, a study which has been

 2   cited by some of the amicus briefs on both sides in this

 3   case, Dr. Albert testified that 70 percent of the time,

 4   when police back off pursuit, the perpetrator stops

 5   running and they resume safe driving.                     And when the car

 6   is stolen, most of the time --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Once they have

 8   gotten away, I assume.

 9                 MR. JONES:       Well, sometimes you have to let

10   them get away.     In Garner, it says, even if the guy has

11   just broken into somebody's house in the middle of the

12   night and committed a felony, if the choice is letting

13   them go or using deadly force when the factors

14   authorizing deadly force are not present, you have to

15   let him go.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not if he is shooting his

17   way out of the house and endangering other people.

18                 MR. JONES:       That's correct.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, that's a factor

20   here, of course.     If he has taken the jewelry and he's

21   gone off into the night, if shooting at him might

22   endanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to

23   let him go.    I'm talking about a burglar who is, you

24   know, who is shooting as he leaves.

25                 MR. JONES:       You can shoot him.             I'd be there

 1   shooting him, too.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Of course you can shoot

 3   him.

 4               MR. JONES:         Let me take that distinction and

 5   apply it to the vehicle, Justice Scalia.                   What we have

 6   to have to authorize deadly force in this context is

 7   something more than just unsafe flight.                   You've got to

 8   have someone who is behaving violently, who is menacing

 9   people, trying to ram people.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Can you tell me as of the

11   time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he

12   committed any felonies?

13               MR. JONES:         No.       All he had done was taken

14   evasive action to avoid an officer who --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              90 miles an hour would not

16   be a felony, not a reckless driving?

17               MR. JONES:         Are you talking about the

18   traffic pursuit?

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Yes.

20               MR. JONES:         No, none of those are felonies

21   under Georgia law.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              At no point did he commit

23   a felony?

24               MR. JONES:         No, Your Honor.            It's not even a

25   felony in Georgia.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But he certainly

 2   committed a lot of --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If he had intended to hit

 4   the police officer, was it --

 5                MR. JONES:       If he had intended to hit the

 6   police officer, if that was shown by the evidence, so

 7   they could have charged with aggravated assault.                     They

 8   didn't do that.    They left traffic citations in his

 9   hospital room.    They never arrested him.                   They never

10   prosecuted him.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The key point is that he

12   is endangering the lives and safety of others.                     Anyone

13   who has watched that tape has got to come to that

14   conclusion, looking at the road and the way that this

15   car was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite

16   direction.   This was a situation fraught with danger.

17                MR. JONES:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, I hope I

18   don't have you on my jury if that's -- but what the

19   trial court found was that construing the facts in a

20   light most favorable to the Plaintiff as a nonmoving

21   party, that reasonable jurors can find that this was

22   simply a person who was driving fast.                    This was not a

23   person who was driving assaultively.                     He wasn't driving

24   violently.   He wasn't a threat to anyone that would

25   authorize the use of deadly force against him.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that a factual finding

 2   of the, of the trial court here?

 3               MR. JONES:       That is a factual finding.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are we bound by that fact?

 5               MR. JONES:       We are bound by that.          This is

 6   an interlocutory appeal, this an interlocutory appeal

 7   under Mitchell v. Forsythe, and the Court is bound by

 8   its own ruling to accept the facts as found by the court

 9   below, and decide the narrow issue of law here which is,

10   one, is there a constitutional violation on these facts.

11   And two, was the law clearly established.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Even if having watched the

13   tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be

14   accurate?

15               MR. JONES:       If you want to repeal Johnson v.

16   Jones and Mitchell v. Forsythe, then yes.               This is the

17   Supreme Court.   You can make that determination.

18               But based upon the prior rulings of this

19   Court, this Court is bound to accept the findings of

20   fact of the courts below, and then to determine solely

21   the legal issue on an interlocutory basis.               The bottom

22   line issue here, Your Honors, is whether the fact that

23   someone is driving in violation of traffic laws in and

24   of itself can be justification for the use of deadly

25   force.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:             I don't see how -- I mean,

 2   you know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see

 3   how that's the issue.       Because you say we have to assume

 4   that the Defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all

 5   that was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.

 6               MR. JONES:        Well, I'm not talking about the

 7   underlying violation here.           I'm talking about the

 8   conduct observed by the officer who made the decision to

 9   use deadly force.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             That conduct -- it could be

11   conduct -- you could say exactly your same question,

12   just as the Chief just said.             I mean, I don't know how

13   to get around this.      You could say the question was,

14   does a person who reasonably thinks he might be being

15   pursued for a murder --

16               MR. JONES:        This is the issue.         This is the

17   issue.   If what this person is doing is driving, say

18   driving unsafely, but they are not driving violently,

19   they are not driving aggressively, they are not menacing

20   anyone on the road.      They are simply driving fast trying

21   to get away, that in and of itself, is that going to be

22   justification for the use of deadly force or is

23   something more going to be required?

24               JUSTICE ALITO:           When someone is fleeing and

25   creating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's

 1   the case, creating a very danger for other drivers on

 2   the road, when in your view is it reasonable for the

 3   police to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to

 4   breaking off the chase?         What, what is the test.

 5              MR. JONES:         Well, under Garner the test is

 6   they have to be threatening violence or inflicting

 7   violence against someone.           There have to be no other

 8   alternatives other than deadly force available to effect

 9   the apprehension.    And assuming there is justification

10   for deadly force, then there is a duty to give a warning

11   where feasible before using deadly force.                    And the court

12   below felt none of those three factors --

13              JUSTICE ALITO:            How could you possibly give

14   a warning in this situation?

15              MR. JONES:         It's academic in this case,

16   because the first two factors were not met.                    I mean,

17   it's our position that you don't worry about giving a

18   warning unless you have the right to use deadly force,

19   and if you don't get to that point then it's -- it's a

20   moot question.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Why wasn't there warning?

22   There were lights, there were sirens.                    Surely the

23   defendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.

24              MR. JONES:         There was certainly warning that

25   he needed -- that he was expected to pull over.                       There

 1   was no warning of any intent to use deadly force.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             What am I -- you said

 3   factually.   What am I supposed to assume?                     You said in

 4   light of -- I mean, I looked at the tape and that tape

 5   shows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving

 6   around automobiles that are coming in the opposite

 7   direction with their lights on, goes through a red light

 8   where there are several cars that are right there,

 9   weaves around them, and there are cars coming the other

10   way, weaves back, goes down the road.

11                Now, what in fact -- am I supposed to

12   pretend I haven't seen that?              What am I supposed to

13   pretend to here?

14                MR. JONES:        Well, I didn't see that.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:             You didn't see that?

16                MR. JONES:        I --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             You didn't -- I thought

18   that -- you didn't see that?

19                MR. JONES:        Well, the point is most people

20   use the word weaving to describe the motion of

21   Mr. Harris's car is when they are going through the, the

22   shopping center --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no.          I -- what I saw is

24   he is driving down one lane, what I mean by weaving, and

25   this lane goes with me in traffic.                   And there is some

 1   cars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where

 2   the cars are now coming right directly at him.                  And then

 3   before they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and

 4   he does this while going through a red light, it seemed

 5   to me.

 6                 Am I -- did I mis-see that?                 I'll go look at

 7   it again if you --

12   were found by the court below in this --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well that's, that's what I

14   wonder.   If the court says that isn't what happened, and

15   I see with my eyes that is what happened, what am I

16   supposed to do?

20                 (Laughter.)

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Under, under -- under your

22   rule, what you're concerned with is the bumping, the use

23   of the force.     Under your rule, if the police continue

24   the chase without using the, without trying to ram him,

25   and then there is an accident and innocent people are

 1   killed, or injured, I assume that under the tort laws of

 2   most states, the police could be liable.

 3                MR. JONES:      Well in theory perhaps they

 4   could be if the officer was a joint proximate cause of

 5   the accident, but in most states --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, aren't they the

 7   proximate cause if they continue the chase without

 8   trying to terminate it?

 9                MR. JONES:      That's correct.             If the officer

10   terminates the chase then he is never going to be liable

11   because number one he is acting prudently; he is going

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No.      No.    Well, I meant

15   terminate the chase by -- by -- by forcing him off the

16   road.

17                MR. JONES:      Well, if he terminates the chase

18   using deadly force, that that creates a whole host of

19   other problems.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But isn't there -- but

21   isn't that one way to assure that the police are not

22   liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal

23   standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?

24                MR. JONES:      Now from a constitutional

25   standpoint the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect other

 1   people.   It protects those who have been seized.               And

 2   that's, that's the framework we are dealing with here

 3   today.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, you mean it's

 5   irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might

 6   injure other people?

 7               MR. JONES:       The potential for danger to

 8   others is certainly part of the justification for deadly

 9   force, just as, if deadly force cannot be used

10   endangering other people, then that certainly goes into

11   the matrix, too.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Jones, could I --

13               MR. JONES:       Yeah.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Could I ask whether the

15   portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he

16   was not endangering anybody is this portion?                The court

17   is mindful that traffic laws are designed to -- safely

18   -- and Harris acted in an unsafe manner.                However, the

19   record reflects" -- - is this the portion?

20               MR. JONES:       Yes.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- "that he maintained

22   control over his vehicle."          Well, that doesn't prove

23   he's not endangering anybody.             "Used his turn signals"

24   -- wonderful.

25               (Laughter.)

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           "And did not endanger any

 2   particular motorist on the road."               I think that's true.

 3   In that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting

 4   any particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a

 5   finding that he was not endangering anybody.               "Any

 6   particular motorist," but he was endangering the public

 7   at large.

 8               MR. JONES:      Well, this is my point is that

 9   if, if the drive --if the hazard caused by driving in

10   and of itself is the only threat here, does that rise to

11   a level of imminency and immediacy that justifies the

12   use of deadly force?     If it does, then any officer who

13   perceives that someone is driving unsafely and that they

14   may cause an accident to someone who may or may not be

15   down the road if not stopped, would be justified in

16   using deadly force, to literally take out anyone who is

17   speeding.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It depends on how fast --

19   if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a

20   two-lane road or four-lane divided highway.              All those

21   factors come into, into account.              And it doesn't seem to

22   me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will

23   discourage police officers.           There's, there's enough

24   disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the

25   fact that the police officer may hurt himself.              It's


                                      48

 1   pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't

 2   you think?   I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.

 3                MR. JONES:      Well that's --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I would have let the guy

 5   go.

 6                MR. JONES:      Now what he, if he --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Driving 90 miles an hour

 8   and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved.

 9   Scott could have been killed, couldn't he?

10                MR. JONES:      Absolutely.                Or because he's

11   also --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So I don't think we need a

13   whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in

14   engaging in frolicsome conduct.

15                MR. JONES:      Well, not only that, Justice

16   Scalia.   The officer had no control over what was going

17   to happen once he used deadly force, like the officer

18   who fired into the cab of a flying vehicle in Barn v

19   Cox, once you disable the driver the car keeps going.

20   And in this case, when you -- when you hit the vehicle

21   and knock a vehicle that has been in control and make it

22   out of control, then it's now an unguided missile that

23   could just as easily cross the center line and hit an

24   innocent person.

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me just ask this


                                       49

 1   question.   In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to

 2   innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy

 3   driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming

 4   that the chase will continue?             Or do we measure it by

 5   assuming that the chase would be discontinued?

 6               MR. JONES:       The officer --

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Just as we did in Garner?

 8               MR. JONES:       The officer has both options.            I

 9   mean Garner simply commands that he not use deadly force

10   if it's a choice between letting him go and using deadly

11   force.   Now in the Sacramento v Lewis case, it does say

12   that involves a different, a different type of claim and

13   a different standard.      But in the Sacramento case it

14   does say that an officer in a pursuit has a duty to

15   always be weighing the risk of the continued pursuit

16   against the risk to the public.              So there is an

17   independent duty there to act reasonably.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If it were -- clear that a

19   jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk

20   to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase --

21   assume that's a possible finding.                If that were true,

22   would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?

23               MR. JONES:       Not under the Fourth Amendment.

24   Now, the -- the only expert testimony in this record on

25   that subject says there is a 7 percent chance --

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:               You're saying there is a

 2   duty not to use deadly force.

 3              MR. JONES:          That's what Garner says, if you

 4   don't use deadly force.          And that's what our claim is.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And aren't you

 6   concerned that that creates an incentive in every case

 7   for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to

 8   know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the

 9   police are going to have to give up eventually?

10              MR. JONES:          Well, let me respond by reading

11   a portion of Garner that deals with that point,

12   Mr. Chief Justice.      These, these same important policy

13   reasons were raised in Garner, that we don't want to

14   encourage disobedience of issues.                  We want to discourage

15   people from fleeing.        And this is what the Garner Court

16   said --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, Garner --

18   Garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the

19   back, right?

20              MR. JONES:          Yes.       He might easily break into

21   someone else's house and perhaps end up killing them.

22   This was a vigorous dissent in Garner.                    But this is what

23   the majority said:      "Without in any way disparaging the

24   importance of these goals we are not convinced that the

25   use of deadly force is a sufficiently productive means

 1   of accomplishing them to justify the killing of

 2   nonviolent suspects."

 3                And if unsafe driving --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But your, your answer to

 5   Justice Stevens as I understand it was the police not

 6   have the duty to discontinue the chase?                   The obverse of

 7   that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e.,

 8   prolong the injury to the public.                 I'm surprised at your

 9   answer.

10                MR. JONES:       Well, I think there is an

11   independent duty, it doesn't rise under the Fourth

12   Amendment, but there is an independent duty to do that.

13   But my concern is that under Garner, given a choice

14   between --

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It is certainly the case

16   that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to

17   innocent third parties, there would be a duty to

18   discontinue the chase rather kill him.                   But you don't

19   seem to buy that.

20                MR. JONES:       Well, experience shows most of

21   the time when you discontinue a chase, the person who is

22   running discontinues driving unsafely.                   That is the --

23   that is experience.      This officer's own policy says that

24   --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did this study show what

 1   future fleeing speeders would do?

 2                I mean, I will accept that for, for the sake

 3   of argument that -- in fact, it's probably true.                  I

 4   would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing,

 5   you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore.                  But did this

 6   study show what the effect of a rule that says stop

 7   chasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule

 8   would be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or

 9   fleeing anybody?

10                MR. JONES:      Well, the rule simply says you

11   don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely.                    And

12   if, it simply says that if the choice is between killing

13   him and letting him go, you have to let him go if the

14   Garner factors aren't present.              And we find nothing in

15   the law and no reason to create a new exception in the

16   law that says that Garner doesn't apply if you're

17   fleeing by vehicle.

18                Thank you.      We ask that the Court of Appeals

19   be affirmed.

 1                 Let me refocus for a moment that in order

 2   for the officer to be denied qualified immunity in this

 3   context a jury would have to be able to find two things.

 4   One, that no -- that there was no probable cause, and

 5   second, that that was clearly established.                      And I think

 6   that the discussion this morning if nothing else shows

 7   that it's not clearly established.

 8                 As far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned,

 9   I think the measure needs to be exactly as this Court

10   stated in Graham versus Connor, which is looking at the

11   facts from the standpoint of the officer on the scene,

12   because after all, he has to make split-second

13   decisions.     He does not have the benefit of taking

14   depositions of Mr. Harris --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What am I supposed to do?

16   I mean, I'll look again at the tape.                      I certainly will

17   do that.     But suppose I look at the tape and I end up

18   with Chico Marx's old question with respect to the Court

19   of Appeals:     Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?

20                 MR. SAVRIN:        Your Honor, I think the answer

21   to that question was provided in this decision in

22   Ornelas versus United States, a decision by this Court

23   in 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a

24   direct criminal appeal involving the question of

25   probable cause.     And this Court set forth very clearly


                                         54
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that the historical facts are given deference.                The

 2   question of, a legal question about whether those facts

 3   reasonably give rise to probable cause is an independent

 4   de novo review.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Whether he is endangering

 6   anybody is a historical fact, no?                So what do you do

 7   about that finding?

 8              MR. SAVRIN:         I don't believe that is

 9   historical fact.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:             It is.

11              MR. SAVRIN:         The historical facts here are

12   whether Mr. Harris was driving excessively, whether he

13   was driving across the line, whether he was driving at

14   high rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his

15   path, whether he had collided with anyone.               I think the

16   question about whether or not those facts give rise to

17   probable cause to believe that Harris was a threat of

18   serious physical harm is a legal issue, and I think the

19   Court of Appeals recognized that in this case when they

20   applied a different analysis or came out with a

21   different result to those same undisputed facts.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What is the, the court

23   saying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition

24   appendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers

25   and when there, when there were no other motorists or


                                       55

 1   pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's

 2   assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed

 3   an immediate threat of harm to others.

 4                This is a finding that there were no other

 5   motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming

 6   occurred.

 7                MR. SAVRIN:        And that is a fact that we

 8   accept as true in the immediate vicinity.                  The tape

 9   shows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before,

10   and I think that a reasonable officer at the time would

11   believe that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on

12   that road.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I would hope he would wait

14   until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming

15   before he, before he did the ramming.

16                MR. SAVRIN:        Yes, Your Honor.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I assume he waited

18   precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?

19                MR. SAVRIN:        Yes, Your Honor.           Exactly.     He

20   had limited options and I believe it was a no-win

21   scenario.    And he took the best course that he

22   reasonably believed he could at the time.                  And --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you agree with

24   Mr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct

25   rose to the level of a felony?

 1                 MR. SAVRIN:       I would not, Your Honor.              In

 2   our brief we did list a number of felonies that

 3   Mr. Harris, that we believe he committed.                     But I would

 4   go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect

 5   would have been a different case.                 And Garner also says

 6   that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more

 7   dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime.

 8   So I think the question should not be whether it's a

 9   technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to

10   felony, but the harm that is being caused by the

11   continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this

12   case.

13                 And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's

14   question about what to do in terms of responding to

15   Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that

16   you would review it for clear error.                     And in this case

17   you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the

18   lower court.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

20   Mr. Savrin.    The case is submitted.
