 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  MR. McCONNELL:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11                  This Court has consistently rejected the

12   argument that Federal statutes that both create a right

13   to sue and also bar waiver of rights under the statute

14   are sufficiently explicit to override the strong Federal

15   policy in favor of arbitrability expressed in the

16   Federal Arbitration Act.        In two of those cases, Gilmer

17   and Pyett, the Court construed a statute the relevant

18   language of which is virtually indistinguishable from

19   that and the Credit Repair Organizations Act that we

20   have before us today.

21                  Those cases involve the ADEA.             Both the ADEA

22   and CROA, as I'll call it, create a cause of action for

23   aggrieved parties to bring actions for damages.                And

24   both statutes explicitly bar waiver of, quote, "any

25   right" under the statute.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, that statute

 2   didn't have, as this one has, a disclosure requirement

 3   that says you have a right to sue.

 4                MR. McCONNELL:       And that's the sole

 5   distinction between the two statutes.            So, let's talk

 6   about --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, it could be a

 8   meaningful one.

 9                MR. McCONNELL:       So, the -- first of all, the

10   disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms,

11   gives a quick description of an operative civil

12   liability section, which is set out in 1679g and which

13   tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a

14   cause of action.

15                And when you look at the language of the

16   actual operative provision, 1679g, it's almost as if

17   Congress deliberately went out of its way to use

18   language that would not preclude arbitration.            That

19   language provides that a person who violates the statute

20   shall be liable to the persons --

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Suppose it said something

22   different, Mr. McConnell.       Suppose the disclosure

23   provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that

24   liability provision, you had a provision that simply

25   said:   Any person injured by a violation of this Act


                                     4

 1   will have a right of action or will have a right to sue

 2   under this statute.      And then you had the waiver

 3   provision that you have in this statute.                 Is that

 4   enough?

 5                 MR. McCONNELL:        Justice Kagan, I think that

 6   would be exactly the same, because a cause of action and

 7   a right to sue are the same thing.                 They mean the same

 8   thing.    And this Court has consistently since Mitsubishi

 9   held that just because Congress creates a cause of

10   action which is a right to sue does not preclude

11   arbitration, because --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. McConnell, you

13   started with the notion that the disclosure provision in

14   the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if

15   an ordinary person not schooled in the law read "you

16   have a right to sue," wouldn't they understand that to

17   mean I have a right to sue in court?

18                 MR. McCONNELL:        Justice Ginsburg, in the

19   ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC, sends

20   discriminated-against workers a right-to-sue letter that

21   tells them they have a right to sue.                 But this Court has

22   twice said that that does not preclude arbitration.                 And

23   that's because a right to sue is simply a cause of

24   action.   It doesn't actually -- that doesn't mean

25   exclusively a right to be in court.                 It gives you rights


                                       5

 1   which may be vindicated, and there are various ways in

 2   which they can be vindicated.             And the Federal

 3   Arbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or

 4   that the courts must enforce private contractual

 5   agreements that provide for the vindication even of

 6   statutory rights through arbitration.

 7                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Can you imagine any

 8   statutory language that would eliminate the right, the

 9   ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration

10   agreement other than language that expressly prohibits

11   the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of

12   arbitration?

13                  MR. McCONNELL:       Yes, Justice Alito, I can

14   imagine it.    Now, Congress has to date not used it.

15   Congress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration.

16   They've done it in a number of statutes.             In fact, in

17   the very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three

18   different statutes that were proposed that would have

19   eliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes.

20   None of them were adopted.

21                  But Congress is perfectly aware of how to do

22   this.   I don't think they have to use the magic words

23   "no arbitration," but -- but they certainly have to do

24   something considerably more direct than this.

25                  Here they've created a statute that provides


                                       6

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that there must be liability and creates a cause of

 2   action, and then they tell people in a separate

 3   disclosure provision -- by the way, added very late in

 4   the drafting process, right -- simply to tell people

 5   that they have what is colloquially known for laymen as

 6   a right to sue.

 7                Now, we lawyers call things causes of

 8   action.   We call them things like the right to bring a

 9   civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

10   That's lawyers' language.       But when ordinary people talk

11   about this, they think that's a right to sue.           But a

12   cause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same

13   thing.

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. McConnell, the cases

15   that you cite in support of your position rest on a

16   distinction between procedural rights and substantive

17   rights, which you invoke here.           But where does that

18   distinction itself come from?           Because it seems very

19   atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear

20   in the cases.   But when Congress talks about rights, why

21   should we think of rights as limited to substantive

22   rights rather than also procedural rights?

23                MR. McCONNELL:       First of all, only our

24   waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we

25   have a second argument.      But, nonetheless, I think this


                                     7

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   comes from the very long tradition, at least back to the

 2   1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration

 3   is a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the

 4   substantive rights of the particular statute.

 5                  So, this is the way courts have talked about

 6   the relationship between arbitration and the substantive

 7   statute.   So, you look at the statute, and you see what

 8   are the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights

 9   and so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those,

10   but that the term rights does not include -- it does not

11   mean that there's an exclusively judicial forum, just

12   that whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce

13   exactly the same set of substantive rights which are in

14   the statute.

15                  But, Justice Kagan, even if that were not

16   persuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the

17   way that this Court had been interpreting the words,

18   because Gilmer, which interprets the very words "any

19   rights" in an anti-waiver provision as not including

20   arbitration, happened just a few years, 5 years, before

21   enactment of this statute.          And we know Congress was

22   aware of Gilmer, because in -- the very same Congress

23   that passed CROA also considered a bill, considered and

24   rejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision

25   in Gilmer.

 1               So, Gilmer and the very question of -- of

 2   arbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that

 3   the word "any rights" was interpreted by this Court the

 4   way that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the

 5   language that was interpreted that way in Gilmer.

 6               And so, at this point, there's a vocabulary.

 7   It's like there's a glossary.            Congress is using it, and

 8   even if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you

 9   say, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the

10   matter.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the -- the Act in

12   Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as

13   a right within the non-waivable provision.

14               MR. McCONNELL:         That's true, Justice

15   Ginsburg, and the question is, does it matter?            I would

16   say anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says

17   that an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in

18   court, anyone would say that that is a right to sue.             It

19   is surely a right.

20               And, indeed, when this Court interpreted

21   that statute in Pyett, this Court called it a right, a

22   right, to a judicial forum.           Three times in the opinion,

23   the Court refers to that as a "right."            And the fact

24   that our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather

25   than a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly


                                      9

 1   against the backdrop -- recall, please, that the

 2   question here is whether Congress has explicitly

 3   abrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically

 4   barred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the

 5   contracts, and that all doubts are supposed to be

 6   resolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the

 7   statutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for

 8   the policy in favor of arbitrability.

 9                 Considering this, and considering the paltry

10   basis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't

11   see how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood --

12   could be upheld.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do you think a --

14   the word "lawsuit" typically describes an arbitration

15   proceeding?   If you're subject to an arbitration, would

16   you say, I'm in a lawsuit?

17                 MR. McCONNELL:       I do not think so.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, why doesn't a

19   right to sue refer to a lawsuit?

20                 MR. McCONNELL:       It refers to a cause of

21   action, Your Honor, you know, and we can call that a

22   lawsuit, too.   I mean, often that's another layman's

23   term for a cause of action.           But this Court has held I

24   don't know how many times, I believe it's at least six

25   times since -- since Mitsubishi, that just because


                                     10

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   Congress creates a cause of action and says that it will

 2   be in court, that does not mean that that's -- that that

 3   does not preclude arbitration, that that creates a cause

 4   of action.

 5                And I think the -- the underlying logic of

 6   this is that the existence of a cause of action or of a

 7   right to sue, which I submit is a synonym for a cause of

 8   action, is -- is not inconsistent with arbitration; it's

 9   the precondition for arbitration.           If there were not a

10   cause of action, there would be nothing to arbitrate,

11   right?   So, in every case in which there's a legal

12   arbitration, there's a cause of action.           It might arise

13   from contract, it might arise from a statute, but in

14   every single arbitration, there is a cause of action.

15   If this Court were to interpret --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           No, if this were written

17   to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you

18   would have a stronger argument.           But this is meant for

19   consumers, and they read "you have a right to sue, and

20   that right is not waivable."            A right to sue -- they're

21   not going to think about cause of action.           They don't

22   know what cause of action is.           But they do know that a

23   right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit.

24                MR. McCONNELL:       Justice Ginsburg, again, if

25   that is so, it would apply to other cases in which the


                                    11

 1   language "right to sue" is used.             For example, the

 2   EEOC's right-to-sue letters, what could be more explicit

 3   than that?    But this Court has held several times that

 4   just because the EEOC sends a right-to-sue letter

 5   doesn't mean that Congress has --

 6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is that in -- is that in

 7   the statute?    Or is it just a colloquial --

 8                  MR. McCONNELL:       It's in the regulations,

 9   Your Honor.

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but Title VII

11   doesn't say "right to sue."            It's a name that the agency

12   uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute.                The

13   statute doesn't say you have a right to sue.

14                  MR. McCONNELL:       Well, what the statute says

15   is you may bring a suit in court.             And so, if this

16   Court -- I do not see how the Court can say that the

17   right -- that the language "the right to sue" is

18   different from a right of action.             It certainly -- it's

19   -- it is the same thing.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One way you could do

21   it is that the right to sue is more familiar

22   colloquially.    If somebody, you know, hits your car and

23   you jump out angrily and say -- you can say:                I'm going

24   to sue you.    You're not likely to say:              I'm going to

25   bring a cause of action against you.

 1                (Laughter.)

 2                MR. McCONNELL:       We have -- there is no

 3   reason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure

 4   provision toward the end of the drafting of this statute

 5   and simply used a colloquial version of cause of action

 6   so that ordinary people would understand it, that they

 7   intended to change the meaning of the operative

 8   provision.   The operative provision tells us, I think

 9   very clearly, what Congress meant, and then in this sort

10   of quick shorthand, colloquial way, they're telling

11   people, yes, they have an action, but just like they

12   have an action -- persons have an action under the

13   Sherman Act, they have an action under RICO, they have

14   an action under the ADEA, they have an action under the

15   Truth in Lending Act.     In all of these cases, people

16   have a right to sue, but this Court has held that

17   arbitration vindicates the cause of action.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In a standard arbitration

19   agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and

20   Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then

21   stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of

22   the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?

23                MR. McCONNELL:       I don't --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean, doesn't that

25   happen rather often?

 1                  MR. McCONNELL:       It does happen rather often.

 2   I'm not sure what the -- I would say no.              What I would

 3   say is that the -- is that the question of arbitrability

 4   has been put before the court, and the court will decide

 5   whether to enforce the arbitration clause or not.

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And, of course, suits are

 7   brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration

 8   award.

 9                  MR. McCONNELL:       Exactly.       Exactly.   So, in

10   this sense, it's not that the cause of action goes away.

11   It's not the -- the cause of action is not being waived.

12   It's simply being vindicated in a different way, in a

13   way which Congress in the Arbitration Act has told us is

14   perfectly appropriate, just as appropriate as a -- as

15   vindication in Court and that we should leave it to --

16   and that a contract between the parties to decide which

17   of the forums for vindication of their rights would be

18   used should be enforced.

19                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Except that this is not

20   what the parties decide.        These are take it or leave it

21   contracts.   So, the consumer doesn't really elect

22   arbitration.    It's just presented as part of the terms

23   that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated.

24                  MR. McCONNELL:       That is an argument against

25   arbitration that this Court has rejected several times.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It's a question of

 2   whether we take that into account in -- in determining

 3   what "you have a right to sue" means.

 4                MR. McCONNELL:         Well, Justice Ginsburg,

 5   Congress -- that's a policy question, and Congress has

 6   given us an answer.      Recently, by the way, Congress has

 7   indicated a slightly different answer which will affect

 8   cases like this in the future.            As part of the

 9   Dodd-Frank regulatory reform bill, Congress required the

10   new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a

11   serious study of the use of arbitration procedures in

12   consumer financial matters to find out whether things

13   like what you referred to, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the

14   types of contracts and so forth are fair to consumers.

15                So, we'll get an authoritative answer to

16   this.   And Congress then vested this new bureau with

17   authority either to outlaw arbitration awards or to

18   require conditions or to reform them.              But in the

19   meantime, the policy that Congress has set is the policy

20   in the Federal Arbitration Act, which is one of a strong

21   policy in favor of enforcing arbitration contracts.

22                JUSTICE KAGAN:         You know, except if Congress

23   indicates otherwise and --

24                MR. McCONNELL:         Unless Congress has

25   indicated otherwise.

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:        And I guess that the problem

 2   here is that there is this language in this disclosure

 3   provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform

 4   consumers about -- about their rights and about where

 5   they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it

 6   says "you have a right to sue."          And you're asking us

 7   essentially to read that language as:            You have a right

 8   to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to

 9   end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form

10   contract.

11               And that seems a very different kind of

12   statement to consumers.

13               MR. McCONNELL:        Justice Kagan, I do not see

14   how it would be any different from a consumer who reads

15   any of the statutes that this Court has held are subject

16   to arbitration.   If, for example, in the Truth in

17   Lending Act, which this Court interpreted in the Green

18   Tree case that as part of the arbitration contract, it

19   was required to send the consumer a copy of the statute.

20   The consumer would read in the statute that there's a

21   cause of action, that they can bring suit in court to

22   enforce their rights under the Truth in Lending Act.

23               They would read that statute, and they would

24   draw exactly the same conclusion that they do from the

25   shorthand layman's language of "a right to sue."

 1                 But, again, even if that were so, I think as

 2   a matter of -- of how -- of statutory interpretation,

 3   that a disclosure provision cannot change the meaning of

 4   the operative section.      The operative section which

 5   creates the rights and liabilities here is section

 6   1679g.    And not even Respondents seriously claim that

 7   that section is -- shows a congressional intent to

 8   prevent arbitrability.      And that seems -- the fact that

 9   there's a disclosure provision that uses more informal

10   language instead of the lawyers' language used in 1679g

11   does not change the meaning of the statute.

12                 Unless there are further questions, I will

13   reserve the remaining part of my time for rebuttal.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

17                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18                 MR. NELSON:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20                 The Credit Repair Organizations Act provides

21   consumers with what it explicitly denominates a right to

22   sue, and then it says that any right of the consumer

23   under the statute is non-waivable.                As this Court has

24   said --

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Does that mean that

 1   there's a violation of the statute the minute one of

 2   these organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration

 3   clause?

 4                  MR. NELSON:     There's --

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         A $1,000 penalty for the

 6   mere asking?

 7                  MR. NELSON:     There's a -- there's a

 8   technical violation in asking, because in 1679f not only

 9   are waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is

10   prohibited to ask someone to waive their rights.

11                  However, that does not mean that you

12   actually have a cause of action to go in and sue

13   somebody for that, because, remember, under 1679g, what

14   you can sue for is your money back.                If somebody's asked

15   you for a waiver -- you didn't sign the contract, you

16   didn't pay them any money.          Or your damages -- if

17   somebody asked you for a waiver and you never signed up

18   with them, you don't have any damages.               And then

19   punitive damages in addition, which -- you know, the

20   general rule about punitive damages is you get them on

21   top of actual damages if you have actual damages.

22                  So, it's -- yes, it's a technical violation.

23   If a company engaged in a pattern or practice of it, the

24   FTC could quite rightly go in and get an injunction

25   against that.    But it's not a case where there would be


                                      18

 1   some onerous penalty imposed on a company merely for

 2   asking for a waiver.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, doesn't that

 4   reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress

 5   would have intended -- without any discussion in the

 6   legislative history -- and our case law has said you

 7   have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the

 8   language of the statute, its context, and its history.

 9   I just don't see any history here that supports your

10   reading.

11               MR. NELSON:        Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want

12   to take that in two parts, because the first was -- was

13   tied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and

14   whether that calls into question whether Congress really

15   could have meant this.       It's sort of an unusual

16   provision to say not only can you not waive rights, but

17   it's a violation even to ask somebody to waive them.

18               But that's no more unusual with respect to

19   the right to sue than with respect to any other right

20   under this statute.      For example, the right to cancel

21   after 3 days.   Everybody would concede, I think, that

22   that's a non-waivable right under the clear language of

23   this statute.   It's an unusual and perhaps onerous

24   provision to say that if somebody just suggested that

25   you waive that right to cancel and you never actually


                                      19

 1   waived it, they still violated the statute.

 2                But, you know, that's what Congress wrote

 3   here, because in this statute, it was concerned with an

 4   industry that it saw as overreaching pervasively in

 5   relation to the people that it was -- it was trying to

 6   sign up for its services.       And that's why Congress

 7   wanted a very strong prohibition of waiver of rights

 8   that even attempted -- that even extended to attempts.

 9                Now, as to the --

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Mr. Nelson, but your

11   friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules

12   in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew

13   it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void

14   arbitration agreements.      So, if that's the case, why

15   didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other

16   statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a

17   number of other statutes, which is to say so?

18                MR. NELSON:     First of all, the -- the rules

19   are not that Congress has to be especially clear in this

20   context.   And, in fact, the Court has said over and over

21   in the line of cases starting with Mitsubishi, McMahon,

22   Rodriguez de Quijas, and Gilmer that what has to be

23   discernible -- and this also gets back to Justice

24   Sotomayor's question -- it merely has to be discernible

25   from the text or the legislative history or the


                                    20

 1   structure and policies of the Act that -- that there's

 2   an intent to preclude waiver of the right to judicial

 3   remedies.

 4                  That's not an unmistakable plain statement

 5   rule; it's not a requirement of explicitness in the

 6   sense of explicitly using the term "arbitration."               As

 7   even my friend stated, there's no requirement of magic

 8   words.

 9                  What this Court said, what it told Congress

10   in the years leading up to this statute is:               You have to

11   express a discernible intent to preclude waiver of the

12   right to judicial remedies.

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Right.      And -- and you

14   don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need

15   something more than a provision dealing with what you

16   have to tell to the people who -- who accept these

17   contracts.   I mean it's not in the substantive part of

18   the statute.    It's in the part of the statute that tells

19   you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to

20   notify the consumer of.        It's a very strange way for

21   Congress to say "no arbitration" by putting this

22   language in a section that has nothing to do with the

23   rights under the Act.

24                  MR. NELSON:     Well --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         It is intended to be a

 1   summary of the rights under the Act.

 2               MR. NELSON:      Justice Scalia, I think it's --

 3   I think it's not a strange way at all but a very direct

 4   way in the context here.      Remember, in Gilmer, what the

 5   Court was dealing with was a statute that as amended in

 6   an amendment that actually wasn't before the Court in

 7   Gilmer said you can't waive any right under the statute.

 8   But that then raises a question:           Well, what do we mean

 9   by rights under this statute?           And the Court concluded

10   there and reinforced in Pyett that it interpreted that

11   to mean substantive rights; in the absence of a textual

12   indication, that when Congress used the term "rights" in

13   this statute, it was intending to protect the procedural

14   right to go to court.

15               Here we have something very different.

16   Congress creates a cause of action which, as my friend

17   says, colloquially someone could call that a right if

18   they wanted to.   But the cause of action says you can --

19   you can obtain this liability; the court will determine

20   it; you obtain it through an action.             That certainly

21   gives you an entitlement to go to court.             But Congress

22   then goes further and it denominates that one of the

23   rights under this statute, one of only two rights under

24   this statute that are so-called.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Do you think that Gilmer


                                    22

 1   would have come out differently with regard to one of

 2   the procedural rights involved in that case if the

 3   statute had happened to refer to that procedural right

 4   as a right?   Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?

 5                 MR. NELSON:      Yes, they are definitely

 6   rights, and --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          So, and if the statute in

 8   Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in

 9   passing as a right, you think that one would have been

10   non-waivable?

11                 MR. NELSON:      I think that if Congress had

12   expressly denominated something in that statute as a

13   right --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          But procedural rights are

15   rights.    I mean, to denominate it as a right is --

16                 MR. NELSON:      Well, but the question is:

17   Does "any right" refer to both procedural and

18   substantive rights?

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Exactly.

20                 MR. NELSON:      Which is what this Court held

21   that it did not in Pyett.         But when Congress -- you

22   know, it does matter what words Congress uses, and

23   "rights" is a word that can have a lot of meanings.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Yes, but --

25                 MR. NELSON:      This is a statute that --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         But you're saying -- in

 2   answer to my question, you're saying that just because

 3   the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just

 4   as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute

 5   uses our normal language, those procedural rights are

 6   elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be

 7   waived.    That can't be right.

 8                 MR. NELSON:     I think if Congress makes clear

 9   in the statute that what it means when it's talking

10   about rights is -- includes procedural rights, and then

11   it has a provision that says any right under this

12   statute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very

13   strong inference that Congress meant what it said.           But,

14   in fact --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't think that

16   referring to a procedural right as a right creates any

17   inference at all.    It is a right.

18                 MR. NELSON:     It is a right, and when

19   Congress has said -- I mean, many of these statutes such

20   as Title VII and TILA don't say that rights are

21   non-waivable.   This statute is a unique statute in its

22   phrasing.    It has a non-waiver provision applicable to

23   any right, and it has a list of rights.           That's pretty

24   unusual.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What else is non-waivable

 1   besides the 3 days to back out?

 2                MR. NELSON:     Well, the other thing that this

 3   statute makes non-waivable besides rights is

 4   protections, and -- which is a phrase that isn't then

 5   tied to anything defined in the statute.           But I think

 6   that, for example, all of the prohibited practices

 7   listed in section 1679b, which are at pages 4a to 5a of

 8   the red brief -- those would be non-waivable.           You

 9   couldn't waive your right not to have the credit repair

10   organization make false statements to you.           You couldn't

11   waive your right under 1679b(b) not to have to make a

12   payment in advance to a credit repair organization.              You

13   can't waive the right to the disclosures provided for in

14   1679c or the protection provided by those disclosures.

15   And 1679d requires written contracts and specifies those

16   terms.   Those would all be subject to the provision in

17   the statute that says you can't waive any protection or

18   any right provided by the statute.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Do you know, Mr. Nelson,

20   whether this statute is unique in this sense:           Do you

21   know of any other statute that arguably voids

22   arbitration agreements without saying that they're

23   voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement?

24                MR. NELSON:     No.        There's a -- sort of a

25   pending disagreement, perhaps, over whether the

 1   Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act does, but that's because of

 2   some very specific language in that statute about

 3   informal dispute resolution mechanisms and the manner in

 4   which that has been interpreted in agency regulations.

 5   So, this is really the only statute that I'm aware of

 6   that uses this formulation.

 7                  But you remind me of your earlier question,

 8   which I never got to finish answering about the

 9   thousands of other statutes that say specifically that

10   you can't enforce arbitration agreements.                 In fact,

11   there are very few such statutes.             There were none at

12   the time this statute was enacted.                 The first one

13   appeared 6 years later.        The only time that there has

14   been any number of them is in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,

15   which came after what I would say is a lengthy period of

16   considerable attention that had been paid by advocates

17   before Congress to the issue of arbitration that I think

18   led to the desire to use as sort of a belt and

19   suspenders approach in those statutes.

20                  But what we had here in 1996, there had

21   never before been a statute that prohibited the

22   enforcement specifically of an arbitration agreement in

23   those terms.    And as Mr. McConnell said, there were some

24   proposals, unenacted proposals, that had been floated at

25   that time.   But I think the one thing that is clear is


                                      26

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that we don't learn how Congress does things by looking

 2   at things that it didn't do.           And that's all those

 3   unenacted proposals were.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Would your position of

 5   right to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a

 6   post-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate?

 7               MR. NELSON:     No, I think not, Justice

 8   Ginsburg, and for this reason:           The -- the Court has

 9   always differentiated between post-dispute settlements

10   of claims and pre-dispute waivers, and has not

11   considered agreements to settle, absent very special

12   either statutory language such as in the ADEA, which

13   does apply a waiver provision to some types of

14   settlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act, where

15   there's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting

16   certain kinds of settlements.           But, generally, the Court

17   has not considered the settlement of a case to be a

18   waiver of the right to bring the case.           And that

19   primarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our

20   briefs.

21               But I think it was significant that in Wilko

22   v. Swan, where the Court said we're going to interpret

23   the Securities Act not to -- not to allow waivers of the

24   right to sue, the Court said:           Of course, this wouldn't

25   apply to something that came post-dispute.


                                   27

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1                And in McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas, what

 2   the Court disagreed with Wilko v. Swan about was whether

 3   the right to sue under that particular statute was

 4   non-waivable.   But it favorably commented on the notion

 5   that, of course, even if it were, it wouldn't bar a

 6   post-dispute agreement to arbitrate a claim as a way of

 7   settling an actually pending dispute.

 8                And that's why I think when Congress enacted

 9   this statute, it would have been acting against that

10   backdrop and would not have -- no one would have thought

11   that a settlement agreement is a waiver of the right to

12   sue.   A settlement agreement is a resolution of the

13   right to sue.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Another argument that is

15   made, in opposition to your position, is that the

16   statute says any waiver of any protection or right may

17   not be enforced by any court or any other person.          And

18   the suggestion is "any other person" must contemplate an

19   alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court --

20   court or any other person.

21                MR. NELSON:     Well, I don't think that it

22   necessarily contemplates an alternative dispute

23   resolution mechanism, because I think, for example, that

24   would bar -- when someone goes to court to compel

25   arbitration, they are enforcing an arbitration agreement


                                    28

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   by bringing an enforcement action.               So, that would bar

 2   them from doing that.

 3               So, "any other person" doesn't necessarily

 4   mean arbitrators.   But even to the extent that it

 5   comprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have

 6   thought was principally applicable to them, you've got

 7   to realize that this statute -- what it prohibits is

 8   only the waiver of the consumer's ability to arbitrate

 9   her CROA claim.   It doesn't bar a credit repair

10   organization from requiring a consumer to arbitrate the

11   credit repair organization's breach of contract action.

12   And, in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the

13   consumer arbitrations that were handled by the

14   arbitration forum that was designated in this contract

15   were collection actions brought by a company that says

16   this consumer owes me some money.

17               So, that's kind of the norm.               That's the

18   general run of arbitration cases.           And if a credit

19   repair organization were to initiate an arbitration

20   against a consumer, that wouldn't violate the non-waiver

21   provision; but if the consumer then defended and said,

22   wait a second, this contract is void because I never got

23   the right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly

24   prevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying

25   you waived the right to cancel.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What about the

 2   argument that the consumer retains the right to sue,

 3   since they can go into court with their complaint, but

 4   it's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is

 5   that you have to proceed to arbitration?

 6                MR. NELSON:     Well, I think it's -- it would

 7   be a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue

 8   that meant you could file a complaint that was

 9   mandatorily subject to decision elsewhere.              And, second,

10   and this goes to Justice --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But that's

12   frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues

13   come up.   I mean, people --

14                MR. NELSON:     Well, that's certainly --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- who think they

16   cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement

17   or any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in

18   court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of

19   whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.

20                MR. NELSON:     But -- but all that has been

21   resolved in that -- that suit is not the plaintiff's

22   claim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue

23   on.   All that's resolved is the issue of whether he has

24   a contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has

25   breached by going into court.


                                    30

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  And this goes to Justice Kennedy's question.

 2   Under the FAA, you can compel arbitration when someone

 3   has filed a complaint that is in breach of an agreement

 4   to arbitrate.

 5                  So, they -- they don't actually have a right

 6   to sue.   You can't stop them from going and filing a

 7   complaint, but once they do, you come in and say, no,

 8   you have no right to -- to proceed on the merits with

 9   this claim in court.      And, in fact, that's -- that's

10   exactly what the arbitration --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you get -- can you get

12   damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's

13   fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the

14   arbitration?

15                  MR. NELSON:     No, I don't think you would

16   generally have that entitlement under any -- any rule of

17   law that is -- that is normally applicable in American

18   courts.   However, if your -- if your arbitration

19   agreement provided for that -- I'm afraid I can't point

20   to any decision that would make it unenforceable, much

21   as I would regret that result.

22                  So, you know, I think in a -- in a real

23   sense, the consumer has no right to -- right to sue

24   merely because they can run into court and -- and then

25   be compelled to arbitrate.          And that's exactly why this


                                      31

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Court, in every one of its decisions enforcing

 2   arbitration agreements or not, has referred to the

 3   arbitration agreement as a waiver of the right to

 4   proceed judicially.      It has used that phrase over and

 5   over again in McMahon, Rodriguez de Quijas, Mitsubishi,

 6   and -- and Gilmer itself.

 7                 The -- the common recognition of all those

 8   cases is that the arbitration agreement is a waiver of

 9   the person's right to proceed in court.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You agree, I take

11   it, that you would lose if the statute said "you have a

12   cause of action"?

13                 MR. NELSON:      Yes.       I -- you know, a cause of

14   action I don't think would -- would do it for us.                In

15   fact, that's exactly what the ADEA says, the section

16   that creates a judicial remedy is headed "Cause of

17   Action."    And so, you know, the question again is

18   "right" is a word that -- that can be used in many

19   senses.    It's -- it's a word sort of like

20   "jurisdiction."   It gets thrown around loosely.               But

21   when Congress says a right is non-waivable, it's

22   referring to something specific.             And the question is:

23   What is it referring to in a statute that uses the term

24   "right" and uses it to describe the -- the ability to go

25   to court?


                                      32

 1                 And -- and, again, that "right to sue"

 2   language is important in two ways, because it not only

 3   specifies that the 1679g remedies are a right for

 4   purposes of this statute, but it says something about

 5   the nature of the right.       It's a right to sue.      It's not

 6   just a right to get those damages, to get your money

 7   back.    And "sue," as I -- and I think my friend

 8   agrees --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well -- well, I guess it

10   goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to

11   me.   Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of

12   rights provision would normally be read to mean

13   non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given

14   to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural

15   right to sue as a "right," eliminates that presumption.

16                 So, I presume, therefore, that your position

17   is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot

18   be waived.    Because, I mean, that's what we're talking

19   about:    What does "right" mean --

20                 MR. NELSON:     Justice --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- when it says rights are

22   not waived?    And our prior case law says ordinarily that

23   means only substantive rights.           But here in this

24   statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is

25   certainly a procedural right, as a right.           So, I presume


                                     33

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise

 2   cannot be waived.

 3               MR. NELSON:       Well, I -- I'm not really sure

 4   there are other procedural rights in the statute.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, there are none?

 6               MR. NELSON:       I mean, unless -- the right to

 7   cancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a

 8   procedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think

 9   it -- it probably would generally be categorized as a

10   substantive right.

11               But as far as procedural rights of the

12   consumer, they are set forth in 1679g, and they are the

13   right to bring an action either on an individual or

14   class basis for the damages and attorney fees specified

15   in that section.    And that's what I think is being

16   referred to as "the right to sue."

17               Now, if there were something else in the

18   statute that one might arguably call a right and

19   arguably call procedural -- I mean, it's hypothetical

20   because I don't think it's there, but I would not jump

21   to the conclusion that it was a right if it was not

22   comprehended by "right to sue," because I think what

23   that statement "right to sue" makes non-waivable is the

24   right to sue.   It's not just any procedural thing in

25   this statute that one might loosely call a right.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose the case were

 2   reversed.   The liability section says you have a right

 3   to sue, and the disclosure section says you have a right

 4   to sue or go to arbitration.            What result then?

 5                MR. NELSON:     Well --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me that under

 7   your -- well, I'll let you answer.

 8                MR. NELSON:     Justice Kennedy, let me divide

 9   it up.   If the liability section said you had a right to

10   sue and there were no disclosure -- disclosure section

11   at all, I would say that's -- that's plenty good enough.

12   If the disclosure section says, you have a right to sue

13   or to go to arbitration, I think you would have to then

14   say sensibly what is Congress talking about when it's --

15   when it's referring to this, and you would have to read

16   them together.   And I would have a hard time standing up

17   here and saying that a statute that told people "right

18   to sue or arbitrate" meant right to sue only and

19   foreclosed arbitration.      And -- and, you know, I think

20   -- I think that really would be a very different matter.

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Nelson, you just said if

22   the liability section said you have a right to sue,

23   that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action,

24   that's not okay.   But the right to sue is really just a

25   colloquial way of expressing the first.            So, why should


                                    35

 1   we draw the line between those two things?

 2                MR. NELSON:      Well, when you say

 3   "colloquial," I'm not -- I don't want to fence with you,

 4   but I think that that's selling it a bit short.             This is

 5   a statute where Congress prescribed a notice, prescribed

 6   it in statutory terms, did it so people would have an

 7   understanding of what their rights were, and did it in a

 8   way that no reasonable consumer would understand meant,

 9   oh, this non-waivable right is not really to sue in the

10   way that I would ordinarily understand the word, and

11   even that courts normally use it but actually to -- to

12   do something else.

13                So, I -- I don't think it's colloquial in --

14   in a disparaging sense.       What it is, is something that

15   is designed to convey a clear meaning, and the clear

16   meaning that it conveys is you have a right to go to

17   court.   Now, of course, even a disclosure that you have

18   a right to go to court wouldn't be enough to get you

19   over the hump if you didn't also have a provision that

20   made that right non-waivable.            But, again, here what you

21   have is both.

22                And -- and in doing that, in writing that

23   statute, Congress was doing exactly what the Court had

24   told it, it didn't do in Gilmer, it didn't do in

25   McMahon, it didn't do in Mitsubishi.              It created a right

 7           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Mr. McConnell, can we go

10   to the issue of the class action?           If we buy your

11   argument that procedural and substantive rights are

12   different, is it your position that you could seek a

13   waiver of a class action even though this statute

14   expressly contemplates class actions?

15                MR. McCONNELL:       Actually, Justice Sotomayor,

16   I think this statute specifically does not require -- it

17   contemplates but does not require class actions.              If you

18   look at -- at 1679g(a)(2)(B), which is the class action

19   provision -- it's on page 59a of the appendix to the --

20   to the petition -- all that it says is that in the case

21   of a class action, here is how we would -- here's how

22   the damages, the punitive damages, would be calculated.

23   It does not say that there must be class actions.              It

24   doesn't make that a non-waivable right at all.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, your answer to me is

 1   that that is waivable.       That's not a right contemplated

 2   by the right to sue.

 3                  MR. McCONNELL:       Actually, my answer to you

 4   is that it's not a right to begin with.

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, you have to meet

 6   the prerequisites --

 7                  MR. McCONNELL:       Whether waivable or not.

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But you have to meet the

 9   prerequisites of a class action before you are entitled

10   to seek one.    But your position is that's not a

11   protected right?

12                  MR. McCONNELL:       May I -- if we were to

13   hypothesize that the statute did provide that there

14   shall be class provisions, which this does not -- I

15   think this statute is agnostic on that, but the

16   hypothetical statute where class actions are

17   contemplated, I would not argue that that is necessarily

18   waivable.   What I would argue is that that can be

19   vindicated through arbitration, that there can be -- as

20   this Court discussed just last term in Concepcion, there

21   can be class arbitration proceedings.

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But you -- but this

23   arbitration agreement precludes class actions, doesn't

24   it?

25                  MR. McCONNELL:       Yes, it does.     And, again,

 1   this statute does not require that there be class


 2   proceedings.    I'm only addressing a hypothetical --

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Unless --

 4                  MR. McCONNELL:       -- statute that did.


 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Unless we read the


 6   disclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that


 7   you're entitled to bring your action in court.                With


 8   whatever protections, procedural and substantive


 9   protections, that entails.


10                  MR. McCONNELL:       Yes, and that seems to me

11   just a further reason not to interpret a disclosure

12   provision with a layman's language as importing, you

13   know, very specific legal notions, that -- I think this

14   simply means -- right to sue simply means cause of

15   action.   And it's -- each of the rights, I should point

16   out, in the disclosure provision is -- has its actual

17   textual home elsewhere.        None of them are created in the

18   disclosure provision.       Each of them is created

19   elsewhere, either in this statute or another.                To find

20   out exactly what they entail, you look to the

21   substantive provisions.        Here, you would look to 1679g,

22   and you would see that class actions are possible but

23   not required under this particular statute.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Could you in an

25   agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify

 1   what a court shall consider in awarding punitive

 2   damages?

 3                  MR. McCONNELL:       I don't think so,

 4   Mr. Chief Justice.     Most lower courts treat the right to

 5   punitive damages as a substantive right which would not

 6   be waivable.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, well what --

 8   what if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those

 9   four requirements?     Could you waive particular aspects?

10   I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of

11   course, "the court shall consider"; but I take it your

12   position is when they say "the court," they mean the

13   court or arbitrator?

14                  MR. McCONNELL:       It means the decisionmaker.

15   Many statutes of course refer to things that courts

16   might do, even though those statutes can be vindicated

17   in arbitration.    Title VII, for example, has several

18   provisions in which it says, if the court determines

19   this, then it may do that, for example, issue

20   injunctions and so forth.         I -- when you import the

21   substantive provisions of a statute into an arbitration

22   proceeding, everything that would be substantively

23   available from a court becomes available from -- from

24   the arbitrator.    And that's the way I would read the

25   punitive damages section here.

 1               I note, by the way -- if I might just

 2   respond to a few of the points made by my friend in

 3   response to questions -- begin with Justice Sotomayor's

 4   interesting question about the fact that the statute

 5   appears to make even offering a waiver, offering an


 6   arbitration clause, a violation.             It's actually even


 7   worse than that for two reasons.


 8               One is that under their reading, a


 9   settlement is surely just as much a waiver as an


10   arbitration is.   Now, they say, oh, well, that only

11   means post-dispute waivers.            But that is not what this

12   statute says.   This statute is about all waivers.            In

13   contrast to other statutes previously enacted, like the

14   ADEA, which distinguish between pre-dispute and

15   post-dispute waivers, this one does not.             So, their

16   position suggests that even a settlement offer is a

17   violation of this statute.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, Mr. Nelson just

19   said no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when

20   I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up

21   settlement as well.      He said that their interpretation

22   does not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff

23   agrees --

24               MR. McCONNELL:          Well, Justice Ginsburg, that

25   was his answer, but what that tells us is that he is not


                                      41

 1   giving us a plain language meaning of the statute, which

 2   is all that they have, right?             Their entire position is

 3   based upon a plain language reading of the statute.

 4   Remember the way the Ninth Circuit begins its opinion by

 5   quoting Alice in Wonderland.             It's -- it's all about

 6   plain language.   But they do not offer us a plain

 7   language interpretation of this statute.               In order to

 8   avoid absurd consequences like making settlement offers

 9   a violation of the statute, they have to create

10   exceptions, unspecified exceptions, to the text.

11               It would be much easier simply to follow the

12   rules of construction that this Court had announced

13   before this statute was enacted and against which

14   Congress operated.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, one of those

16   rules of construction is that you don't read statutes

17   when -- to the extent they lead to absurd results.               I

18   mean, I think you can still say follow the plain

19   language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say

20   you can't enter into a settlement.

21               MR. McCONNELL:         I think it's easier, though,

22   simply to assume that Congress was using words in the

23   way that this Court used them in Gilmer just a few years

24   before, that that's a much more straightforward way of

25   reading the statute.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I'm not sure that a

 2   settlement is a waiver anyway.          It's a vindication.   You

 3   -- you vindicate your right to a settlement.          I don't

 4   know that you waive it.

 5                MR. McCONNELL:       Just as I think you can say

 6   that when you go to arbitration, you vindicate the

 7   substantive rights of the statute as well.          And, indeed,

 8   this Court has used that very language in Mitsubishi

 9   with respect to -- to arbitration.

10                The -- just a couple of other small points.

11                My friend points out that this is the first

12   statute in -- or that at the time of this statute in

13   1996, that there had been no statute that explicitly

14   barred arbitration, which is historically true but I

15   think not particularly revealing.           It was only in '85 in

16   Mitsubishi and then '91 in Gilmer that Congress became

17   aware that it needed to do this in statutory causes of

18   action.   In -- and by 1996, they were considering bills

19   that explicitly voided arbitration clauses.          They

20   weren't enacted, but this is for political reasons.

21   Remember the political composition of Congress in 1996.

22                It is not surprising that statutes voiding

23   arbitration agreements become more common when the

24   political composition of the Congress changes.          This is

25   fundamentally a political choice, and ought to be -- we


                                    43

 1   ought to respect the choices that Congress has made.

 2               Unless there are further questions, I will

 3   waive the remainder of my time.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 5               MR. McCONNELL:       Unless it's an un-waivable

 6   right.
