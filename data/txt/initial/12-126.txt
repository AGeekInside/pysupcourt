 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 12-126, McQuiggin v. Perkins.

 5                Mr. Bursch?

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                MR. BURSCH:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                We're not dealing here with the situation

11   where a prisoner is trying to gather new evidence AEDPA

12   has a tolling rule to take care of that problem.

13   We're also not dealing with anything that prevents

14   Petitioner from filing because that's the problem you

15   solved in Holland.

16                What we have here is the question of when a

17   petitioner must file his Federal habeas petition when he

18   has the evidence and there are no barriers to filing.

19   And 2244(d)(1)(D) addresses that exact question.                It

20   says, "within 1 year."

21                Now, Mr. Perkins asks for a fairly dramatic

22   expansion of Holland.       What he wants is equitable

23   abrogation with no diligence, no fault, or any other

24   factor.   And our primary position is that you should

25   simply apply the plain language of 2244(d)(1)(D).

                                      3

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Mr. Bursch, I thought

 2   that -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you

 3   could take into account -- I'm looking for the

 4   brief -- you could take into account delay as a factor

 5   in whether his actual innocence gateway plea should be

 6   heard.

 7                  MR. BURSCH:      Well, he -- he does say that,

 8   and we read that as a concession that, sometimes, if you

 9   wait too long, that can actually trump a claim of actual

10   innocence.     And so, at a minimum, our alternative

11   position is that you have to act with diligence.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That's not quite what

13   he's saying.     We've had a miscarriage of justice

14   exception for as long as there's been a habeas statute.

15   We've applied it repeatedly.

16                  It's not that it trumps it, but that it puts

17   into doubt the evidence you're claiming, proves your

18   actual innocence.     It's not the sort of situation where,

19   as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to

20   override even an actually innocent person.

21                  MR. BURSCH:      Well, we think it --

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What he says is it -- it

23   really puts into question the validity of your claim.

24                  MR. BURSCH:      But, Justice Sotomayor,

25   it -- it represents the same kind of principle, you've

                                      4

 1   got to act quickly, or adverse consequences can happen.

 2   But what diligence does that his rule doesn't do is it

 3   recognizes this compelling, countervailing State

 4   interest in having notice and an opportunity to

 5   investigate evidence, as soon as it's discovered.

 6               Now -- and the problem here -- we don't have

 7   any issue at all, if it takes 10, 15, 100 years to find

 8   new evidence, but once he has that evidence, the burden

 9   is on him to come forward, so that the State has the

10   opportunity to investigate.           And the --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's a small point and

12   doesn't go to the general issues you have to discuss

13   with us, but just, on the small point, he gets -- I

14   forget exactly the detail -- he gets an affidavit that

15   Jones did it within a year.           He has one.

16               MR. BURSCH:      Yes.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Now, if I were the

18   prisoner, I'd say -- you know, this one might not work.

19   Maybe I can get two, and then he gets a second, which

20   makes a certain amount of sense to me -- although a

21   substantial period of time elapses -- and the same thing

22   happens with the third.

23               It makes sense to me that the prisoner might

24   try to wait for the third.         How -- how does that factor

25   into your diligence, assuming we get there?

                                   5

 1               MR. BURSCH:      Yes.      Justice Kennedy, there's

 2   a very simple solution to that problem.          If he gets

 3   close to the end of his year and he thinks that that

 4   next affidavit might be just around the corner, but he

 5   doesn't have it yet, all he has to do is file a

 6   protective habeas petition with the district court, ask

 7   for a stay, and say, I'm still diligently pursuing what

 8   I think is going to be another affidavit.          And, if he

 9   can't find that next affidavit, you litigate it on the

10   merits, and, if he does, then he amends his petition,

11   and then you hear it.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          I'm not quite -- excuse

13   me -- I'm not quite sure that wouldn't mean that you

14   have a whole raft of -- of petition-protective decisions

15   waiting on the shelf in the district court.          That --

16   that -- that causes its own congestion problems in the

17   district court, it seems to me.

18               MR. BURSCH:      Two thoughts on that.      First,

19   we already see this in the exhaustion area.          There are

20   petitioners who are concerned that, notwithstanding

21   statutory tolling for pursuing State remedies, that,

22   while they're monkeying around in State court, they

23   might somehow be time-barred from bringing their Federal

24   claim.

25               So we see this all the time in the Sixth

                                   6

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   Circuit -- you know, in Michigan in particular, that

 2   someone will file their petition and -- and ask for a

 3   stay while they exhaust State remedies.           So -- you know,

 4   the pile really isn't going to be any different

 5   than it is right now.

 6                But the key difference between that scenario

 7   and the scenario that Perkins proposes is that, when you

 8   have him file something, the State's on notice, they

 9   have an opportunity to investigate.

10                Now, here, we have his last affidavit from

11   the dry cleaning clerk, and it's 10 years old.           So, even

12   if Michigan could find that person, there's no way for

13   us to meaningfully cross-examine her and investigate

14   what she really knew or didn't know when she wrote that

15   affidavit 10 years ago.

16                And so with the file and stay, you preserve

17   all of the rights, but, yet, you give the State the

18   countervailing interest that the statute was meant to

19   protect.   And I do want to --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         What would it take to --

21   what would it take to show diligence?           And didn't he say

22   that he tried to get a lawyer, several times, and was

23   unsuccessful?

24                MR. BURSCH:      Sure.      And that's a very

25   practical question that I'd like to address.           Most of

                                    7

 1   the habeas petitioners don't have lawyers, but filing

 2   the habeas petition itself is not something that takes

 3   great difficulty.     Every district court, on their

 4   website, has a place where you click for forms.                 In the

 5   Eastern District of Michigan, when you click that, the

 6   very first two entries are habeas petitions for Federal

 7   prisoners and State prisoners.

 8                  And it's a relatively simple form.              You

 9   check some boxes, say when your conviction was, and you

10   write your claim.     And then every Federal district court

11   in the country has full-time pro se staff attorneys who

12   go through these pro se petitions.

13                  And, if there is a legitimate claim there,

14   then they can work that up for the judge, if necessary,

15   and the State will respond.              So --

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:         I have some difficulty

17   understanding what the Sixth Circuit was doing.                 And

18   maybe you can help me with that.                 The district court, as

19   I understand it, said to the Petitioner, you lose for

20   two reasons.     First, you don't really have evidence of

21   actual innocence, not enough anyway; and, second -- and

22   I can understand that, because the evidence -- well,

23   that -- the most that is suggested by the affidavits is

24   that Jones was a participant in this murder, not that

25   Perkins was not responsible for the murder.

                                      8

 1                 But, anyway, so you lose for two reasons.

 2   First, you don't really have evidence of actual

 3   innocence; second, you weren't diligent.                The Sixth

 4   Circuit grants a certificate of appealability only on

 5   the issue of diligence, and they say, diligence doesn't

 6   make any difference.

 7                 Well, where does that leave the petitioner?

 8   He's already lost on the question of whether there's

 9   evidence of actual innocence, and there was no appeal on

10   that issue.

11                 MR. BURSCH:      Well, we're very confused about

12   that, too.    They do say, in their opinion, that the case

13   is remanded to the district court to determine whether

14   he's got evidence of actual innocence.                Now, as you just

15   pointed out, Judge Bell in the district court already

16   made that determination, so maybe they're contemplating

17   an evidentiary hearing or some further investigation,

18   but it is curious because --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, that -- that may be

20   what they're contemplating, but they can't get to the

21   issue of whether the district court adequately addressed

22   the issue of adequate innocence -- of actual innocence,

23   unless that issue is before them.                And the issue isn't

24   supposed to be before them, unless -- isn't before them,

25   unless the certificate of appealability was issued, and

                                     9

                                 Official


 1   there was no certificate of appealability on that issue.

 2               MR. BURSCH:       We agree with that 100 percent,

 3   so --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Was that -- was that

 5   argued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit?          Did you argue in

 6   the Sixth Circuit that, even assuming diligence, there

 7   wasn't enough here, and that's what the district court

 8   held?

 9               MR. BURSCH:       I believe that is the position

10   of the State of Michigan, that because he confessed to

11   his friends, both before and after --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But it -- it was

13   explicitly made to the Sixth Circuit?

14               MR. BURSCH:       I believe that the Sixth

15   Circuit argument did focus on the question of diligence.

16   But -- you know, our opinion would be that, even if this

17   Court would use -- you know, what we call equitable

18   abrogation, to kind of wipe away the 1-year limitations

19   period, and you would also disagree on diligence, and we

20   don't think you should do that, that you would still

21   reverse because there's nothing left to be done in the

22   district court.

23               This is not a case that rises to the very,

24   very high threshold of proving actual innocence, based

25   on new evidence.   I would like to get back to the

 1   statutory language.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Where does that leave

 3   us?

 4                MR. BURSCH:       I --

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Let's assume --

 6                MR. BURSCH:       Well, that leaves you with a

 7   reversal in any of those three instances.            We think that

 8   you should address the circuit split, which is the

 9   important question of do we apply the limitations

10   period.   And, to turn to that, what I would like to do

11   is set up an analytical construct.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It's sort of an advisory

13   opinion, in your judgment.

14                MR. BURSCH:       Oh, no, it wouldn't be an

15   advisory opinion.     It would --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Sure, it would be

17   because you're telling us that there is no proof of

18   actual innocence.

19                MR. BURSCH:       I'm saying that --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So why don't we just say

21   that?

22                MR. BURSCH:       I'm saying that's an

23   alternative ground to get to the same place, but the

24   Sixth Circuit's holding was, consistent with some other

25   circuits, that there is no statute of limitations here,

                                    11

 1   that you can get by with equitable abrogation, as we

 2   call it.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            It might be its holding,

 4   but, as Justice Alito just proved, there's no basis for

 5   it because they didn't grant a COA on the substantive

 6   merits question.

 7               MR. BURSCH:        Right.       I -- I think you're

 8   wholly within your right to address the merits question,

 9   and I would like to turn to that.

10               The analytical construct I want to set up is

11   that we've got three different categories of prisoners

12   who claim actual innocence, based on new evidence.                In

13   the first category, they used that new evidence only to

14   try to establish innocence with no constitutional claim.

15   And, in Herrera, you say no Federal habeas remedy for

16   that; you have to go back to the State courts, executive

17   clemency, prosecutorial discharging of verdicts, and

18   things like that.

19               The second category is where you have a

20   prisoner who uses new evidence as a gateway.             It's not

21   related to the constitutional claim that they assert --

22   the true Schlup gateway.        And that's not actually this

23   case, either, and you could reserve that question,

24   although I'm happy to talk about that.

25               The case we have here is the third instance,

                                    12

                                Official


 1   where the evidence of actual innocence -- the new

 2   evidence, is the factual predicate for the claim.             And

 3   you could not find a provision more on all fours with

 4   that category than what Congress did in 2244(d)(1)(D).

 5   And we know that Congress was thinking about actual

 6   innocence in Schlup.

 7               For those of you who are interested in the

 8   context, in the legislative debate in '95 and '96,

 9   before AEDPA's enactment, we have Senators Feingold and

10   Kennedy and Dodd, among others, talking about how this

11   new statute is going to eliminate claims of actual

12   innocence based on new evidence.           In fact, Senator

13   Feingold even mentioned the Schlup decision.

14               And, yet, Congress adopts 2244(d)(1)(D) and

15   all the rest of the provisions by a 91 to 8 vote.             So

16   Congress had this Court's decision in Schlup in the back

17   of its mind, it considered this particular construct and

18   it said, no, we want a 1-year limitations period.

19               I do want to --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Your -- your three-way

21   classification, you began with Herrera?

22               MR. BURSCH:      Correct.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          And -- and, in a way,

24   you're saying that you're three loops back in the

25   Herrera a bit because, here, the innocence is the

                                  13

 1   factual predicate.

 2                MR. BURSCH:        Right.       And, in the Herrera

 3   case, there is no constitutional claim, so there is no

 4   factual predicate.     It's just a stand-alone "I'm

 5   innocent" claim.     And this Court has said, appropriately

 6   so, that the Federal habeas remedy doesn't cover that.

 7                You know, if you think about the remedies

 8   you can get from State courts, from prosecutors, from

 9   executive clemency, it's a rather big circle, and AEDPA

10   is a much smaller circle that's subsumed in that.                And

11   you recognize, in Herrera, that, just because you don't

12   fall within the habeas circle, doesn't mean that you

13   can't get relief.

14                In fact, if you look at the examples that

15   the amici briefs cite on the Respondent's side, in

16   almost every case, the final decision is motivated by

17   State action.   There's a governor who grants clemency in

18   a couple of cases, there's a State attorney general's

19   office that dismisses charges in others, county

20   prosecutors who do the same.             One, which the amicus

21   brief characterizes as a habeas grant, is actually the

22   Illinois Court of Appeals in a State proceeding

23   reversing.

24                You know, what the -- these are the best

25   examples that they have for why you need an equitable

                                     14

 1   abrogation rule, and, yet, in the vast majority of those

 2   cases, it's the State system that's solving the problem.

 3                 Now, I do want to go back to what I think

 4   is -- is the trickiest question, and that's,

 5   Justice Kennedy, the second category of prisoners, those

 6   who are using actual innocence to prove, not their

 7   underlying constitutional claim, but, simply, the Schlup

 8   gateway.   And I would respectfully submit that, even

 9   there, Congress has closed the door with 2244(d)(1)(D).

10                 And the best way to understand that is by

11   looking two subprovisions earlier in the second and

12   successive petitions category.            And this argument that

13   I'm going to make now is a little bit different than the

14   way we -- we did it in the brief, which was -- you know,

15   they had it there, they -- they don't have it here.

16                 If you look at 2244 --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Before you present the

18   argument --

19                 MR. BURSCH:      Yes.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         -- you are saying that

21   Congress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point

22   you're making?

23                 MR. BURSCH:      The -- the contextual point

24   that I was making was that Congress knew about Schlup,

25   it was brought up in the debate that this was,

                                    15

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   essentially, changing the Schlup rule and allowing

 2   someone who claims actual innocence not to present their

 3   claim, and Congress swept those objections aside by a 91

 4   to 8 vote.

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But that was with

 6   respect to successive petitions.

 7                MR. BURSCH:      No, they were talking in the --

 8   the legislative record, just generally, about actual

 9   innocence and claims of miscarriage of justice.

10                So -- so the textual argument that I want to

11   present involving successive petitions is that, when

12   you're looking at 2244, you flow from successive

13   petitions down to the statute of limitations.

14                What that means is that, if you have a

15   successive petition, Congress requires you to prove

16   actual innocence and diligence, and you still have to

17   prove that you satisfied the statute of limitations.

18   The Seventh Circuit recognized this in the Escamilla

19   case.

20                So what that means is that, even when

21   Congress had a situation where they knew that someone

22   had presented evidence that would satisfy a heightened

23   actual innocence standard, they still required that you

24   satisfy the statute of limitations.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where -- where is that in

                                   16

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the text?     What are you relying on in the text of 2244?

 2                  MR. BURSCH:      I'm relying on 2244(b), which

 3   is the successive petition provision.              It requires you

 4   to, first, prove that you've got evidence of actual

 5   innocence and then also demonstrate that you had

 6   diligence.

 7                  And, after you're already gotten through

 8   what I'll call the actual innocence statutory gateway,

 9   you're still required to satisfy the statute of

10   limitations.     If Congress was concerned about Schlup and

11   wanted to make a situation where someone with evidence

12   of actual innocence did not have to comply with the

13   limitations period, they would have put an exception in

14   the successive petition subprovision and they didn't do

15   that, so --

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           You -- you don't have

17   2244(b)in your brief, do you?

18                  MR. BURSCH:      Unfortunately, the text is not

19   there, no.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           That is very -- that is

21   unfortunate.

22                  MR. BURSCH:      Yes.       Well, as we explained in

23   the briefs, the fact --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           If you're relying on it, I

25   mean.

 1                 MR. BURSCH:      Well, as we explained in the

 2   briefs, both parties rely on that.               The fact that you

 3   have an actual innocence exception only two

 4   subprovisions earlier is strong reason to think Congress

 5   didn't intend it here.

 6                 But I'm making a different argument now,

 7   which is --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I'm sorry.   Go

 9   ahead.

10                 MR. BURSCH:      Which is simply that Congress

11   considered the -- the instance where you've establish a

12   statutory actual innocence gateway in (b)(2), the

13   successive petition, and still require that it be timely

14   filed, because the State's interest in having notice and

15   an opportunity to investigate is so important.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:          But are -- are you saying

17   that this case is a fortiori from a successive petition?

18   Because this isn't a successive petition.

19                 MR. BURSCH:      No, this is not.         What I'm

20   using the successive petition provision to demonstrate

21   is that, consistent with the legislative history,

22   Congress is demonstrating here, in 2244(d)(1)(D), that

23   there is no special actual innocence --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You don't see a

25   difference -

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you're saying that

 2   Congress knows how to write --

 3               MR. BURSCH:       Yes, I am --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- an exception if -- if

 5   they want it.   But this (b) does apply to successive

 6   petitions and this is really before that.

 7               MR. BURSCH:       Well, my -- my point is that,

 8   if Congress anticipated that actual innocence could be a

 9   gateway to circumvent the limitations period, then

10   certainly they would have put that exception in the

11   successive petition of (b)(2) where they said, all

12   right, if you establish actual innocence, we're still

13   going to make you comply with the limitations period.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, now, your

15   friend on the other side, I think, argues that that --

16   they put that in expressly because they limited what

17   would be the otherwise applicable miscarriage of justice

18   provision in the question that's before us now.

19               MR. BURSCH:       Right.       And if you would --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What is your -- what

21   is your answer to that?

22               MR. BURSCH:       If he was right about that,

23   then in (b), you would also see another provision that

24   says and anyone who satisfies this statutory actual

25   innocence standard doesn't have to comply with the

                                   19

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   limitations period.      And we think that -- that's

 2   dispositive.

 3                  Now -- you know, when we --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm sorry.   I don't

 5   understand.     I mean, there is a presumption that's been

 6   longstanding that, at least with respect to the filing

 7   of your first petition, that it is a statute of

 8   limitations subject to exceptions, including the

 9   manifest injustice one.

10                  It would seem to me that if they intended

11   not to have that apply, they would have done what they

12   did with the successive petition, but they chose not to.

13                  MR. BURSCH:      Justice Sotomayor, the history

14   of this statute and of the case law isn't quite that

15   way.   And I want to draw a sharp distinction between

16   this case and Holland, with respect to history.              With

17   respect to equitable tolling, you did have decisions

18   going back to the 1800s recognizing that Federal

19   statutes of limitation in all kinds of contexts, civil

20   and criminal, were subject to equitable tolling.

21                  And so then, in Irwin, 6 years before AEDPA,

22   you actually create a presumption that, if Congress

23   doesn't specifically -- you know, exclude equitable

24   tolling --

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm not talking about

                                     20

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   that presumption.

 2               MR. BURSCH:        Right.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            What I'm talking

 4   about --

 5               MR. BURSCH:        Now, I'm going to move to

 6   miscarriage of justice.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- are cause and effect

 8   and manifest injustice.

 9               MR. BURSCH:        Yes.     So the cause and effect,

10   the manifest injustice, the actual innocence, really

11   starts to develop in 1986, and it comes to fruition in

12   Schlup in 1995, right before AEDPA is passed.

13   Importantly, that exception was always applied to

14   court-created procedural bars, never once to a Federal

15   statute of limitations.

16               And, obviously, the separation of powers

17   considerations are quite different when you're talking

18   about a court-created exception to a court-created bar.

19   The first is a bar that's enforced by Congress itself.

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:           But you're creating a world

21   in which this would function as an exception to a State

22   time limit, but not to the AEDPA time limit.

23               MR. BURSCH:        That's correct.

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:           Why does that make any

25   sense?

                                    21

 1                  MR. BURSCH:      Because it was the Court itself

 2   that created the judicial exception to the State filing.

 3   And so then -- or, I'm sorry, that created the bar with

 4   respect to the State filing.             And so then it was

 5   completely within the Court's power to make an exception

 6   to that bar.

 7                  But, again, here, the separation of powers

 8   considerations militate differently when you're talking

 9   about Congress doing the telling, and this Court has

10   acknowledged, in Launcher and Dodd and other places,

11   that Congress gets to set the parameters of habeas.

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:         But I thought we said, in

13   Missouri v. Holland, that AEDPA was -- was enacted

14   against a background rule, which stated that normal

15   equitable principles, such as this one, which had been

16   applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA

17   suggested that those would -- that AEDPA was

18   against a background that those would continue to apply.

19                  MR. BURSCH:      Well, it was a very short

20   background, one with no Irwin-like presumption and one

21   that, again, had never ever been applied to a Federal

22   statute of limitations.         And --

23                  JUSTICE KAGAN:         But why is a Federal statute

24   of limitations any different?

25                  MR. BURSCH:      Because it's Congress and

                                     22

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official


 1   Congress is the one that's handcuffing the Court with

 2   respect to the scope of the --

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Yes, but, again, it's

 4   Congress but we said, in Holland, that it's Congress

 5   and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this

 6   presumption that normal equitable principles would

 7   apply.

 8               MR. BURSCH:      But here's another way to think

 9   about it -- you know, if you imagine the -- the template

10   that you have on your Microsoft Word, when you're doing

11   a document, an opinion, whatever, you've got certain

12   stuff that's on the template.         And you said, in Irwin,

13   that when it comes to equitable tolling, you've always

14   got a subprovision Z, call it, in every Federal statute

15   of limitations that appears on that template, And so

16   Congress has to do something affirmatively to strike

17   that out.

18               Because the miscarriage of justice exception

19   had never been applied to any Federal -- Federal statute

20   of limitations, there wasn't a miscarriage of justice

21   exception sitting on the template.             Congress was writing

22   from scratch.

23               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But, again, why would

24   Congress have thought that there would be any difference

25   in -- with respect to a statute of limitations?

 1               MR. BURSCH:      Well, the biggest reason is

 2   because of the State interest in notice and

 3   investigating the evidence.           When you're talking about

 4   the typical Schlup claim --

 5               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But that applies to States,

 6   as well.

 7               MR. BURSCH:      Well, no, there -- there you

 8   have stale claims, but you don't have stale evidence.

 9   And -- you know, we -- we don't have any problem with

10   litigating a claim that could have been litigated

11   earlier and is going to be litigated now.           But the world

12   of evidence, the record that supports the claim, is

13   already defined and is not going to change.

14               The world we're dealing with in

15   2244(d)(1)(D) is when new stuff has come forward, and,

16   if that new stuff sits in the jailhouse cell for 10, 20,

17   30 years and we don't have an opportunity to talk to

18   those witnesses, to do counter-investigation, then not

19   only are we prejudiced with respect to delay and

20   finality and things like that, but we're prejudiced with

21   respect to the merits determination of what that

22   evidence means.

23               And, when I talked about my three

24   constructs -- you know, this case, here, where you're

25   using the old evidence to establish the underlying

                                  24

 1   claim, that's really the position where the State is in

 2   the worst possible position because, now, you've got

 3   a -- you know, the dry cleaning clerk affidavit -- a

 4   10-year-old affidavit -- we can't possibly cross-examine

 5   her, and, yet, not only is that their gateway, that's

 6   their substantive merits claim about why there is

 7   ineffective assistance of counsel.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Why can't you

 9   cross-examine her?     Is it just because the lapse of time

10   and she won't remember?

11                  MR. BURSCH:      It'll be very difficult.     And

12   there are some examples in the amici briefs of the New

13   York case, for example, where witnesses were completely

14   unavailable.     They had died, or one was out of State

15   and, because of mental infirmities, could not travel.

16                  You know, we all know that, as time passes,

17   evidence deteriorates, whether it's because of -- of

18   death or illness or simply forgetfulness.            I certainly

19   can't remember what I was doing 10 years ago today.            And

20   the affidavit that she submitted was quite short.            And

21   that one affidavit is just a microcosm of the problem

22   when you don't come forward immediately with evidence.

23                  One other point that I want to make, really,

24   on the equities here because we're spending a lot of

25   time on that -

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do you have any idea how

 2   many actual innocence claims win on the underlying

 3   constitutional issue?

 4                  MR. BURSCH:      Right.       The number that win is

 5   small.     But what this case demonstrates is that the

 6   number where it's claimed is very high.                In fact, in

 7   Michigan -- you know, where we deal with procedural

 8   default every day, somewhere between a third and a half

 9   of our petitioners claimed actual innocence, so that

10   they can use Schlup to get past the -- the failure to

11   prove cause and prejudice.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          How many wins on the

13   attempt?

14                  MR. BURSCH:      Well, in the Sixth Circuit, a

15   little more than in some other circuits, but, generally,

16   not very many --

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Not many.

18                  MR. BURSCH:      -- you know.       But this case is

19   the perfect example.       When you cut the court loose from

20   the statutory requirement, you end up with what

21   Justice Alito is describing -- you know, a situation

22   where no one thinks that Mr. Perkins is actually

23   innocent based on this new evidence; at best, it proves

24   that he had a co-conspirator who helped him commit the

25   murder together.

 1           And, yet, now, we've got the Sixth Circuit order,

 2   which purportedly sends us back to the trial court to

 3   do -- you know, who knows what?            I mean, how do you

 4   prove that he's not innocent?          Well, a jury already did

 5   that.

 6                You know, The jury heard all the evidence.

 7   They had a presumption of innocence.            All the

 8   constitutional rules that should have been were applied

 9   to that trial, and the jury said he's guilty, and

10   there's not a presumption of innocence anymore.

11                And -- and the equitable point that I wanted

12   to touch on is that this is not just about prejudicing

13   the State's interest.      If you allow claims like these to

14   go forward, it also prejudices those who have legitimate

15   claims of actual innocence, the needle in the haystack.

16                And Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, in their

17   Herrera concurrence, talked about the haystack problem,

18   that, when you keep adding hay to that pile, not only is

19   it harder to find the needle, the truly meritorious

20   claim, but, at some point, the Federal judges just give

21   up, and they stop looking.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Why -- why is it that

23   the meritorious claim is going to be the one that's

24   going to be hidden?

25                MR. BURSCH:      Because there are so many.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Meaning --

 2                MR. BURSCH:      It's important to understand

 3   that -- that, notwithstanding the limits that Congress

 4   was trying to put on these habeas petitions when it

 5   enacted AEDPA, that we actually have more habeas filings

 6   on an annual basis today than we did before AEDPA was

 7   enacted.   It's not going to stop the filing.

 8                This is just one small rule to cut the

 9   haystack down a little bit and make it that much easier

10   to find the needle.    And, if you can find that

11   occasional needle -- and we submit there's not a lot of

12   those -- Federal judges are going to be more inclined to

13   look for those.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But you would -- you

15   want to keep it out altogether.

16                MR. BURSCH:      No.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You want an actually --

18   potentially actually innocent person not to have --

19                MR. BURSCH:      No, that is not our position.

20   And I want to be really clear about this.             First,

21   they've got the year, but, if they go past the year,

22   they've got the State system.          And what the examples in

23   the amici briefs demonstrate is that --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But they don't have the

25   Federal system.

 1               MR. BURSCH:      No, they don't.

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          As the first habeas.

 3               MR. BURSCH:      But, as the Alabama amici brief

 4   explains, every State has got a process for hearing these

 5   claims, no matter how old they are.             You've also got

 6   the -- the prosecutors who look at these and they don't

 7   want to keep innocent people in jail.

 8               And then, lastly, you've got clemency, which

 9   this Court has always recognized as the remedy for those

10   who assert true, actual innocence, but have no

11   constitutional violation to assert.

12               Unless there are further questions, I would

13   like to reserve the balance of my time.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, counsel.

16               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHAD A. READLER

17                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18               MR. READLER:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

19   and may it please the Court:

20               I would like to start with Justice Kagan's

21   question regarding the important background interpretive

22   principle here that's set out -- set out in Holland.

23   There, the Court held that longstanding equitable rules

24   in the habeas context are incorporated into AEDPA,

25   barring a clear command by Congress to the contrary.

                                  29

 1                  And the longstanding miscarriage of justice

 2   exception has had a well-settled meaning.            It has

 3   allowed petitioners, who can meet the high standing of

 4   showing actual innocence, a procedural gateway around a

 5   procedural bar to allow them to present their otherwise

 6   barred constitutional claims in Federal court.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Before you proceed with

 8   that, can you address Justice Alito's point that the

 9   district court said there is no merit to this; it's not

10   an actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence

11   claim.    And then the Sixth Circuit sends it back for the

12   district court to decide something it's already decided?

13                  How do you overcome that the Sixth Circuit

14   never reviewed the actual innocence question, the

15   district court did and said this doesn't make it?

16                  MR. READLER:      That's correct, Justice

17   Ginsburg.     And, with respect to Justice Alito's

18   question, the reform recommendation from the magistrate

19   denied this petition on statute of limitations grounds

20   solely.     It said it was too late, and it missed the

21   statutory period.

22                  At the district court level, the court held

23   that the statute of limitations was missed and that

24   there was no diligence; the court believed there was a

25   diligence requirement, and so the petition failed for

                                     30

 1   that reason.

 2                  And then, as Justice Alito noted, the court

 3   added some other language, which said -- was not a

 4   weighing of the evidence, but the court said that it

 5   felt that the evidence was not new, in the sense that it

 6   was reasonably -- potentially reasonably known at the

 7   time of trial, which I think is one -- was, one, the

 8   wrong legal standard, but, two, was a misinterpretation

 9   of Schlup because Schlup allows you to consider all the

10   evidence, old and new.

11                  And I don't think that's what the

12   district -- the district court I think applied the wrong

13   legal standard, so it wasn't actually getting to the

14   merits.   It didn't sort of set out all the evidence and

15   weigh them.

16                  And then, Justice Ginsburg, you are correct

17   that this was not part of the certificate of

18   appealability.     The certificate of appealability was

19   limited on the narrow question of whether there was a

20   diligence requirement.

21                  That factual issue was not before the Sixth

22   Circuit and hasn't -- it is not before this Court as

23   well, and what I think this Court should do is what it

24   did in Schlup, which is announce the standard that

25   would apply and then it remanded the case back to the

                                     31

 1   district court for application of the correct standards.

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, I don't understand

 3   that.     The district court -- or you seem to suggest the

 4   district court was wrong in saying that there wasn't

 5   sufficient evidence for an actual innocence claim.

 6   Maybe that's the case.        Maybe it was wrong.

 7                  But, if it decided that issue and the issue

 8   wasn't appealed, then the issue is settled.               And that's

 9   the problem that I see.         Now, how do you get around

10   that?

11                  MR. READLER:      Right.       Justice Alito, I don't

12   read the Sixth -- or I don't read the district court as

13   actually getting to the merits.              I think it applied a

14   wrong legal rule and said, I can't even consider the

15   evidence because it's not new evidence.              I think that

16   was an erroneous interpretation.

17                  Under Schlup, the -- the Court has said many

18   times that the court can consider all the evidence old

19   and new.     And I think that case really turns on the --

20   the equitable tolling of --

21                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Did you ask for a

22   certificate -- what other issues did you ask for a

23   certificate of appealability on?

24                  MR. READLER:      Well, our client was acting

25   pro se.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:         What -- what other issues

 2   did he ask for a certificate on?

 3                MR. READLER:      Justice Alito, I don't -- I

 4   don't have that in front of me.            I don't recall the full

 5   contours of what he requested.           The certificate -- the

 6   Sixth Circuit granted it on the one narrow issue of

 7   whether diligence was a requirement.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Counsel, you say, on

 9   page 17 of your brief, that this Court has applied the

10   manifest-injustice exception to limits created by

11   Congress.   What's your best case for that?

12                MR. READLER:      Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

13   Those cases are on pages 36 to 38 of the red brief, and

14   I think my friend and I have a disagreement here.              It's

15   true that the -- the rule has never been applied to the

16   statute of limitations because there was no statute of

17   limitations for AEDPA before the statute, but the Court

18   has applied the exception to acts of Congress.              It did

19   so in Sanders.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             What -- what do you

21   mean, acts of Congress?       Your sentence says, applied at

22   the limits created by Congress.            I read that to mean

23   statutes of limitations.       But that's wrong?

24                MR. READLER:      Mr. Chief Justice, that --

25   that's incorrect, in the sense that there was no Federal

                                   33

 1   statute of limitations before AEDPA, but the Court had

 2   applied the miscarriage of justice exception to acts of

 3   Congress.    So, for instance, in Sanders, the -- Congress

 4   had included, in 2244, an ends-of-justice provision

 5   which seemed to allow the Court to consider the ends of

 6   justice when considering whether to hear a successive

 7   petition, which is, essentially, the equivalent of

 8   miscarriage of justice.

 9                  It did not include that language in 2255,

10   and, yet, the Court read 2255 as also including the

11   ends-of-justice requirement, hence the miscarriage of

12   justice, even though the language wasn't there.

13                  In Kuhlmann --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             With 2255 -- remind

23   respect to the time limits?

24                  MR. READLER:      There were -- there were --

25   there was language in both -- in both statutes regarding

                                     34

 1   when you could bring a successive petition.               The -- the

 2   statute that applied to petitions out of State judgment,

 3   2254, included an ends-of-justice provision, which said

 4   the court could consider the ends of justice in deciding

 5   whether to take a second or successive petition.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             So -- so, when you

 7   said limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant

 8   substantive limits?

 9                MR. READLER:      Substantive -- well, no.

10   Procedural limits, procedural limits on -- procedural

11   limits.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Procedural limits.

13   Do you have a case that applies it to time limits?

14   Which, of course, is the question we have here.

15                MR. READLER:      We do.       In -- in -- now, these

16   would be State time limits, but --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Right.   But you said

18   limits created by Congress.            So just -- I mean, I should

19   read "limits created by Congress" not to mean time

20   limits, but procedural or other limits.

21                MR. READLER:      Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there

22   have never been any time limits --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Right.   And I guess

24   that's the point of my questioning and your friend's

25   position.   There have never been any time limits created

 1   by Congress that have been abrogated by a

 2   manifest-injustice exception.

 3                MR. READLER:        I think I can agree with that

 4   because there was never a statute of limitations before

 5   AEDPA.   But --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Right.   And the

 7   difference is, in Holland, we are dealing with equitable

 8   tolling, which had applied as far back as -- you know,

 9   whatever the law goes to limitations; in other words,

10   equitable tolling, which is different from the

11   abrogation, I think, that you are asking for.

12                MR. READLER:        Well, I don't think so,

13   Mr. Chief Justice.     Two responses, first, with respect

14   to the timing issue, the Court had applied the

15   miscarriage-of-justice exception to abusive petitions.

16                So there is a timing concern invoked there

17   because you're filing a second petition when you could

18   have raised issues earlier.              And the Court has said,

19   even in that timing context, not a statute of

20   limitations, but it certainly invokes timing concerns,

21   that even, in that instance, the miscarriage of justice

22   would still overcome the rule.

23                Now, what --

24                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, you are asking for

25   what is, potentially, a very big exception to the 1-year

 1   statute of limitations.       If you took a poll of all of

 2   the prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think

 3   would say they are actually innocent?

 4                MR. READLER:      Justice Alito, I suspect very

 5   few of them could credibly say --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         "Very few" would say they

 7   are actually innocent?

 8                MR. READLER:      Well, I haven't done that

 9   study.   I suspect very few of them would say that

10   they -- credibly say that they are actually innocent.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:         Oh, "credibly say."   But how

12   many would say that they are actually innocent?           A lot.

13   And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is

14   equal to -- to what the petition -- what the Respondent

15   here has come up with.

16                Now, do you think it's -- it's plausible

17   that Congress, in establishing this new 1-year statute

18   of limitations, because it doesn't want these things to

19   drag on indefinitely, intended to create an exemption

20   that broad, so that anybody who claims to be actually

21   innocent can at least get over -- can get to the point

22   where the Court has to decide whether the -- has to

23   weigh this evidence of actual innocence, to see whether

24   it -- it gets over the threshold?

25                MR. READLER:      Sure -

                                   37

 1                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Is that plausible, given

 2   what Congress was trying to do in AEDPA?

 3                  MR. READLER:      Absolutely, Justice Alito, for

 4   two reasons.     First of all, the background presumption,

 5   of course, given the established nature of this

 6   exception -- in fact, on Mr. Chief Justice's question,

 7   while this exception, as compared to equitable tolling

 8   in the criminal context, I think is actually more

 9   important because it goes to the ultimate equity, and

10   that is innocence.

11                  But the background presumption is that

12   Congress includes these foundational equitable rules, of

13   which the miscarriage of justice exception is absolutely

14   one of them, unless Congress expressly says otherwise.

15                  Now, Justice Alito, no -- no petitioner is

16   going to want to find themselves in the Schlup world,

17   where they missed the statute of limitations.             It is not

18   a place they are going to want to be.             They are going to

19   absolutely want to file within a year, if they can.

20                  Sometimes, they miss that -- that period,

21   and what the Court has said, in those rare circumstances

22   where you can make a credible, compelling showing of

23   actual innocence, we will allow you around the statute

24   of limitations.     But no petitioner wants to be in that

25   circumstance because the Schlup standard is so high.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, it's -- I'm

 2   not sure that's right.       They don't want to definitely

 3   file within one year, if they don't have anything to

 4   say.   You know, if it takes a certain amount of time

 5   before they either acquire it legitimately or can find

 6   somebody or -- I don't know, in this case -- you know,

 7   the codefendant dies, everybody has no reason any

 8   more -- you know, to object and pin it on him.

 9                 There are a lot of reasons that it's in some

10   of these prisoners' interest to drag things out and then

11   to file.   They don't have anything to say within the one

12   year and need time to either, from your point of view,

13   legitimately develop the evidence or, from your friend's

14   point of view, to concoct it.

15                 MR. READLER:      Well -- and the statue speaks

16   to that.   I mean, I think we do have a disagreement on

17   the interpretation of the statute, but Section

18   2244(d)(1)(D) does speak to the discovery of new

19   evidence which goes to support a claim.               I think

20   Congress --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         And the statute of

22   limitations would run from the discovery of the new

23   evidence, not from --

24                 MR. READLER:      That's -- that's correct,

25   Justice Ginsburg, to the extent that the evidence goes

                                    39

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   to support a claim.    Congress included a typical

 2   discovery rule.   If you've discovered new evidence

 3   that -- that supports the factual underpinnings of your

 4   claim, that starts the one-year period over again.

 5               But, critically -- and I think my friend and

 6   I have a disagreement here -- critically, with respect

 7   to that provision, if you find evidence that solely goes

 8   to your innocence, that provision is not triggered,

 9   meaning you don't get another year if you find

10   completely exculpatory evidence that shows you're not

11   innocent, you don't -- you don't necessarily get another

12   year.

13               And there's a hypothetical I can give you.

14   If your underlying claim is a Batson claim, a

15   structural error claim, and you fail to raise it, and

16   you missed the one-year limitations period, but then, 10

17   years later, you find DNA evidence that completely

18   exonerates your client that was unknown to anyone, so

19   it's not the basis for an IEC claim, it's not the basis

20   for prosecutorial misconduct, in that instance, the

21   statute doesn't start the limitations period over.

22               You're entirely out of luck, which is why

23   Congress had to have meant to include the absolute --

24   the innocence exception for just that kind of case, so

25   that that petitioner at least has the ability to try to

                                   40

 1   meet the Schlup standard.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:         But that's very odd because,

 3   if you have somebody who's actually innocent, then

 4   you're saying that person can't get out of prison,

 5   unless the person happens to have a good constitutional

 6   claim that's totally unrelated to the fact that the

 7   person is actually innocent.

 8               That's just very odd, isn't it.

 9               MR. READLER:      Well, I don't think so,

10   Justice Alito, in the sense that all this is, is a

11   gateway to allow them their first opportunity to bring a

12   Federal habeas petition.      Ordinarily, they're out of

13   luck.

14               But, if they brought evidence that is so

15   compelling, that shows that there may well have been a

16   miscarriage of justice because this person has shown,

17   under the Schlup standard that they're actually innocent,

18   then, in that instance, the Court has always said that

19   we're going to allow those claims to be heard, at least

20   in the first instance, by -- by a Federal court for a

21   first petition.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Your friend responds

23   to that point, I think, by saying that every State

24   allows collateral review in that instance and that what

25   we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second

 1   bite at the apple -- or a third bite at the apple, I

 2   guess, by -- by assumption, in the Federal system.

 3                MR. READLER:      Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm

 4   not sure that's practical, to the extent that we've

 5   already raised our underlying constitutional claims in

 6   the State court.   Those have been exhausted.             So the

 7   Michigan rule, as I read it, doesn't allow us to go back

 8   to State court and present our constitutional claims

 9   again.   They've already been adjudicated.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             What about the

11   actual innocence claim?

12                MR. READLER:      The innocence evidence may --

13   you may be able to pursue that under -- under the --

14   under the State rule, but that is more akin to a

15   freestanding --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Is that the most --

17   is that the most -- I thought I understood your friend

18   to say -- he can correct me if I'm wrong -- that every

19   State has an avenue for considering that.

20                MR. READLER:      Well, two responses.         One, I

21   think every State has different rules and so this -- the

22   application of the exception is never turned on sort of

23   what the alternative potential State rule is.              That

24   wasn't -- that was true in House and true in Schlup,

25   where there were State alternatives.

                                 Official


 1                But, two, those State alternatives go to

 2   freestanding innocence claims, where you're not --

 3   you're not alleging that there's an underlying

 4   constitutional violation.

 5                What you're saying is similar to Herrera,

 6   and that is that I have evidence that shows, setting

 7   aside any error of the trial, no errors, I have evidence

 8   that shows I'm innocent.       That's a completely different

 9   concept.   And what we're getting at here is the case

10   where you wanted evidence of innocence and, two, have a

11   constitutionally corrupt trial -- or at least an

12   allegation of a constitutionally corrupt trial.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, I see --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, assuming for the sake

15   of argument that there is this exception, why shouldn't

16   diligence be required?      How can it be equitable to allow

17   someone to bring a claim when the person has --

18   involving new evidence, when the person has not been

19   diligent in presenting this new evidence to the court?

20                MR. READLER:      Well, Justice Alito, for

21   decades, this Court has never required diligence and, in

22   fact, in McCloskey, has expressly rejected it, and the

23   Court has noted that diligence has not historically been

24   required under the standard because, as the Court said

25   in House and Calderon, that Congress raised the bar in

                                   43

 1   two places on the statute.

 2               But the reason why is because, as

 3   Justice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion with --

 4   with -- in Withrow, with Chief Justice Rehnquist, is

 5   that innocence is the ultimate equity.             And it trumps --

 6   diligence is not the ultimate equity, it's innocence.

 7               And if -- if a petitioner can come forward

 8   and make a credible showing of actual innocence, that,

 9   standing alone, has always been enough to allow a

10   Federal court to at least go ahead and then reach the

11   underlying claim.

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You have a larger -- you

14   have a larger category, you say miscarriage of justice,

15   so one is actual innocence.             You say the category is

16   well defined.    So what else would fit under this -- and

17   we can bring it up very late in the -- in the day.

18   Anything else other than actual innocence would be in

19   this category?

20               MR. READLER:        Justice Ginsburg, I think the

21   Court has always treated the phrase "miscarriage of

22   justice" as synonymous with actual innocence, and

23   that's -- that's the one thing it's getting at.             It's a

24   narrow exception, it's difficult to meet, but -- but

25   it's always included cases where you can make -

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           A juror who's bribed, is

 6   there no -- no miscarriage of justice there?

 8   be the basis for a habeas claim.

 9                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But we're -- we're talking

10   about the meaning of the term "miscarriage of justice."

15   term of art?     Fine.

16                  MR. READLER:      Justice Kennedy, I'm relying

17   on the Court's decades of decisions, many of which

18   you've written in this area, where they've described

19   miscarriage of justice in the habeas setting as the

20   equivalent of incarceration of an innocent person, and

 2   correct, then suppose that he purposely has delayed

 3   filing this until everybody's dead, so they know they

 4   can't prove it anymore.

14   analysis, so --

10   facts.   I suspect he's going to lose.

12   hypothetical.

15   facts, I'm going to say he loses at the Schlup stage

16   because Schlup, which is, one, an incredibly high bar to

17   meet, but, two, the Court expressly said, at page 322 of

18   the opinion, that it could consider the timing of the

19   evidence when it's submitted.

21   game-playing that petitioner may engage in when they're

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           So the State is asking for

12   a diligence requirement.       You admit that there's a

13   requirement that -- that you have to not really use this

14   as a sham device, so we're pretty close.

15                MR. READLER:      Well, there's -- there's never

16   been a diligence requirement in this setting because

17   that's not been the focus.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But there has --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:           But there is a sham --

20   there is a sham and deliberate delay requirement, not a

21   diligence one, but there is a sham.             I'm not trying to

22   trick you.

23                MR. READLER:      No, but --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           What I'm trying to say is

25   maybe we're arguing about something that we could solve;

                                   49

 1   that is, in fact, many of these people don't have

 2   lawyers.     They don't understand the statute of

 3   limitations, they don't understand what diligence might

 4   consist of looking later.          You agree that it's -- it

 5   shouldn't be a sham, shouldn't do it deliberately.

 6                  All right.     Now, if I'm thinking about that,

 7   how would you advise me to write it?

 8                  MR. READLER:      I think -- I think the Court

 9   can just build on the principles it's already set

10   forward in Schlup and other places, and that is, that

11   there's never been a diligence requirement in this

12   setting.

13                  And Congress, by the way, did not -- the

14   Congress -- the intent of Congress was not to include a

15   diligence requirement here because, in two places, it

16   did include a diligence requirement with respect to

17   successive petitions or evidentiary hearings, so

18   congressional intent was not to include diligence --

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But there has always

20   been a laches defense until Rule 9(a) was rescinded.

21                  MR. READLER:      That's correct, Justice

22   Sotomayor.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          All right.   So there's

24   been some form -- not of due diligence, but some form of

25   check on a prisoner waiting so long that a State can't

                                     50

 1   respond, the -- Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

 2                  So he's asking you, I think, to tell us how

 3   to write it.     So do we write it by saying there's no

 4   diligence requirement -- but there is a sort of common

 5   law laches, although that's a hard argument to make

 6   because it was based on 9(a) until recently.

 7                  Or do we just say it's equity, and equity

 8   would suggest that, if it's contrived -- the delay is

 9   contrived, that the evidence is suspect and doesn't --

10   and shouldn't be credited.

11                  MR. READLER:      Absolutely.       Two responses.

12   First, just with respect to Rule 9(a), Chief Justice

13   Burger, in a concurring opinion to a dissent in

14   Spalding, said that even a laches rule would give way,

15   if there was a colorable showing of actual innocence.

16                  With respect to the rule I'd write, I would

17   write the rule that is essentially already in place, and

18   that is that the miscarriage of justice exception does

19   not turn on diligence; it turns on whether you can show

20   innocence.

21                  And in -- in attempting to show innocence

22   under Schlup, this timing -- the timing of the

23   submissions is a consideration.              So if there's -- if

24   there's been a delay that, somehow, hurts the State

25   because a witness has died or that it appears to be that

                                     51

 1   that's the fault -- or that the petitioner was playing

 2   games in that context, I think that's a fair

 3   consideration under Schlup.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How about --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So is this

 6   established after -- after some kind of evidentiary

 7   hearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular

 8   purpose or not?

 9               MR. READLER:         Well, it depends.         If -- if

10   the petition is filed 3 weeks after the star witness

11   dies, presumably, the State will come back in their

12   petition and note, one, all the evidence that they think

13   goes against the -- the petitioner's claim, but, also,

14   they'll note that this happened, and the court could

15   resolve it at that stage, too.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why -- why did your

17   client wait 5 years after the last affidavit?

18               MR. READLER:         A number of reasons,

19   Mr. Chief Justice.     One, he was looking for counsel to

20   assist him; two, he continued to look for evidence;

21   three, he didn't have access to his legal papers.                Many

22   of his legal papers were lost in a prison riot and then

23   a flood that occurred at this prison, so he didn't have

24   access to those and had to regain those.

25               For a period of time, he was denied access

                                     52

 1   to the library and to a legal writer.          So there were a

 2   culmination of reasons why he didn't do this, but I

 3   think two of the critical ones were looking for counsel

 4   and trying to develop more evidence.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, as your -- as your

 6   adversary says, there's nothing really procedurally

 7   complicated about filing a Federal habeas.          There --

 8   there are forms -- I've read hundreds of them -- that

 9   have been filed by pro se petitioners, and there is

10   nothing technical about claiming, "I'm innocent of this

11   offense."

12               This isn't a legal issue.          It's something

13   anybody can understand.      I've got an -- I've got my

14   sister's affidavit, I have an affidavit by a third

15   person, I have an affidavit by -- by a person who worked

16   in the dry cleaning shop that shows that I'm actually

17   innocent.

18               Why doesn't -- what is the reason for

19   waiting 5 years to file that?

20               MR. READLER:      Well, Justice Alito, no -- no

21   rational petitioner is going to want to wait in that

22   period because, if they file within the 1-year period,

23   they go straight to review on their habeas claims, and

24   they don't have to worry about any procedural gateway.

25               So -- so no rational -

                                  53

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:     But I just -- I don't understand

 2   your answer about why it took him 5 years from the --

 3   from obtaining the last affidavit to the filing of the

 4   Federal habeas.    You said he couldn't get a lawyer.            He

 5   really didn't need a lawyer to do this.             He didn't have

 6   access to a library.     This isn't a legal issue -- isn't

 7   a complicated legal issue.       It's a factual issue, that

 8   anybody who watches detective shows on TV can

 9   understand.

10                 MR. READLER:     Well -- and, Justice Alito,

11   you're right, we're not arguing for equitable tolling

12   here, in the sense that he could have filed earlier.

13   There wasn't -- there wasn't a State impediment that

14   stood in his way the entire period of time.             And he

15   should have filed it earlier, and had he filed earlier,

16   then he would have gone straight to consideration of his

17   underlying habeas claims and wouldn't have to worry

18   about this high hurdle of satisfying --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:     But you think that Congress,

20   which, in AEDPA, was trying to speed all this up and get

21   rid of the delay and make things simpler, intended to

22   allow that?    You could wait 5 years, you could wait 10

23   years, you could wait 15 years; it doesn't matter?

24   That's what AEDPA was intended to do?

25                 MR. READLER:     Well, no, Justice Alito,



                                       54

                                  Official


 1   you're correct that AEDPA was intended to delay -- or to

 2   end delay when possible -- but, as the Court said in

 3   Holland, AEDPA was not meant to end every delay at all

 4   costs.    I think this is exactly the situation it had in

 5   mind.

 6                 In Calderon, the Court recognized that the

 7   miscarriage of justice exception is consistent with

 8   AEDPA because -- because it arises so rarely that, in

 9   the vast majority of cases, the finality and comity

10   concerns that the State has are honored because there's

11   no -- there's no additional proceeding, the petitioner

12   will not meet the high Schlup standard, and the case

13   will end.

14                 But, in the rare case where a petitioner can

15   satisfy Schlup, the Court has always said that the

16   courthouse doors, in that circumstance, will be open to

17   review of your first Federal petition.              And that --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         The Second Circuit --

19   when it had a similar case, the Second Circuit itself

20   said that actual innocence is rare.              This is such a

21   case.    This is a case where the alibi that he had was --

22   it was established by forensic evidence, air-tight, he

23   was someplace else.     The -- the Second Circuit didn't

24   send it to the district court to decide the actual

25   innocence.

                                    55

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1                 It decided that itself and then said,

 2   district court, now you deal with the -- with the

 3   questions that the petitioner is raising -- the

 4   constitutional questions.         But the Sixth Circuit just

 5   seemed to be -- it didn't matter whether -- it didn't

 6   matter whether the actual innocence claim had any solid

 7   basis, when they sent it back to the district court.

 8                 Shouldn't -- if there is an actual innocence

 9   gateway, shouldn't the court of appeals determine that

10   before it returns the case to the district court?

11                 MR. READLER:      I think, ordinarily, yes.       The

12   Sixth Circuit said, here, that there was a gateway, and

13   it was remanding the case back to the district court --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Yes, but it didn't find

15   anything about whether this was -- this claim was -- was

16   a good one.

17                 MR. READLER:      That's correct.     That's

18   correct --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         And I'm still puzzled

20   about what happens next.        The case goes back to the

21   district court and the -- the district court is told,

22   diligence doesn't matter.         The district court says, yes,

23   but I thought -- I thought that the claim was worthless.

24                 MR. READLER:      Well, it's correct that the

25   case should be remanded back to the district court, just

                                    56

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   like this case -- just like the Court did in Schlup,

 2   where it announced the standard and remanded back to the

 3   district court for application.

 4               But, here, I disagree with that reading of

 5   the underlying opinion, in that the Court doesn't set

 6   out in sort of weighing all the evidence and saying,

 7   here's what I find in favor of the petitioner and here's

 8   what I find in favor of the State.              What the district

 9   court said is that -- it said the timing of the evidence

10   was somehow a problem because the information was known

11   at trial, which I think is, again, wrong for two

12   reasons.

13               I think the petitioner has -- is able to use

14   the information because the problem for us was his

15   attorney was told about some of these things, but didn't

16   actually assert them -- or didn't interview one of the

17   key witnesses.   One of the affiants was on the

18   prosecution's witness list, and my client's lawyer

19   didn't even interview that person, let alone call them.

20               And then the court -- I think the court --

21   the trial court misunderstood Schlup because Schlup

22   allows you to consider all the evidence, old and new,

23   make appropriate credibility determinations, consider

24   the timeliness of the evidence, and determine whether

25   that standard has been met.

                                   57

 1                And I think that's what should happen here

 2   for the -- for the first time, in our view.                And there

 3   is a question -- there was a question, earlier, with

 4   respect to how often the Schlup standard is met.                In

 5   response to the reply brief, we did a search of circuit

 6   courts.   And we found, since Schlup was decided, eight

 7   circuits that have upheld or have found that Schlup was

 8   satisfied.

 9                If you add in House, then that adds nine

10   appellate cases where Schlup was satisfied.                So it's --

11   it's a narrow range of cases.            It shouldn't be difficult

12   to meet, but we --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, but, I mean,

14   the whole question -- and your friend made the -- made

15   the point -- the question is how many are filed, in how

16   many cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's

17   upheld.

18                MR. READLER:        Sure.       Mr. Chief Justice, I

19   suspect, no matter the rules, there will always be

20   filings by petitioners, and many of those may be

21   frivolous.   But, as the Court has said in Panetti and

22   other cases -- you know, unmeritorious petitions can be

23   dismissed at the earliest course, and it's consistent

24   with Habeas Rule 4.

25                That's what should happen in this instance,

                                     58

 1   too.   But it's -- and it's awfully --

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             How do you know

 3   which of these are meritorious and which aren't?                Is

 4   this the meritorious -- I assume you think this is a

 5   meritorious one?

 6                  (Laughter.)

 7                  MR. READLER:      We -- we do,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice.

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             And your friend says

10   nobody can reasonably think this person is innocent.

11   Maybe he has constitutional claims.                But, if you look at

12   the evidence, is this something, at the -- a preliminary

13   stage, you look and say, oh, this guy's clearly

14   innocent, and this goes forward?

15                  Or is it one that you can cast aside?

16                  MR. READLER:      I don't think it's one you can

17   cast aside.     I think you -- you have to give this more

18   development.     And, by the way, he was proceeding pro se.

19   I think, when he -- when the case is remanded, with

20   assistance of counsel, he can present -- better present

21   the evidence and better present some other things, to

22   make -- make the showing stronger.                And I think we can

23   meet the Schlup standard.

24                  If there are no further questions, we'd ask

25   that the Sixth Circuit be affirmed.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 2               Mr. Bursch, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 3              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5               MR. BURSCH:       Three brief points about

 6   Holland and some closing thoughts about diligence.

 7               With respect to Holland, I want to note,

 8   first of all, that, there, you were dealing with

 9   legislative silence.     Everyone agreed that Congress had

10   not said anything about equitable tolling.

11               And, as I explained earlier, when you

12   consider the three categories of defendants who claim

13   actual innocence based on new evidence, this situation

14   here, where the new evidence relates to the factual

15   predicate of the constitutional claim asserted, that's

16   where Congress, most clearly, meant to have the

17   limitations period apply.

18               So it's very different.              With respect to

19   equitable tolling applying to acts of Congress, everyone

20   recognizes that.   Mr. Chief Justice, you note that this

21   has never been applied to limitations.              I actually have

22   to take issue with my friend's statement that Sanders

23   and Kuhlmann, somehow, took a different tack because, in

24   both of those cases, what Congress did is it left it to

25   the district judge's discretion to do or not do

                                   60

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   something.

 2                And all this Court said was, well, if

 3   they've got discretion, then they can still have an

 4   equitable exception.      So, even in those cases, this

 5   miscarriage of justice exception has never, ever been

 6   used to override a congressional act.

 7                The last thing is that, in equitable

 8   tolling, you are dealing with the fault of the

 9   petitioner -- Hurricane Katrina or something else

10   happened that wasn't their fault.                And, here, it's

11   entirely within the Petitioner's control.

12                All they have to do is print the form, check

13   the boxes, attach the evidence, and then file the claim.

14   And they have an unlimited time to find evidence and

15   then, 1 year after that, to file.

16                Now, with respect to diligence --

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:          General, you had suggested,

18   earlier, some way out of this puzzle about why Congress

19   would have put the actual innocence exception into the

20   second successive petition provision and not had one for

21   a first petition?

22                MR. BURSCH:       Yes.

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:          So that seems really quite

24   odd to me.   I mean, a number of my colleagues have said,

25   well, can we really believe that Congress contemplated

                                    61

 1   this.   But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress

 2   contemplated it in the second and successive context, a

 3   slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to

 4   say that Congress contemplated an actual innocence

 5   exception when you are on your second petition, but

 6   barred it when you are on your first?

 7                What sense would that be?

 8                MR. BURSCH:      Yeah, let me explain that and

 9   I'm glad you raised that because -- you know, besides

10   the legislative history that informs what we are looking

11   at here, what they did in 2244(d)(1)(D) is they made it

12   broader.   They said, even if you don't claim innocence,

13   if you are coming forward with new evidence, we want the

14   court to hear that constitutional claim, if you bring it

15   within one year.

16                The reason they didn't mention it there is

17   because it would have made the provision narrower, and

18   they didn't want to do that.           Then they ratcheted it up

19   with respect to successive petitions, making you pass

20   through the successive petition actual innocence gateway

21   and then comply with the limitations period, so that's

22   the explanation, consistent were with legislative

23   history.

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, I guess I'm just not

25   sure I understand that.       I mean, they could have added a

                                   62

 1   separate provision, just saying there's an actual

 2   innocence exception, or there is -- there's not,

 3   consistent with the way they did it in the -- in the

 4   second and successive petition.

 5                MR. BURSCH:   Right, they could have, but,

 6   again, that would have limited (d)(1)(D).

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:    Well, it didn't have to.

 8   Why would it have necessarily have limited (d)(1)(D)?

 9                MR. BURSCH:   Well, if they said there is an

10   exception for those who claim actual innocence, the

11   implication is, for those who don't claim actual

12   innocence, you are out of luck.

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:    Well, you just you make the

14   converse clear.

15                MR. BURSCH:   Well, if we could rewrite

16   congressional statutes with hindsight -- you know, maybe

17   we could draft a perfect statute.

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:    All I'm suggesting is that your

19   interpretation of the statute creates a glaring anomaly

20   that people would be out of court on the first petition,

21   and they could turn around on their second petition,

22   which is usually disfavored, and get an actual innocence

23   exception.

24                MR. BURSCH:   No, that -- that's not the way

25   that we interpret this at all.           Under either provision,



                                     63

 1   you are stuck with (d)(1)(D), you have got to file

 2   within a year.     All that the successive petition adds to

 3   it is that you do have a statutory actual innocence

 4   gateway to pass through first that you don't have on your

 5   first petition.     That's our position.

 6                I do want to close with some thoughts about

 7   diligence.   You know, looking for counsel, we've talked

 8   about how simple it is to -- to file these things.              The

 9   papers lost in the -- the prison riot and the access to

10   the library are related, and it's because Defendant

11   Perkins incited the prison riot, so he is hardly in an

12   equitable position of -- of claiming any tolling benefit

13   from that.

14                And with respect to the -- the rule,

15   Justice Breyer, we can't have a diligence rule if you go

16   to that point, based on intent, because the interest

17   that is being vindicated here is not the purpose of the

18   Petitioner in --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:             What do you think about the

20   words "discovered in exercise of due diligence"?              You

21   know, you could manipulate those words so as to deal

22   with the circumstance of the -- say, below-average IQ

23   person who doesn't have a lawyer, who isn't certain

24   about what to do, and what counts as diligence and

25   discovery in that case.

                                     64

 1               Is that -- are you objecting to that?             Do

 2   you object to that?   What do you think?

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Go ahead, briefly.

 4               MR. BURSCH:      Sure.      As long as it takes into

 5   account that the State's interest in timeliness is at

 6   its apex when we are dealing with new evidence that

 7   relates to the actual constitutional claim.             And they

 8   are asking for -- not equitable tolling, but

 9   extraordinary tolling that you should reject.

10               Thank you. 


11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, counsel. 


12               The case is submitted. 


13               (Whereupon at 11:01 a.m. the case in the
