 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. GUERRA:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The government claims in this case that

11   Congress decided to treat retaliation against Federal

12   workers who complain of age discrimination differently

13   than every other species of retaliatory conduct, that

14   for age-based retaliation alone Congress created a

15   four-part patchwork scheme in which a small cadre of

16   Federal employees have a full judicial remedy, but tens

17   of thousands of others who suffer retaliatory conduct

18   have absolutely no remedies at all.

19              This scheme is inconsistent with over three

20   decades of administrative interpretations by the

21   agencies charged with administering and enforcing the

22   statute and it is flatly inconsistent, most importantly,

23   with the plain language and historical origins of the

24   statute itself.    By its plain terms, Section 633a(a)

25   bars retaliation against covered workers who have


                                         3

 1   complained that have they suffered age discrimination.

 2   Such retaliation is directed at persons over --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.      By its plain

 4   terms?

 5              MR. GUERRA:        Yes, Justice Scalia.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Read it to me, would you?

 7              MR. GUERRA:        The provision is:           "All

 8   personnel actions shall be made" -- "affecting covered

 9   employees shall be made free from any discrimination

10   based on age."

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is retaliation

12   discrimination based on age?            I can see your argument

13   that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain

14   language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary.                  The

15   plain language doesn't cover it.

16              MR. GUERRA:        With respect, Justice Scalia, I

17   submit it does cover it for at least three reasons.

18   First of all discrimination -- retaliatory conduct aimed

19   at a 40-year-old or someone over age 40 because he or

20   she is asserting rights she possesses by virtue of being

21   age 40 or older is discrimination based on age.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, it's not.    I

23   mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody

24   who complains about anything and the fact that a worker

25   is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he


                                       4

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is being fired because of age.

 2              MR. GUERRA:         Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in

 3   this case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and

 4   ultimately prove that she was -- she suffered adverse

 5   personnel actions because she complained of age

 6   discrimination.   It may be that in some, that in a

 7   certain case the employer could demonstrate that in fact

 8   the retaliatory conduct was not triggered by the nature

 9   of the complaint, and in fact there have been Title VII

10   cases where the courts have found that it was the manner

11   in which a complaint was lodged, that there was, that

12   there was false statements or it was too inflammatory,

13   and so the employer prevailed.

14              But if -- the issue here is whether, if

15   Ms. Gomez can prove ultimately that the retaliatory

16   conduct was a function of the fact that as a 40-year-old

17   she was asserting her rights to be free from age

18   discrimination, we submit that is covered by the plain

19   language of the statute.         And that is confirmed by this

20   court's interpretation of Title IX in the Jackson case

21   because there the Court --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Of course the

23   statute that covers age discrimination in the private

24   sector does have an express provision addressing

25   retaliation.   The one that governs Federal employees


                                        5

 1   does not, and that's the government's main argument,

 2   that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not

 3   there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply

 4   one.   What's your answer to that?

 5               MR. GUERRA:          Mr. Chief Justice, three

 6   responses to that.      First of you, as this Court

 7   explained in Jackson itself, it's improper to narrow the

 8   scope of a stand-alone general discrimination ban that

 9   does not identify any discriminatory practices based on

10   a comparison with an enumeration ban that sets forth a

11   detailed series of prohibitions.                 And that's precisely

12   the comparison that the Court rejected in Jackson and

13   the government is asking the court to draw here.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:               But in Jackson it was in a

15   different statute and here it's in the same statute.

16   Surely that makes a big difference.

17               MR. GUERRA:          It doesn't in this case,

18   Justice Scalia, for two reasons.                 First of all,

19   subsection (f) of section 633a effectively deems the

20   private sector and the Federal sector provisions of the

21   Age Act to be the functional equivalents of two separate

22   statutes.   So I think that distinction is refuted by

23   that provision.   But more fundamentally, the

24   government's argument --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:               I'm not familiar with that


                                          6

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   provision.    What does that provision say?

 2                 MR. GUERRA:       That is the provision that the

 3   government cites in its brief and it provides that:

 4   "Any personnel action of any department, agency, or

 5   other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this

 6   section shall not be subject to or affected by any

 7   provision of this chapter other than the provisions of

 8   Section 631b of this title."             And the government's

 9   position is that that provision makes these statutory

10   schemes utterly distinct from one another.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, no.        I mean, they're

12   all in the same, in the same statute, and what that

13   provision says is that just because we give certain

14   relief in, in the portion applicable to private

15   discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief

16   in the section applicable to government discrimination,

17   where it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be

18   explicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although

19   it's explicitly included for private discrimination.                   I

20   think that's the only sensible way to read that

21   provision.    It surely doesn't make two statutes out of,

22   out of one.    It is simply one statute.

23                 MR. GUERRA:       Justice Scalia, if I may, two

24   points.   One is it's clear that the scope of the

25   language of 633a(a) is broader in its own right than


                                         7
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   623a, which is the -- or 623a and 623b operate in

 2   conjunction with each other.               So we know that the

 3   stand-alone prohibition in the Federal sector side is

 4   intended to be broader than the -- the discrimination

 5   ban of 623(a).    So it's not anomalous at all to conclude

 6   that because it sweeps more broadly and because it's not

 7   limited by any other provision that operates in

 8   conjunction with it, that there's no basis for drawing a

 9   negative inference.

10              JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, why would Congress

11   have taken this drafting approach?                   The private sector

12   provisions were already in existence when it made the

13   statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a

14   specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the

15   private sector.   If Congress wanted to carry that over

16   to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either

17   copied that or incorporated it?                And they did neither,

18   and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the

19   private sector provisions are not incorporated unless

20   they're specifically noted.               And this isn't one of the

21   ones that's noted.

22              MR. GUERRA:           Justice Alito, if I could --

23   the second point I was going to address to Justice

24   Scalia I think answers this, this point.                   Congress did

25   the exact same thing in Title VII two years earlier.                      It


                                          8

 1   could have added Federal employers to the definition of

 2   employer and subjected them to the private sector regime

 3   there, but instead it created a stand-alone prohibition.

 4   If you take the government's logic in this case and

 5   apply it to Title VII, it would lead to the conclusion

 6   that the Federal sector ban in Title VII, which is

 7   717(a), does not bar retaliation either, and yet we know

 8   that's not true.     Because --

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why?          This Court hasn't

10   so held.     We haven't had that issue before us.

11                 MR. GUERRA:        You -- that's correct, Your

12   Honor.     It's not true because of this Court's holdings,

13   but it's true because of the structure of the statute,

14   the consistent interpretations of the lower courts and

15   the administrative agency.            The structure of the statute

16   is, in 717(a), the language, the prohibition there is

17   virtually identical to the prohibition here except it

18   proscribes race discrimination, et cetera, instead of

19   age discrimination.

20                  Then, in the remedy section Congress

21   explicitly made a remedy for retaliation available for

22   violations of 717(a)'s substantive norm.                      The only

23   reason to do that was because Congress understood that

24   substantive norm to prohibit retaliation.                      Congress then

25   copied that very same language into 633a(a), thereby


                                          9

 1   giving it the same breadth.

 2                And so the negative inference theory the

 3   government puts forward with respect to Title VII fails

 4   on that statute because of the incorporation of the

 5   remedies, we know that that prohibition bars

 6   retaliation.    And because the norm at issue here was

 7   copied from that Federal sector prohibition in Title

 8   VII, the same reasoning dictates that the argument fail

 9   here as well.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The Federal

11   employee, though, has all of the remedies under the

12   Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment

13   practice.    Those remedies are elaborately reticulated

14   and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add

15   complication.    In other words, despite all the remedies

16   under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in

17   other cases you go here, and you get different types of

18   review depending on the facts, all of that would be

19   wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the

20   age discrimination statute.

21                MR. GUERRA:        Three points, Mr. Chief

22   Justice:    First of all, everything you just said would

23   be equally true of discrimination under Title VII, and

24   yet the government acknowledges that retaliatory conduct

25   for race discrimination claims, sex discrimination


                                        10

 1   claims, can all be brought directly in court,

 2   notwithstanding the existence of the CSRA.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Did the government --

 4   well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind

 5   of qualified that in their brief.                 The brief says that

 6   the case -- this case presents no occasion to consider

 7   whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against

 8   Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private

 9   sector retaliation ban.         So they haven't made a

10   concession.

11                 MR. GUERRA:       Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, I

12   read them to be conceding for purposes of this case and

13   the analysis of this case, and if they're willing to

14   acknowledge, at least for purposes of this case, that

15   all these other retaliatory claims can be brought

16   outside of the CSRA regime, it makes no sense, I submit,

17   to single out retaliation based on age discrimination

18   claims.   And, in fact, Congress --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think you're saying even

20   if, even if that were the case, they would still urge

21   the Court to come out the way they do.                   I don't think

22   they're conceding that that's the case.

23                 MR. GUERRA:       But, Justice Scalia, even if --

24   if -- even if taken on the "even if" premise, you still

25   are in the situation where you have an irrational


                                        11

 1   distinction by saying the CSRA is the exclusive remedy

 2   for retaliation for age complaints and yet not for

 3   retaliation under Title VII.

 4               Also, Mr. Chief Justice, the CSRA itself

 5   explicitly carves out claims under the ADEA and Title

 6   VII.   So, Congress did not view it as the exclusive --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But not retaliation

 8   claims.   In other words, although the direct claims, as

 9   you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation

10   claim fits under the employment practices provisions of

11   the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation.                   In

12   other words, you took personnel action against me for an

13   impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the

14   various civil service remedies.

15               MR. GUERRA:          That's -- that's correct,

16   Mr. Chief Justice.      And of course, the CSRA covers

17   retaliation that has nothing to do with complaints of

18   employment discrimination as well.                   So it would not be

19   rendered a dead letter by recognizing our position.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Does it cover your client?

21               MR. GUERRA:          I don't believe it would,

22   Justice Souter, because she did not suffer an adverse

23   action.   No, and in fact putting that aside --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               She could complain; it's

25   just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.

 1               MR. GUERRA:        Well, more fundamentally,

 2   Justice Ginsburg, she's not covered at all by the CSRA.

 3   And that was the third point I wanted to make.                 The CSRA

 4   excludes thousands of employees.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But it does that for

 6   a reason.   We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit

 7   and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these

 8   problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types

 9   of claims of employees, they do it for a reason.                 In

10   other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them

11   or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the

12   remedies that they've provided don't apply in a

13   particular case.   And to say that those people who are

14   excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for

15   employment practices seems to me to undermine that --

16   that judgment.

17               MR. GUERRA:        Mr. Chief Justice, with

18   respect, the problem with the government's reliance on

19   the statute is that it doesn't -- on their view, White

20   House employees and congressional employees have a full

21   judicial remedy for retaliation suffered for raising age

22   discrimination complaints.          And our argument is it makes

23   no sense to permit that one band of employees, many

24   high-level policy employee -- policymakers, to bring

25   retaliation claims in Federal court, while excluding

 1   Postal Service workers who have only collective

 2   bargaining rights and tens of thousands of other

 3   employees for --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The answer is that it

 5   doesn't exclude them, that they have all these

 6   collective bargaining rights; they have the civil

 7   service rights; they can go and bring their same claim

 8   with other remedies.        You could make the opposite claim:

 9   Why should they have two rights?                 Everybody else has

10   one.     I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is

11   underlying this.

12                 Then when you go to Title VII -- and this I

13   don't understand fully.          Look at Title VII and Title VII

14   in 16(e) has a basic ban.            Is that right?

15                 MR. GUERRA:        That's correct, Justice Breyer.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And then, in 16(d) it says

17   certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits

18   against the Federal Government.                Then it incorporates

19   some provisions.     And it says that you get that certain

20   relief against the Federal Government where there is

21   discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex,

22   or national origin.       Then it says "or in violation of

23   3(a)."     And then 3(a) refers to retaliation.

24                 So it looks like Title VII does give you a

25   remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation.                  And it's rather


                                         14

 1   specific, and that suggests that those other words don't

 2   pick up retaliation.     It's rather that specific thing.

 3   Now, what have I missed?

 4              MR. GUERRA:        Justice Breyer, the -- you are

 5   right to focus on these remedies, but the remedies

 6   themselves are not incorporated as substantive bans.

 7   They are simply remedies, and our point is by making a

 8   retaliation remedy available for a violation of the ban

 9   that you identified in subsection 717(a), Congress

10   necessarily understood that substantive ban, 717(a), to

11   prohibit retaliation.     Otherwise there would be no

12   reason to provide a remedy for retaliation as one of the

13   remedies for a violation of --

14              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, you could say that,

15   but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII

16   Congress has some words, and these words give you a

17   specific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's

18   retaliating against you because you went and complained

19   about race or something, just read those words; you can

20   bring a lawsuit, right?       Am I right about that?

21              MR. GUERRA:        I don't think so --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:            No?

23              MR. GUERRA:        -- Justice Breyer.       You can

24   bring a lawsuit under section --

 2   under Title VII if you are a person, an employee or

 3   applicant aggrieved.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where is this stuff?        Where

 5   is this text that we're talking about?

 6               MR. GUERRA:        I apologize, Justice Scalia.

 7   It is not in --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not in your brief.

 9   It's not in the appendix.          So I don't know what you're

10   talking about.

11               MR. GUERRA:        I am talking about subsection

12   (c) of 717a, the Federal sector provisions of Title VII.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which we don't have here

14   now.   I guess I can ask --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I'm not totally

16   certain what I'm talking about either.                  So we could go

17   on.

18               (Laughter.)

19               MR. GUERRA:        I'd like to think I -- I can

20   illuminate the -- the language that authorizes Federal

21   employees to bring suits for violations of Title VII

22   says that if they are aggrieved by final disposition of

23   the complaint, they may bring a civil action under Title

24   VII, and aggrieved -- they can bring complaints for

25   violations of subsection (a), which like subsection (a)

 1   in our statute says "all personnel actions affecting

 2   employees or applicants for employment shall be made

 3   free from any discrimination based on race, color,

 4   religion," et cetera.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            Or in violation of --

 6               MR. GUERRA:        No, it does not say that,

 7   Justice Breyer.   The prohibition of subsection (a) of

 8   717a in substantive terms is identical, except it

 9   specifies a different protected status.                 So this is a

10   ban on discrimination based on race, color, religion,

11   and you are authorized to bring a suit if you are

12   aggrieved by a violation of that provision, and one of

13   the remedies that's made available is a remedy that's

14   available for violations of the private sector provision

15   on retaliation.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why is that so clear,

17   because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it

18   is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall

19   govern civil actions brought hereunder.                 And if there is

20   no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't

21   be applicable.

22               MR. GUERRA:        Justice Ginsburg, the language

23   "as applicable" I submit has to be referring to whether

24   the case itself would implicate the need for that

25   remedy.   In other words, it would not be applicable to


                                       17

 1   have a reinstatement remedy in a case where there was no

 2   discharge.

 3                But the reading that you have suggested

 4   assumes that Congress didn't know what it was -- the

 5   scope of the prohibition it enacted in Section 717(a)

 6   and was effectively saying:              Here are some remedies; we

 7   don't know whether they apply or not, but if they do, go

 8   ahead and use them.

 9                And I submit that is an improper assumption

10   about congressional understanding of its own

11   legislation.     The proper assumption is that Congress

12   understood 717(a) to bar retaliation.                     That's why it

13   provided a retaliation remedy, and that assumption is

14   buttressed by the fact that, as this Court explained in

15   the Brown v. GSA case, Congress adopted Title VII

16   precisely because it found that fear of reprisal had

17   made the old scheme ineffective.

18                So it makes perfect sense that it would want

19   to prohibit retaliation under Title VII in the Federal

20   sector because reprisals had rendered the old

21   protections useless.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, could you proceed

23   with that?     That is, a very simple way of thinking of

24   this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress

25   says:   When private employers discriminate, there can be


                                         18
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put

 2   some in.     When State officials discriminate, say, on the

 3   basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's.                 Maybe

 4   they protect them in some States; maybe they don't

 5   protect them in others.          We better put some in.         When

 6   Federal Government officials discriminate against on the

 7   basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected.

 8                 But we have a whole system here to protect

 9   them.     And so let's just use that system and treat all

10   whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter.

11   We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's

12   here.

13                 Now, the answer to that is what?

14                 MR. GUERRA:        That is the very system that

15   Congress had deemed ineffective to prevent retaliation

16   for the very claims you're talking about in -- and

17   that's why it chose to adopt the amendments to Title VII

18   in 1972.    That's what the Brown case canvasses; and, in

19   fact --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's sort of

21   begging the question.        I mean, you're saying it's not

22   true because our interpretation of Title VII is true.

23   But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title

24   VII.    That is, it makes more sense to say when it's

25   retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed

 1   remedies within the agency.

 2               I mean, it doesn't answer the point that

 3   Justice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret

 4   Title VII the way we want to interpret it.                His point

 5   is:   One reason to interpret it the way you do want to

 6   interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of

 7   the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through

 8   the agency mechanism, rather than in court.

 9               MR. GUERRA:        Justice Scalia, I apologize if

10   I wasn't clear in my response, but what I'm saying is

11   that in the Brown case this Court looked at the

12   legislative history of Title VII -- excuse me -- yes, in

13   1972 and 1977 -- and said that the reason Congress

14   adopted these, this new prohibition, was because the

15   very scheme that Justice Breyer is suggesting would have

16   been a fix for whistle blowing was ineffective.                   That --

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then it's ineffective here.

18               MR. GUERRA:        And it is ineffective here.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:            And if it's ineffective

20   here and Congress has made it clear that the only way to

21   cure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provision

22   and you don't have a separate provision, you're out.

23               MR. GUERRA:        That's correct.          And the

24   ineffectiveness here is because of the extraordinarily

25   limited nature of the types of conduct that would


                                       20

 1   trigger any rights that the employee could control under

 2   the CSRA.   Retaliation rarely takes the form of a

 3   removal from position or a suspension of more than 14

 4   days.   The most typical things are poor performance

 5   evaluations, what we have in this case, allegations of

 6   groundless charges of misconduct.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 When you qualified

 8   your answer by saying that the employee can control, was

 9   that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?

10               MR. GUERRA:        Well, I was talking about

11   actually the -- the -- you can complain about

12   non-adverse actions under the CSRA, but all you can do

13   is ask the Office of Special Counsel to investigate.

14   And then you have no right to compel any further action

15   at any step of the process.            So if the counsel decides

16   not to investigate, that's the end of the matter.                   If

17   they do and the agency refuses to take their advice,

18   that's the end of the matter.             There's no judicial

19   remedy for the vast majority of retaliatory actions that

20   a Federal employee could suffer under the CSRA.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about review

22   under -- by the Merit Systems Protection Board?

23               MR. GUERRA:        That is the remedy under the

24   CSRA, Mr. Chief Justice.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So when you're

 1   talking about the Office of Special Counsel --

 2              MR. GUERRA:         If the Office of Special

 3   Counsel doesn't pursue the case -- and the statistics in

 4   the NTEU brief suggest that it rarely -- out of

 5   thousands and thousands of complaints, it pursued only

 6   in a small handful.     You have no right as the employee

 7   to do anything, to go to the MSPB or to any Federal

 8   court, if they decide not to pursue that claim.            And so

 9   that is -- and, again, both because Title VII, I submit,

10   clearly based on the remedial structure, would allow

11   employees to bring all types of retaliation claims

12   unrelated to age discrimination complaints in Federal

13   court, it doesn't make sense for Congress to have

14   relegated older workers who suffer age discrimination to

15   this one scheme, especially because it excludes --

16   Petitioner herself has no rights under the CSRA.

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Guerra, can you help

18   me on a provision of the statute that I'm a little

19   puzzled about?   Am I correct in believing that Section

20   2000e-16, which is the provision under Title -- 42

21   U.S.C. -- I'm using the code number -- that that is the

22   provision that makes the Federal Government liable for

23   retaliation based on sex and race?

24              MR. GUERRA:         That is.


25              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Is there another provision

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that is necessary for there to be a remedy against the

 2   Federal Government?

 3              MR. GUERRA:         For retaliation based on race

 4   and sex?

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Under Title VII.

 6              MR. GUERRA:         No.      That's the remedy.

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Then -- your argument, if

 8   I understand it, is that precisely the same language

 9   that's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a.

10              MR. GUERRA:         633a.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:             633a.

12              MR. GUERRA:         Yes, Justice Stevens.

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And, therefore, the two

14   should be treated alike?

15              MR. GUERRA:         Precisely.               That is the -- that

16   is our -- one of our central arguments.                     Of course, we

17   also realize --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:             In other words, that the

19   language "shall be made free from any discrimination

20   based on race, color, or religion," and so forth, covers

21   retaliation.   And when you use the same language based

22   on age it also would cover retaliation.

23              MR. GUERRA:         Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:             It's just as simple as

25   those two provisions being exactly --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It isn't that simple

 2   because the government hasn't conceded that, with

 3   respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for

 4   retaliation.   If the Government -- we'll ask them --

 5   will make that concession, then the argument is very

 6   strong.   The words are identical.

 7                MR. GUERRA:         Justice Ginsburg, even if, as I

 8   anticipate, they will not make that concession, the fact

 9   of the matter is that the remedial structure of Title

10   VII, the Federal sector provision, confirms that the

11   substantive ban that Justice Stevens read necessarily

12   covers retaliation.       Otherwise, Congress wouldn't have

13   made a retaliation remedy available.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, another reason

15   it's not that simple is that under the Age

16   Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that

17   specifically provides for retaliation.                    And that is

18   noticeably absent from the Federal remedy.                    And I

19   thought that was the strongest argument on the

20   government's side.

21                MR. GUERRA:         Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that

22   is precisely the same -- the same is precisely true of

23   Title VII.   Section 704a of Title VII is the analog to

24   623(b) in our case.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I thought there was

 1   a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private

 2   anti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this

 3   case.

 4              MR. GUERRA:           That is true, but our position

 5   --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So that makes it not

 7   precisely the same situation.

 8              MR. GUERRA:           Not precisely the same,

 9   Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court's -- in that case, for

10   example, this court said when you copy language verbatim

11   into another statute, there must be some compelling

12   evidence that you've intended to have given it a

13   different meaning.

14              If you look at the remedy section of Section

15   633a(c), all you see there is not some dramatic

16   difference, but what Congress did was it replicated the

17   civil action provisions of the private sector in the

18   Federal sector provision.            So it's not as though there's

19   some stark evidence that Congress intended to have a

20   drastically different regime.               It simply didn't --

21   rather than incorporate subsection (c) of the private

22   section, 626c, it simply replicated it.

23              I would like to reserve the balance of my

24   time.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

 2                ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 3                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 4               MR. GARRE:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 5   and may it please the Court:

 6               The Age Discrimination and Employment Act

 7   does not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federal

 8   sector context and it should not be read to impliedly

 9   prohibits such conduct either.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why not, given the

11   Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general

12   ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to

13   include retaliation for complaining about

14   discrimination?

15               MR. GARRE:        Justice Ginsburg, the Court did

16   so very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's cases

17   interpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX

18   broadly.   And it specifically distinguished statutes

19   like Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act which

20   delineate different types of discrimination.

21               In fact, on page 175 of the Court's decision

22   in Jackson, the Court said because Congress did not list

23   any specific discriminatory practices when it wrote

24   Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does

25   not tell us anything.       And then it pointed to the fact


                                        26
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that Title VII had delineated certain types of

 2   practices.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:         Would it be -- would it be

 4   unkind to say that the government's position seems to be

 5   that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on

 6   retaliation except when the government is being sued?

 7   In Jackson the government argued that discrimination on

 8   the basis of sex included retaliation.                  Tomorrow the

 9   government is going to argue that the prohibition of

10   discrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation.

11   And yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me

12   exactly the opposite position.

13                MR. GARRE:      I think that would be unfair,

14   Justice Alito.   The government's position is that

15   statutory context matters.          It made that clear in

16   footnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court.                 It's

17   made it clear in this case.

18                In this case, there are several indicia of

19   statutory intent that are lacking where you have a

20   general prohibition in the context of the inferred right

21   that has -- that this Court has treated differently, as

22   it did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the

23   CBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow.

24                In the Age Discrimination Act you have

25   separate provisions of the Act which explicitly


                                       27
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   delineate different types of discrimination, including

 2   retaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector

 3   prohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at

 4   a time where it decided to treat State employers like

 5   Federal employers, specifically put the State employers

 6   in the definition of employer for the Federal -- for the

 7   private sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act,

 8   and it created a stand-alone provision for Federal

 9   employers.

10                And then it went even further.              It

11   specifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the

12   Federal sector provision, that the Federal sector

13   provision should be unaffected by the private sector

14   provision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts

15   should not be reading into the Federal sector provision

16   the additional protections or other provisions in the

17   private sector provisions.           And this Court recognized

18   the significance of that construction, that statutory

19   scheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case.

20                In that case, the Court considered whether

21   Federal employees were entitled to a right to a jury

22   trial in an action for discrimination under the Federal

23   sector prohibition.      Private sector employees were

24   entitled to that.     And so the plaintiffs in that case

25   made an argument very much similar to the argument made


                                        28
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   by Petitioners in this case:            Well, the private sector

 2   provisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no

 3   sense not to have a jury trial --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that's -- Mr. Garre,

 5   that's traditionally when you're suing the government,

 6   you don't get a jury.      And so that's on one side.

 7                Here, as I think you would recognize,

 8   retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination

 9   claims.   A person who is discriminated against will

10   quite commonly say:     I was not promoted because that was

11   discrimination and then because I complained about it

12   all these bad things happened to me.                    It's very common

13   that those two go together.

14                And yet, without any indication that

15   Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one

16   forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue

17   retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress

18   had in mind, it would be rather strange.

19                MR. GARRE:      Well, let me try to answer that

20   question, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one

21   final point on Lehman and the statutory construction in

22   that case.   The Court specifically said on page 162 of

23   its decision that because Congress demonstrated that it

24   knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial

25   when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very


                                       29
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   legislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly

 2   failed to do so, and it said that that was the

 3   conclusive point of statutory construction in that case.

 4   So we do think the Lehman case is very on point here.

 5              With respect to the general notion that it's

 6   uncommon to provide -- not to provide an

 7   anti-retaliation right when you do have an underlying

 8   anti-discrimination prohibition, certainly we would

 9   agree with you that it is uncommon, but we don't think

10   that it is absurd.      It's certainly not absurd where

11   Congress was aware that there was a separate set of

12   protections available for Federal workers --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But you -- I recognize

14   it's not absurd.     But if there is ambiguity and one

15   interpretation is, well, that in every other context

16   retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would

17   Congress leave out this one category of persons,

18   especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme

19   Court says discrimination includes retaliation?

20              MR. GARRE:          Well, we know that Congress in

21   the Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice

22   noted, we know that it didn't think that additional

23   anti-retaliation protections were necessary for some

24   Federal employees.      So the fact that Congress wouldn't

25   have a separate anti-retaliation -- anti-retaliation


                                         30
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   right in some situation in itself is not unprecedented.

 2               We do think that the statute has several

 3   indicia that make clear that Congress did not intend to

 4   provide an anti-retaliation right here.                 Not only the

 5   contrast between the private sector and Federal sector

 6   provisions, but look at what Congress expressed in

 7   section 633a.   In at least three respects this is

 8   materially unlike the typical anti-retaliation right.

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:          Can you say what the

10   government's position is on Title VII, whether there is

11   a retaliation remedy against the Federal Government?

12               MR. GARRE:       As we make clear in our brief,

13   we have not conceded that, Justice Alito.                We don't

14   think it's necessary for the courts to decide that in

15   this case --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What is the government's

17   position?   What does, for example, EEOC or whoever

18   passes on these complaints, what is the government's

19   position in practice with respect to a Federal employee

20   who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of

21   my race and then they retaliated against me for

22   complaining?

23               MR. GARRE:       I think in practice, Your Honor,

24   we have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal

25   courts that have found that Title VII does incorporate


                                       31
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   an anti-retaliation right.            But there are at least --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Has any Federal court

 3   found otherwise?

 4              MR. GARRE:          I'm not aware of a circuit court

 5   that has gone the other way on Title VII.                       Certainly the

 6   Age Discrimination Act is different.                       The First Circuit

 7   in this case explicitly recognized that the textual

 8   differences between Title VII and the Age Act call for a

 9   different result.     And there are at least two

10   differences that we do think call for a different result

11   under the Age Act.

12              The first is the fact that, whereas Title

13   VII expressly incorporates the private sector provisions

14   of the Act and by reference the anti-retaliation

15   provision of the Act --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                So you agree -- then you

17   agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words

18   "as applicable"?

19              MR. GARRE:          Well, this Court actually has

20   interpreted that phrase, "as applicable," in a case

21   called Chandler v. Radabush.              It wasn't cited in the

22   brief, but it is directly responsive to that question.

23   And the cite there is 425 U.S. 840.                       And in that case

24   the Court said that the "as applicable" language just

25   means that there are certain provisions of the private


                                         32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sector remedies that are inherently incompatible in the

 2   Federal sector context.          And it pointed to the

 3   provisions in the private sector part of Title VII that

 4   allowed EEOC or the attorney general to intervene in the

 5   private action and take over the suit.

 6                 So the "as applicable" doesn't undermine the

 7   express incorporation of private sector remedies and

 8   anti-retaliation.     And that's a critical difference

 9   between Title VII and the Age Act.                   The Age Act not only

10   does not include that express incorporation, it goes in

11   just the opposite direction, and Congress went out of

12   its way to say don't import the private sector

13   provisions -- it did that in section 633a(f) -- don't

14   incorporate those provisions, and that's what this Court

15   recognized.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do we know what Congress

17   had in mind when it said don't incorporate private

18   sector?

19                 MR. GARRE:       Well, this Court in the --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There must be an

21   explanation for that section.

22                 MR. GARRE:       I don't think there is any

23   legislative history on point.               The Petitioners argue

24   that it meant don't incorporate the more restrictive

25   features.     But that argument is directly contradicted by

 1   this Court's decision in Lehman, where it pointed to

 2   section, subsection (f) of that provision as a reason to

 3   not import in the jury trial right that was not

 4   recognized for private sector employees.

 5                 The other way --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you agree with

 7   your friend that this employee has no remedy under the

 8   Civil Service Reform Act?

 9                 MR. GARRE:      Yes.       She is a

10   nonpreference-eligible employee of the Postal Service.

11   That means that she has to pursue her remedies under the

12   collective bargaining arrangement, which gives her a

13   remedy to complain about reprisal.                  And it means that

14   the union representative would present that grievance on

15   her behalf.    But it also means that if for some reason

16   she felt that her right of -- her obligation of fair

17   representation was not carried through, she could go to

18   court and complain about that.

19                 This Court in a case called Bowen v. United

20   States Postal Service recognized that employees who

21   don't get fair representation can go into court and

22   complain about that.       So she is protected --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What could she get --

24   what could she get by way of remedy?                     And you recognize

25   that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service


                                        34
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Act, but does have collective bargaining rights.

 2   Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.

 3              MR. GARRE:        I believe the remedies are

 4   largely co-extensive in that the principal remedy that

 5   you would get under the Age Act, under the Civil Service

 6   Reform Act and I believe under the collective bargaining

 7   agreements, although I frankly am not certain about

 8   that --

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about --

10              MR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective

11   action, Justice Ginsburg.         There is no right -- unlike

12   Title VII, there is no right to compensatory damages

13   under the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or

14   emotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act

15   is quite different.     What you typically get -- you get

16   this under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the

17   Age Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front

18   pay and corrective action to -- to address the

19   discrimination.

20              The other way in which the Age Act, section

21   663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is

22   actually another thing that makes it inherently

23   incompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that

24   the prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector

25   provision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who


                                      35

 1   fit within the protected class, employees over the age

 2   of 40.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why is that?   I

 4   mean, if you have the private -- the private sector

 5   remedy is not so limited, right?

 6                MR. GARRE:       Right.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, if we imply or

 8   incorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedy

 9   an anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be in

10   the same scope as the private anti -- the private

11   anti-retaliation provision.

12                MR. GARRE:       Well, then this Court would be

13   directly disregarding the express intent in section

14   663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants of

15   employees -- for employment who are at least 40 years of

16   age.   And further, in section 633 --

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, Mr. Garre isn't the

18   most that argument gets you that the only individuals

19   who could complain against retaliation are those over

20   40?    It doesn't get you out -- it doesn't get you where

21   you want to go.    It's not retaliation right at all.

22                MR. GARRE:       I think that's right, but if

23   we're going to talk about anomalies then we have to

24   recognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation

25   protection right that only protects people within the


                                        36
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   protected class with respect to discrimination.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, is it any more

 3   anomalous than the fact that the only protection of the

 4   age protection is simply for people over 40?                In other

 5   words, Congress didn't care whether there are employers

 6   in the world who don't like youthful people.

 7               MR. GARRE:       If --

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:            They're just worried about

 9   the age.   So if it's an anomaly it's an anomaly across

10   the board in the statute.

11               MR. GARRE:       I think it's a great deal more

12   anomalous, with respect, Justice Souter.                With both

13   anti-retaliation provisions, whistleblower provisions,

14   all the provisions that the government is aware of,

15   including all the ones cited in Petitioners in its

16   brief, protect all employees, all --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the same anomaly

18   applies to the private sector, because section 631a

19   applies to the private sector and 631b to the public

20   sector.

21               MR. GARRE:       Well, that's not the way the

22   courts have interpreted it, Justice --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            The language is the same.

24   They both are limited to prohibitions to people who are

25   over 40.

 1              MR. GARRE:       What the courts have focused on

 2   is the "any employee" language of section 623d of the

 3   private sector provisions.         And that's the way --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that's no reason why

 5   that trumps -- any more reason why that trumps 631a than

 6   631b.

 7              MR. GARRE:       And that's the longstanding

 8   interpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's

 9   been any doubt in the courts to date that under the

10   private sector provision you can bring claims for

11   retaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's

12   the way it is under Title VII.

13              We do think that it would be anomalous to

14   say that employees who complain about age discrimination

15   or who testify about age discrimination in a case are

16   not entitled to protection if there is an

17   anti-retaliation right, and if they are under the age of

18   40; and there is at least two other respects in which --

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I don't think it says that

20   -- the protection doesn't apply.              The word is

21   prohibition -- but that --

22              MR. GARRE:       Well, I think that that's right.

23   But it's odd to say that this prohibition in 663a, which

24   is clearly limited to people -- and I think by --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's the explanation why


                                      38

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the problem doesn't arise in the private sector.                     The

 2   same explanation would apply to the public sector, if

 3   you choose the word prohibition as talking about these

 4   people who are protected by the --

 5              MR. GARRE:          That's not -- that's not the way

 6   the courts have interpreted for more than 20 years under

 7   the statute.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I though we are talking

 9   here a prohibition against taking retaliatory action.

10   Isn't that a prohibition?

11              MR. GARRE:          It is a prohibition.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Yes.

13              MR. GARRE:          Right, and then that would be --

14   their argument is that 663a contains that prohibition,

15   and so therefore it is limited by 631b.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Isn't this an

17   unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly

18   retaliated against also has substantive

19   anti-discrimination claims?              And I gather -- I think it

20   would take a particularly incompetent lawyer that

21   couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying

22   discrimination.

23              MR. GARRE:          I wouldn't disagree with that,

24   Mr. Chief Justice.      I'm not sure it's unusual to have

25   retaliation claims piggyback on discrimination claims,

 1   but I think you're right.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:         Isn't it quite the contrary,

 3   Mr. Garre, that most -- if you did a statistical

 4   analysis of all the cases in which there was a

 5   retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a

 6   very high percentage of those are cases in which the

 7   person claiming retaliation is also the person who

 8   claimed the underlying discrimination?

 9               MR. GARRE:      I wouldn't doubt that.            I think

10   in most cases you do have discrimination claims.                I

11   would say, though, that our research indicated that in

12   the Age Discrimination Act context, at least the private

13   sector context, only 14 percent of the claims involve --

14   cases involve retaliation claims, which is lower than

15   other statutes.

16               I wanted to point out two respects --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Are those, are those

18   mostly witness cases?

19               MR. GARRE:      I don't know.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                In other words, it's

21   a witness saying I think so and so was fired because of

22   his age.

23               MR. GARRE:      I don't know the answer to that

24   question.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Isn't the typical

 1   retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case,

 2   whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination

 3   Act?   That is, I think I have a solid claim of

 4   discrimination, but maybe not.              Nevertheless, once I

 5   filed that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who

 6   complain about sex discrimination, age discrimination.

 7   Therefore, I was retaliated against.

 8               In this case, isn't it the fact that the age

 9   discrimination claim, the claim of direct

10   discrimination, was rejected and the question is but

11   nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?

12               MR. GARRE:       She abandoned that claim at the

13   summary judgment stage.        That's my understanding,

14   Justice Ginsburg, and of course we are here today

15   because she is still pursuing her anti-retaliation

16   claim; and certainly if there is an anti-retaliation

17   right, we've agreed that you could pursue that

18   independent of whether you complained about the

19   underlying discrimination, but we do think that in at

20   least three respects the prohibition in 663a is

21   incompatible with an anti-retaliation right.

22               One, we think it is limited only to the

23   people within the protected class, people 40 years old.

24   Two, it's limited to personnel actions, which means if

25   you think about it in the context of this Court's


                                       41

 1   decision in the Burlington Northern case and the Oregon

 2   case, it's limited to workplace-related things that

 3   happened to you, and in Burlington Northern the Court

 4   specifically said, in holding that Title VII's

 5   anti-retaliatory provision was broader than that, was

 6   that it would defeat or at least limit the purpose of

 7   achieving the purpose of an anti-retaliation provision,

 8   to limit it workplace-related harm.

 9               And then third, of course, the

10   discrimination that's expressed in section 633 is

11   discrimination based on age, not discrimination based on

12   conduct -- the conduct of complaining about or

13   exercising your rights under Federal law.                 And that,

14   that --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That does bring up

16   Justice Alito's point.       I mean, tomorrow you're going to

17   argue the exact opposite, right?

18               MR. GARRE:       With respect --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or else that

20   distinction between conduct and status would require you

21   to lose.

22               MR. GARRE:       I think if we have the conduct

23   and status alone, then I think you're in the Jackson

24   box.   But where you've got the three indicia that you

25   have here, which indicate that this provision is


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   incompatible with the typical anti-retaliatory

 2   provision, and you couple that with other indicia of

 3   statutory intent -- you have the competing schemes in

 4   the statute between private sector where Congress

 5   specifically delineated an anti-retaliation right, with

 6   the fact that it didn't delineate that right in the

 7   Federal sector scheme; the evolution of the statute --

 8   where you have Congress specifically deciding not to put

 9   in Federal employers with private employers, as it did

10   for States having the separate provision; and the

11   distinctions between 663a and 623 of the Act -- 623 of

12   the Act is the main private sector prohibition; 663a,

13   the Federal sector provision, doesn't have all the other

14   types of practices that are prohibited by 623.

15              For example, pensions -- pensions are

16   specifically addressed by 623.              Congress didn't address

17   that in 663a of this Act.          It presumably understood that

18   it either would address it through other means if there

19   were other protections out there.

20              Similarly we think with respect to

21   retaliation.   Congress knew how to express an

22   anti-retaliation right.        It did so forcibly in the

23   private sector provisions of the Act; and that language

24   which you find in 623d of the Act is simply completely

25   absent in 663a of the Act.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE ALITO:           Do you think it's plausible

 2   that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation

 3   in the Federal sector differently under the various

 4   Federal anti-discrimination statutes?

 5              MR. GARRE:        I do think that, Justice Alito.

 6   There certainly are several differences between Title

 7   VII and the Age Act, and I'm not sure that Congress has

 8   explained each difference, but nevertheless they exist

 9   and this Court has recognized them, most recently in the

10   Smith v. City of Jackson case, where the Court noted

11   that because of textual differences between acts, there

12   is less protection with disparate impacts of

13   discrimination under the Age Act and Title VII.

14              It's also the case that Congress has

15   provided for compensatory damages in Title VII and not

16   in the Age Act.   It's also the case that there is a

17   right, a Federal right to a jury trial in Federal sector

18   actions in Title VII but not in the age act.            And this

19   Court has recognized, in Smith v. City of Jackson, that

20   Congress has treated age discrimination as if it's

21   qualitatively different and presumably accorded

22   different protections taking that into account.

23              So, the notion that this -- that the Age Act

24   is different than Title VII or different than other

25   Federal statutes in itself with respect to retaliation


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in itself is not unusual, and it's especially not

 2   unusual when you take into account that there is this

 3   back-stop protection that's --

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Garre, can I go back

 5   to the authority you're pointing out for a moment?            Is

 6   it your reading of 631a, the private sector section,

 7   that says "the prohibitions in this chapter shall be

 8   limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of

 9   age," that it's correctly read as the prohibitions in

10   this chapter, except those contained in 623a, shall be

11   limited?   That's the way you read it?

12               MR. GARRE:       Well, we -- no, Justice Stevens.

13   I think that the textual argument that the courts have

14   embraced with respect to 623d, the anti-retaliation

15   provision, is because in 623d the Congress specifically

16   said "with respect to any employees or applicants."            It

17   couldn't have meant with respect to only 40, only

18   employees who are over 40.          And, again, that's the way

19   it's been interpreted consistently for decades under the

20   statute.   And we think, though, that giving effect to

21   the language in 633a, you have express prohibition

22   limited to people over 40 years old, and that it is

23   anomaly, and we're not aware of any other situation that

24   --

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the effect of giving


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the effect to the word "any" in this section is in

 2   effect to read in this exception.

 3                MR. GARRE:      I think --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do you --

 5                MR.GARRE:     I think --

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           That's the practical

 7   effect?

 8                MR. GARRE:      I think that is the practical

 9   effect.   This Court has recognized, in Bush -- in the

10   Bush v. Lucas case, which dealt with the question of

11   whether to infer a retaliation remedy for constitutional

12   claims by a Federal employee -- that Federal employment

13   practices present different questions.                  It's an area in

14   which this Court uniquely defers to the policy judgments

15   of Congress, recognizing that Congress has greater

16   resources to police Federal employment, that there are a

17   number of balances that have to be struck between

18   government efficiency and the rights of Federal

19   employees.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           Am I right now in thinking,

21   just as a matter of practice, where there is

22   retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race

23   discrimination, Federal Government, that the person

24   making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court?

25   That's right?

 1                MR. GARRE:      That's true --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:           The same thing in respect

 3   to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go

 4   through the civil service system or the collective

 5   bargaining agreement; is that right?

 6                MR. GARRE:      Well, what would happen, if you

 7   had an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of

 8   age and retaliation, that would be a so-called mixed

 9   complaint.   They could bring that to the --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, not what they do if

11   their claim is a retaliation claim.

12                MR. GARRE:      If it's purely --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

14                MR. GARRE:      -- a retaliation claim, they'd

15   have to bring it under the protections afforded by the

16   Civil Service Reform Act.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.      And now, do you have

18   -- two things:   A, do you have any evidence one way or

19   the other that one of these two systems -- the civil

20   service plus collective bargaining, on the other hand;

21   or EEOC plus the court, on the other -- works better,

22   works the same, works worse?

23                MR. GARRE:      I don't have any evidence.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           No.     So we don't know.

25                MR. GARRE:      I wasn't --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      Now what reason --

 2   okay.   So we don't know.

 3                MR. GARRE:       Well, I guess, if I could just

 4   add though, I don't think there's any reason to doubt

 5   that certainly Congress had any concerns about whether

 6   the system under the Civil Service Reform Act is working

 7   properly.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's drawing

 9   something from where you don't know.                     Okay.   So that's

10   fair enough.

11                But is there any -- what is the best reason,

12   in your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make

13   this distinction?    What are the best two or three

14   reasons?    If you were just starting with a blank slate,

15   why would Congress have wanted to send the one to the

16   one route and the other to the other route.

17                MR. GARRE:       My assumption is that Congress

18   felt that the back-stop protections that were available

19   for Federal workers at the time it passed the Age

20   Discrimination Act and that were subsequently codified

21   by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were

22   appropriate for people who complained about age.                     As I

23   mentioned earlier --

 1              MR. GARRE:         I don't know the -- Congress

 2   didn't tell us the answer to that.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:              But I'm asking you, and if

 4   you were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought --

 5   the conclusion that I would reach from what you're

 6   saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat

 7   them differently.

 8              MR. GARRE:         Well, I think the reason would

 9   be that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially

10   different than other types of discrimination, and it --

11   either it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as

12   great or that the protections -- that it didn't need to

13   add protections.    And as I mentioned --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But why would it have

15   thought that?   In other words, if -- I can understand

16   why you say -- if you're going to put a rational gloss

17   on it, that must be what they were thinking, but why

18   would they think such a thing?

19              MR. GARRE:         Your Honor, again, Congress

20   didn't say -- I'm not -- I think you can make the same

21   argument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a

22   jury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age

23   Act, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages

24   under Title VII but not under the Age Act.

 1   make sure I understood something you said before, rather

 2   pleadingly.     One is if one could imagine a claim just

 3   for reprisal, but you called something a "mixed claim"

 4   if you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both.

 5   So if you're suing for both, on your theory you still

 6   must split them up?       You cannot bring the reprisal claim

 7   together with the discrimination claim?

 8                 MR. GARRE:       Well, you can bring them

 9   together.     What you would do is you would bring a

10   discrimination claim under the Age Act and you'd bring a

11   reprisal claim under the Civil Service Reform Act.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But there's a different

13   administrative mechanism.

14                 MR. GARRE:       You can bring them both together

15   before the Merit Systems Protection Board, if you're --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Oh, oh, but how about

17   court?

18                 MR. GARRE:       Well, in -- what would happen

19   there is you would have your proceeding in the Merit

20   Systems Protection Board, which would decide the

21   discrimination claim and the retaliation claim.               At that

22   point, the employee could decide to go to the EEOC to

23   try to fight on discrimination, or the employee could go

24   to Federal court, and in Federal court he would get a de

25   novo trial on his -- on his discrimination claim and a

 1   record review --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But then you -- you would

 3   be putting everything under the civil service umbrella

 4   and nothing under the --

 5              MR. GARRE:        No, I don't think so.        And it's

 6   a clear difference.     There are several types of mixed

 7   claims that can be brought in this fashion.             Once you

 8   get to Federal court on your Age Act discrimination

 9   claim, you get a trial de novo on that claim.             You just

10   only get record review of the Civil Service Reform Act

11   claim because that's what Congress deemed appropriate.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But if it didn't amount

13   to an adverse action under the Civil Service Act --

14              MR. GARRE:        If it doesn't amount to an

15   adverse action, then you have to go the route that

16   Congress thought appropriate for --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And you wouldn't get to

18   court.

19              MR. GARRE:        Well, you would have -- you

20   would -- it would be investigated by the Office of

21   Special Counsel.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Yes, but it would not be

23   within your control.      It would not be up to the --

24              MR. GARRE:        It would not, and that's what

25   Congress deemed appropriate for those types of actions.

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:               But it seems to me,

 2   Mr. Garre, that, following up on Justice Breyer's

 3   question of what's the reason for it, the most striking

 4   thing to me is that Congress used precisely the same

 5   language in the two sections:               "All personnel actions

 6   shall be made free from any discrimination based on

 7   race, color" and so forth.            That clearly includes

 8   retaliation.     But "all personnel actions shall be made

 9   free from discrimination on account of age" does not

10   include retaliation seems to me rather anomalous.

11              MR. GARRE:          But there are at least two

12   material textual differences between Title VII and the

13   ADA -- and the Age Act.          The first is that the Title --

14   the Title VII --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:               In the key section

16   describing the prohibition, the language is exactly the

17   same.

18              MR. GARRE:          Well, to understand the meaning

19   of that section you have to understand the meaning of

20   the whole section itself including this express

21   incorporation.    And, secondly --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. Garre, are we going to

23   have to decide the Title VII question in this case?               We

24   don't even have the materials in front of us.              They

25   haven't been put in the appendix to the briefs.                And in

 1   order to decide this case, we're going to have to decide

 2   a Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?

 3               MR. GARRE:       The Court does not have to

 4   decide the --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, I would

 6   have thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question

 7   would be:   This is an unusual situation where you have

 8   the employer writing the law about what the employees

 9   can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the

10   situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be

11   covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or

12   disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that

13   it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that

14   they as the employer didn't want to face that

15   disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil

16   Service Reform Act already.

17               MR. GARRE:       I think that that's right,

18   Mr. Chief Justice, and I think this Court recognized

19   similar considerations in the Bush versus Lucas case.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Wasn't there -- there was

21   something that was said about this -- that doesn't apply

22   to congressional employees or White House employees,

23   that they would have a claim of retaliation.

24               MR. GARRE:       Well -- and that's because

25   Congress gave them one, and this is --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So why would Congress say

 2   when you -- when it's Congress that's doing the

 3   reprisal, we're going to give you a suit, but not if

 4   some other --

 5                MR. GARRE:      I think, at least with respect

 6   to congressional employees, I'm not sure that they would

 7   have been protected by the Civil Service Reform Act

 8   protections that existed for executive agency employees,

 9   but -- but look at the statutes -- and we cite them at

10   page 36 in the appendix and our brief -- in those two

11   statutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition

12   that is in section 633(a):          "All personnel actions

13   affecting these employees shall be made free from

14   discrimination based on age."             But they explicitly

15   included a separate anti-retaliation provision, which,

16   again -- that's a subsequent statute, but that's --

17   again, that's another indication that Congress doesn't

18   think that this kind of general prohibition in section

19   633(a) covers discrimination.             When it wants to cover

20   retaliation, it passes an express anti-retaliation

21   provision    Thank you.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

23   Mr. Garre.

 1                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 2              MR. GUERRA:           I'd like to make three points.

 3   First, I want to emphasize the practical reality that

 4   there are thousands of employees who have no remedies

 5   under any of the schemes we are talking about:

 6   Employees of TVA, employees of the General Accounting

 7   Office, these employees of the Transportation Security

 8   Administration.

 9              They have no collective bargaining remedies,

10   no CSR remedy, and, according to the Government, no

11   remedy under the ADEA.

12              Justice Ginsburg, on Title VII, not only has

13   the Government failed to challenge the lower --

14   consistent lower court interpretations.                   The EEOC's

15   interpretation of this provision is that it bars

16   retaliation in the Title VII sector -- Title VII bans.

17   And so when you --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Excuse me.       Would you

19   clarify your earlier statement:                These people have no

20   remedies just for retaliation?                They do have remedies

21   for the age discrimination, but not for retaliation?

22              MR. GUERRA:           They have no remedies for

23   retaliation under --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               But they have remedies for

25   age discrimination?

 1                 MR. GUERRA:       They do, Justice Scalia, but my

 2   point is --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

 4                 MR. GUERRA:       Our argument is that it makes

 5   no sense to give some people remedies under one scheme

 6   and leave some -- congressional employees getting full

 7   remedial relief, people under the CSRA getting a limited

 8   remedial relief, others getting remedies under the

 9   collective bargaining rights and thousands of others

10   have no remedies only with respect --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is that because they

12   may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they

13   have chosen not to?

14                 MR. GUERRA:       I believe they are not allowed

15   to.   The entities I mentioned, I believe, are not

16   allowed to.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           To have a remedy.

18                 MR. GUERRA:       Because they simply have none

19   of the remedies the Government has put before --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Who -- who is such a

21   person?

22                 MR. GUERRA:       An employee of the

23   Transportation Security Administration.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why can't they -- why can't

25   they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?

 1               MR. GUERRA:          They are excluded from the

 2   Civil Service Reform Act.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:              So they are outside the

 4   Civil Service, and they don't have unions?

 5               MR. GUERRA:          They don't have bargaining

 6   rights.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:              They don't have a union?

 8               MR. GUERRA:          Correct.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:              So they could be fired for

10   anything.

11               MR. GUERRA:          Well, they have claims for

12   discrimination if they suffer age discrimination

13   directly, but if they complain about age discrimination

14   and then get fired in retaliation, they have nothing.

15   And -- and just --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I suppose that's

17   consistent with whatever prohibition it is that

18   precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.

19               MR. GUERRA:          But it's not consistent with

20   their rights under Title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, because

21   as the EEOC has -- an -- is entitled to deference, it

22   has said, for three decades.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So you think we do

24   have to decide the Title VII question if you are to

25   prevail.

 1                MR. GUERRA:       I do.        Well, I don't know that

 2   you necessarily do, but I certainly think it compels the

 3   conclusion I am advocating if you reach -- if you reach

 4   the issue.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You should have given us

 6   the statute to look at if that's the case.

 7                MR. GUERRA:       I recognize that, Justice

 8   Scalia, and I apologize.

 9                I would also like to note that there was a

10   suggestion that perhaps Congress didn't care as much

11   about age discrimination.          That's refuted by the House

12   report that accompanied this very statute.

13                It's quoted at page 23 of the AARP brief

14   where the Congress said age is as great an evil in our

15   society as discrimination based on race and religion.

16   Whether or not this Court agrees with that assessment as

17   an objective matter, that's the view of the Congress

18   that adopted this statute.

19                And, as Justice Stevens noted, they have --

20   they adopted the statute by incorporating the language

21   from Title VII, the exact same language where Title

22   VII's remedial scheme makes clear, and the EEOC's

23   consistent interpretation confirms, that that then

24   prohibits retaliation for complaints of race or gender

25   discrimination.

 1              By incorporating that same language in the

 2   ADEA's federal sector provision, Congress necessarily

 3   gave it the same scope; and, by doing so, eliminated the

 4   various anomalies, to put it mildly, that the

 5   Government's position leads to.

 6              If the Court has no further questions --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you counsel.
