 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. YOUNG

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. YOUNG:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Before addressing SEIU's motion to dismiss

12   for mootness, it is important to remember the underlying

13   facts of this case.      For 10 months in 2005 and 2006,

14   more than 36,000 nonmembers, or nearly 40 percent of

15   those employees represented by SEIU employed by the

16   State of California, were compelled to contribute to

17   SEIU's $12 million Political Fight-Back Fund without

18   being provided the opportunity to challenge the amount

19   of the fee and to object to its exaction, required by

20   the First Amendment.

21               Adding insult to that injury, the Ninth

22   Circuit said that nonmembers could never say no to

23   contributing to SEIU's political expenditures for ballot

24   propositions, at least Proposition 76.                They have no

25   right to refuse to bankroll that element of SEIU's

 1   political speech.    This defies this Court's decisions,

 2   distorting the political process on a massive scale.

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Mr. Young, could I ask you

 4   to speak to the mootness question first?

 5               MR. YOUNG:       I was just addressing that.

 6               JUSTICE KAGAN:          As -- as I understand your

 7   brief, you're essentially saying that it's impossible to

 8   moot a claim for nominal damages.             Is -- is that a

 9   correct reading of your position?

10               MR. YOUNG:       I'm not sure I would go that

11   far, Justice Kagan.      I think in this case, the

12   wishy-washiness, as it were, of the language used by

13   SEIU when it distributed this pasted-on dollar to the

14   class -- or dollars, more accurately -- was inadequate

15   because it failed to represent the importance of the

16   judgment that the nonmember class had won.

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:          So, that's a different

18   point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate?

19               MR. YOUNG:       That would be correct.

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:          And -- and when you say

21   "inadequate," I read you to be saying sort of not

22   apologetic enough.     And -- in other words, not saying,

23   look, you had a claim against us, we think you're right;

24   it was a valid claim; here is your judgment in

25   satisfaction of that claim.            That it didn't forthrightly

 1   say that.   But do you think if it had forthrightly said

 2   that, we would be living in a different Article III

 3   universe?

 4                  MR. YOUNG:    Not in this case, Justice Kagan.

 5                  Turning to the adequacy of the notice, of

 6   the financial disclosure, that did not comply with the

 7   district court's judgment, either.                 If -- if the only

 8   question were the distribution of nominal damages, then

 9   perhaps we would be living in that different Article III

10   universe.   But this case is about the judgment of the

11   district court that the SEIU was attempting to comply

12   with.   They failed to do so in virtually all of its

13   elements.

14                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       And how is that?         How did

15   they fail to comply, other than, you know, the question

16   of whether they were forthright enough about the fact

17   that they were satisfying a claim?

18                  MR. YOUNG:    The -- the district court had

19   ordered -- described the type of notice that it

20   anticipated.    The district court specifically determined

21   that SEIU's subsequent 2006 financial disclosure was

22   inadequate to cure the problem that was caused by the

23   seizure of fees starting in September 2005.                 And that's

24   on 73a of the -- the Petition Appendix B.

25                  The union in this case merely sent the same


                                       5

 1   financial disclosure in the notice that it sent, to try

 2   to moot the case, that it had sent in June of 2006.

 3   Well, the district court had already said this is

 4   inadequate.   That seems to me to -- to end the inquiry.

 5                 Obviously, the district court did not

 6   contemplate that the notice that was sent in June 2006

 7   satisfied the obligations of its judgment; else it

 8   hardly could have ordered a -- a useless act in ordering

 9   a new type of notice go out.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And the reason

11   that's important in terms of the content of the notice,

12   the inadequacy, is what?

13                 MR. YOUNG:    The reason that is important,

14   Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, excuse me -- is that the

15   SEIU is asserting that the case has become moot because

16   it has now complied with the district court's judgment.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I thought your --

18                 MR. YOUNG:    It has --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I thought your

20   argument was that the -- a different type of notice

21   would have resulted in more members electing to opt out,

22   to demand the refund of their assessments?

23                 MR. YOUNG:    And that's certainly one of the

24   possible consequences.      Obviously, I -- we would --

25   that's speculative to some extent.                But since the


                                      6

 1   purpose of the notice is to provide the information

 2   necessary to -- to object, one of the purposes, then we

 3   certainly anticipate that there would be more objectors

 4   were there to be an -- an adequate notice that complies

 5   with the district court's judgment.


 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:       If the special assessment


 7   requires a different kind of notice and possibly a


 8   different kind of opt-in or opt-out regime, would the


 9   case be moot?


10                 MR. YOUNG:    If the notice -- I'm sorry.     I

11   didn't understand.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, we're not dealing here

13   with the kind of notice -- with the typical Hudson

14   notice given at the beginning of the year, when the

15   annual dues are collected.         We're dealing with a special

16   assessment.   Now, if a different kind of notice is

17   constitutionally required in that context, would this

18   case be moot?

19                 MR. YOUNG:    No, it would not.     Obviously, we

20   have -- we -- we still have the nominal damages question

21   and the adequacy of the payment --

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:       My question is whether

23   the -- the different requirements, which presumably were

24   not met here in the context of the special assessment,

25   if there are different requirements in that context,


                                      7

 1   would that be enough to preserve this case as a live

 2   controversy?

 3                  MR. YOUNG:    So long as the union failed to

 4   provide them, and at least in this case, the district

 5   court's judgment, we believe, provides a -- an adequate

 6   respect for Hudson's underlying requirements,

 7   Justice Alito.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. -- Mr. Young --

 9                  MR. YOUNG:    Yes, Justice --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- as I understand, the

11   union recognizes that a consequence of mootness would be

12   that the Ninth Circuit judgment is vacated.            Now, if the

13   union would also recognize that that means the district

14   court judgment stays in place, so if the Ninth Circuit

15   judgment is worked out and you're left with the district

16   court judgment as the law of the case, then I think it

17   is moot, isn't it?

18                  MR. YOUNG:    No, Justice Ginsburg, and this

19   is why:   The union would remain free to return to its

20   old ways, the -- the very type of reason that this Court

21   declined to find mootness in W.T. Grant.            The union has

22   made much -- much of a showing -- or much of a show,

23   more accurately, of the fact that it has changed its

24   internal policy.    It won't do this for 180 days.          But

25   that can hardly be sufficient for this Court to find


                                       8

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   mootness in this case.    The union made this wonderful

 2   and meaningful policy change on 6 days' notice.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But it wasn't -- this --

 4   this case is about a completed episode.          It's about a

 5   special assessment that is long over.

 6               MR. YOUNG:    That is true, Justice Ginsburg.

 7   But it is also about the declaratory relief that was

 8   ordered by -- that was entered by the district court.

 9   It is about the -- which was virtually injunctive relief

10   in this case.

11               It is also about the effect of that judgment

12   for future activities and -- and how that will affect

13   the way SEIU operates.

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Does it have --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, are you saying that

16   this is capable of repetition, yet evading review?          I'm

17   not quite sure.

18               MR. YOUNG:    It would certainly be so in this

19   case, Justice Kennedy.    The union set a very short

20   time -- well, a relatively short time period, given the

21   length of time a case comes up from the courts as a rule

22   in this Court.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Does the injunction have

24   future -- future terms?     Is it a permanent injunction or

25   is it just an injunction that relates to the notice


                                    9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   that's required in this case?

 2                 MR. YOUNG:    Just -- just to be clear, there

 3   is -- I'm talking about something that's tantamount to

 4   an injunction, Justice Kennedy.             It's -- it wasn't

 5   actually phrased as an injunction.                It was an


 6   affirmative -- an act -- ordering an affirmative act.


 7                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But isn't that important,


 8   Mr. Young, because usually where we've talked about


 9   capable of repetition or where we've talked about the


10   same thing could happen again, it's where an injunction

11   has been before us rather than a suit for damages as to

12   a past act?

13                 MR. YOUNG:    Yes, Justice Kagan, I think that

14   has been generally the case.             I -- in my research, I

15   could find very few cases where it wasn't clear to me

16   that this Court was addressing injunctive relief.

17   Hudson itself, it seems to me, did not specifically

18   discuss the entry of injunctive relief in the lower

19   court, and Hudson itself addressed a mootness issue.

20                 I mean, if we -- if we talk about these

21   cases in their -- in their strictest sense, the union's

22   notices are all annual.       So, by the theory that it

23   becomes moot when those notices expire, or potentially

24   moot when those notices expire, this Court would never

25   address these issues because it would -- I can't imagine


                                     10

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   one of these cases ever getting up to this Court in as

 2   little as a year.

 3                  But the -- this Court in Hudson, in -- I

 4   believe it was footnote 12, said that this Court reviews

 5   the policy, the procedure, the acts as they were

 6   defended in the district court.             And the union's policy

 7   and procedure and acts here were defended in the

 8   district court.    And, therefore, cases like this should

 9   not become moot, because it is capable of repetition and

10   would be evading review simply by the mere limits of how

11   long these policies and procedures are in effect.

12                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you make that argument

13   in your opposition?

14                  MR. YOUNG:    It's -- it seems to me,

15   Justice Kennedy, it is implicit in our argument,

16   although clearly our main point in that argument is that

17   this is a -- a paradigm case of voluntary cessation of

18   allegedly unlawful activity.              Until cert was granted in

19   this case, until the Petitioners' merits brief was

20   filed, SEIU was vigorously defending its practice.             It

21   remains free to impose that practice.

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That's another --

23   something quite different than the capable of returning

24   to old ways, because here we do have a discrete episode

25   that's over.    And there was no question that, even


                                      11

 1   though that -- what was it, in 2005 -- that the period

 2   in 2005-2006, when the special assessment was in effect,

 3   that was long over, but you were -- you were continuing

 4   to litigate it.   And nobody suggested that it would

 5   become moot simply because the period was over.

 6                MR. YOUNG:     That's -- that's true, Justice

 7   Ginsburg.   Pardon me.

 8                This argument -- this argument was not

 9   raised until we were before this Court, the union's

10   argument that the case had somehow become moot, and

11   until it issued a notice --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, they said that it

13   had become moot because they gave you all the relief you

14   requested; so, there was nothing left to the case.

15                MR. YOUNG:     Well, "all the relief," Justice

16   Ginsburg, implies that they had complied with the

17   district court's judgment.         As to the notice, we believe

18   that they have not, and we believe that's clear because

19   of the very fact that the district court rejected the

20   2006 financial disclosure as adequate.               And --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Maybe it's a good

22   point for you to move to the merits.

10   Justice Sotomayor.     No, we are not attacking the normal

11   Hudson procedures.     On --

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.   So,

13   articulate for me what's -- borrowing a phrase from one

14   of my colleagues yesterday, how do we write this

15   opinion?   When is a second Hudson notice required?

16   Let's presume for the sake of argument that the union

17   had cost overruns.     Labor salaries went up; printing

18   costs went up, not for lobbying; but generally there was

19   a 10 percent increase in their expenses across the board

20   because various contracts that they were involved in

21   required it.    Would you require a second notice in that

22   circumstance?

23                  MR. YOUNG:    Yes, Justice Sotomayor.         We

24   would -- we believe -- pardon me -- that a new Hudson

25   notice is required whenever there is a material

 2   nonmembers.    The values that this --

 4   A material change --

 5                  MR. YOUNG:    A material increase or --

 6   increase in general terms, in the obligation imposed

 7   upon the nonmembers.      In this case, I don't think

 8   anybody would dispute the 25 percent --

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         A material new assessment?

10                  MR. YOUNG:    A material new assessment.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Okay.

12                  MR. YOUNG:    Yes, Justice --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's -- we're talking

14   about money here, right?

15                  MR. YOUNG:    Yes, we are.

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Okay.

17                  MR. YOUNG:    Yes.         Certainly --

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Without -- but

19   without regard to the reason for the assessment?

20                  MR. YOUNG:    I think as a matter of principle

21   I would have to say yes, Mr. Chief Justice.                The

22   nonmember --

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, I'm not sure

24   that -- this may just simply be repeating Justice

25   Sotomayor's question, but if they say we have to raise

 1   the assessment 10 percent because, as she said, you

 2   know, we estimated the printing costs for the union

 3   newsletter, whatever, was going to be this and it turns

 4   out they raised it, it's going to be that; so, we know

 5   we're going to have to get additional money, for things

 6   that are indisputably chargeable, why do you need

 7   special procedures in that case?

 8                MR. YOUNG:    Well, it wouldn't be so much a

 9   special procedure as a new opportunity to object and

10   challenge the amount of the fee, Mr. Chief Justice.

11                Certainly, one of the elements -- and we

12   recognize, of course, that the primary reason

13   individuals object is political expenditures, but this

14   Court said very clearly in Abood that people can object

15   for any reason, for no reason, for a good reason, for a

16   bad reason; nobody can inquire as to why someone

17   objects.

18                And certainly when a material alteration --

19   there has been a material increase in the obligation

20   imposed upon nonmembers, they may choose to make an

21   economic decision that heretofore they chose not to

22   make.   They may choose to minimize -- particularly the

23   non-objectors.   They may choose that they want to

24   minimize the financial obligation that they are paying

25   to the union at that time.        And --


                                    15

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:          It's peculiar because in

 2   the circumstance where the extra assessment is all going

 3   to go to chargeable activities, in fact that means

 4   economically speaking the following year the objector

 5   will be better off, not worse off, because there is a

 6   higher percentage of the total fee that's being paid to

 7   chargeable activities.

 8               So, this special assessment that Justice

 9   Sotomayor and the Chief Justice were talking about is

10   one that will benefit the objector, if he keeps quiet

11   and says nothing.   So, it's a little hard to imagine the

12   frame of mind that would say I need the notice because

13   now I might object, whereas I wouldn't have before.

14               MR. YOUNG:     Well, Justice Breyer, the reason

15   for the notice is these people may not trust the union.

16   They -- they may choose to challenge the amount of the

17   fee.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, I see that point.      Can

19   I ask you -- oh, are you -- you want to pursue that

20   further, or are we --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Go ahead.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.       Let me give you

23   this example.

24               MR. YOUNG:     Sure.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:          And now I -- but I think I

 1   see what your answer is.       Imagine it's year two.       In

 2   year one, expenditures broke down so that it was

 3   70 percent chargeable, 30 percent not chargeable.            Got

 4   that?

 5                 MR. YOUNG:    Yes, sir.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:         And normally, under Hudson,

 7   that means in year two the deal is the objectors pay

 8   70 percent, right?

 9                 MR. YOUNG:    Yes.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         In the middle of year two,

11   surprisingly, something comes up.            Something comes up.

12   A surprise to the union, and they want to have a special

13   assessment.   And you're saying they just can't without

14   going through this procedure all over again?

15                 MR. YOUNG:    That would be correct,

16   Justice Breyer.   The -- I'm now talking about --

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And take the money that

18   they collected?

19                 MR. YOUNG:    I'm sorry.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Can they take the money

21   that they collected under the first notice, and, instead

22   of doing the special assessment, in the middle of it,

23   this campaign gets announced by the governor, and can

24   they then divert the chargeable amount that they had

25   predicted and spend it on the non-chargeable amount?             Or


                                     17

 1   are you -- or does that require a second Hudson notice?

 2   Without a special assessment.

 3                MR. YOUNG:    I understand, Justice Sotomayor.

 4   And no, under that case, I don't believe it would.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.     So, this is a

 6   peculiar rule that you have asked us to adopt.            The rule

 7   is that where there is a special assessment and it will

 8   make all the objectors better off, they have to have a

 9   special notice that they can object.             But where the rule

10   is that we're going to take money we already collected

11   from them and spend it for a totally political purpose,

12   we don't give them a special notice and they don't have

13   to object.

14                Now, that seems totally backwards, but I

15   understand why you get there, and my suspicion is --

16   which you can confirm, is that's the only administrable

17   system you can think of.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Do you concede that it's

19   going to make them better off?          I would -- I would

20   assume that that's your principal objection.            They don't

21   know whether this new assessment is indeed going to be

22   divided the way the original one was or not.            They might

23   want to challenge --

24                MR. YOUNG:    That's --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- whether -- whether it's

 1   all going to be used for -- for assessable activities or

 2   not.    And they have no -- you're telling me they have

 3   no --

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Right.      But in my

 5   hypothetical --

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         At the very least, they

 7   have to make a -- an interest-free loan to the -- to the

 8   union until such time as they can challenge it.

 9                  MR. YOUNG:    Well, that's exactly correct,

10   Justice Scalia.    And I understand --

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes, but the hypothetical,

12   if I could continue with it, is -- is perhaps

13   unrealistic, but they have 20 bishops and 14 most honest

14   people in the United States, and they've all absolutely

15   guaranteed, and everybody agrees, that this goes to

16   chargeable activity.      And where I was going with my

17   question, which you see where I was -- you're with me on

18   this, right?

19                  MR. YOUNG:    Yes, I am, Justice --

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:         And combine the two.    What

21   I'm trying to point out and get your response is that

22   you've been forced into this position to create a

23   workable system.    Now, why is that workable system one

24   whit better than the workable system we already have,

25   which is all this washes out in a fair manner the

 2   It doesn't work perfectly, but it's as good as any

 3   other, and all we have to say is it's better than yours.

 4   Now, why is yours better than that?

 5               MR. YOUNG:     Well, I recall the bishops from

 6   the last time I was here, Justice Breyer.         I think they

 7   made an appearance then.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:          They're useful to me.

 9               (Laughter.)

10               MR. YOUNG:     They are, I'm sure.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I assume we wouldn't need a

12   Hudson notice at all, if -- if bishops affirmed all of

13   these things, right?

14               (Laughter.)

15               MR. YOUNG:     You anticipate my next point,

16   Justice Scalia.   These -- these aren't bishops, and with

17   due respect to our litigation opponents in this case,

18   these are people that nonmembers don't trust.         These are

19   people with whom nonmembers do not wish to affiliate.

20   And these are people that the nonmembers do not wish to

21   support, and --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The problem is in -- in

23   this system, and going back to Justice Breyer's

24   practicality, they will get a chance to object.         It just

25   won't be at the moment of the special assessment; it

 1   will be the following year.           So, when the union gives

 2   its new notice, it's going to set forth its chargeable

 3   and non-chargeable amounts as audited, and it will say,

 4   as it did -- as it's done in the briefs before us, on

 5   Proposition 76, we're going to take 50 percent as

 6   chargeable.    And the union members can come in and give

 7   a Lehnert objection, those who want to.            Those who

 8   don't, know it's happened, and they agree to it.

 9                 Isn't that correct?          They do get a chance to

10   object; the question is the timing.

11                 MR. YOUNG:    Then the problem is, Justice

12   Sotomayor, understanding the --

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Is there an answer to

14   that?    They will get a chance to object then?

15                 MR. YOUNG:    Well, they'll get a chance to

16   object after they've already paid the interest-free

17   loan.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, but that's true of

19   the first example I gave you.            If something happens in

20   the middle of the year and the union needs to divert

21   already-assessed funds to challenge a election, they can

22   do it.    And you said that's okay.

23                 MR. YOUNG:    And the nonmembers would have

24   the chance to challenge that, but it would be within the

25   normal system of ordinary union dues.

 1                 We -- we, and I believe this Court in


 2   Hudson, presume that any reasonable -- reasonably


 3   competent union management would -- would have


 4   relatively stable expenditures over the years.


 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Isn't -- isn't the premise

 6   of Hudson that you give the notice before, before -- you

 7   receive the notice before you have to cough up the

 8   money?

 9                 MR. YOUNG:    Yes.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         And what's now proposed is,

11   well, for -- if there's an additional assessment, you

12   cough up the money first, and then later you straighten

13   it out.   And I -- do you get -- do you get the interest?

14                 MR. YOUNG:    That seems to me to be the

15   problem, Justice Scalia.       The people who got the June --

16   June 2005 notice were left in the dark -- indeed, the

17   union may have been in the dark -- as to this special

18   assessment.    But once the union agreed to -- decided to

19   impose the special assessment, the union was required by

20   Hudson's principles to shed some light.               You know,

21   perhaps it is less predictive, less accurate, to say we

22   intend to spend the money this way.               But when you have

23   an assessment which is purely intended for politics, and

24   that's what the union said, to create a Political

25   Fight-Back Fund, that's not, you know --

 2   Hudson notice tell you about what's going to happen next

 3   year?   I thought your Hudson notice told you this was

 4   the breakdown for the last year, and as far as we can

 5   tell, that's what it will be next year, but -- but

 6   things could change.     What does the Hudson notice tell

 7   you?

 8                MR. YOUNG:     The Hudson notice provides you

 9   with an opportunity to object and some assurance,

10   because of the audit requirement --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:          But am I right in my

12   description of it?

13                MR. YOUNG:     I think -- I think that would be

14   a fair description, Justice Breyer.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Do they -- do they

17   carry over from one year to the next, or do you have to

18   refile your objection to the union expenditures every

19   year?

20                MR. YOUNG:     Most unions, Mr. Chief Justice,

21   require an annual objection.             Now, of course, there

22   would be nothing -- we find nothing wrong with an annual

23   challenge requirement if you choose to challenge that

24   year's figures, because obviously it's a specific event.

25   But most unions seem to require annual objection.               So,

 2   for your politics.


 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, but what


 4   happens --

 5                 MR. YOUNG:     But that's not raised in this

 6   case.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But going back to the --

 8   forget about special assessments.             I think in one of the

 9   briefs, I know in one of the briefs, someone says

10   elections happen every 4 years.            So, in the normal cycle

11   of union activities, in an election year they're going

12   to divert more of whatever accessible moneys they have

13   to their lobbying efforts, and the following year

14   they'll go back to normal for 3 years.

15                 You're not challenging that normal variation

16   in the -- in the distribution of the moneys, correct?

17                 MR. YOUNG:     Correct, Justice Sotomayor.        And

18   that, too, may vary from union to union, from State to

19   State even.   As some of the Justices I'm sure know,

20   Virginia has called for --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, I guess my problem

22   is I don't see how that, given your argument, is any

23   less alone than this special assessment where the

24   labor -- where the objecting members at the end of the

25   year will get notice of what has happened that year,

 1   will have an opportunity to place their Lehnert

 2   challenges and get them ruled upon, and will, as

 3   Justice Breyer said, have a benefit because they're

 4   going to either pay more if the Lehnert -- pay less if

 5   the Lehnert challenges are upheld or pay more if -- if

 6   they're not.

17                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH COLLINS

18                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19                  MR. COLLINS:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

20   please the Court:

21                  Justice Ginsburg is absolutely correct

22   that what we have suggested to the Court is that the

23   court of appeals decision be vacated, with the

24   consequence of reinstating the district court judgment.

 1   you give up once the case was granted here?              You didn't

 2   consider that until the case came before this Court.

 3               MR. COLLINS:      That's correct, Your Honor,

 4   and the reason for that is when the events in this

 5   matter were new and the then union officers' actions

 6   were being challenged, the instinct was we're going to

 7   defend the case.   And, as time went on, there was no

 8   rethinking of that situation.           When the case was granted

 9   here over our opposition, noting that we didn't think

10   that the questions presented were really presented, the

11   officers of the union, who are not the ones involved in

12   the original case, thought about the situation and came

13   to the realization that they have no stake in the

14   procedures that are at issue here.               This is a local that

15   had never done a mid-year increase in the past.              The --

16   what was contemplated as a temporary increase here

17   turned into a permanent increase.           The dues went up to

18   1.5 percent of salary a year after this increase ended.

19               JUSTICE ALITO:        What does this local, and

20   what will the other locals, do in the future when

21   special assessments are made?           Will they provide notice

22   or will they go back to the old system?

23               MR. COLLINS:      This local -- and I won't

24   belabor the term "special assessment" at the moment, but

25   when we get to the merits, I think there's a

 1   misunderstanding around that, Justice Alito.           But this

 2   local has put in a procedure which frankly would satisfy

 3   the Petitioners' concerns for the future if future

 4   conduct was legitimately at issue here.           But it is not,

 5   for two reasons.

 6                First, when we state that the district court

 7   judgment be reinstated, that's a judgment that was not

 8   appealed by the Petitioners.            That defines the limits of

 9   what they can attain from this case, whatever this Court

10   may decide, and that decision gives whatever protection

11   it gives against future conduct.           Now, it gives

12   essentially none for a very good reason.           This was a

13   case, as has been noted, brought only about a one-time

14   event.   There were no allegations of an ongoing

15   practice.   There was no request for declaratory or

16   injunctive relief to prevent --

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Collins, as I understand

18   Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about

19   the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute

20   about whether it was clear enough, about that it was

21   satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about

22   whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr.

23   Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the

24   district court's order.

25                Now, as long as that's true, don't we have a

 1   live case before us?     Somebody has to answer that

 2   question about whether your notice complied with the

 3   order, and if it's the case that a court has to answer

 4   that question, doesn't that depend on the questions

 5   presented here, the substantive questions?

 6                 MR. COLLINS:     No, it doesn't, Justice Kagan.

 7   And the Court's explained in a number of cases,

 8   beginning I think with Walling v. Reuter and also,

 9   obviously, Munsingwear and U.S. Bancorp, a case can be

10   in a posture where this Court, in disposing of it, needs

11   to grant certain relief or clarification of the status

12   of prior orders; and yet, the case is moot on the merits

13   such that the Court cannot appropriately reach the

14   merits.

15                 That's what we have here.           If there is a

16   dispute -- and I'll explain in a moment why there really

17   isn't.    But if there is a dispute, for example, as to

18   whether an individual failed to get their refund because

19   the notice was inadequate, that dispute is not affected

20   by and requires no decision of this Court.

21                 If the district court judgment is

22   reinstated, then the question of whether we have fully

23   provided all relief called for by that judgment, which

24   we believe we have, would be before the district court

25   for decision, unaffected by --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But this is not --

 2   this is not an incidental matter.            I mean, the whole

 3   point of your friend's argument with the Hudson notice

 4   is they want people to understand what's happening with

 5   the -- their union money.       And they say this notice

 6   didn't let people know that.            And if the case is not

 7   moot and if they prevail, they will have a right to be

 8   heard on what the notice should say.              And that will make

 9   a difference in how many people opt out or how many

10   people don't.

11                And I guess I'm following up on Justice

12   Kagan's question.   That's a very important part of this

13   case, what the notice is going to say, and if we accept

14   your view that it's moot, that issue goes by the

15   wayside.

16                MR. COLLINS:     I think that's incorrect,

17   Mr. Chief Justice, for two reasons:              First of all, the

18   district court required a certain kind of notice to be

19   given.   We are stating the district court judgment

20   should be reinstated.     If the notice we have given does

21   not comport with what the district court judgment, which

22   was not appealed by the Petitioners, requires, it will

23   be provided by the district court.

24                We are -- we are not contesting -- the

25   Petitioners are looking a gift horse in the mouth.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I'm sorry.   I don't

 2   see how that -- I don't see how that works.

 3                The notice is only required by the district

 4   court if the case is not moot.            If the case is moot by

 5   the notice you sent out, the district court doesn't have

 6   a case on the basis of which to order a different

 7   notice.

 8                MR. COLLINS:      No, I don't think that's

 9   correct, Your Honor.     A case can be moot in this Court

10   -- and this is what I believe Munsingwear, Walling v.

11   Reuter, and the other cases, U.S. Bancorp more recently,

12   explain.   And, at first, it seems paradoxical, but it is

13   not paradoxical.    A case -- there can be remaining

14   issues potentially in the district court, such as

15   whether the check that the plaintiff paid bounced or

16   not, that could potentially have to be resolved by a

17   district court.    And it -- but it means, at least in

18   terms of prudential mootness, there is not a substantive

19   merits issue remaining for the court to be deciding.

20   And it's really quite simple.            The Petitioners, as I

21   say, are looking a gift horse in the mouth.

22                The apex, the acme, that they can achieve in

23   this case, is what they got from the district court, and

24   it was reversed.    We are saying give it back to them.

25   Take back the reversal, reinstate the judgment.

 1   Whatever they won, they will have.                We believe we have

 2   already given them everything they want.                If we have

 3   not, the district court will do that.

 4                 But let me explain the second point, if I

 5   may, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that there is no

 6   legitimate issue here about whether the notice was

 7   adequate.    Mr. Young stated quite incorrectly that the

 8   notice we have provided is the same as the notice the

 9   district court struck down.           That's absolutely

10   incorrect.   The district court said that the 2005 notice

11   issued before the dues increase obviously did not give

12   specific notice of the dues increase, although it stated

13   that dues could be increased.

14                 The district court specifically held, at

15   Petition Appendix 73a, that the 2006 notice, which

16   described the so-called fund and the dues increase, and

17   the purposes of it, was completely adequate.                And the

18   notice the district court -- one also has to realize the

19   district court was requiring the union to refund only

20   the non-chargeable portion of activities attributed to

21   this increase.

22                 A certain kind of notice would be needed for

23   that to justify how the union was computing what it was

24   saying with the chargeable portion to refund.                But what

25   the union has done here is provide greater relief than


                                     31

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the district court ordered.            We have refunded every

 2   penny that anyone who requests had paid during the

 3   increase.

 4                So, there's no serious question that the

 5   notice that the union sent out, which explained what the

 6   increase had been spent on, sufficiently informed

 7   individuals as to whether they now want to get back

 8   every penny, as we've offered them, of what they paid

 9   under the increase.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But -- I want you to

11   move to the merits.      It may be a good time to do that.

12                MR. COLLINS:       Fine.      Turning to the

13   merits --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Can I clarify a point?

15   I thought I heard and maybe I just didn't look at the

16   union regulations, the new ones -- is it limited to

17   180 days?   I thought I heard your adversary say that

18   the --

19                MR. COLLINS:       It -- no, it has a provision

20   that it can't be repealed without 180-day notice.                There

21   can't be a sudden repeal of the new procedure.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I see.

23                MR. COLLINS:       But I do want to make clear,

24   we think nothing -- our position on mootness is not

25   dependent on the Court determining that the new


                                      32

 1   procedure will be in effect forever.             Our position --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could you tell me what

 3   the burden is on a union to give a second Hudson notice

 4   whenever there is a special assessment?             Meaning do you

 5   happen to know how frequently unions impose special

 6   assessments --

 7                MR. COLLINS:     Well --

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- and what the

 9   incremental cost is to the union of giving such notice?

10                MR. COLLINS:     That requires a fairly

11   extensive answer, I believe, Justice Sotomayor, partly

12   because --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Try to summarize it.       I

14   wasn't looking to monopolize you.

15                MR. COLLINS:     I understand, but I believe --

16   I believe the word "special assessment" is being used

17   here with a meaning that doesn't correspond to what this

18   union did.   I can say this much:          There's never --

19   there's been only one other case in any Federal court

20   that I'm aware of, and only in a district court, there's

21   been no other appellate court, dealing with any kind of

22   assessment, a temporary dues increase, and how it

23   affects Hudson rights.

24                So, this is a -- a non-event in the real

25   world.   There are -- there are no challenges that have


                                    33

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   -- that have been made previously to any kinds of

 2   assessments or increases.

 3                But unions use assessments in two -- in many

 4   different ways.   And let me contrast one way with what

 5   happened here, and I think it will show why there's no

 6   serious question here about a need for a notice.

 7                Some unions have a dues structure which

 8   covers only certain kinds of activities.             And they

 9   contemplate a new kind of activity that they would not

10   normally pay for out of dues or fees.             They say often

11   with -- with a vote, which was not required here.               There

12   was -- there was no vote required or taken here of

13   bargaining unit members for what occurred in this

14   instance.

15                But you may have a union that says:            We want

16   to make a kind of expenditure that's really

17   unanticipated.    It's not what we normally do with our

18   dues.   We're going to put it to a vote.            If you approve

19   it, we'll collect it.      We'll probably put it in a

20   segregated fund separate from our treasury.

21                That kind of an assessment can raise

22   potential issues, I would acknowledge, under Hudson.

23   It's worlds away from what we have here because all that

24   happened in this case was that the union increased, from

25   1 percent to 1.25 percent of salary, the regular


                                     34

 1   membership dues and the fees based on those dues that


 2   were deducted by employers and paid into the union's


 3   general treasury --

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:         Is it incorrect that this


 5   was for what was termed a "Political Fight-Back Fund"?

 6                MR. COLLINS:       It was -- some union

 7   communications described it as having that sole -- that

 8   purpose.   The October 27th letter, which was the most

 9   detailed explanation, said it had two purposes,

10   basically to fight back at the bargaining table and to

11   fight back politically.

12                But what's essential, Justice Alito, it was

13   never suggested nor was it ever the case that this money

14   would be in any way segregated or treated as a separate

15   entity, so to speak.      So, we have the Schermerhorn

16   problem here.   Basically, Petitioners' position is based

17   on the fallacy exposed in Schermerhorn of trying to take

18   part of a unified general treasury and treat it as if it

19   were a distinct entity, because --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, let me give you this

21   example, and maybe you'll say that this is different

22   from your case and the rules should be different in

23   these two cases.   The annual dues for particular -- for

24   members of this union are 1 percent of their salaries,

25   and let's say that amounts to -- or it's a certain


                                      35

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   percentage of their salaries, and let's say that amounts

 2   to $500 annual dues.    And let's say that, in the prior

 3   year, 90 percent of the money collected by the union was

 4   used for chargeable purposes, 10 percent for

 5   non-chargeable purposes.      So, someone who objected, a

 6   nonmember who objected, would be able to get back $50.

 7                Now, during the course of the year, the

 8   union levies a special assessment or whatever you want

 9   to call it, and for this 90 -- the percentages are

10   exactly reversed:   90 percent is for non-chargeable; 10

11   percent is for chargeable.        So, now a nonmember who

12   potentially wants to object has $450 at stake.        Now, in

13   that situation, why shouldn't there be separate notice?

14   Aren't the economic incentives quite different?

15                MR. COLLINS:     If I understand the

16   hypothetical, there could be a problem there if the

17   assumption is then that the union really is beginning a

18   kind of spending that's really foreign to the way it's

19   spent money in the past.

20                What needs to be explained here, though,

21   Justice Alito, I don't think one would guess from

22   anything that has been said today that we're talking

23   about a period of time when the union's chargeable

24   spending increased and its non-chargeable spending

25   decreased.   We're talking about a period of time when


                                    36

 1   objecting nonmembers did not even pay their pro rata

 2   share of the concededly chargeable expenditures, meaning

 3   they did not pay one penny for any political activities.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, as I said, my

 5   hypothetical may be very different from what happened

 6   here, and maybe it's an unrealistic hypothetical; and

 7   you can answer that.    But if -- if it were to occur,

 8   should there not be Hudson notice?

 9               MR. COLLINS:     Well, the problem -- it would

10   be a closer question, but I think not, because, again,

11   it would be caught up in the subsequent year.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:       But what if the money is

13   going to be used for an election campaign?            What if it

14   is going to be used to weigh in, in favor of one

15   gubernatorial candidate against another, in favor of one

16   slate of legislative candidates against another?            And on

17   those issues, the nonmembers may have very strong

18   partisan and ideological objections.            So, why should

19   they not be given a notice at that time --

20               MR. COLLINS:     It would depend --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:       -- and given the opportunity

22   not to give what would be at a minimum a -- an

23   interest-free loan --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:       -- for the purpose of

 1   influencing an election campaign?


 2                 MR. COLLINS:       It would depend,


 3   Justice Alito.   I think in your hypothetical, one might


 4   be able to say -- there might be more facts needed, but


 5   one might be able to say that what is occurring is

 6   something that could not be anticipated reasonably by

 7   the person who got the notice.

 8                 In this case, however -- and this is crucial

 9   to this case -- the notice in 2005 told every nonmember

10   that, of our $38 million budget, we spent 43.6 percent

11   of it last year on non-chargeable activities.                 And if

12   you do not object, we will spend whatever amount out of

13   our roughly $40 million budget in the coming year on

14   various activities as we perceive the need, including

15   specifically ballot initiatives, which were specifically

16   mentioned in the notice as one of the things the union

17   spent its money on.

18                 Now --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought your

20   point, though -- this was a very special ballot

21   initiative.   That's what the literature suggests, that

22   this was not sort of the normal run in the course --

23   every 2 years, every election cycle, we spend something.

24   That's why it's a special assessment.

25                 MR. COLLINS:       Well, I don't -- I wouldn't


                                       38

 1   call it a special assessment if one uses that term as

 2   it's usually used, to mean a very short-term assessment

 3   apart from general union functions for a new kind of

 4   function.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, it's not

 6   short-term; it's just until November 7th or whatever.

 7               MR. COLLINS:       But it's nothing new under the

 8   sun, Mr. Chief Justice.       And we can see that -- for

 9   example, the record reflects the audit for 2005 shows us

10   that, in addition to the money that was attributed to

11   the dues increase and spent in opposing these ballot

12   propositions, additional money, approximately

13   $2 million, was spent on those same purposes from the

14   pre-increase dues.

15               So, ballot -- opposing ballot initiatives is

16   nothing new for this union.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           Can you think of for a

18   second -- to go back to Justice Sotomayor.               Now, I would

19   like you to see, I think, why she asked the question.

20               As I understand it, the way it works now is

21   at the beginning of, say, September -- say it goes

22   September -- September.       September of year two, we look

23   back to year one, and we see what the percentages were.

24   And now we in the union calculate a budget for year two.

25   And we go and get approval or opt-outs on that basis.

 1                 Now, what I thought coming in here is that

 2   the problem was going to be, if you have to have a new

 3   notice in the middle of the year for special political

 4   assessments, you're going to discover that half the time

 5   you don't know if they're special political assessments.

 6   It's an impossible line to draw.            It's really tough.

 7                 You're making the argument that however you

 8   draw the line, we're on the right side of it, not the

 9   wrong side.    Isn't that what -- basically what you're

10   saying?    It's not a special assessment.          It wasn't

11   really -- et cetera.     Okay.

12                 Now -- but there's a new argument that's

13   come along that I hadn't focused on, that we can avoid

14   the administrative problem by saying all special

15   assessments require a new notice, whether they're for

16   political purposes or not.         Hence the question that I

17   was trying to get -- I was very interested in your

18   answer.    If we had that rule, which avoids the problem

19   of saying which is which, how does that affect the

20   union?    Not necessarily yours but unions in general.

21   How often is it that you draw up your budget for year

22   two in September, you put it into effect, and then

23   during the year, you discover you need more money from

24   people for any reason, and, therefore, you change what

25   you thought they were going to contribute?            How often,


                                     40

 1   if you can give us an estimate -- and you're in a better

 2   position than I.    Does it happen a lot, rarely, a

 3   little?   What do you want to say?

 4                  MR. COLLINS:     I -- I --

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And a footnote:   And if

 6   it happens a lot, how burdensome is it?

 7                  MR. COLLINS:     I will get to that, Justice

 8   Sotomayor.   I have tried to determine how frequent it

 9   is, and I've been unable.         All I've been able to

10   determine is there's no litigation over it.           How

11   often -- and I've been able to determine that so-called

12   assessments take many different forms from -- and I

13   think there are crucial distinctions -- from funding

14   what would -- a kind of charge that would not otherwise

15   be funded out of dues for some short period of time, to

16   the opposite extreme, what we have here and what I don't

17   think would be called an assessment frankly by anything

18   I've read, a temporary dues increase which became

19   permanent and which simply increased the total flow of

20   dues and fees into the general treasury and which went

21   for the usual -- the kinds of activities the union had

22   always funded.    And in that regard, there's one --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could you please answer

24   my question?

25                  MR. COLLINS:     The burden?

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right?       The burden.

 2               MR. COLLINS:     The burden consists of two

 3   things, Justice Sotomayor.       The -- if a union has to

 4   give a new Hudson notice in a situation like this,

 5   whereas I've been trying to explain the spending that

 6   went on is really not different from what one would have

 7   reasonably anticipated given the notice, then we have

 8   litigation and disputes about the need for new notices

 9   whenever any number of things happen, because one thing

10   that happened here that is undisputed but hasn't been

11   discussed is that collective bargaining costs were up

12   six-fold in 2005 over 2004, and they were up six-fold in

13   2006 over 2005.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One reason -- I

15   mean, we're dealing with the situation where the union

16   is compelling nonunion members to give them money for

17   political activities.    We allow, as I understand Hudson,

18   as I read it, because you can't figure out what that is,

19   you wait until the end of the year.             In other words,

20   it's a compromise for administrative convenience.

21   Normally, you wouldn't allow it at all, as -- at least

22   under the law as I read it, you would not allow people

23   to take money -- you would not allow the union to take

24   money from people who don't want to spend it on

25   political activities so the union can spend it on

 1   political activities.     But we allow that in the course

 2   of the year because it's impossible as you go on to sort

 3   these things out.   I thought the argument on the other

 4   side was when you have a special assessment, an

 5   additional charge, there you don't have the

 6   administrative problem.      You can tell it's .25 percent.

 7   So, you can't take that until you tell them, do you want

 8   to object or are you happy -- are you fine with having

 9   this spent on political purposes?

10               MR. COLLINS:      The reason, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   that it isn't that straight forward is quite simply that

12   all of these questions about it's a special assessment,

13   we can figure out what it is, we can treat it

14   separately, flounder when one realizes that the

15   so-called special assessment is simply a dues increase,

16   because if I were to try to imagine -- let's try to

17   imagine the notice that could have been given.           If I was

18   giving a new notice in the fall of 2005 to explain to

19   all nonmembers how things look now compared to what

20   they -- how they may have looked when the Hudson notice

21   was given, I would say the following, completely

22   consistent with all the facts of record in this case as

23   revealed in the audits.      I would say:        We've determined

24   we need more income.    Part of this is because we

25   anticipate $3.7 million in fight-back expenses this


                                    43

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   year.   Another part is we expect more than $3-1/2

 2   million of additional bargaining costs this year, and we

 3   expect a lot of other changes in our costs.

 4                 On the Petitioners' theory -- and this is

 5   why Schermerhorn is the complete answer to their

 6   theory -- there's a constitutional violation if the

 7   union says we're going to view this increase as paying

 8   for our additional political costs, and it's going to

 9   free up our bargaining -- our general treasury for the

10   bargaining.   That's a violation.           But if you say we're

11   going to treat this increase as covering those new

12   bargaining costs we told you about, that's going to free

13   up our general treasury for the political costs --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But on the -- I'm

15   reading from the district court opinion.               It said that

16   this assessment would be used -- and they're quoting

17   from union material -- "for a broad range of political

18   expenses, including television, radio advertising,

19   direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and

20   get out the vote activities in our work sites and in

21   communities across California."           And it further said,

22   quote, "The fund will not be used for regular costs of

23   the union such as office rent, staff salaries or routine

24   equipment replacement."

25                 MR. COLLINS:     But two points,


                                     44

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   Mr. Chief Justice:    First, as the court of appeals

 2   pointed out, there were other statements that said the

 3   money would be used for both purposes.

 4               But, as Schermerhorn points out,

 5   Schermerhorn says even if you specifically say this part

 6   of our dues income is going to be earmarked for this

 7   purpose, it's artificial when you're dealing with a

 8   general union treasury, not a separate segregated fund,

 9   to give that separate legal status.               And that -- because

10   that is why -- my point to you, Mr. Chief Justice, is

11   nothing in the world would have changed here.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:         Suppose that the --

13               MR. COLLINS:       If --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:         Suppose that the proponents

15   of Propositions 75 and 76 had come to the union and

16   said, would you please give us an interest-free loan for

17   money because we want to use this money to -- to

18   persuade the electorate to enact these; but don't worry

19   because we're going to pay it back right after the

20   election, when we've achieved our electoral ends.

21               Would -- would the union provide the money

22   because it's all going to come out in the wash?

23               MR. COLLINS:       I -- I really can't answer

24   that question.   I don't know.           I --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, I -- gee, I really

 1   doubt that you -- that they would.                 But what's the

 2   difference?   If you look at this from the perspective of

 3   a nonmember who doesn't want those ballot initiatives to

 4   be defeated, saying that we're going to give you your

 5   money back -- we're going to use your money to achieve a

 6   political end that you oppose, but don't worry because

 7   we're going to give it back to you next year after we've

 8   achieved our political end -- how does that solve the

 9   problem?

10                 MR. COLLINS:      That's not the situation here,

11   Justice Alito.   The nonmembers were told in June 2005 in

12   the Hudson notice that if you don't object, we may spend

13   millions of dollars on political activities, including

14   ballot initiatives.      If a person didn't want to support

15   that, they merely need to object.             What then happened --

16   and this is what gets lost in the messaging about the

17   dues increase.   What actually happened in the real world

18   in the period that followed is that, compared to the

19   numbers in the 2004 Hudson notice, the union spent less

20   on non-chargeable matters and more on chargeable

21   matters.   And the only reason there's a case here in the

22   Court is that the union, for whatever PR purposes,

23   whatever it may have been, instead of saying we're going

24   to treat the increase as covering our vastly increased

25   bargaining costs, thereby freeing up money for politics,

 1   we're instead going to describe this increase as being

 2   attributable to our political costs, thereby freeing up

 3   money for bargaining.      But what the union is spending

 4   its -- its money on is bargaining.                More money --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It -- it seems to me that

 6   this answer is -- is so confusing that the Court

 7   probably should consider whether or not an opt-in

 8   requirement is -- is preferable.            I -- we're talking --

 9   in the first exchange, you had with Justice Alito, he

10   gave you a very simple question:            90 percent and 10

11   percent.   Then, it's reversed.           Special assessment for

12   90 percent political.      And the point there was that

13   you're taking someone's money contrary to that person's

14   conscience.   And that's what the First Amendment stands

15   against.   And you simply wouldn't answer that question.

16   You would -- and then you say, well, maybe that it's --

17   it's fungible, it's hard to --

18                 MR. COLLINS:     No, but --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me that you're

20   avoiding --

21                 MR. COLLINS:     No.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- a very, very critical

23   question on the constitutional rights of these objecting

24   members.

 1   believe -- I was not meaning to avoid it,

 2   Justice Kennedy.   What I thought I said is, if you are

 3   springing something on someone that's not anticipated in

 4   the notice that gave them their rights to object, then

 5   there's a problem.

 6               My point is very simple.              Anyone reading the

 7   2005 Hudson notice, if that person was asked -- if I

 8   don't -- if you -- if I don't object, might the union

 9   spend $3.7 million next year on ballot initiatives that

10   I may not want to oppose?        The answer would be yes.         The

11   notice made it perfectly clear.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Let me ask you this --

13               MR. COLLINS:       And the person can object.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- by way of background:

15   In collective bargaining negotiations, do the unions

16   consider the -- as one factor the importance of ensuring

17   that the governmental employer has fiscal stability?

18               MR. COLLINS:       That's generally considered,

19   yes, by unions.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, isn't that

21   ultimately a political judgment, so that even collective

22   bargaining involves a core political judgment?

23               MR. COLLINS:       And that's exactly what the

24   Court said in Abood.     And the reason that exclusivity

25   and agency fees are permitted in -- in serving an

 1   important government purpose is that the government has

 2   concluded that its interest lies in having an exclusive

 3   spokesperson who -- with whom it can negotiate so that

 4   it won't have an array of different employment relations

 5   or different --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you -- you concede, in

 7   ordinary collective bargaining, there are critical and

 8   important political -- significant political judgments

 9   that are being made by the union in the course of

10   collective bargaining with chargeable expenses?

11               MR. COLLINS:      Absolutely.          And Abood

12   explicitly says that, and Abood then says that,

13   nevertheless, the government -- we're talking about a

14   regulatory scheme to promote the government's interest

15   in orderly labor relations.          The government needs to

16   make arrangements and agreements on terms of employment.

17   It has a vital interest in having an exclusive

18   representational arrangement where that can be

19   accomplished.   And that, the Court held in Abood -- and

20   it's not challenged by Petitioners -- that justifies the

21   degree of impingement that's inherent in the fact that,

22   as Your Honor correctly says, all bargaining,

23   particularly in the public sector, has political

24   elements in it.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

 2              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. YOUNG


 3                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 4                  MR. YOUNG:    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mr. Young, I hope this

 6   won't use up much of your time, but I do have a pressing

 7   question to make sure that we're just not spinning our

 8   wheels here.

 9                  What if the union here had simply said all

10   this additional assessment will go to bargaining

11   activities, and then simply used its original

12   assessment, the portion that had been anticipated to be

13   used for bargaining, for political activities?           It could

14   do that, couldn't it?

15                  MR. YOUNG:    It would --

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         I mean, it's not committed

17   to -- to, you know, an 80-20, or whatever the division

18   is, simply because that's what's given out in the first

19   notice.   It can indeed use its -- the anticipated

20   portion for bargaining for political activities.

21                  MR. YOUNG:    It would be free to do so,

22   Justice Scalia.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         So, why are we wasting our

24   time?   I mean, all the unions are going to do is say

25   this is a general assessment for bargaining purposes,


                                      50

 1   and then use their -- their general funds for the


 2   political thing.


 3               MR. YOUNG:     Because the nonmembers still


 4   have that right to challenge, Justice Scalia.


 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But they don't lose it;

 6   they're going to do it the following September.              The

 7   attractive part of your argument from the beginning was

 8   that this is somehow a forced loan.              And I understand

 9   the attractiveness of that.          But it goes back to what

10   Justice Breyer said from the beginning, which is, given,

11   as has been recognized, that money is fungible and that

12   you can't really often predict what's going to happen in

13   the future, it's been developed a system that cyclically

14   gets money to the people back.

15               MR. YOUNG:     And money is fungible to a

16   degree, Justice Sotomayor -- Sotomayor -- excuse me.

17   And I respect that argument, but let's remember the

18   facts as we have them here.          In the facts of this case,

19   it was a segregated fund.       There's a separate portion, a

20   separate line item in the union's notice for both --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Okay.       So, you win, and

22   it'll never happen again.       It'll never again be called a

23   segregated fund for politics.

24               (Laughter.)

25               MR. YOUNG:     I lose, Justice Scalia, and it


                                    51

 1   will happen all the time, I'm afraid.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:          No, but the -- the problem

 3   if you win in this case, and then there is this other

 4   way of getting to the same -- the same result, is that

 5   the other way of getting to the same result, while

 6   permissible, is far less transparent.            And people won't

 7   understand it, and it -- it encourages a kind of slyness

 8   that seems highly undesirable.

 9               And the virtue of the present system is that

10   it does require some forced loans, that's true, but it

11   does wash out in the wash, and it ends up being fair to

12   the objectors.   And it's simply hard to think of a

13   better system that doesn't provide more administrative

14   problems than the existing one.

15               MR. YOUNG:     But --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:          So, that's -- go ahead.

17               MR. YOUNG:     And I thank you, Justice Breyer.

18   I'm sorry for interrupting.

19               It -- I understand that, Justice Breyer.

20   And for ordinary union dues, that's why when Justice

21   Sotomayor asked me at the beginning of the argument

22   whether we're challenging the ordinary Hudson system, I

23   answered no, because that system is perfectly adequate

24   for ordinary union dues.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The problem is that I'm


                                    52

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   being told by your adversary -- and since we don't know,

 2   I'm always afraid of writing a decision in a vacuum,

 3   okay?

 4                MR. YOUNG:     Sure.

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That unions structure

 6   their business in a myriad number of ways, that some

 7   have a very small due each year and a larger special

 8   assessment for special projects.            And I assume there's

 9   endless variety.

10                You're proposing a rule that every single

11   time an assessment outside of annual dues is imposed,

12   that a new Hudson notice can be given.                And you're

13   suggesting, Justice Scalia, that all they have to say is

14   we think it's going to be for chargeable effect.

15                MR. YOUNG:     Well, the -- I'm sorry.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Briefly, counsel.

17                MR. YOUNG:     Yes, and I thank you,

18   Mr. Chief Justice.

19                So, Justice Sotomayor, the answer is that

20   I'm saying it would -- it would be brief -- and my

21   friend Mr. Collins is saying that it doesn't happen that

22   often.   So, the burden is minimal.               Unions have other

23   options than extracting this money from unwitting

24   nonmembers -- interest-free loans, internationals.

25                And I thank the Court for its attention.
