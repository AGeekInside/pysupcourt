 6           ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD CORDRAY

 7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. CORDRAY:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10              Because this case arises under the

11   deferential standards of the AEDPA statute, Mr. Spisak

12   must show that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was

13   contrary to Mills v. Maryland or that it unreasonably

14   applied Strickland v. Washington.

15              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Why?        I -- I have been

16   trying to figure out why the State court would know in

17   its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different

18   result when Mills was issued after the State denied its

19   petition for rehearing.

20              MR. CORDRAY:        It's a bit of a conundrum,

21   Your Honor, because Mills was issued after the Ohio

22   Supreme Court's decision here, but before it became

23   final on direct review when cert was denied by this

24   Court in March of 1989.

25              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, finality in that


                                      3

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute

 2   of limitations.     Why should the same rule apply to the

 3   question of whether a State has acted contrary to or

 4   unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when

 5   the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering

 6   its decision?     How can a court act?

 7              MR. CORDRAY:           I'm perfectly willing, Your

 8   Honor, to back it up a step and say Mills was not

 9   clearly-established law at the time that the Ohio

10   Supreme Court decided, although the issues were current

11   at the time.

12              But I would go further and say the extension

13   of Mills that the Sixth Circuit's ruling made here is

14   not clearly-established law even today, more than

15   20 years later.    There is a -- the vast majority of

16   Circuits, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, have

17   rejected the position the Sixth Circuit took here, and

18   in fact, this case is quite distinct from Mills even if

19   Mills were applicable.         But I would take your point and

20   I would agree with it that it's kind of tough to impose

21   on the Ohio Supreme Court Mills when -

22              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                We don't have to go any

23   further if we simply address the question, at what point

24   in time are we talking about a State court's decision,

25   correct?

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. CORDRAY:        Fair enough.           Fair enough.

 2   Yes.   But I would say this case is distinct even from

 3   Mills, where the Court determined that the jury

 4   instructions gave the jury to believe that they could

 5   only consider mitigating factors that they had

 6   determined unanimously to be present.                  And in this case,

 7   none of that was done.       The verdict form was quite

 8   different, and in fact the jury was only instructed to

 9   be unanimous on the ultimate question of whether the

10   aggravators outweighed the mitigators, a common

11   instruction and one that's upheld around the country

12   consistently.

13               Second -

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            General Cordray, under

15   the charge that was given, what happens if there is a

16   juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances

17   don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances?                 Under

18   Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty.

19               But under the instruction that was given

20   here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators

21   outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a

22   failure of the jurors to agree on that question?

23               MR. CORDRAY:        Even at the time, if the jury

24   effectively hung -

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.


                                       5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. CORDRAY:        -- on that question, the

 2   consequence would be that the court would then impose

 3   some version of a life sentence.

 4               The issue is whether the jury was required

 5   to be instructed that at the time, whether they were

 6   required to be instructed something that might push them

 7   away from unanimity.      This Court has never so held, and

 8   in fact, in Jones v. United States the Court rejected

 9   that rule in a ruling that was not dissented to by

10   anyone on the panel.      Your dissent in that case at

11   footnote 20 took no issue with the -- with the notion

12   that the jury did not have to be instructed in ways that

13   would push them away from rendering unanimous verdict on

14   the ultimate question.

15               Since that time, as a matter of State court

16   practice the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Brooks did

17   say:   We are now going to add that instruction.           But

18   they later themselves rejected that that was required by

19   the Eighth Amendment in State v. Davis, and that also

20   has been the consistent holding of most circuits, that

21   that is not required.       If I could move -

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It would be -- under the

23   charge that was given in this case, you say it would be

24   -- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the

25   two life sentences.      It would not be a deadlock


                                       6

 1   requiring a resentencing hearing.

 2              MR. CORDRAY:        I believe that's the case at

 3   the time, Your Honor.

 4              At the time, the instructions pushed the

 5   jury toward unanimity one way or the other.            Do the

 6   aggravators outweigh the mitigators or do they not?

 7   Since that time, the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of

 8   practice has been willing to go further and instruct the

 9   jury, or have the jury be instructed, that if a single

10   one of you feels that the aggravators do not outweigh

11   the mitigators, that will preclude a death sentence.

12              But that has never been constitutionally

13   required by this Court.      It is an extension of Mills v.

14   Maryland that has never been so held by this Court, and

15   in fact is a source of a -- of a significant

16   overwhelming majority of circuits the opposite way.

17              If I could move to the -

18              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Isn't your adversary's

19   position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but

20   their position would be that this is a step further than

21   Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are

22   tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will

23   have to impose a life sentence or some form of it.

24              But the jury could believe that they could

25   -- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror


                                      7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would say:   Well, I don't want to let this guy out;

 2   because those are the only two choices and 11 people

 3   want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I

 4   have to vote for death to make sure that he is

 5   restrained in a way that I find acceptable.

 6                MR. CORDRAY:         This, as Your Honor notes from

 7   your time on the trial court, is the jury dynamic in the

 8   jury room.   It is the push towards unanimity.                 The issue

 9   here is whether the Constitution requires an instruction

10   to be given that would encourage a single juror to hold

11   out and try to avoid reaching a unanimous verdict.                     The

12   Court has never held that that is constitutionally

13   required, and if they did so hold in this case it would

14   be an extension that is a new rule and would not be

15   applicable on AEDPA review here.

16                Second, on the ineffectiveness claim,

17   Mr. Spisak loses sight of the fact that this was no

18   run-of-the-mill trial.         His crimes were among the most

19   infamous in Ohio history.           At the trial he groomed

20   himself to look like Adolf Hitler, and on the stand he

21   celebrated his victims' deaths, spewed his racist

22   beliefs, and pledged to continue his own brand of

23   personal warfare against society.                  In the sentencing

24   phase, defense counsel reasonably took the only tack

25   available to him.     He used the sheer depravity of his


                                         8

 1   client's crimes and his disturbing character to tell a

 2   story about his client's mental illness, and he asked

 3   the jury to forego the death penalty for Mr. Spisak

 4   because he is mentally ill and thus, under the

 5   mitigating factor, lacked substantial capacity to

 6   appreciate or conform his conduct to the requirements of

 7   the law.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            General Cordray -

 9               MR. CORDRAY:        That is not sufficient -

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- in reading that

11   closing argument, it is disjointed.                    It goes off on

12   tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that

13   the defendant is getting.         I mean, it really is quite a

14   stream of consciousness.        And what's remarkable about it

15   is at no point did counsel say, give him a life

16   sentence.   He said that either one would be acceptable,

17   either death or life would be acceptable.

18               MR. CORDRAY:        First of all, I would disagree

19   with that characterization of the closing.                    It was not a

20   perfect closing, but it had three identifiable pieces to

21   it.   The first was, he -- he did go back and

22   recapitulate the nature of the crimes, something this

23   Court said in Yarborough is an acceptable defense

24   strategy.   That's the elephant in the room.                   The jury

25   heard weeks of testimony about this crime.                    The


                                       9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   prosecutor was surely going to highlight that.            He was

 2   attempting to take this sting out and identify with the

 3   jury that he understood how they would react to the

 4   crimes.

 5                The second piece of the closing -- this is

 6   at petition appendix, approximately 339a to 344a, he

 7   goes into the mitigating factor of mental illness.            He

 8   had presented three mental health experts in the

 9   sentencing phase to demonstrate that his client was

10   mentally ill.   He had made a continued argument that

11   there was a larger jar of not guilty by reason of

12   insanity that he had not been able to fulfill, even

13   though he had tried at trial, and that evidence had

14   ultimately been struck by the trial court, which found

15   they have not made out a defense of not guilty by reason

16   of insanity.

17                But he pursued the same theme here in

18   sentencing, presenting evidence and saying:            We have at

19   least fulfilled the smaller jar of mental illness,

20   diminished capacity to intend, and because we are a

21   humane society our general assembly has made that a

22   mitigating factor that you should apply here, and you

23   should not execute someone who has a diminished ability

24   to intend.

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           General Cordray, may I -

 1   may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not -

 2   not deficient in performance.

 3               MR. CORDRAY:         That's right.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Assume I am persuaded that

 5   there was deficient performance, for all the reasons

 6   your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the

 7   prejudice issue.    I think you make a very strong

 8   argument that this guy would have gotten the death

 9   penalty anyway.    But what if -- what if the deficiency

10   had been even worse?      Supposing the defense counsel had

11   got up and said:   I wish I could make an argument, but I

12   really think you ought to give him the death penalty -

13   just outrageously sided with the prosecutor.             Would that

14   mean that we could still find no prejudice?

15               MR. CORDRAY:         I think in Cronic the Court

16   said that if there is effectively a structural

17   breakdown -- I mean, if in fact counsel had gotten up

18   and argued solely a prosecution argument and not pivoted

19   at all to mitigating circumstances, perhaps it would be

20   possible to presume prejudice in that situation.             That's

21   not the situation in this case.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:             No, I -- I understand

23   that.   But -- so you really are saying the question is

24   whether Cronic or Strickland controls?

25               MR. CORDRAY:         That's one of the questions.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Yes.

 2                MR. CORDRAY:         Although in our cert petition

 3   question 2, we also argue that the Sixth Circuit erred

 4   by not deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court's application

 5   of Strickland v. Washington.

 6                And on the prejudice issue, this is

 7   Landrigan.   That is the case this Court decided and then

 8   granted, vacated and remanded this case back to the

 9   Sixth Circuit.   If you look at the prejudice discussion

10   in Landrigan -- and I would direct attention to the

11   quote near the end where the Court says that the court

12   of appeals panel got it right, and what they said was

13   that the -- the testimony was chilling.                  The person in

14   Landrigan had repeated -- had committed repeated murders

15   and tried to kill again and again.

16                The same with Spisak in this case.                 He had

17   been unrepentant in the court and in fact had flaunted

18   his menacing behavior, just as Spisak went on for days

19   on the stand expressing his white power views and how he

20   would continue to war if he had the opportunity, if

21   given the chance.

22                In Landrigan this Court approved the court

23   of appeals statement in the end that any further, minor

24   mitigating evidence that could have been presented in

25   the wake of that record could not have been helpful;

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there is no prejudice.       That prejudice holding in

 2   Landrigan I believe controls this case.                In fact, this

 3   case may be even a stronger case than Landrigan for no

 4   prejudice.

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But does your argument

 6   really depend on any deference to the State Supreme

 7   Court?   It seems to me that your argument is just sort

 8   of as a fresh matter there wasn't prejudice here.                And

 9   -- and isn't it also true that we really don't know what

10   the Ohio Supreme Court's basis for its decision was,

11   whether not competent, incompetence, or lack of

12   prejudice.

13                MR. CORDRAY:       I would say three things, Your

14   Honor.   First of all, I would agree with Yarborough,

15   where this Court said that the -- the determination

16   about deficiency and prejudice is doubly deferential

17   through the AEDPA lens.       We would defer, as Yarborough

18   said, to reasonable tactical decisions made in closing

19   argument, but we would be doubly deferential under AEDPA

20   because we have to hold that the Ohio Supreme Court's

21   rejection of the ineffectiveness claim was itself

22   objectively an unreasonable application of Strickland.

23   So that's one.

24                Number two, the Ohio Supreme Court did

25   reject this claim.    It cited Strickland v. Washington.

 1   It did not go on in detail.

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But we don't know which

 3   prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?

 4               MR. CORDRAY:          We don't.              But this is not a

 5   case like Rompilla, where the -- where the Court was

 6   faced with a court that had held only on one prong and

 7   had disclaimed any attempt to review under the other

 8   prong.   If the court simply gives a summary affirmance

 9   or summary disposition and doesn't specify which prong,

10   I think the Court has to give deference under both

11   prongs, because the alternative would be to give

12   deference under neither prong, which is inconsistent

13   with the -- the AEDPA statement that we have to did

14   defer to an adjudication on the merits by a State court.

15   And so I think that is -- that is fair here.                     But I

16   certainly think -

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:              So you'd say a State

18   supreme court is entitled to more deference if it

19   doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?

20               MR. CORDRAY:          It -- it may seem a little

21   odd, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Yes.

23               MR. CORDRAY:          If they disclaim a prong, then

24   I think it's de novo review, and Rompilla did say that.

25   If they don't disclaim a prong, I think that the Court

 1   has to defer because the alternative is it gives no

 2   deference to summary dispositions, and -- and that has

 3   been the general tenor of courts under AEDPA, is if

 4   there is a question you err on the side of giving

 5   deference.    That clearly was Congress's intent in

 6   enacting that statute.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, there are two

 8   extremes.    One is no defense whatsoever, Justice

 9   Stevens' hypothetical.        The attorney just comes in and

10   says, kill him, okay?       And then there is another, which

11   is your very eloquent explanation of this attorney's

12   strategy.    If he had done what you did here, we may not

13   be having this appeal.        But at some point you can have a

14   strategy and execute it so poorly, so incompetently,

15   that you're providing ineffective assistance of counsel.

16   You are not accepting that that can occur, you are

17   saying the minute an attorney says, I had a strategy,

18   that that is effective counsel, regardless of how that

19   attorney executed that strategy.                That appears to be

20   your argument.

21                MR. CORDRAY:        We, of course, Your Honor,

22   don't have subjective testimony from the counsel as to

23   what his strategy was.        But I think it's quite apparent

24   from the record.    He at trial attempted to establish a

25   defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.                He was set


                                       15

 1   back, he and his trial team, because in the end the

 2   trial judge rejected that defense and struck that

 3   testimony.     He renewed his effort at the sentencing

 4   phase by bringing several mental health experts and

 5   having them testify on the stand to show that at least

 6   they had met the lower standard of mental disease or

 7   defect under the Ohio Revised Code.

 8                He then argued, perhaps not as eloquently as

 9   -- as one might, you know, as -- as Justice Jackson once

10   said, you know, in their bed that night, but he argued

11   about:   Yes, these crimes were brutal.                  He went on at

12   some length about that.         But these crimes were brutal

13   and the jury had heard all that and clearly had that in

14   their minds.    He then pivoted to five pages of closing

15   arguments, in addition to days of presentation on the

16   subject, to say:    We have shown at least mental illness;

17   it is a mitigating factor; the General Assembly made it

18   a mitigating factor and we as a humane people should be

19   proud that we do not execute someone who has substantial

20   deficiency in ability to intend.

21                He then went on to handle some rebuttal

22   points that he was -- he was feeling the heat on from

23   the prosecutor's presentation.               For example, that he had

24   not necessarily met with these experts before they came

25   and testified at trial; that he had perhaps shopped for


                                        16

 1   experts and other matters of that sort; that maybe the

 2   -- the jury was going to hold against him and his

 3   defense team their deficiency as counsel, because they

 4   had made this effort to get not a -- a not guilty by

 5   reason of insanity plea and the judge had knocked that

 6   out.

 7              JUSTICE ALITO:          Have you ever heard or read

 8   a defense summation that was more derogatory of the

 9   defendant than the summation here?

10              MR. CORDRAY:        I have not read a great number

11   of defense summations, but this was derogatory.            But

12   frankly, the bed that was made was made by his client,

13   who got on the stand for days on end and spewed his

14   racist propaganda, made it clear that he was not only

15   unrepentant but was triumphant; that one or more of his

16   murders were slick, pretty neat; that he celebrated the

17   killings; that he went out to kill again, that if he had

18   the opportunity now he would again go out to kill again.

19              JUSTICE ALITO:          But defense counsel -

20              MR. CORDRAY:        That's the context.

21              JUSTICE ALITO:          -- goes so far as to say:

22   Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none.

23   But isn't that exactly what he has to appeal for in

24   order not to get a death verdict, sympathy based on -

25   on mental illness, despite the horrific crimes that this


                                     17

 1   person committed and the things that he said on the

 2   stand.

 3              MR. CORDRAY:        No, Your Honor.           And I think

 4   again counsel in the context of this proceeding judged,

 5   perhaps rightly, that it was very unlikely this jury was

 6   going to have sympathy for his client.                Instead he

 7   appealed to the jury's own sense of humanity and pride:

 8   We have this mitigating factor under the law, we are a

 9   civilized people, we do not execute people who have

10   substantial diminished ability to intend; and I appeal

11   to you, you jury, even though I can sense that you are

12   not feeling sympathy for my client, do what -- what

13   makes you a humane people, what makes us proud as a

14   people, and do not give the death penalty to a person

15   who is sick, demented, twisted, as my client has shown

16   himself to be here on the stand.

17              I think it's a coherent strategy.                In fact,

18   I don't see easily how he could have done better.                  And

19   as in Landrigan, if he had said, give him sympathy, give

20   him a life sentence, which was the thrust of the entire

21   proceedings, I don't think that that created -- that

22   lack of saying that created any prejudice on this

23   record, which was very thoroughly established, in part

24   by his client 's own testimony.

25              I would also say in Yarborough, on the


                                     18

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   deficiency point, this Court said that focusing in on

 2   one particular theme may well be a preferable strategy,

 3   and there has to be broad deference given to closing,

 4   which is only a part, after all, of the entire

 5   sentencing proceeding, in that taking an understated

 6   approach that -- that emphasizes the jury's autonomy.

 7                In Yarborough, if you remember, the defense

 8   counsel did not actually ask specifically in so many

 9   words for a life sentence.            The Court said that's not

10   deficient.     He could count on the judge's charge to the

11   jury.   They were going to charge the jury as to how to

12   handle the evidence.       It was the thrust of the whole

13   proceedings.     He presented three mental health experts

14   to show mental illness and diminished ability to intend.

15   And he argued that as part of his closing.

16                I think it was not deficient, and I

17   certainly think on this record, this stunning record

18   created in part by his client's crimes, which were

19   acknowledged and undisputed and there was no factual

20   dispute about them and their heinousness, and then by

21   his client's testimony on the stand, which graphically

22   and at great length reinforced his, again, triumph in

23   his -- in his warfare against trying to kill as many

24   black people, Jewish people and gay people as he could

25   find, and that he would continue that warfare if given

 1   the chance.

 2                 I think it's impossible to find that there

 3   is prejudice on this record for the -- for the -- for

 4   the -- even the medium-sized quibbles that are being

 5   raised here 20 years after the fact.

 6                 If I -- if I may reserve the rest of my time

 7   for rebuttal.

10                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. BENZA

11                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12                 MR. BENZA:      Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

13   and may it please the Court:

14                 The Sixth Circuit evaluated performance of

15   trial counsel in this case and found deficient

16   performance for three primary areas.

17                 First, counsel presented and argued to the

18   jury nonstatutory aggravating factors as reasons to

19   impose the death sentence on Mr. Spisak.                In Ohio, the

20   jury is allowed to consider only the statutory

21   aggravator factors, not nonstatutory factors.                The

22   counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons

23   to execute Mr. Spisak.

24                 He then proceeded to tell the jury what was

25   not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors


                                       20

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that have long been accepted as mitigating factors like

 2   performance in prison, adaptive skills and the issue

 3   regarding his family upbringing and childhood.

 4                Finally, the lawyer turned to what he argued

 5   was the only mitigating evidence that they were going to

 6   be arguing, and that was the issue of the client's

 7   mental health.     He then -

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You say -- you fault

 9   him for not talking about performance in prison,

10   prospective performance in prison?

11                MR. BENZA:        That is correct.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It doesn't look like

13   that's going to be a very strong argument.                  I mean, he

14   is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you

15   are going to get up there and say he might perform well

16   in prison?

17                MR. BENZA:        Absolutely, Your Honor.           In

18   fact, because it is directly related to the mental

19   health evidence.    Had the lawyer identified the

20   testimony of the mental health experts, including

21   Dr. Resnick, who is the court clinic psychiatrist, who

22   testified that while he has been incarcerated and

23   receiving treatment his performance and his mental

24   illness has resided -- that he has gotten better.                  And

25   that he is not -

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               He is on the stand

 2   with a Hitler moustache testifying about what a great

 3   job he did killing these people, and he says he is going

 4   to do it again.   I think -- didn't the letter identify

 5   particular people he wanted to kill?

 6                MR. BENZA:      That is correct, it did.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And the jury is

 8   supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in

 9   prison?

10                MR. BENZA:      If the -- if the lawyer had

11   identified for the jury the testimony of the mental

12   health experts, that would have been the case.               This

13   Court recognized -

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:          These experts said he had

15   improved?

16                MR. BENZA:      Yes.       Dr. Resnick testified -

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Before this testimony on

18   the stand?

19                MR. BENZA:      During the trial, yes.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Wow.

21                MR. BENZA:      That his performance -

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:          That didn't look like

23   improvement to me.

24                (Laughter.)

25                MR. BENZA:      Well, that may be, Your Honor,

 1   but that's what the experts testified to.                  And this was

 2   the court clinic expert who was testifying, who

 3   evaluated him for the not guilty by reason of insanity.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But I guess it gets

 5   back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a

 6   jury would think and isn't it possible.                  You are

 7   suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws

 8   that are there, this might help.              But isn't it possible

 9   that that would have a negative effect on the jury?                  In

10   other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy

11   is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's

12   credibility is -- is shot.

13              MR. BENZA:       If there is no evidence to

14   support that, that would be correct.                  The problem that

15   this case presents -- and this is what the Sixth Circuit

16   found -- that had the lawyer then said, yes, for all of

17   these reasons they may weigh in favor of death, but here

18   are the reasons why you should consider life, we would

19   have a very case than we have here today.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Benza, do you know of

21   any case where ineffective assistance was found on the

22   basis of a closing argument alone?               General Cordray

23   pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of

24   witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness,

25   and that he did play that theme in the closing.


                                     23

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 Do you know of any case where the closing,

 2   not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was

 3   held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of

 4   counsel?

 5                 MR. BENZA:       No.      And that's because this

 6   case is such an outlier.          I have been litigating capital

 7   cases since 1993.     I have never seen a closing argument

 8   like this.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What would you have done?

10   I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this.                    But I mean,

11   I have heard the other side and I have read the

12   argument.     And it makes sense logically to say he has

13   the worst defendant he has ever seen.                    He's murdered

14   lots of people in cold blood.              He gets up on the stand

15   and says:     I'm going to kill a lot more.                 He sounds

16   totally bonkers.     And -- and he says to the jury, I

17   can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it

18   was terrible.     I can't tell you that there's anything

19   here that should make you feel better about him; there

20   is nothing.     But we are a nation of people who are

21   humane and our law says don't put a person to death when

22   he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a

23   lower standard of insanity than I had to meet.                    But it's

24   clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their

25   testimony, and that's what they said.                    So be humane.

 1               Now, you think he should have said something

 2   else.   What?

 3               MR. BENZA:        He -- what he should have done

 4   is what this Court recognized in Penry v. Lynaugh, is

 5   that mental health evidence is a double-edged sword.

 6   The job of the defense lawyer is to explain why the

 7   mental health evidence mitigates the crimes -

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, he -- he said why.        He

 9   said.   He said:   We don't execute people who are crazy

10   and this guy is crazy.        He might not be crazy enough to

11   meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity.

12   He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of

13   incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you

14   that he's seriously crazy.           And if you don't -- if you

15   doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes.

16               I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have

17   courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.

18               MR. BENZA:        Well, we actually don't know

19   what the State court said about -

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            Or we had at least one

21   State court that found it okay.

22               MR. BENZA:        For whatever reason we had the

23   State court decision that affirmed this.                We have no

24   idea why.

25               The issue is, however, once the lawyer

 1   decided that this was the mitigation strategy that he

 2   was going to present, this was the evidence that he had

 3   available to argue to him, it is the role of the defense

 4   counsel to advocate.

 5               So once the lawyer makes the strategic

 6   decision, I am going to present the closing argument

 7   focused -- based on mental health mitigating evidence,

 8   then the lawyer's job is to stand up and explain to

 9   the -

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             But I agree with all that

11   you are saying.     What I am saying my hard time is here

12   is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable

13   decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really

14   rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of

15   defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no

16   sympathy?

17               MR. BENZA:         As the amici points out, there

18   is no strategic reason for this closing.                  The amici for

19   Petitioner -- or for Respondent has identified that

20   there can be no strategic reason to have provided this

21   closing argument.     By any evaluation of the skill of

22   closing argument this was deficient.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, I think -- I think it

24   was swallowing the worst evidence.                  It was telling the

25   jury that was going to think this is a hateful person

 1   who had done hateful things.

 2                 I agree with you.            I accept all of that, but

 3   even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant

 4   closing argument.     You said you've -- you've conducted

 5   many capital cases.

 6                 Have you ever conducted a capital case in

 7   which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler

 8   moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he

 9   will do it again?

10                 How many cases have you had like that?

11                 MR. BENZA:       No.      Spisak is the only one like

12   that.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           This was an extraordinary

14   trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique

15   that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this

16   fellow was -- was the best that could have been done.

17                 MR. BENZA:       If that's your conclusion, then

18   we -- we don't point on the merits of the claim.               I beg

19   to differ -

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, if -- if the

21   strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to

22   some extent, Justice Scalia have outlined is a correct

23   strategy, would you go on to say that the implementation

24   of that strategy was substandard?

25                 It's rambling, you have to -- in order to

 1   get Mr. Cordray's very succinct explanation, you have to

 2   go through a couple of pages and drift it out, as

 3   Justice Sotomayor said, his argument was fine, and

 4   Justice Breyer -- but that is not the argument we have.

 5              MR. BENZA:       That is correct.          The lawyer

 6   didn't -

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What -- what is the case

 8   that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a

 9   case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme

10   courts, where it is said that the implementation of the

11   strategy was just inept -- totally inept.

12              I mean, is that what your argument is here?

13              MR. BENZA:       Yes, that the application, that

14   the way the lawyer delivered the closing, the themes

15   that he identified, the things that he said, was the

16   deficiency -

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Again, that depends on,

18   oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom.

19   This -- this is very hard for us -- you know, he was

20   trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously.

21              These are things that are very difficult for

22   us to assess.

23              MR. BENZA:       They are very difficult, but

24   this case doesn't present those nuances.              This case

25   presents the case where the lawyer stands up at closing

 1   argument -- and the only thing he didn't say that could

 2   have made this worse was Justice Stevens hypothetical of

 3   it's fine by me if you actually execute him.

 4               It's the only thing he didn't say in his

 5   closing that could have possibly made it worse for the

 6   client.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, he actually did

 8   say that.

 9               MR. BENZA:         Not in those words.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, but, pretty much,

11   he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the

12   death sentence.

13               MR. BENZA:         And we will be proud of you,

14   whichever you do.     Only those very words, I would like

15   you to execute him as well, did not escape his lips.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But, I mean, it

17   seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and

18   the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record

19   may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are

20   telling us he has to have.

21               Here's why you should give this guy

22   sympathy.   Here's why.        Here's -- he's a good guy.             I

23   mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is

24   a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which

25   is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did

 1   some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for

 2   sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very

 3   proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it

 4   seems to me that this disagreement is over different

 5   styles of advocacy.

 6                 And I don't know how to -- particularly in a

 7   case where you don't have much to work with, I don't

 8   know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse

 9   than the other.

10                 MR. BENZA:      But that's what we do under

11   Strickland.    The court recognizes, in Strickland

12   analysis, that there are multiple ways that various

13   lawyers will try the same case; all of which can be

14   effective.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You just told me that,

16   under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case

17   in which there has been a decision for the defendant,

18   based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone.

19                 So you are asking us to take a new tact and

20   inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing

21   argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.

22                 MR. BENZA:      Yes, but this court has already

23   recognized that the Sixth Amendment applies, the right

24   to counsel applies at closing argument.

25                 In Yarborough v. Gentry, at page 5 of this

 1   Court's opinion, the Court specifically stated that the

 2   right to effective assistance extends to closing

 3   argument.

 4                 So this is not a redevelopment or an

 5   expansion of Strickland.          It's simply an application of

 6   the Strickland analysis, the particular facts of this

 7   case before the -

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why -- why isn't it the

 9   Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the

10   context of the case that was presented at trial, and,

11   here, the case was.

12                 The only thing going for the defendant were

13   the witnesses to his mental illness and whether,

14   eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury.

15                 This is a mentally ill man.

16                 MR. BENZA:       That's -- that's correct, and

17   that's the theme that defense counsel said he was going

18   to implement at the closing.              What -- the failure of the

19   lawyer was to adequately and effectively make that

20   closing to the jury.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, he talked about

22   nothing else.     And I understand -- look, I am not an

23   expert.     I haven't argued these things to juries, and I

24   recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very

25   rambling.    I didn't think it was rambling.

 1                I thought he was trying to spend a lot of

 2   time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial

 3   remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert

 4   because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them

 5   enough.

 6                And so you describe that for a couple of

 7   pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he

 8   talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked

 9   about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here,

10   is because he recognizes this is the most sensational

11   case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are

12   going to congratulate you.

13                But what you are doing here is you are

14   applying a standard, and you are proud to be an

15   American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane

16   standard that requires you to not give the death penalty

17   when the man's insane.

18                Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or

19   9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over.

20   And how can I -- since there is a lower court that

21   seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say

22   it wasn't?

23                MR. BENZA:      Well, it -- first, as to the

24   question of whether or not the lower court found it

25   adequate, we have no idea, again, what the Ohio Supreme

 1   Court determined as to question of deficient

 2   performances or to prejudice or to strategy.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           How many -- how many

 4   issues were before the Ohio Supreme Court?

 5                 MR. BENZA:      There were 67 assignments of

 6   error raised to the Ohio Supreme Court.                 This is the

 7   only case on direct appeal, where the Ohio Supreme Court

 8   issued a procuring of.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Didn't -- didn't they cite

10   Strickland?

11                 MR. BENZA:      They did cite Strickland, along

12   with 49 other claims.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, I guess then they

14   concede the argument.

15                 MR. BENZA:      They dismissed this claim and -

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Why do we have no idea

17   then?   If they cited Strickland, why do we have no idea

18   what they -- 

19                 MR. BENZA:      We have no idea whether they

20   decided that there was deficient performance, but no

21   prejudice -- that there was, in fact, deficient

22   performance, but no prejudice, that this was not

23   deficient because it was reasonable strategy.

24                 It is also possible that the lower courts

25   were misapplying, as this Court recognized in Michael

 1   Williams' case, that -

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So I think that we have to

 3   defer to all of those, right?

 4                MR. BENZA:        I'm sorry?

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I think, if they could have

 6   been relying on any of those, we would have to defer to

 7   all, wouldn't we?

 8                MR. BENZA:        Unless we -

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            One-by-one, I mean -

10                MR. BENZA:        If we assume that they were then

11   applying the Lockhart v. Fretwell standard as to the

12   question of prejudice, then it would clearly be contrary

13   to Strickland, to have applied that standard of review

14   for prejudice.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why would we assume that?

16                MR. BENZA:        Well, because we don't know what

17   the Supreme Court actually did.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            When we -- when you don't

19   know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume

20   the best, not the worst.          Isn't that the standard rule

21   of review?

22                MR. BENZA:        That is.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You, very often, don't know

24   on what basis the lower court took action.               You assume

25   it was a lawful basis.

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's the rule on direct

 2   appeal, of course, not on collateral.

 3               MR. BENZA:       That is the rule on direct

 4   appeal.   It is also the implication of applying AEDPA.

 5   The problem that you have in that is, when you try to

 6   apply AEDPA to this particular claim, you don't know how

 7   the state court, in fact, decided this case.

 8               And, therefore, you don't know whether or

 9   not you are going to give the AEDPA deference to the

10   decision that there was no deficient performance, that

11   there was no prejudice.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:           How -- how does that work?

13   Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the

14   defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he

15   would even number them.

16               And it's fairly common to find a court of

17   appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17,

18   and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.

19               MR. BENZA:       That is true.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, that -- that happens

21   all the time.

22               MR. BENZA:       That is correct.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           And, now, it's very, very

24   common that, in making that argument, there could be

25   some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be


                                      35
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   some bad grounds for rejecting it.

 2                So would we send -- do we send every case

 3   like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected

 4   it for a good reason or a bad reason?

 5                MR. BENZA:        I would think, no, that you

 6   don't send it back, but what happens -

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            What we do is we assume

 8   they did it for a bad reason?

 9                MR. BENZA:        I would -- I think the issue

10   then would become that, when a state court chooses to

11   summarily deny, without evaluation, an explanation of

12   the merits of the claim, that, when it comes to habeas

13   review, the constraints of AEDPA are lifted.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So the Ohio Supreme

15   Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at

16   least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate

17   itself against being overturned on federal habeas?

18                MR. BENZA:        Not insulate from overturning,

19   but to gain the benefit of 2254(d)'s restrictive reviews

20   of habeas.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which insulates it from

22   being overturned.

23                MR. BENZA:        If, in fact, it is not contrary

24   to our unreasonable application, it would be insulated

25   or -

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           Is there any authority for

 2   that?   Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one,

 3   but I -- I do think hearing it that suddenly habeas

 4   opinions and district court opinions would grow by an

 5   order of magnitude, because it's very common to see

 6   arguments rejected summarily.

 7               MR. BENZA:       That is correct.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, is there any authority

 9   for the proposition that if they reject it summarily,

10   that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we

11   assume they are wrong?

12               MR. BENZA:       No, this Court has never

13   addressed how to apply 2254(d) to a summary decision.

14   In Knowles v. Mirzayance, the Court noted that this was

15   in fact an issue and reserved that for another day.

16               In Early v. Packer, this Court recognized,

17   though, however, that AEDPA constraints are looking at

18   not just at the outcome of the lower court's -- the

19   State court's decisions, but the reasoning behind it,

20   because if you are going to have an unreasonable

21   application of -- of a binding law from this court, the

22   lower courts have to be able to apply it and explain,

23   how did we apply it?     Otherwise every decision of the

24   State court would be insulated from Federal habeas

25   review, making the writ available but unavailable.

 1   Because no decision would therefore ever be unreasonable

 2   if the standard is for a district court judge to say:

 3   Can I imagine a reasonable way for the State court to

 4   have reached this result?          I have; I'm a reasonable

 5   judge; the State court must have done what I have done;

 6   therefore, the review is limited, and the writ -- and

 7   the writ is denied.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if you're -- if

 9   you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a

10   decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our

11   own, without deference to the State court findings?

12                MR. BENZA:       It would review -- it would

13   revert to pre-AEDPA habeas review to the standards, and

14   with review of the State court decision but with de novo

15   application in the -

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that is not what AEDPA

17   says.    AEDPA says that we have to give deference unless

18   it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.

19   The burden is on the appealing defendant to show that it

20   was an unreasonable application.                In case of doubt, he

21   loses.

22                Now, AEDPA could have been written

23   differently.    It could have been written the way you

24   want.    The Supreme Court shall evaluate the

25   reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion.                It isn't

 1   written that way.     It says the burden is on you to show

 2   that this was an unreasonable application of Supreme

 3   Court law.     And where there is a summary disposition,

 4   that's a hard road aho.

 5                 MR. BENZA:       I would submit it is impossible.

 6   If the -

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's -- it's not

 8   impossible.     I think there are cases where -- where

 9   relying on prior Supreme Court law doesn't get you

10   there.    It's not impossible.

11                 MR. BENZA:       I would -- I would beg to

12   differ.     I would think that if the summary disposition

13   is going to be held to that standard of an unreasonable

14   application where we have no indication of how the State

15   courts actually applied the law, it would have to be the

16   extreme outlier that would demonstrate that that was an

17   unreasonable -

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So we should revise the

19   statute and it should not say unreasonable application

20   of Supreme Court law?

21                 MR. BENZA:       It -- it does not require a

22   revision.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why doesn't it?

24                 MR. BENZA:       It simply requires the Court to

25   say that when you have summary disposition, that when


                                        39

 1   evaluating the State claim, the State court decision is

 2   given the deference that it is due, and that is that we

 3   simply cannot determine whether or not it properly

 4   applied Federal law, and therefore, it does not get the

 5   safe harbor of AEDPA evaluation.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not how the -

 7   that's not how the statute reads.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why wouldn't you do

 9   that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an

10   appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion?

11   Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied,

12   motion denied, this denied, denied, denied.                   And if I'm

13   going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I

14   also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal

15   judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most

16   common thing in the world?

17              MR. BENZA:        The Court does that when it

18   reviews those quarters constrained by what actually

19   happened in the lower court.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:            We did?          I mean, I've

21   reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always

22   thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all

23   his reasons.   And the question is really, given the

24   circumstance, can we say that he acted contrary to law?

25              MR. BENZA:        And that is -

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           If it's trial-based, you

 2   look at what the facts are that he might have taken.

 3               MR. BENZA:       And that would be the evaluation

 4   that would continue on in habeas review of these claims,

 5   is evaluating the State court decision without, though,

 6   simply saying, well, we're going to -- and this is what

 7   happens in the lower courts.            When you have these

 8   summary decisions in 2254(d) analysis, those circuits

 9   that have applied this say, what we will imagine a way

10   in which the State court could have reasonably applied

11   this law to reach this result, and therefore, since that

12   is a reasonable way, because of course we as Article 3

13   judges have reasonably come up with that, it must be

14   reasonable, it's not an unreasonable application, and

15   the writ is denied.

16               The problem that we face is when you look at

17   that in comparison to cases like Wiggins and Rompilla

18   where the State courts affirmatively denied applying

19   Federal standards, you get a different level of review.

20   And so you end up encouraging State courts in these

21   types of cases to simply issue postcard denials:              Appeal

22   denied.   Federal courts, you figure it out.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I think that assumes

24   that the State courts are -- what the Supreme Court of

25   Ohio and all the other State supreme courts are doing is

 1   waiving briefs for Federal habeas courts.

 2                MR. BENZA:       I don't think -

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:          Do you think that's what

 4   AEDPA was intended to do?

 5                MR. BENZA:       I think AEDPA was designed that

 6   when the State courts, in fact, are doing their jobs

 7   under the Constitution to protect defendants' rights to

 8   review their claim, then they should receive the

 9   protections of AEDPA.       What that means for deferential

10   review -

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's not what it says.

12   That's not what it says.         It says that you have to show

13   that it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court

14   law.    That's what it says.

15                MR. BENZA:       It does.          And as this Court has

16   explained, what happens in habeas is that the Federal,

17   the district courts and the circuit courts have to

18   evaluate the claim and determine whether or not there

19   was an unreasonable application.                It still falls to the

20   district court and the circuit court to -

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And if they can't, you

22   lose.    Because that's the way the statute reads.

23                MR. BENZA:       That's correct.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You want to say if they

25   can't, we have a new statute.             But we don't.     The burden

 1   on you is to show that it's an unreasonable application.

 2   If you tell me we can't tell, you lose.

 3                MR. BENZA:         That's the other alternative is

 4   that then the statute doesn't apply, which as this Court

 5   has recognized, when it comes to applying AEDPA, the

 6   side that is left untouched regarding that is the issue

 7   of the suspension of the writ.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:             So you are saying -- I

 9   mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of

10   reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the

11   habeas judge vis--vis the State judge there is the same

12   as the Federal appellate judge vis--vis the district

13   judge?    That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes

14   a finding, doesn't fully explain it.                      Now, I would think

15   it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application

16   of a Supreme Court case.           And I know how to review that.

17   I mean, I -- I know how to review it, I think.

18                Okay.     So you are saying however I do that,

19   I should do the same thing and the -- but you don't -

20   you don't think there is a more relaxed standard than

21   that?    You think that's basically the standard?

22                MR. BENZA:         It's still the same standard.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             Same -- but if they had

24   made an explicit finding, then maybe it would be a

25   tougher standard.

 1              MR. BENZA:       That's correct.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.

 3              MR. BENZA:       The standards provided for in

 4   AEDPA are there to protect the State court judgments

 5   when they have done their job, when they explained their

 6   rationale and applied the Federal law.                If you see these

 7   postcard denials -

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Benza, you might want

 9   to use what time is remaining to deal with the other

10   issue, which we haven't talked about at all.

11              MR. BENZA:       If I may, if I'm turning -- if

12   there are no further questions on the effect, I will

13   turn to the Mills issue.

14              The -- the question in front of the Sixth

15   Circuit was whether or not the totality of the jury

16   instructions in this case were such that they violated

17   Mills' directive that an individual jurist's

18   determination of a mitigating factor's existence could

19   not be precluded from being considered by the injection

20   of that -- of those factors by the other 11 jurors.

21              What you have in this particular case is the

22   totality of the jury instructions were such that a

23   reasonable understanding of the instruction was that the

24   jury had to be unanimous as to the understanding and the

25   existence of a mitigating factor before it could even be

 1   considered.

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, what is your answer to

 3   the first question that Justice Sotomayor asked?           Half

 4   of you say that -- that the State court's decision was

 5   contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of

 6   clearly-established Federal laws determined by the

 7   Supreme Court of the United States, i.e., Mills v.

 8   Maryland, when Mills v. Maryland hadn't been decided.

 9                 MR. BENZA:      In Terry Williams v. Taylor,

10   this Court recognized in the opinion authored by Justice

11   O'Connor that the issue for contrary to or unreasonable

12   application is going to be governed by the

13   application of Teague.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         And are there -- are there

15   not quite a few instances of contrary statements in our

16   opinions?

17                 MR. BENZA:      As to the application of Mills?

18   Or -

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:         As to the -- as to the time

20   when the -- the law has to be clearly established by a

21   decision in that court.

22                 MR. BENZA:      No, this Court has maintained

23   that the issue regarding the application of -- of

24   controlling established -- what -- clearly established

25   law by this Court is going to be determined by Teague,


                                       45

 1   and Teague determines that Mills v. Maryland decision

 2   applies to this claim.        In -- it was adjudicated on the

 3   merits in State court.

 4                 Now there is another -- underlying this is

 5   another AEDPA concern, is how does the Federal -- or the

 6   State court adjudicate the constitutional claim since

 7   Mills had not been presented.             It decided the merits of

 8   the claim were -- were to be rejected but it did not

 9   decide the case under Mills v. Maryland because of

10   course Mills had not been decided and we know from this

11   Court's decision in the Banks case that Mills was a new

12   law.

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:         This Court has not said that

14   clearly established Federal law refers to this Court's

15   decision as of the time of the relevant State court

16   decision.

17                 MR. BENZA:      That this Court has said, but

18   this Court has also said that the decision to that

19   question is based on the decision of Teague.                 If a case

20   applies to the Court based on Teague, then it will apply

21   to the merits of this particular claim.                 And what the

22   circuit found -

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Counsel, I don't understand

 1                 MR. BENZA:      This Court has held that the

 2   decision of whether a -- when a case is going to be

 3   clearly established for review in habeas is going to be

 4   based on Teague.    That was the opinion by Justice

 5   O'Connor concurring in the judgment in Terry Williams,

 6   that the decision for clearly established is going to be

 7   based on the decision of the applicability of Teague.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Does Teague say anything

 9   about time?

10                 MR. BENZA:      Teague says that the decision

11   for application of a newly established law or a new

12   established constitutional rule is predicated on the

13   denial of direct appeal, which in this case would be the

14   cert denied by this Court of the direct appeal of the 

15   case, which happened in 1989, a year after the decision

16   in Mills was handed down.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Counsel, the Mills

18   opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the

19   end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we

20   conclude there is a substantial probability that

21   reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's

22   instructions in this case and in attempting to complete

23   the verdict form as instructed may have thought they

24   were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence

25   unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a

 1   particular such circumstance.

 2               MR. BENZA:       That is correct.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Now how is that

 4   clearly established law that your claim is -- is

 5   contrary to Mills?

 6               MR. BENZA:       Because in -- in our case every

 7   jury instruction that was given to the jury told them

 8   that they had to be unanimous, including the specific

 9   instruction -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That is on death or

11   nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating

12   circumstance exists.

13               MR. BENZA:       Actually they -- they were told

14   that, because they were also told that that included

15   their decisions as to all disputes of fact.                 The

16   existence of a mitigating factor is of course a question

17   of fact.   So the jury was in fact specifically

18   instructed to be unanimous to every decision that they

19   made including resolving disputes of fact.                 They were

20   told by both lawyers for the defense and lawyers for the

21   prosecution that the first question they had to answer

22   when they got into the jury room was to the existence of

23   mitigating factors.

24               If they -- if they reasonably understood

25   that they had to be unanimous as to that fact they would

 1   have rejected the mitigating factors, even if 11 of them

 2   had agreed that the mental health evidence in this case

 3   was a mitigating factor.          And when -

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How does that work?   The

 5   instruction was all 12 must agree that the aggravators

 6   outweigh the mitigators before death is imposed.

 7                MR. BENZA:        That's correct, as to that

 8   instruction.    But the existence of the mitigator was the

 9   predicate question that the jury would have to answer

10   and our position is that they also would have had to be

11   unanimous per the instruction.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where -- where is that in

13   the instructions?     I -- I didn't realize that that's

14   what you are counting on.           Where is it?

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Read it again?

 2               MR. BENZA:       At page -- the petition appendix

 3   page 326.   "It is your duty to carefully weigh the

 4   evidence.   To decide all disputed questions of fact, to

 5   apply the instructions of the Court to your findings and

 6   to render your verdict accordingly."

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Where does that say

 8   what your summary was earlier, that they -

 9               MR. BENZA:       That the -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- can't consider a

11   mitigating circumstance unless they unanimously agree

12   about it.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           New?       New?

14               MR. BENZA:       Those instructions are given and

15   every reference to the jury is in a collective you.                   And

16   there -- that instruction tells the jury that they must

17   -- a reasonable understanding of that instruction is

18   that the jury would understand that they had to

19   unanimously agreed as to the existence of the mitigating

20   factors.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that in your brief, too?

22   I just don't remember it from your brief.

23               MR. BENZA:       I believe it is, Your Honor, I

24   don't at the -- the page cite to it.                   It is at petition

25   appendix page 326.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, doesn't every

 2   court tell them it's their duty to decide disputed

 3   questions of fact?

 4                 MR. BENZA:       That is correct.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And you think that

 6   includes within it the idea that they -- they cannot

 7   consider a mitigating circumstance unless they all 12

 8   agree on it?

 9                 MR. BENZA:       Yes, that then would violate

10   Mills.     That's the error in this instruction.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay, I just -

12                 MR. BENZA:       That's the question in Mills.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I want to make sure

14   I have got your Mills argument.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It is that the

16   sentence that says "it's your duty to did decide all

17   disputed questions of fact is the same as saying they

18   are instructed that they cannot consider a mitigating

19   circumstance unless they are unanimous?

20                 MR. BENZA:       When considered in totality,

21   yes.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.   Thank you,

23   counsel.

24                 Mr. Cordray, you have ten minutes remaining.

25               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD CORDRAY

 1                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 2              MR. CORDRAY:        Thank you, Your Honor.

 3              On the Mills instruction, it -- it's clear,

 4   Mills was not decided at the time the Ohio Supreme Court

 5   rendered its decision.      It was decided before this Court

 6   denied direct review.

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is that an argument

 8   you made before this Court?

 9              MR. CORDRAY:        I beg your pardon.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is this an argument

11   that you've made before this Court in your brief, that

12   we shouldn't consider whether Mills is the controlling

13   standard because Mills came after?

14              MR. CORDRAY:        No.      Nor am I making it now.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.

16              MR. CORDRAY:        I am simply summarizing a

17   response to Justice Sotomayor's question.                But this

18   Court -- on -- on Teague, in Beard v Banks determined

19   that Mills itself expressed a new rule and expressed

20   some doubt as to whether that rule itself was even clear

21   until McKoy v. North Carolina was decided in 1990, which

22   was to finality in this case.           But the -- the jury

23   instruction issue is entirely knocked out by the fact

24   that this case is an extension of Mills that goes beyond

25   anything this Court has ever held in the jury


                                     52

 1   instruction context.       It is an extension of Mills that

 2   has been rejected by the majority of circuits to

 3   consider it, even today 20 years later, and it couldn't

 4   possibly be understood to be clearly established law.

 5              The reference to page 326a and the jury

 6   instructions, that's quite distinct from the passage

 7   where the jury was told specifically they have to be

 8   unanimous only on the ultimate question, whether

 9   aggravators outweigh mitigators.                 This was very

10   different from the jury form in Mills which was itself

11   was somewhat cryptic and -- and later was explained

12   further in McKoy.

13              If I could return then to the

14   ineffectiveness issues.         Counsel argued that there was

15   deficiency on a couple of different grounds.                First of

16   all, that -- that defense counsel should have argued

17   about family background and performance in prison.                The

18   family background was uncontested; it was humdrum; there

19   was nothing special there.            Performance in prison was an

20   issue that was raised at trial.                The prosecutor read to

21   Spisak on the stand a letter he had written from prison.

22   I am not going to foul the record with his specific

23   verbiage but it was after a card game in which he had

24   gotten into a fight with inmates and said he would like

25   to kill them.   When that was read to Spisak on the stand


                                        53
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   his response was to say "Heil, Hitler" and give the Nazi

 2   salute to the jury.

 3              So the notion that we should be referring

 4   back to his performance in prison and that somehow would

 5   have helped mitigate the jury's consideration of the

 6   death sentence to me is -- is fanciful.

 7              In terms of the argument that defense

 8   counsel here argued, nonstatutory aggravators, that is a

 9   characterization that I don't think is accurate and it's

10   not accurate as a matter of Ohio law.                 In our reply

11   brief we cited State v. Hancock which indicates that the

12   nature and circumstances of crimes are always relevant

13   in determining whether the aggravators outweigh the

14   mitigators, and in fact the main aggravator here was

15   that Mr. Spisak engaged in a course of conduct that

16   involved the purposeful killing of more than one person

17   -- two or more persons, or the attempt to kill two or

18   more persons which he had done here and which certainly

19   was going to be and was, in fact, in fact if you read

20   the prosecutor's closing, the heart and soul of the

21   prosecutor's closing.

22              As to whether the mental health presentation

23   was, quote, "not strong enough," obviously it wasn't

24   strong enough in the end to sway the jury.                 But you

25   cannot judge by hindsight, this Court has said it again

 1   and again, counsel's performance.                 The court said that

 2   in Strickland v. Washington itself, emphasized that

 3   tremendously in rejecting the deficiency claim in that

 4   case.   And then in Yarborough as applied to closing

 5   arguments, the Court said very specifically we have to

 6   be doubly deferential to -- to strategic decisions made

 7   at closing, even if we might had made them differently

 8   or might have executed them somewhat differently, and

 9   particularly through the AEDPA lens.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What -- what is your

11   answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to

12   defer when they don't even say anything?

13               MR. CORDRAY:         I think that we have to read

14   the statute.    The statute -- the AEDPA statute, 2254

15   says we defer to what?        We defer to an adjudication by

16   the State court on the merits.              There is no suggestion

17   here that this adjudication was on some procedural

18   grounds or default grounds.            It was a merits

19   adjudication.    It wasn't a lengthy, eloquent, you know,

20   long explained adjudication, but it was an adjudication

21   on the merits and deference should be given.

22               The alternative is that if they don't

23   explain which prong they are using that you defer to

24   nothing, and that seems to be not consistent with what

25   Congress clearly intended under AEDPA, nor is it


                                       55
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   consistent with the language of the statute.

 2                 The claim was made that the deference only

 3   applies when the State court, quote, "has done its job."

 4   Under the statute the job is to adjudicate a claim on

 5   the merits, not to provide a lengthy discourse in doing

 6   so.   As to the prejudice point which I think is finally

 7   decisive and was the basis on which this Court GVR'd

 8   in -- in Landrigan, this is Landrigan -

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Can we just go back to

10   that one point for a minute.

11                 MR. CORDRAY:       Yes, sir.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would your deference be

13   exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or

14   so, they simply entered a one-line order saying,

15   "Affirmed"?

16                 MR. CORDRAY:       I believe, Your Honor, under

17   the statute, it would be the same, although here they

18   did more than that -- you know, they cited Strickland.

19   We have to assume they applied Strickland.

20                 And, as for the prejudice claim, we have

21   findings from the Ohio Supreme Court that, I think, bear

22   on the prejudice claim.        In its decision -- this is

23   309(a) through 311(a) of the appendix -

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me -- let me go back

25   to the question.

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. CORDRAY:       Yes, sir.

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do you think they are

 3   entitled to more deference because they did cite

 4   Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?

 5               MR. CORDRAY:       I think that the Ohio Supreme

 6   Court is entitled to deference because it adjudicated a

 7   claim on the merits, so -

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:           So it would be exactly the

 9   same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.

10               MR. CORDRAY:       I would agree with that.

11   However, if the Court was inclined to make gradation -

12   this is a gradation beyond simply an unexplained order.

13   Yes.

14               As to prejudice, the Ohio Supreme Court at

15   309(a) through 311(a) itself independently reweighed the

16   aggravating factors against the mitigating factors,

17   which is something the Ohio Supreme Court does under

18   Ohio law.

19               There had been some issues of merger of some

20   of the aggravating circumstances.               On direct appeal,

21   they had dealt with those issues, and then they went

22   back and reweighed, and they found that, on this record,

23   the aggravating factors heavily -- lie heavily and

24   beyond a reasonable doubt to outweigh the mitigating

25   factors.


                                     57

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              That is, in fact, the same kind of

 2   determination that the Court would make in trying to

 3   determine if there was prejudice here.

 4              As to the implementation of the strategy

 5   here, it is coherent in understanding what counsel was

 6   trying to do.   Was it a bit rambling?                 Perhaps.

 7              You know, were there -- were there side

 8   issues that he tried to take up, which he thought went

 9   to his credibility with the jury and the credibility of

10   the mental illness defense with the jury?                 Perhaps.

11              But the strategy was twofold.                  It was to

12   reference the crimes, make it clear to the jury he

13   understood the nature -- the horrific nature of the

14   crimes, as he thought the jury understood it, and then

15   pivot to the mental illness -- mental disease or defect

16   prong as the mitigator that the -- that the jury should

17   apply in not giving the death penalty in this case.

18              I think the strategy here was coherent.                    I'm

19   not sure what else defense counsel could have done in

20   this case, where his client had both committed these

21   horrific crimes, undisputed, and then had reveled in

22   them, in his flamboyant testimony from the stand.

23              In the context of that and given the doubly

24   deferential lens this Court has laid out in Yarborough,

25   I think that there is neither deficiency, nor could

 3   Honor, thank you for your time.
