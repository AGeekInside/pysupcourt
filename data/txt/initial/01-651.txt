 7                       ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID


 8                          ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 9              MS. REID:            Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


10   the Court:


11              The alienage diversity statute provides that the


12   Federal courts have original jurisdiction in civil actions


13   between citizens of different States and citizens who are


14   subjects of a foreign State where the matter in


15   controversy exceeds $75,000.                   The question presented today


16   is whether respondent, Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure


17   Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the


18   British Virgin Islands, qualifies as a subject of the 


19   United Kingdom within the meaning of that statute. 


20   Petitioner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, submits it clearly does.


21              It is well-settled that the term, citizens and


22   subjects, applies to corporations and not just natural


23   persons.   It is also not controversial that a subject is


24   one who owes allegiance to and is under the protection of


25   a foreign State.


                                                    3

 1                QUESTION:         Is this a question of Federal law?


 2                MS. REID:         In terms of looking to the matter of


 3   the subject?


 4                QUESTION:         In determining who is a citizen or


 5   subject of a foreign State, or whether a corporation in


 6   this instance is a citizen or subject?                          Is that a Federal


 7   law question?


 8                MS. REID:         Yes, Your Honor, we would submit it


 9   is in the first instance, but in saying that we must then


10   look at the nature of the relationship and look at the


11   foreign State which is asserting the sovereignty, and


12   certainly that is a matter that we should consider


13   carefully.     In this case, the United Kingdom has clearly


14   expressed its sovereignty over respondent and over the


15   other residents and corporations of its overseas


16   territories.


17                QUESTION:         When you say the United Kingdom has


18   expressed its sovereignty, Ms. Reid, do you mean that


19   you're looking at their statutes, or that their diplomatic


20   representatives have made a representation?


21                MS. REID:         Both, both the fact that they have


22   intervened as an amicus in this and in other cases, but


23   also, particularly in the case of respondent, if one looks


24   at the BVI constitution enacted in 1976, it is enacted as


25   a result of the act of parliament and the order of


                                                   4

 1   parliament, and it reserves expressly all power to the


 2   Crown ultimately, and it is only from the Crown that the


 3   law is then delegated to the elected legislative council. 


 4   Each member of whom must swear allegiance to the Crown and


 5   to the Queen.


 6             The United Kingdom reserves the right to review,


 7   approve, and ultimately disapprove any statute that is


 8   enacted in the British Virgin Islands, which is a right


 9   that they do exercise.           In this case, therefore, the


10   enabling or enacting statute which, under which respondent


11   is incorporated, is a direct result of the authority


12   granted from the Crown, so I would argue it is not just a


13   matter of the diplomatic relationship and the fact that


14   the United Kingdom is the external face for the British


15   Virgin Islands in terms of matters of defense and


16   international relations, but also the fact that all law is


17   derived ultimately from the Crown.


18             QUESTION:         Ms. Reid, every corporation must be


19   formed under the law of some sovereign, and if that's


20   right, a corporation just can't generate itself.


21             Is there any corporation that is formed under


22   the law of some sovereign other than the United States not


23   included within 1332, or is this just a very simple case


24   where every foreign corporation of course is organized


25   under the law of some State, and therefore would qualify.

 1   Does your case involve anything more than that?


 2             MS. REID:         I would say, Your Honor, in 99


 3   percent of the cases, that you're right.                        I suppose it is


 4   conceivable that you would have corporations organized by


 5   someone who declares they are sovereign of some island


 6   somewhere, but no one recognizes them as a sovereign, and


 7   the United States would say, we know nothing of this


 8   person, and know they can't be --


 9             QUESTION:         Then the United States would also say


10   that that's not a corporation.


11             MS. REID:         Right, exactly.


12             QUESTION:         So I think you could say in 100


13   percent of the cases if we acknowledge it as a


14   corporation, it will have been formed under the law of


15   some State.


16             MS. REID:         I would agree, Your Honor.


17             QUESTION:         And I suppose even as to natural


18   persons in this sort of eccentric island in the real


19   world, if we did not recognize their claim to individual


20   sovereignty or nationality, in the real world I assume


21   they would be subject to some other national sovereign and


22   they'd by that virtue, by virtue of that be swept up under


23   the term, citizen or subject, wouldn't they?


24             MS. REID:         I would agree.


25             QUESTION:         Yes.

 1                QUESTION:         Let's assume -- and I'm not sure that


 2   this is an actual proposition of international law, that a


 3   subject of a sovereign has a special duty to obey the laws


 4   of that sovereign.           A United States citizen in China has a


 5   special obligation to obey the laws of the United States


 6   that a British subject does not.                     Does this corporation


 7   have a special obligation to obey the laws of Great


 8   Britain in any greater degree than it has the obligation


 9   to obey the laws of any other sovereign to whom it might


10   become --


11                MS. REID:         Yes, Your Honor.


12                QUESTION:         -- subject?


13                MS. REID:         An analogy, though, not completely


14   perfect, but it -- you know, JPMorgan Chase is a


15   corporation organized under the laws of the State of New


16   York.   It obviously has to follow the laws of the State of


17   New York, but it also has obligations that it has to


18   follow under our Federal law.


19                QUESTION:         Yes.


20                MS. REID:         Similarly, a corporation set up under


21   the laws of applicable overseas territories in the first


22   in stance, of course, must follow the laws of their


23   legislative district, but they must also abide by agreed-


24   upon laws and conventions of the United Kingdom, and that


25   is specifically an issue in the Caribbean, where there are


                                                   7

 2   through the relationship, constitutional relationship


 3   between the United Kingdom --


 4             QUESTION:         Where can we document the proposition


 5   that you've just stated?            What do I look to? 


 6             MS. REID:         To a certain extent, the treaty,


 7   that -- for example the Narcotics Enforcement Treaty. 


 8   There are also the United Kingdom -- the one I'm thinking


 9   of is their recent overruling on the homosexuality, which


10   we cited only to a newspaper article in our brief, will


11   demonstrate that.


12             The best sites are the web sites for the BVI and


13   for the United Kingdom, which detail the relationship


14   between these two entities, also the white paper we cited


15   to Your Honor written in, I believe, 1999, goes into great


16   detail about the relationships between the overseas


17   territories and the United Kingdom, what the authority and


18   sovereignty the United Kingdom has --


19             QUESTION:         No more established authority like


20   Blackstone, or --


21             MS. REID:         Not that we have cited to Your Honor,


22   though in many ways there are parliamentary debates that


23   you can access concerning -- which are referenced in the


24   white papers -- concerning the relationships between the


25   overseas territories and the Queen, which were quite

 2   in terms of virtual representation and --


 3               QUESTION:           If we were dealing with a private


 4   individual rather than a corporation, do you think there


 5   could be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this


 6   statute?


 7               MS. REID:           In very, very rare instances, and


 8   those instances are where the individual had either


 9   renounced their citizenship, which has on occasion


10   occurred, or where they have been, you know, exiled, and


11   have not yet acquired citizenship somewhere else, and we


12   would submit that the cases cited by the Matimak Court


13   deal with those kinds of statelessness.


14               QUESTION:           Suppose that kind of person that


15   Justice O'Connor and you just discussed, a true stateless


16   person, is temporarily in a port of Australia, San


17   Francisco, or Monterey, Mexico, can it be said


18   consistently with the statute here in question that they


19   are at least temporarily subject to the laws of Australia


20   while they are there, because they're stateless and they


21   have no other higher obligation, so they're then


22   subject --


23               MS. REID:           No.     I would submit that what subject


24   to you must mean is that you have an allegiance to a


25   sovereign, and the sovereign in turn has an obligation to


                                                    9

 2             QUESTION:         It's not subject to.                    The phrase is


 3   subject of, isn't it?


 4             MS. REID:         Yes, of a --


 5             QUESTION:         Everybody living in a country is


 6   subject to the laws of that country, and presumably to the


 7   Government of that country, but they are not necessarily a


 8   subject of that country.


 9             MS. REID:         That is true, Your Honor.


10             QUESTION:         So there can be stateless persons who


11   are not within the clause.


12             MS. REID:         Yes.


13             QUESTION:         And the reason you take that


14   position, I take it, is that the impetus for the


15   constitutional grant was in effect to keep countries from


16   getting mad, rather than for purposes of extending


17   jurisdiction as such to everyone who one might want to sue


18   in a Federal court.


19             MS. REID:         Right.        I mean, we have argued that


20   there were two impetuses.             One is the prevention of


21   foreign entanglements by providing a neutral Federal


22   forum, and the other was the promotion of commerce.


23             QUESTION:         I must say, I didn't understand what


24   you mean by foreign entanglements.                    Are you talking about


25   the foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us

 2                MS. REID:         The --


 3                QUESTION:         I mean, like alliances with France,


 4   or things like that?             What --


 5                MS. REID:         No.     The foreign entanglements, when


 6   one looks back at the Framers' discussion, seem to


 7   envision that if the British debt could not be collected


 8   we might find ourselves back in another war.


 9                QUESTION:         We don't want to make them mad.


10                MS. REID:         We didn't want to make them mad.


11                QUESTION:         Okay.


12                MS. REID:         That, I think, was the entanglement


13   that they were worried about.


14                QUESTION:         It's a strange term for it, then.


15                MS. REID:         And just briefly on the issue of the


16   promotion of commerce, I wanted to make the point that


17   JPMorgan Chase Bank and the financial market, you know,


18   considered the Matimak decisions as ones who have


19   potentially very deleterious effects on international


20   commerce.


21                QUESTION:         Well, why?           Aren't New York courts --


22   this is not a question of saying for our corporation you


23   can't enter U.S. court.               They can enter a New York State


24   court, and those courts are pretty savvy about commercial


25   matters, are they not?

 1             MS. REID:         Absolutely, and I practice before


 2   them frequently, but the perception on the part of


 3   foreign -- foreigners is that the Federal system is one in


 4   which procedures are uniform across the country, and a --


 5   with predictability, perhaps, that is more a matter of


 6   perception than of reality.


 7             QUESTION:         I know Alabamans who are afraid of


 8   New York courts.


 9             (Laughter.)


10             MS. REID:         And vice versa.


11             QUESTION:         But it is a little different from


12   what it was in the days of the post revolution, when the


13   British creditor said State courts are simply going to let


14   them collect on their debts.


15             MS. REID:         That's true.            In this particular


16   case, the reason in large part that it was decided to go


17   into Federal courts is simply because we wanted to get as


18   speed a resolution as possible, and the State court system


19   has interlocutory appeals, which is just the way the


20   system works, and -- but it does often lead to additional


21   delay and we had noteholders who were insistent that we


22   try and get our collateral back as soon as possible. 


23             QUESTION:         Anyway, you -- I think no one has


24   suggested a dynamic interpretation of 1332, so that if the


25   original rationale is not as strong today as it was then,


                                               12

 1   that somehow the meaning of 1332 would change.


 2             MS. REID:         No.     I think it's -- the -- clearly


 3   the United Kingdom at this point is, I guess one could say


 4   at best, annoyed by this continuing refusal to recognize


 5   their sovereignty over these types of entities, and the


 6   fact is that you know, they have submitted an amicus brief


 7   here, several other amicus briefs, two diplomatic notes,


 8   so that the fear of the Framers of having an entanglement


 9   of some sort with an ally is still, I think, valid today.


10             QUESTION:         No other circuit has followed the


11   Second Circuit, have they?


12             MS. REID:         No.     The Third Circuit has split


13   explicitly.   The Fourth and the Seventh Circuit have also


14   disagreed, though not -- they didn't discuss Matimak, and


15   one of them was earlier than Matimak, but no, there is no


16   other circuit that has followed this rule.


17             If the --


18             QUESTION:         You wish to reserve the rest of your


19   time?


20             MS. REID:         Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.


21             QUESTION:         Thank you, Ms. Reid.

 1                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


 2        ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


 3                         SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


 4              MR. MINEAR:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


 5   may it please the Court:


 6              The United States submits that corporations


 7   organized under the United Kingdom overseas territories


 8   are citizens or subjects of a foreign State for purposes


 9   of alienage diversity jurisdiction.                      We reach that


10   conclusion based on the plain language of 1332.                              Section


11   1332's operative term, subject, describes a personal


12   entity that is amenable to foreign authority in the sense


13   that it owes allegiance to that foreign State and is


14   entitled to the protection of that foreign State.                                 That


15   term quite clearly embraces a corporation created by a


16   foreign State.      This Court recognized that principle in


17   Steamship Company v. Tugman 120 years ago.


18              The crucial issue in this case is whether the


19   United Kingdom exercises sufficient sovereign authority


20   over the British Virgin Islands such that citizens and


21   corporations can be said to be subject to the United


22   Kingdom's rules, and we think the answer to that is


23   clearly yes.     The United States expressly recognizes the


24   United Kingdom's sovereignty over the British Virgin


25   Islands.   We do so through treaties such as the Consulate


                                                14

                                      Alderson Reporting Company
                1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   Convention that we have with the United Kingdom.                                    We also


 2   recognize it through our diplomatic relations with the


 3   United Kingdom.         Now, we fully support the United


 4   Kingdom's claim here of sovereignty over the British


 5   Virgin Islands.


 6                In addition, if the Court needs to look further,


 7   and we think it does not, it's clear from the British


 8   Virgin Islands' constitution that the United Kingdom has


 9   retained its sovereignty over the British Virgin Islands. 


10   That constitution expressly states that the United Kingdom


11   reserves full power to exercise and pass laws for the good


12   government, order, and peace of the British Virgin


13   Islands.


14                We think the language of section 1332


15   conclusively resolves this case, but if the Court needs to


16   look further still, then we think the policies that


17   underlie section 1332 further buttress the conclusion that


18   we reach.


19                QUESTION:         Mr. Minear, what if the -- say, the


20   U.K. takes one position and makes a representation, but


21   the State Department, our State Department disagrees.


22                MR. MINEAR:          The --


23                (Slide.)


24                QUESTION:         Then what sort of an action should


25   our courts take?


                                                  15

 1             MR. MINEAR:          We think that you should defer on


 2   the United States views on these matters.                         As far as


 3   disagreements between the United Kingdom and the United


 4   States, that's a matter for the State Department to deal


 5   with, but this Court's own decisions, cases such as Jones


 6   v. The United States, which is at 137 U.S. 202, explicitly


 7   state that questions of sovereignty are political


 8   questions that are entrusted to the political branches.


 9             QUESTION:         Well then, if you were to submit the


10   views of the State Department in a case like that, no


11   matter what else there is in the record, we should accept


12   the views of the State Department?


13             MR. MINEAR:          Your cases suggest that that is the


14   result that would follow.


15             QUESTION:         Yes, but do you have a position --


16             MR. MINEAR:          Yes, we do.            To answer pointedly,


17   yes, we do believe that you should defer to the United


18   States views, because oftentimes on the question -- let me


19   distinguish here that the question of subject is, of


20   course, the meaning of that term is a legal question that


21   this Court would interpret according to its normal


22   practices, but the question of whether a foreign entity is


23   a foreign State is a question that is properly entrusted


24   to the political branches.


25             We believe that the Second Circuit's decision


                                               16

                                     Alderson Reporting Company
               1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   stands alone here because it is quite plainly wrong.                             The


 2   Third Circuit has expressly rejected it, and the Fourth


 3   Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have not followed it. 


 4   Under these circumstances, we think it is appropriate for


 5   the Court to reverse the decision below and remand the


 6   case for further proceedings.


 7             QUESTION:         Can you comment on the stateless


 8   person problem, not a legal person?


 9             MR. MINEAR:          But an individual.                 Yes, we can


10   conceive that there can be such a thing as a stateless


11   person, and we cannot believe that section 1332 by its


12   plain language would reach a person who is not a citizen


13   or a subject of a foreign State.                  Pure alienage is not


14   sufficient.   Nevertheless, the class of stateless persons


15   is vanishingly small, and as was pointed out in the


16   earlier discussion, the idea of a stateless corporation is


17   an oxymoron, as Judge Altimari had stated.


18             QUESTION:         But there are some U.S. citizens who


19   don't have access to the Federal court because they're not


20   a citizen of any State.            Let's take a U.S. citizen who is


21   residing in Switzerland.


22             MR. MINEAR:          That is correct.               That is correct,


23   and again, we think the courts have consistently answered


24   these questions by adherence to the plain language of the


25   jurisdictional provisions.              For instance, for many years,


                                               17

               1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   until Congress dealt with the issue, citizens of the


 2   District of Columbia were not entitled to ordinary


 3   diversity jurisdiction, but these are matters that we


 4   think are best resolved by looking closely at the language


 5   that Congress has provided in the jurisdictional


 6   provisions.


 7              If there are no further questions, thank you.


 8              QUESTION:         Thank you, Mr. Minear.


 9              Mr. Albert, we'll hear from you.


10                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG J. ALBERT


11                       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


12              MR. ALBERT:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


13   please the Court:


14              There are two statutes at issue here, both of


15   which have plain language.               Section 1332 of title 28 says


16   that diversity jurisdiction extends only to citizens or


17   citizens and subjects, and it does not extend to all


18   aliens.   The British Nationality Act of 1981 defines those


19   persons whom the United Kingdom of Great Britain and


20   Northern Ireland views as its citizens or subjects, and


21   natural persons who are living within the British


22   Dependent Territories do not fall within the category of


23   being British Citizens.


24              There is a special class, a subclass that is


25   delegated to those people.               They are British Dependent


                                                18

 1   Territory citizens, or British Overseas Territories


 2   citizens, and this is an important distinction, because


 3   they do not have the full measure of rights that any


 4   English citizen would have.


 5               QUESTION:         You're now relying on English law, I


 6   take it.


 7               MR. ALBERT:          I'm referring to English law, yes.


 8               QUESTION:         Yes.      I think that creates some


 9   difficulty for United States courts, particularly when the


10   U.K. is making representations here as to one point, then


11   you tell us we have to read English law, which we're much


12   less familiar with, of course, than American law.


13               MR. ALBERT:          Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.                     Under Rule


14   44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court can


15   look to any source for finding where --


16               QUESTION:         I realize that.              It's not that we're


17   somehow disqualified from it, but it makes it a much more


18   difficult inquiry.


19               MR. ALBERT:          It would be a much more difficult


20   inquiry had the United Kingdom actually cited to any


21   statute or any case ever decided in any English court


22   anywhere on the subject, but it is --


23               QUESTION:         Well, Mr. Albert, even if the British


24   Nationality can be read as saying that corporations formed


25   in the British Virgin Islands are not citizens, it doesn't


                                                 19

 1   say they're not subjects of the United Kingdom, does it?


 2             MR. ALBERT:          Well, actually, the British


 3   Nationality Act carves out classes of citizens, and


 4   classes of subjects, and persons who are neither citizens


 5   nor subjects, so in fact it --


 6             QUESTION:         I just didn't find anything that


 7   indicated to me that a corporation formed in the British


 8   Virgin Island was not a subject of the U.K., and we are


 9   dealing here with a brief filed by the U.K. that says they


10   are subjects, so what do we --


11             MR. ALBERT:          Well, I think that the question


12   here is whether the deference should be unyielding to a


13   litigation and advocacy position which the British


14   Government puts forth in its briefs versus the substantive


15   basis for that position which one would find in a statute.


16             QUESTION:         Just looking at it from an American,


17   U.S. perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects,


18   and the fact that it is a corporation formed in the


19   British Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a


20   subject of a foreign nation under our own statute.


21             MR. ALBERT:          Respectfully, Justice O'Connor, I


22   think that the conclusion ought to be different, because


23   there is nothing with -- the first step in the inquiry is,


24   what would 1332(a)(2) have to say about corporations, and


25   we know that 1332(a)(2) is a reference to citizens or


                                               20

 1   subjects which is consistently -- which before the Letson


 2   fiction was adopted had resulted in severe conflict over


 3   whether there was jurisdiction for corporations at all.


 4               What this Court did in Letson was adopted the


 5   fiction not that the corporations were citizens or


 6   subjects, but that the corporations would be deemed to be


 7   citizens or subjects by virtue of the imputed citizenship


 8   of its shareholders and, applying the same principle here,


 9   you would impute the citizenship of the -- the citizenship


10   of natural persons resident within the British Virgin


11   Islands to a British Virgin Islands --


12               QUESTION:         That's going back to a law that has


13   long since become obsolete.                 A corporation within the


14   United States is a citizen of the State in which it's


15   incorporated and where it has its principal place of


16   business.    We don't look to the citizenship of the


17   shareholders any more.             Why should there be such a


18   tremendous disparity between our modern view of what a


19   U.S. corporation is and the rest of the world when we


20   don't even really think of the corporation as an entity in


21   itself but say it's stuck by what its shareholder


22   citizenship is.


23               MR. ALBERT:          Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,


24   1332(c) does not say that corporations are citizens of


25   their States.      It says that for purposes of diversity they


                                                 21

 1   are deemed to be citizens of these States.                          It is a


 2   counting rule, not a citizenship rule, and hence, the


 3   Letson fiction still obtains.                  All that Congress did when


 4   it adopted the 1332(c) language was to restrict the scope


 5   of diversity jurisdiction by providing a second political


 6   jurisdiction, principal place of business, which would


 7   further limit the number of diversity cases which were


 8   appearing in Federal courts.


 9             This Court has never held that corporations were


10   political citizens or political subjects.                         Only 1332(c)


11   deems them to be so, and taking that a step further, it is


12   Congress' choice, because Congress' language in 1332(a)(2)


13   is that only citizens or subjects -- it does not use the


14   word aliens or anything broader -- are subject to


15   diversity jurisdiction.


16             QUESTION:         Are you saying those words cover only


17   human individuals and not corporations?


18             MR. ALBERT:          For 1332(a)(2), humans, then


19   applying the 1332(c) presumption, that would bring


20   corporations within the scope of diversity jurisdiction.


21             QUESTION:         Well, 1332(a) does use the term,


22   aliens at the very end.


23             MR. ALBERT:          Yes, there is a reference to it,


24   but not in the provision of 1332(a)(2) on the extension of


25   that dispute between citizens of a State and citizens or


                                               22

 1   subjects of a foreign State, and in fact, Mr. Chief


 2   Justice, Congress in fact had used the word, aliens, the


 3   broader word, in the original enactment, in the Judiciary


 4   Act of 1789, but Congress abandoned that language when it


 5   revised the statute in 1875.


 6             QUESTION:         Is a Spanish corporation -- as I


 7   say -- is that -- does that come within 1332 jurisdiction,


 8   a corporation formed in Scotland?


 9             MR. ALBERT:          In Scotland, yes, because a --


10   because the Scottish people, the English and Welsh people,


11   and the people of Northern Ireland all are citizens of the


12   Metropolitan United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great


13   Britain and Northern Ireland.


14             QUESTION:         Well, my problem is if -- take


15   some -- the British Virgin Islands, a place that's still


16   held in something like colonial status, that you say that


17   Scotland, which has a great deal more independence,


18   belongs to the U.K. in the sense that it is a subject of


19   the U.K., but the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman


20   Islands, that have less independence, are not subjects? 


21   That may be something a lawyer could understand, but I


22   don't think it makes much sense, does it?


23             MR. ALBERT:          I think that the distinction is, no


24   one is disputing here that the British Virgin Islands is


25   subordinate to the United Kingdom, no one is disputing


                                               23

 1   that its people ultimately are answerable to the authority


 2   of the United Kingdom, but that simply goes --


 3                QUESTION:         Does it make them subject --


 4   subjects?


 5                MR. ALBERT:          Subject to, not subject of, and


 6   that is why the British Nationality Act is so important


 7   here.


 8                QUESTION:         If it's so important, I guess then


 9   maybe corporations incorporated in Scotland are not


10   citizens and subjects either, because it doesn't say


11   anything about corporations, does it?


12                MR. ALBERT:          No, Justice Breyer.


13                QUESTION:         Wouldn't people then be surprised if


14   it doesn't say anything, if we said that Scottish


15   corporations weren't citizens, or -- in fact, wouldn't the


16   people who live in these islands be a little surprised if


17   the Supreme Court were to say, you're not nationals?                                How


18   does it work?       This is not an act that refers to


19   corporations.


20                MR. ALBERT:          The proper allegation in a case


21   like this would be that a corporation is incorporated


22   under the laws of Scotland and is therefore a citizen or a


23   subject of the United Kingdom.


24                QUESTION:         And the reason that they are but


25   these people aren't is?

 1             MR. ALBERT:          Is because England, Wales,


 2   Scotland, and Northern Ireland, along with the Channel


 3   Islands, are the constituent parts of the Metropolitan


 4   United Kingdom.      That is the Government with whom we


 5   maintain a direct relationship, and when we treaty with


 6   them, we -- our treaties are binding as to that nation and


 7   those persons who are within those political subdivisions.


 8             QUESTION:         As of English law, the reason that --


 9   although their law says, I guess, the counselor law, the


10   diplomatic manual,the thing that says you have to swear


11   allegiance if you're in the British foreign -- you know,


12   you're in the British Virgin Islands, all the laws are


13   subject to British authority and so forth, so the reason,


14   in your opinion, despite all those things they list in


15   their brief, that makes it very, very similar, the reason


16   that a corporation incorporated in Wales is a citizen of


17   the United Kingdom or subject of the United Kingdom but


18   these are not, because it's the British Virgin Islands,


19   is?


20             MR. ALBERT:          Because when parliament enacts a


21   law of general applicability within the United Kingdom,


22   its applicability is to those four jurisdictions that I've


23   mentioned, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,


24   along with in some instances the Channel Islands, but it


25   does not, of its force, extend to the British Overseas


                                               25

 1   Territories, the British dependent -- what's now known as


 2   the British Overseas Territories.                       They are regulated


 3   separately.


 4              When we enter into a treaty with the United


 5   Kingdom on any subject whatsoever, unless our treaty


 6   specifically extends to those territories, what happens in


 7   those territories is unaffected by our treaty, so it is


 8   not a two-way street of reciprocal obligations within the


 9   United Kingdom.          All of their powers of these


10   jurisdictions are derived from the United Kingdom, but


11   they don't have any reciprocal rights, and that is


12   especially true of the natural people who live within


13   these territories.


14              The natural people who live within these


15   territories have no right of abode within the -- have no


16   right of abode within the Metropolitan United Kingdom.                               If


17   you call them citizens or subjects, and in fact the United


18   Kingdom uses both terms now, it no longer adheres to the


19   old concept of subjects, they cannot travel to the United


20   Kingdom --


21              QUESTION:            Are they stateless people?


22              MR. ALBERT:             They are not stateless people at


23   all.   They do have a State.                  Their State, their


24   overarching State is the United Kingdom, which extends to


25   them defense protection.                The United Kingdom protects them


                                                   26

 2   sense they a State.


 3                QUESTION:         They are British -- their State is


 4   the U.K.?


 5                MR. ALBERT:          They are just -- they are very


 6   similar to what our territorial residents would have been


 7   before we extended citizenship.


 8                QUESTION:         They are subject of and to the United


 9   States, I assume, the residents in the U.S. Territories.


10                MR. ALBERT:          Residents of U.S. Territories are


11   now citizens by virtue of an amendment to the Immigration


12   and --


13                QUESTION:         What were they before they were


14   citizens?


15                MR. ALBERT:          They were nationals and natives. 


16   They had no status.            They were very much --


17                QUESTION:         They were not stateless, were they?


18                MR. ALBERT:          No, they were not.


19                QUESTION:         And so why isn't a corporation


20   organized in the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman


21   Islands -- why is that stateless?                      There's only one State


22   it can belong to, because these are not independent


23   sovereigns.      The BVI is not an independent sovereign. 


24   What State does that -- you tell me that the individual


25   would belong to the U.K.               What does a corporation belong

 1   to?


 2             MR. ALBERT:          I do not advocate the position that


 3   the Matimak -- the Matimak Court adopted that these


 4   corporations were stateless.               I do not think that that is


 5   essential to the determination below, and I think that it


 6   was a poor choice of words.               There is a State involved. 


 7   The United Kingdom granted to the British Virgin Islands


 8   the authority to adopt a Companies Act, just as United


 9   States territories have authority under statute of


10   Congress to adopt their own incorporation laws.                             That does


11   not mean that the corporations that are incorporated


12   within the British Virgin Islands are subjects of, rather


13   than subject to --


14             QUESTION:         They belong to some State, and either


15   they belong to the U.K., or they belong to something that


16   isn't a sovereign, or they're stateless.                        It's got to be


17   one of those three, so which is it?


18             MR. ALBERT:          They belong to the United Kingdom,


19   but that does not answer the statutory question at issue


20   here, because even if they belong to a kingdom, even if


21   they belong to the United Kingdom, that does not make the


22   citizens or subjects of the kingdom.                     You can be an alien


23   and subject -- an alien to the United States, subject to


24   the kingdom, yet not be a citizen or subject of the United


25   Kingdom, and that was Congress' choice to make.

 2             QUESTION:         Could I ask, the word subject in the


 3   statute just tracks the word subject in the Constitution,


 4   and I -- wasn't the status of the colonists before our


 5   Revolution precisely the same as the status of the British


 6   Virgin Islands?


 7             MR. ALBERT:          Justice Scalia --


 8             QUESTION:         Which would lead me to the inquiry


 9   whether the -- even the revolutionaries considered


10   themselves subjects of the British Crown.                         If they


11   weren't, I guess they weren't engaging in a revolution


12   really, were they?


13             (Laughter.)


14             MR. ALBERT:          The laughter from the audience in


15   fact focuses the point here, because that was the


16   fundamental shift in the understanding of the colonists


17   and their relationship to the British Government.                                Before


18   the Revolution, the old idea of subjectship was that it


19   was permanent.     One could never abandon one's subjectship. 


20   The political idea during the Revolution was a shift


21   toward the idea of volitional allegiance.


22             That is, that once the Crown abdicated parts of


23   its protective authority, then the people no longer were


24   subjects of the Crown, and the legal basis for the legal


25   philosophers during the formation -- in the 1774 to 1776

 1   period was to justify how it was that we could throw off


 2   our bonds to the British Crown, and the way in which they


 3   justified it was to say that the King had abdicated, and


 4   therefore, in the words of the Declaration of


 5   Independence, we were no longer his subjects.                             What were


 6   we?   Well, there was a --


 7              QUESTION:         But we had been.               We had been.


 8              MR. ALBERT:          Oh, we had been.               We had been.


 9              QUESTION:         We occupied the same status in those


10   days as the British --


11              QUESTION:         Why wasn't that status the one that's


12   comparable to the status of citizens in the Virgin Islands


13   here --


14              MR. ALBERT:          Justice --


15              QUESTION:         -- because they're not claiming that


16   they've been abandoned by the Crown here.


17              MR. ALBERT:          Justice Stevens, there are two


18   places in which that abandonment can come about.                                  One is


19   by the people themselves declaring themselves independent,


20   they saying that those bonds have been thrown off.


21              QUESTION:         Of course, that hasn't happened here.


22              MR. ALBERT:          It certainly has not happened here,


23   but there is another way, because when nations adopt the


24   idea of volitional allegiance, the new idea of what a


25   subject is, then the nation itself can change its laws to


                                                30

 2   United Kingdom has changed the status of its persons.                             The


 3   United Kingdom has moved away from that 18th and 16th,


 4   17th century view of what a subject is and moved to our


 5   view of what a subject is, and the British Nationality Act


 6   explains exactly what these people are.


 7              QUESTION:         The British Nationality Act has


 8   nothing to do with corporations.


 9              MR. ALBERT:          But the British Nationality Act


10   does have to do with what the people in the British Virgin


11   Islands are --


12              QUESTION:         And the other thing they --


13              MR. ALBERT:          -- and then applies --


14              QUESTION:         I understand your point there, but --


15   so I'm cutting you off, but they say that in these places


16   the Queen appoints the Governor, the Governor is


17   responsible for internal security, public service, and


18   court administration, but all the laws they pass in these


19   places are subject to review by the Foreign Office, the


20   Commonwealth Office, and then the Queen in Council, which


21   is a group of particular individuals, that the Legislative


22   Council swears its allegiance to the Crown before it takes


23   place, and so they haven't just discarded this place at


24   all.   They've sort of treated it as we might treat a city


25   inside a State, or some other kind of semi-independent

 4   Congress to legislate for its --


 5              QUESTION:         You mean, people in our Territories


 6   like Puerto Rico, let's say, which is a Commonwealth --


 7              MR. ALBERT:          Yes.

11   States.

13   the United States, and they're not subject to its laws. 


14   Which is it?


15              MR. ALBERT:          The position that has been


16   advocated here, and I think that the -- and that has been


17   uniformly advanced by the scholars is that citizenship


18   versus subjectship is simply -- are simply two sides of


19   the same coin determin -- describing what the relationship


20   is of one in either a democracy or a monarchy, and what


21   has happened in the United Kingdom is that as the country


22   has evolved from a strict monarchy to a constitutional


23   monarchy with democratic principles, that the ideas of


24   subjectship have evolved, and the idea of citizenship has


25   been incorporated into their law.                    This --

 2   saying, well, that's what the U.K. law is, and you told us


 3   that what the Companies Act means, when U.K. itself is


 4   telling this Court, you've got it all wrong?                           You're


 5   standing before the Court as an interpreter of U.K. law. 


 6   You're riding the whole -- your whole case on what U.K.


 7   law is, and yet the U.K. tells us, you read it wrong.


 8             MR. ALBERT:          I would have thought that had the


 9   United Kingdom had a statute on which it could rely, or


10   any decision on which it could rely, it would cite them. 


11   The only authority to which it cites in the record at all


12   is in the lodging --


13             QUESTION:         Which -- go ahead.


14             MR. ALBERT:          Is in the lodging at page L31, an


15   excerpt from its diplomatic manual which describes the


16   various categories under the British Nationality Act.


17             The other authority upon which it relies are its


18   diplomatic notes in which it asserts that it views these


19   people as its subjects, but if you look to each citation


20   of that -- those diplomatic notes, they come not in a


21   submission to a court, asking a court to determine what


22   British law is, but in a protest to the State Department


23   after a case has been decided saying, we don't like the


24   decision of this court.


25             Now, I've cited to the -- I've certainly cited

 4                QUESTION:         Is it a fair summary to say that it's


 5   a litigating position and therefore we do not owe it


 6   Chevron deference?


 7                MR. ALBERT:          I think it is a pure advocacy


 8   position, and it does not deserve --


 9                QUESTION:         Are you arguing for what we might


10   call a variable definition of subject, that VI residents


11   are subjects of Great Britain in some cases and not


12   others?


13                That is to say, you said earlier that the U.K.


14   could make a treaty binding on VI residents, VI citizens,


15   so that you can be subject of Great Britain in some


16   instances and not others.

18                QUESTION:         If I characterize your argument that


19   way, would that be a proper characterization of your


20   argument?


21                MR. ALBERT:          I think that at the second level of


22   Matimak inquiry, when -- that the Court would necessarily


23   have to inquire as to whether or not a person is or is not


24   a subject, and I think that I would be -- I am willing to


25   concede that Britain could change its statute for general


                                                  34

 1   purposes or for limited purposes so as to give to these


 2   territorial citizens the right to proceed in American


 3   courts, and we would defer to that simply by reason of --


 4   simply for reasons for international comity.


 5             QUESTION:         But doesn't that potential indicate


 6   that there is sovereignty, because --


 7             MR. ALBERT:          Once --


 8             QUESTION:         -- isn't sovereignty the capacity to


 9   exercise power and authority?


10             MR. ALBERT:          Sovereignty is that power.                        The


11   question is whether or not they are subjects.


12             I'll give you an example.


13             QUESTION:         They are subjects because of the


14   potential of the exercise of that power.


15             MR. ALBERT:          The land that sits in the middle of


16   London at Leicester Square, the famous Tolk v. Moxie Land,


17   is subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, but


18   that does not make the land a subject, and so the mere


19   fact that the United Kingdom adopts legislation which


20   regulates behavior of its people, both within the


21   metropolitan United Kingdom and within its territories,


22   does not mean that the people within its territories are


23   subjects for purposes of 1332, and I say that especially


24   in light of the fact that as we stand here today the


25   United Kingdom has adopted a new statute which has not yet


                                               35

 1   come into force, because a statutory instrument has not


 2   yet been signed for it, which will render the British


 3   Territories' citizens to be British citizens, giving those


 4   British citizens now the right of abode within the United


 5   Kingdom, and that will happen in the future.                           It probably


 6   will happen soon, maybe in a matter of months, maybe in a


 7   matter of years, but it has not happened yet, and we


 8   determine subject matter jurisdiction as of the time of


 9   the commencement of --


10             QUESTION:         How does that affect a corporation? 


11   You're talking about what will be the status of


12   individuals.


13             MR. ALBERT:          I think that a -- that applying --


14   that the proper way to apply the Letson principle here is


15   that a British Virgin Islands Corporation should never be


16   subject to diversity jurisdiction precisely because the


17   presumption is that its shareholders have opted for


18   British Virgin Islands status rather than opted for


19   British status.


20             QUESTION:         And that would be the case -- it


21   would be -- the Congress would be immobile as well.                              In


22   order to make -- if I follow your argument correctly, in


23   order to make a BVI corporation subject to 1332


24   jurisdiction, there would have to be a constitutional


25   amendment, because the Constitution uses the same words


                                               36

 2                MR. ALBERT:          The Second Circuit did not reach


 3   the constitutional --


 4                QUESTION:         That's what I'm putting to you,


 5   because the statute uses the same term, citizens or


 6   subjects.


 7                MR. ALBERT:          I do not think that there is a


 8   presumption in this Court that the use of the same


 9   language in Article 3 and in title 28 means that the


10   statute has --


11                QUESTION:         Well, tell me what subject means


12   within Article 3 that it doesn't mean within 1332 and why


13   a court should interpret it -- interpret them differently.


14                MR. ALBERT:          Because if you look to the


15   Judiciary Act of 1789, which was adopted nearly


16   contemporaneously, Congress used the broader language,


17   alien, rather than the narrower language, citizen or


18   subject, and --


19                QUESTION:         That's not -- the Constitution says


20   citizen or subject, doesn't it?


21                MR. ALBERT:          That's correct, it does, and --


22                QUESTION:         What does it mean -- what does


23   subject mean within the Constitution, within Article 3, as


24   it reads?


25                MR. ALBERT:          It would be mere speculation on my


                                                  37

 1   part to suggest what it was that they meant, since this


 2   was one of the least debated provisions of the


 3   Constitution.


 4                QUESTION:         But you're urging a certain statutory


 5   interpretation, and you said, well, maybe it has a


 6   different meaning, the word subject, in the Constitution,


 7   so I'm asking you to tell me what could be those different


 8   meanings.


 9                MR. ALBERT:          I think that it is entirely


10   possible that in 1787 Congress -- the Convention intended


11   to extend the grant of authority to the full measure of


12   diversity jurisdiction over cases involving all


13   foreigners, but the reason that I don't think that they


14   focused on the issue was because in 1787 there really were


15   not these cases of -- there were not a lot of cases,


16   probably no cases in which there were people who lacked


17   subjectship yet nevertheless were foreigners.


18                With respect to these trading colonies in


19   particular, the people who were involved in the mercantile


20   trade involving these Caribbean colonies were not people


21   who were resident within those colonies --


22                QUESTION:         What about Canadians?                   Until Canada


23   domesticated its constitution, I suppose for most of the


24   19th Century Canadians were not subjects of the Crown?


25                MR. ALBERT:          I think Canadians were subjects of


                                                  38

 1   the Crown by virtue of the fact that they were in a


 2   settler colony rather than in a plantation, a plantation


 3   colony, and the -- one of the difficulties of the British


 4   law of that entire era is that it never really had a


 5   uni -- it never had a uniform picture of who its persons


 6   were, and what the relationship was between the Crown and


 7   each one of the different types of colonies that were


 8   created, and it was very, very difficult for the -- it was


 9   very difficult for Britain, because Britain had different


10   types of colonies which promoted different types of


11   British interests, and therefore it created different


12   types of Governments within them, and created different


13   statuses with respect to immigration and migration to


14   Europe for those people.


15                QUESTION:         So among the subjects, or -- well,


16   the entities that are under U.K. sovereignty, which are


17   those are subjects and which of them are not?


18                MR. ALBERT:          The ones which are certainly not


19   subjects right now are those which are the British


20   Overseas Territories, which include the British Virgin


21   Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Turks and


22   Caicos --


23                QUESTION:         Which ones are?              Which ones are?


24                MR. ALBERT:          Pardon?


25                QUESTION:         Which ones are?

 5                MR. ALBERT:          Oh, British subjects, sorry. 


 6   British subjects, and --


 7                QUESTION:         How about the Falklands?


 8                MR. ALBERT:          The Falklands -- the Falklands,


 9   those residents are not British citizens.                            They are


10   British Overseas -- Overseas Territories citizens.


11                QUESTION:         How about Leicester Square?


12                (Laughter.)


13                MR. ALBERT:          It has no status whatsoever,


14   because it is property, not a person.

16                QUESTION:         Thank you, Mr. Albert.

18                  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID


19                         ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


20                MS. REID:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


21   this Court:


22                I will try to be brief.                   I would like to


23   separate the inquiry between corporations and then address


24   natural persons.          Corporations are incorporated through


25   the laws of their legislative district.                          The United


                                                  40

 1   Kingdom's brief details quite clearly how the corporations


 2   are incorporated, rather like our States, corporations in


 3   Northern Ireland are incorporated under the laws of


 4   Northern Ireland.         As I understand respondent's argument,


 5   that would make them stateless entities, because they are


 6   not actually incorporated in Scotland, Wales, or the


 7   United Kingdom.        Clearly, that is an absurd result, given


 8   the presence of the British --


 9               QUESTION:         I think his answer was that if


10   they're formed under Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland,


11   they're okay, but if they're formed under BVI, they're


12   not.


13               MS. REID:         Right.        I think he may have


14   inadvertently been in error, because the Northern Ireland


15   corporations are actually incorporated under a different


16   law than those of the ones in England, but the point is


17   the same.    All of these entities incorporate under their


18   own individual quasi State or district law, all subject to


19   the Crown, and they all should be analyzed in the


20   identical way.       They are all subject to and subjects of


21   the United Kingdom.


22               In terms of the natural citizens, I just wanted


23   to point -- the British Nationality Act, of course, has no


24   applications to corporations, and the analysis that


25   somehow we should adopt the old Letson rule is


                                                 41

 1   inapplicable both because it's United Kingdom law, we have


 2   no learning -- I mean, United States law, no learning on


 3   what -- how the United Kingdom would do it, but it seems


 4   sensible to adopt the more modern view, but the 1981


 5   Nationality Act, interestingly, in schedule 5 to section


 6   41, in terms of naturalization and becoming a citizen or a


 7   British Overseas Citizen, or a British, what was then


 8   known as Dependent Territory citizen, you're required to


 9   take the following oath of allegiance:                       I, name, swear by


10   Almighty God that on becoming a British Dependent


11   Territory citizen I will be faithful and bear true


12   allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs


13   and successors, according to law.


14             I submit to you that that is the definition of a


15   subject, and of allegiance, and that really is --


16   demonstrates that the United Kingdom has come before this


17   Court not as a litigation posture, because it has no


18   interest really in any of these cases, but as a concern


19   over the fact that its sovereignty is not being recognized


20   by the judiciary when it has been recognized by the United


21   States Government in numerous treaties, and again, I won't


22   read them, but I would simply refer you to the Consular


23   Convention and footnote 17 of the United Kingdom's brief,


24   which details the numerous treaties that have been entered


25   into governing the British Virgin Islands and other of the


                                               42
