 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. KATYAL:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               The Ninth Circuit held that no

12   discrimination against a public employee is prohibited

13   by the Equal Protection Clause unless the targeted

14   person is a member of the suspect class or exercises a

15   fundamental right.      No matter how outrageous or evil and

16   no matter how unrelated to any legitimate government

17   interest, the clause provides zero protection.                  This

18   theory is contrary to the Constitution's text.                  It is

19   inconsistent with this Court's precedents.                  It is

20   unworkable and is unnecessary.

21               The Ninth Circuit ignored the Equal

22   Protection Clause's guarantee to any person that the

23   State will not use its vast powers to discriminate

24   without a legitimate government purpose and particularly

25   not in ways that lead to inefficient government.

 1                 This Court has articulated three principles

 2   that control this case.         First, the Constitution

 3   protects the individual from irrational discrimination.

 4   Second, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to public

 5   employers and rational-basis review applies to public

 6   employment.    And third, the clause applies to the

 7   administrative actions of State officials, not just

 8   legislatures.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Rational-basis review

10   normally doesn't inquire into the actual motive, for

11   example, of the State legislators who impose such a tax

12   or impose such a restriction.              We simply ask:   Could

13   there have been a rational basis for this?               Now, are you

14   willing to abide by that test?

15                 MR. KATYAL:       We are, Your Honor.         The Ninth

16   Circuit below said no rational-basis test ever; and,

17   indeed, the trial in this case allowed the government to

18   articulate any rationale, conceivable or not.               We do

19   think, even though it doesn't make --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Listen to what I'm saying.

21   Not whether you could decide that, given all of the

22   facts of this case, the criticism of the co- workers and

23   all of that, whether it is conceivable to say that this

24   was done on a rational basis.              That isn't the

25   rational-basis test.

 1                 It's just sitting back without these factual

 2   inquiries, just as we don't inquire factually into why

 3   the State legislature acted, just asking:                  Could there

 4   have been a rational basis for the dismissal of this

 5   employee?

 6                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Your Honor, we do agree that

 7   that last part, Justice Scalia, looking at could there

 8   have been a rational basis, is the proper test.                  But

 9   that is a factual determination at some level that, as

10   this Court in Kimel and a variety of other cases has

11   said, that you still have to look to the underlying

12   facts.    And even the Solicitor General doesn't disagree

13   at page 5 of their brief when they say you have to look

14   to whether -- that whatever that rationale is, it is

15   supported by the record.          The government had the

16   opportunity to --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that what you do

18   in this case -- I mean the person is fired and that's

19   all you know.    And so you go back and see:               Well, is

20   there any possible reason?           So you look at the time

21   sheets.    Oh, here are a few days where she punched in

22   late.    That's a possible reason, and that's enough?

23                 MR. KATYAL:       Well, we do think that that can

24   be enough; and, indeed, that's what the government had

25   their opportunity to argue in this case.                 The Ninth

 1   Circuit, of course, cuts off even that very deferential

 2   inquiry altogether.       Now --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So in that case --

 4   and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask:                    Did

 5   you fire this person because she punched in late a few

 6   times?     I take it hat the objection would be that that's

 7   irrelevant, and that would be sustained.

 8                 MR. KATYAL:        Well, if it is a counter-

 9   factual -- I mean, the plaintiff would have the

10   opportunity to negate the facts on whatever that

11   rationale.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, no.   The record

13   shows she was -- a few times she punched in late.

14                 MR. KATYAL:        And if it has anything to do

15   with government efficiency, the rational-basis test is

16   that deferential to permit that to go forward.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What about he didn't like

18   him?   I'm the supervisor; I didn't like him.

19                 MR. KATYAL:        Even that, Justice Breyer, is

20   enough so long as it's related to government efficiency.

21   That is --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Now, you say

23   related.    If the truth is I don't like this person,

24   good-bye, now, is that rational?                 When you say -- I

25   mean, you know as much about the case now as I do --

 1   not this case but, you know, that's all we know.                 Is

 2   that rational or not?

 3                 MR. KATYAL:       That, by itself, is not because

 4   the government has --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       Now that seems

 6   to me to be the problem, that either -- going back to

 7   Justice Scalia's point, you're either going to say

 8   rational in these circumstances, which means you go into

 9   it whether the time sheet was this or whether it was

10   that or the other; or you say, hey, it's always rational

11   because he could have fired him because he doesn't like

12   the person.    That's -- and I don't see some intermediate

13   step there.

14                 To put the question differently, every

15   government has a, State and Federal, has an

16   administrative procedures act.               That forbids

17   unreasonable, arbitrary action.               But why do they need

18   that if the Constitution does it by itself?

19                 MR. KATYAL:       Okay.        Let me say two things

20   because there are two different questions there.                 One

21   has to do with the State laws, and so on.                 And this

22   Court has never said that the existence of other State

23   remedies somehow displaces the Equal Protection Clause

24   or other constitutional guarantees.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about on the Federal

 1   level?    Could a Federal employee who says just what was

 2   alleged here come right into Court to bring a Bivens

 3   action and says, I was discriminated against and

 4   similarly situated people were not, and it was

 5   irrational?     Could a Federal employee come to court with

 6   such a complaint?

 7                 MR. KATYAL:        The answer is no, Justice

 8   Ginsburg, and the reason is at footnote 18 of our brief,

 9   and I believe the Solicitor General doesn't disagree in

10   large amount.    That is that for Bivens the question is,

11   will the court imply a right of action, as opposed to

12   the issue in this case, which is Section 1983.                   There is

13   a statutory right of action already in existence.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And it doesn't matter

15   that the State has civil service remedies that were not

16   used --

17                 MR. KATYAL:        Not --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- or there were union

19   grievance procedures that aren't used?                    You can go right

20   into Federal court and say, I don't have to use those

21   State remedies?

22                 MR. KATYAL:        That is correct.           It doesn't --

23   the existence of those State remedies does not displace

24   by itself without a statutory -- without Congress coming

25   in and mandating exhaustion or something like that.                   But

 1   in the absence of that, this Court has not said, outside

 2   of the limited area of procedural due process, that the

 3   existence of either collective-bargaining agreements or

 4   State laws somehow displaces a Federal constitutional

 5   guarantee.

 6                Now, if I could return to the first part of

 7   Justice Breyer's question, which was the dividing line

 8   in whether there is a clear standard, let me articulate

 9   this as one.   We believe that when a government employer

10   comes in and asserts some sort of objective reality, you

11   know, so for here they said the wheat prices are

12   declining, the plaintiff should have a chance to negate

13   that and say, well, it turned out that actually the

14   wheat prices weren't declining, and so on.

15                If, however, the plaintiff -- the government

16   articulates the rationale that you had put forth before,

17   I don't like you, and somehow the supervisor says it's

18   interfering with my government efficiency and I can't do

19   the job, well, that's something that the employer will

20   never really be able to -- the employee will never be

21   able to negate.   And that is set forth in our reply

22   brief at page 16.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I guess you begin

24   with the proposition that the government must always

25   have a reason for what it does?


                                         9

1                MR. KATYAL:         The government must always have

2    a reason when it discriminates against individuals.

3                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, discrimination, when

4    you say "discrimination," I take it you're meaning

5    discrimination not confined to the discrete categories

6    of racial, age, et cetera.           You're talking about

7    discrimination for any purpose.

8                And therefore, it seems to me that when you

9    say the government cannot discriminate, I think, in

10   effect, you're saying a government supervisor cannot

11   fire somebody simply because he does not like that

12   person, because that's a discrimination in relation to

13   the people that the supervisor does like; is that

14   correct.

15               MR. KATYAL:         That is -- that is correct as

16   long as -- as long as, Justice Souter, it is not related

17   to government efficiency; that is, if it's like this

18   case, in which --

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Right.           It's not government

20   efficiency; I just don't want to be around this person.

21               MR. KATYAL:         Exactly.

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Then it is the case, then,

23   that if you prevail in this case, that the notion of

24   paradigmatic, at-will employment within the government

25   in any State that recognizes that now, that will, in

1    fact, be eliminated to -- to the degree that there is a

2    -- a class-of-one cause of action.

3                MR. KATYAL:          To the contrary, Justice

4    Souter.   I don't think that will happen and indeed has

5    not happened and there is not a disagreement --

6                JUSTICE SOUTER:              I thought you just agreed

7    that it would happen in the hypothetical because as I --

8    and maybe I do not understand at-will employment, but I

9    thought the concept of at-will employment was that the

10   individual could be fired for a good reason, a bad

11   reason or no reason at all.              Somewhere in that trinity

12   we get Justice Breyer's hypothetical:                     I don't like him.

13   And you're saying that won't pass muster, but it would

14   pass muster under an at-will employment rule.

15               MR. KATYAL:          Justice Souter, as a practical

16   matter it won't matter -- as a practical matter it won't

17   make a difference.      And the reason is because an

18   employee can articulate, I don't like you, and it's

19   undermining government efficiency, in most cases -- and

20   particularly in at-will cases, where there isn't a

21   collective bargaining agreement or a State law that will

22   constrain the ability of the employer to even articulate

23   some sort of efficiency --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, no, no, no.        I'm not

25   working with this person; he is not going to affect my

1    efficiency.     He's under somebody below me but I just

2    don't like him.

3                  MR. KATYAL:        And if there isn't an

4    efficiency --

5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

6                  MR. KATYAL:        -- and the State can't

7    articulate an efficiency-based rationale --

8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

9                  MR. KATYAL:        -- there will be some effect on

10   at-will employment in those rare cases.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you have a national

12   for-clause employment system.               You can only be hired for

13   cause -- fired for cause.

14                 MR. KATYAL:        Well, except that the cause

15   that the equal protection mandates, the Equal Protection

16   clauses guarantee, is to deferential that as Justice

17   Breyer said, virtually any rationale will suffice if it

18   is --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you're getting back to

20   the point the government must always have a reason for

21   what it does.    Can you cite me a case that says that?

22                 MR. KATYAL:        That the government must always

23   have a reason?

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Must always have a reason

25   for the actions it takes.

1                 MR. KATYAL:       Well, I read this Court's

2    decision in Olech as basically mandating that as well

3    as -- you know, as well as its long history on a

4    class-of-one starting with Sioux City and Sunday Lake

5    and Snowden versus --

6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes, those are all tax

7    cases, or in Olech, 30 feet as opposed to 15 feet, where

8    there was a clear difference that was not -- but there

9    was also an allegation of an invidious motive.

10                MR. KATYAL:       And here, of course, the jury

11   found that invidious motive.            So even if we were to --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's just hard for me to

13   get that sweeping provision out of Olech.

14                MR. KATYAL:       If the Court were worried about

15   at-will employment, it has available to it the

16   possibility of requiring animus just as Justice Kennedy

17   -- or possibly in some --

18                JUSTICE ALITO:         What happens in this

19   situation?   The government gives a reason for whatever

20   the adverse action is.       Somebody -- they give -- and

21   let's say a person had lower performance ratings than

22   another person who was retained or given promotion.

23   Your position is the employee can always contest that

24   and say that's not the real reason; that's not factually

25   supported; is that correct?

1                   MR. KATYAL:       If -- if the government

2    articulates a rationale that is objectively based,

3    budget or something like that, yes; the plaintiff can

4    come back and try and rebut.              It now it does so under

5    the extremely deferential rational basis test, which is

6    why so few causes get through.                And indeed --

7                   JUSTICE ALITO:         How is it extremely

8    deferential when the employee is going to say that's not

9    the real reason; the real reason was simply spite and

10   animus and personal dislike?

11               MR. KATYAL:          Because if the government can

12   put forth --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            And that goes before the

14   jury.

15               MR. KATYAL:          Yeah, I don't believe it goes

16   to the jury, Justice Alito, because under this Court's

17   decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, summary judgment

18   stage will incorporate whatever the rationale basis test

19   or review is.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:            The employee says -- look,

21   it seems to me, the employee says in an affidavit the

22   supervisor doesn't like me, and here are the 20 things

23   that the supervisor has done and said over the course of

24   the last five years to indicate personal dislike.             Then

25   -- then it goes to the jury.

1                 MR. KATYAL:       Again as long as the employer

2    can articulate a reason based on government efficiency,

3    there is no way for that employee to rebut that.

4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But you're going to

5    have to articulate it in Federal court.                 You emphasize

6    it's a deferential standard, it's not -- but every case

7    now -- every case of an employee firing, in fact every

8    case of employee not getting as big a raise as he

9    thought he was entitled, that's now a Federal case.

10                MR. KATYAL:       Well, there are two problems

11   with that.   The first is those are already Federal cases

12   under existing laws, Title VII, the panoply of other

13   laws.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But Title VII,

15   there's no --you know, there is no, "because you don't

16   like me," it's not because I'm a particular race or --

17                MR. KATYAL:       But if we're positing a

18   frequent filer plaintiff who's bent on trying to file a

19   lawsuit, they can always make a Title VII.                 They can say

20   you're firing me because of --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm not worried

22   about a frequent filer.        I'm worried about 40 million

23   single filers.

24                MR. KATYAL:       And -- and the empirical

25   evidence, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, is that that

1    doesn't happen.     You know, we've had this cause of

2    action now for 26 and 27 years in two circuits.                  It's

3    now the law of the land in nine circuits; we haven't had

4    that entire flood, nor have we had the harm to at-will

5    employment.    And the reason is that plaintiffs aren't

6    going to bring these causes of action when they know

7    they are so hard to win.

8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't know if that's --

9    that's why I started this.            I read through, at least

10   briefly, the circuit cases in this area.                  I was trying

11   to figure it out.     And it seemed to me that those

12   circuit cases just really are finding some reason to

13   dismiss the employee's claim, that they are not taking

14   this seriously, that is -- I mean, I don't want to

15   criticize them because I don't know the facts of the

16   case; but I couldn't figure out a standard.

17                 And then I thought, well, the standard has

18   to be the APA standard, and if it's -- I know that

19   standard.   And the reason that you don't have a million

20   cases under that standard is because States have civil

21   service systems.

22                 MR. KATYAL:        The existing --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So it seemed to me that's

24   the standard you want to apply.                You want to bring all

25   those cases into Federal court, and I'm not sure they

1    are doing it now, really, in practice.                     Now what's wrong

2    with what I've just said?

3                   MR. KATYAL:       Well, I don't think there is

4    anything quite wrong with that.                I would say two things:

5    One, the existence of all of those State remedies and so

6    on are far more attractive for the employment plaintiff

7    than this cause of action.            And so, that's one reason

8    why you see these low numbers.

9                   Second is I don't quite agree with you that

10   the lower courts are, you know, maybe not taking it

11   seriously or however.        They have a long-established body

12   of law now on how to dismiss these cases on 12(b)(6)

13   motions, and the majority of the circuits have already

14   upheld that because of the similarly situated

15   requirements and intentionality requirements, as well as

16   on summary judgment; that is, because the test is so

17   deferential.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Let's take this case.

19   You say there were 30 similarly situated people with

20   regard to this employee being let go.                     Wouldn't that be

21   a contested matter?       The employer will say they are not

22   similarly situated; each of them is differently

23   situated.   How does that get resolved on summary

24   judgment?

25               MR. KATYAL:          Well, normally it depends on

1    the rationale that's being offered.                      Here the

2    government's rationale was declining wheat revenues, and

3    so each of the employees who was paid out of those wheat

4    revenues is similarly situated.               The government in this

5    case disclaimed the other rationales, performance and so

6    on.   In the ordinary case --

7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought they withdrew

8    from saying that it was a budgetary matter.

9                MR. KATYAL:         Well, there were two different

10   budgetary issues.    One was the budget having to do with

11   the Oregon State budget, and that was ultimately

12   withdrawn by the State.         The other was that Ms. Engquist

13   and 10 other or so employees were being paid out of

14   wheat revenues, and the State's rationale at trial was

15   that the wheat market was collapsing, and so they

16   couldn't pay for Ms. Engquist anymore.                     And she was --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Suppose the government --

18   suppose the government comes in and says, we don't want

19   to take a position as to -- as to what the reason was;

20   it could have been any one of the following seven -- you

21   know, the wheat market collapsed; she came in late five

22   days; some of the jobs she did she didn't do well; she

23   dressed inappropriately on the job; her co-workers

24   didn't like they are -- you know.                 And -- can the

25   government do that?

1                   MR. KATYAL:       The government can offer those.

2                   JUSTICE SCALIA:           How far -- does it have to

3    pick a reason?    You're --          you're --

4                   MR. KATYAL:       Absolutely not.              It can pick

5    many reasons.

6                   JUSTICE SCALIA:           So long as there is

7    conceivable reason, the court would grant summary

8    judgment?

9

10               MR. KATYAL:          We think that's right.              Now,

11   there are --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I thought you did not

13   agree with that in your brief.                I thought --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's what I thought, too.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- you said no

16   hypothetical justification is there.                      Not like

17   legislation where any conceivable basis, even if the

18   legislature didn't conceive it.                I thought you were

19   quite clear in saying no, that's not what rational basis

20   means in this context.

21               MR. KATYAL:          I might have misunderstood

22   Justice Scalia's question.            I thought he was saying does

23   the government -- can the government put forth a

24   conceivable rationale grounded in some fact, and the

25   answer to that is yes.         It's got to be grounded in fact.

1    That is the test.

2                   JUSTICE SCALIA:           All those facts are true

3    facts, but the government isn't claiming that any one of

4    them was the reason.        It just says here are the

5    conceivable reasons why -- why she might have been

6    fired.   We really don't know which one it was.

7                   MR. KATYAL:       The plaintiffs --

8                   JUSTICE SCALIA:           But here are seven

9    perfectly conceivable reasons.

10               MR. KATYAL:          The government has the ability

11   to put that forth and the plaintiff has the ability to

12   negate that.    That is the rational-basis test under

13   this.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              What do you mean, to negate

15   it?   To negate it as the actual reason is what you mean.

16               MR. KATYAL:          As -- to negate the facts.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But the government is not

18   purporting that -- to say that it's the actual reason.

19               MR. KATYAL:          Justice --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              The government is saying

21   had she been dismissed for this reason, and we really

22   don't know whether that was the reason or not, but had

23   she been dismissed for this reason it would have been

24   rational.

25               MR. KATYAL:          So long as, Justice Scalia,

1    that rationale is itself grounded in the facts.                   That

2    is, you can't come in and say she wasn't -- she was

3    coming to work late when she wasn't.                   But if she were,

4    then --

5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I didn't understand

6    your position to be that, but that -- -

7                MR. KATYAL:       The test here is -- the test

8    I'm trying to offer is one of objective -- objective --

9    whether the rationale is objectively falsifiable.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can I ask you

11   more -- perhaps a more abstract question about this

12   class-of-one?

13               Doesn't that have the effect of adding an

14   equal protection claim to every violation of law?                  In

15   other words, you have a Fourth Amendment search and

16   seizure claim, and you're treated illegally; you say

17   well, everybody else was treated legally and I wasn't,

18   so it's an equal protection violation?                  You get -- you

19   know, the zoning ordinance, it was improper under the

20   zoning law, and because everybody else was properly

21   treated, it's a violation of equal protection.

22               MR. KATYAL:       That is a problem, I think,

23   under this Court's decision in Olech generally.                  It

24   affects class-of-one --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you think Olech was

1    wrongly decided?

2                MR. KATYAL:         I do not.           I think this Court

3    has had a long history on --

4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I don't find anything in

5    Olech that says that every action that does not have a

6    reason is constitutionally infirm.

7                MR. KATYAL:         Let me go back, Justice

8    Kennedy, to answer your question more directly.                 This

9    Court has held in the employment case -- in the

10   employment context, that the government must have a

11   rational basis.    It said so in Harrah v. Martin, Beazer

12   and Murgia, all of which say that when an employer is

13   dismissing employees, it must act with a rational basis.

14   So this Court has already crossed that --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              All of those involved a

16   group characteristic.       One involved people -- Beazer,

17   wasn't it was methadone users?               But none of them

18   involved a situation like this, where she is not

19   claiming anything about being a member of any

20   identifiable class.      She is just saying, they

21   discriminated against me -- not because of sex, race or

22   anything else.    They were out to get me.

23               MR. KATYAL:         Justice Ginsburg, I don't quite

24   think that describes the fact of Harrah v. Martin in

25   which it was a challenge to an individual termination

1    decision by the school board.             But I do agree the other

2    cases are group-based characteristics.                  We don't think

3    that makes a difference, and indeed we think that the

4    Solicitor General's test on this would be unworkable in

5    practice, because everyone can assert their membership

6    in some objective --

7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, but you could -- you

8    could take sentiment -- I thought you could break the

9    cases, for the most part, into two parts; one, what

10   Justice Ginsburg said, and that's where the real reason

11   is some kind of general characteristic, of a disfavored

12   group.   The second is the instance where the -- where

13   the body that's acting is a body whose business it is to

14   classify.   That's zoning, taxation, and it means really

15   classifying in fact, not some theoretical thing where

16   you say, oh, well, they're classifying it employment

17   because they put you in the class of such and such.                 But

18   those two seem to me to handle the bulk of the cases,

19   which, if I'm right about that, would leave your client

20   out in the cold.   So I assume you'll tell me why I'm not

21   right.

22               MR. KATYAL:        Well, I will try.           So the first

23   thing is that -- I don't quite think that describes the

24   facts of Harrah versus Martin, which is an individual

25   decision.   And, secondly, once you start going down the

1    line of objective, group-based characteristics and the

2    like, it is infinitely manipulable, and that's why the

3    Ninth Circuit decisions after, in the wake of this

4    decision below, are dismissing group-based claims on --

5    on disability and age and the like.                       Everyone can

6    replead their claim as part of a group, that is, Ms. --

7    you know, Ms. Engquist can say she's part of a group of

8    two, those who complained about their supervisors and up

9    the chain of command.

10               And so the problem is it becomes unworkable

11   in practice.   And, of course, the Constitution, Justice

12   Ginsburg, doesn't say, the way the Solicitor General

13   would like it be, doesn't say no State shall deny equal

14   protection of the law to anyone who is a member of an

15   objective group-based, you know, group and class.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But you brought up -- you

17   said this is 1983.      It's a cause of action provided by

18   Congress.   So that's why this is something State and

19   municipal employees can do, but no Federal employee

20   could do.   1985 also uses the word "person or class of

21   persons," and yet this Court held that 1985(3), that

22   claim, it has to be some group-based animus, not malice

23   directed toward a particular individual.

24               MR. KATYAL:          I don't quite think that -- I

25   think the Court has already dealt with that in Olech by

1    affirming, essentially, a 1983 cause of action based on

2    an individual person's claim.              And so -- and so that is

3    the relevant precedent here, not the section 1985

4    precedents.

5                  Now, if we --

6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, maybe because

7    1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could

8    say 1983 -- we know the classification to which Justice

9    Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning

10   classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting

11   out.

12                 MR. KATYAL:       But the statutory test -- text,

13   Justice Ginsburg, is the same.               There's one section 19

14   --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it's a -- it's a

16   general statute.   It's not a precise statute like Title

17   VII or the Age Discrimination Act.                  So it's the kind of

18   legislation that seems much more amenable to court

19   interpretation.

20                 MR. KATYAL:       I would agree with that.          I

21   think it might open a whole can of worms were the Court

22   to say that 1983 requires some group-based

23   discrimination outside of this particular context that

24   we are talking about.       And so I think --

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, it certainly opens

1    a can of worms to say that you take every claim against

2    the government, every claim of wrongdoing by the

3    government, and make it an equal protection claim

4    because you say other people were treated properly and I

5    was treated improperly; therefore, I have an equal

6    protection claim.

7                  MR. KATYAL:       Except, Justice Ginsburg, we've

8    had this cause of action now for 26 and 27 years in two

9    circuits; we have it in nine.              We haven't seen the

10   effect on at-will employment nor, more generally, on the

11   Equal Protection Clause opening up that can of worms

12   that you're hypothesizing.

13                 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

19                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20                 MS. METCALF:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22                 The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is

23   consistent with this Court's recognition, in other

24   constitutional contexts, that Federal court is simply

25   not the forum in which to second-guess everyday

1    decisions made by public employers.                      It's also

2    consistent with this Court's recognition, again in other

3    constitutional contexts, that the rights of public

4    employees simply are not as expansive in a number of

5    ways as those of citizens generally vis-a-vis their

6    public employers.

7                We think that both of those lines of cases

8    come at least in part out of the recognition that public

9    employment decisions, indeed employment decisions

10   generally, are highly subjective in nature and highly

11   individualistic in nature.

12               We think really that the Ninth Circuit here

13   has gone no farther than to apply those concepts as a

14   specific context of class-of-one cases brought in the

15   public employment context.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The Ninth Circuit

17   decision would rule out the case where an employee says:

18   I was the most qualified person for this position by

19   far, but the supervisors took a bribe from a rich uncle

20   to promote somebody else.

21               MS. METCALF:          Yes.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That would be out?

23               MS. METCALF:          That would be out as an equal

24   protection claim.    There undoubtedly would be other

25   avenues, potential other avenues, where --

1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The scapegoat case, too,

2    would be out?

3                  MS. METCALF:         Yes.       Yes, it would.   It would

4    under this rationale --

5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why -- but we have said

6    that -- that there is a constitutional claim if the

7    reason the person was not hired is that the person did

8    not belong to the political party that the -- that the

9    hiring person belonged to, the current administration.

10                 MS. METCALF:         And --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You said you can't turn

12   down somebody just because she's a Democrat or a

13   Republican.

14                 MS. METCALF:         That's correct.        And our

15   formulation I think, of the test, Your Honor, is that

16   there should be no such thing as a class-of-one equal

17   protection claim in the public employment context, with

18   certain exceptions, those exceptions including, for

19   example, exercising a fundamental right; membership in a

20   suspect class; perhaps certain other criteria, such as

21   the one you mentioned, certain other classifications.

22   But that as -- as a general matter, the broad question

23   that the Ninth Circuit faced, is there, outside of those

24   exceptions, is there such a thing as a class-of-one

25   public employment?

1                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me ask, following up

2    on Justice Ginsburg's question:              Suppose it's not a

3    class-of-one, but it's a class of two or three because,

4    on two or three occasions they fired somebody because he

5    wouldn't pay the supervisor a bribe.                    Would that cross

6    the threshold?   He had a practice of not -- you know,

7    getting a little money out of every promotion.

8                MS. METCALF:         No, no, Justice Stevens, and

9    again to be clear --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If it's not a class of one

11   --

12               MS. METCALF:         I keep throwing up --

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you say no or yes to

14   whether there would be a cause of action?

15               MS. METCALF:         No.      Because -- and this is

16   why I keep using quotes for "class-of-one."

17   "Class-of-one" doesn't literally describe the number of

18   plaintiffs, both because in some cases there might be a

19   single plaintiff, but they're alleging discrimination

20   based on membership in a class.              And because -- and

21   Olech is an example -- as the Court pointed out in a

22   footnote in Olech, Olech could have been described as a

23   class of five.

24               But, again, we're talking about

25   discrimination allegedly based on something other than

1    the exceptions that this Court has recognized:                        Exercise

2    of a fundamental right, membership in a --

3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, but, as your

4    friend points out, the constitutional provision says

5    "any person."    It doesn't say any person who is a member

6    of a particular class or any person who is exercising a

7    fundamental right.       It's "any person."

8                  MS. METCALF:          Admittedly, Chief Justice

9    Roberts.   And I certainly don't think the constitutional

10   text does us any affirmative good, but I don't think it

11   goes as far as Petitioner would have it go.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Do you think Olech was

13   correctly decided?

14                 MS. METCALF:          Yes, yes.              We take no issue

15   with Olech.   We --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And public employment is

17   different just because it's going to be a big problem?

18   What --

19                 MS. METCALF:          Not because it's going to be a

20   big problem, but because the regulatory context is

21   significantly different, we think, than the employment

22   context.   Part of that is the inherently subjective

23   nature of employment decisions.                 Regulatory decisions

24   are made at arm's length; they are made under relatively

25   --

1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but we're presuming

2    that there is an objective reason for promoting or

3    retaining -- the person has a college degree and so

4    forth -- but that that person is rejected anyway because

5    of dislike.

6                  MS. METCALF:        But -- but again --

7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's the hypothetical.

8    Why is that hypothetical case different than Olech?

9                  MS. METCALF:        You might have an unusual

10   employment case in which an employer has drawn up a list

11   of objective criteria.        That's not this case.        That's

12   not the average case.       In the average case you might,

13   for example, prefer that someone have a degree, but --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But then we say that there

15   is a subset of unusual cases where we will allow the

16   cause of action?

17                 MS. METCALF:        No.      We offer the subjective

18   nature as a general reason why simply class-of-one

19   analysis should not apply in this context, period,

20   because the average -- whereas the average in the

21   regulatory context probably is a high degree of

22   objectivity, the average in the employment context is a

23   relatively high degree of subjectivity and discretion.

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But there are areas outside

25   of employment where there's a lot of discretion.

1    Suppose someone claims that he has repeatedly gotten

2    speeding tickets for going five miles over the speed

3    limit by a local police department because of some sort

4    of personal feud with the chief of police.                   That I take

5    it would be a valid claim under Olech because it's

6    outside his employment?

7                 MS. METCALF:          Because it's regulatory and

8    enforcing, law enforcement.              I think so.

9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'm having trouble hearing

10   both the question and the answer.

11                MS. METCALF:          As I understand -- I don't

12   know if you want me to try to restate the question or if

13   you want to do it.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, the question was:

15   Don't you run into the same problem of discretion

16   outside of the employment context?                   For example, a

17   police officer who is alleged to have given someone a

18   ticket or a number of tickets simply because of personal

19   malice as opposed to some sort of uniform policy.

20                MS. METCALF:          But, again, there I think the

21   -- hopefully, the norm in law enforcement is a

22   relatively objective standard.                Are you in fact

23   speeding?   Are you in fact breaking the traffic laws?

24   Are you in fact breaking the law in some other way?

25   Whereas the norm in employment decisions is a much more

1    discretionary, subjective kind of decision.               Yes, I may

2    have certain criteria that I would prefer a manager

3    have, but then I'm still going to have to weigh the

4    qualifications and experience of various candidates and

5    ultimately make a relatively subjective decision about

6    who I think is the best candidate for that, for that

7    job.     Which is why we think the regulatory context and

8    the employment context are significantly different.

9                  JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but those are all

10   considerations that would be an adequate defense to a

11   claim.    If you had a judgment call to make, you say, I

12   had a judgment call to make.              And maybe there are good

13   arguments on the other side.              You can't be liable for

14   that kind of decision.

15                 MS. METCALF:         Well -- and certainly I'm

16   somewhat perhaps surprised by Petitioner's argument

17   today because I understand Petitioner's argument to

18   almost concede the point that summary judgment should

19   have been given to the -- to the State's defendants in

20   this case because in fact, with regard to each of the

21   three employment decisions that are at issue in this

22   case, the State and the defendants did proffer and --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But we are concerned about

24   the case -- let's just assume, just take it as a

25   hypothetical case -- where there is an arbitrary and

1    vindictive reason for hiring the employee and it has

2    nothing to do with race, sex, or other recognized

3    suspect or improper categories.               And I thought your

4    answer to me was, well, I might make an exception to

5    that.

6                  MS. METCALF:        No.      My answer to you is as

7    long -- well, my answer to you is twofold.                      If we're

8    simply considering whether, in fact, there could be such

9    a thing as a class-of-one case in the employment

10   context, our answer is no.           If we're past that and the

11   issue is what's the test to apply, our test is as long

12   as there is any conceivable rational basis for the

13   action that the government employer took, the case

14   should be at end; it should not go to the jury.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, isn't that an

16   odd system?   I mean, you have -- like our time card

17   example, you're going to have litigation over whether

18   she was late for work or was not late for work, and in

19   fact that's got nothing to do with the reasons she was

20   fired at all.   And yet the government puts it out, well,

21   this is a conceivable reason, and then the other side

22   says, no, it's not, and they fight.                      It just seems so

23   otherworldly; it has nothing to do with the reason at

24   all.

25                 MS. METCALF:        Well, the -- often the real

1    reason -- and this Court has made this observation in

2    particular in legislative contexts.                     But often the real

3    reason is not necessarily apparent or undisputed, and

4    beyond that, that's simply the test that this Court has

5    employed as a general matter in rational-basis

6    equal-protection cases.

7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but that's

8    with respect to legislative or regulatory action, where

9    there are important reasons not to inquire into the

10   motives of the legislators.            It's not clear to me that

11   that same rationale applies here.

12                MS. METCALF:        Well, two points, Your Honor.

13   I would certainly agree that the Court has most often,

14   if not always, said that in the legislative context.

15   But Petitioner is not really arguing for a different

16   test here.   As I understand Petitioner's argument, and

17   perhaps I misunderstand it, but Petitioner's argument is

18   that this Court should apply customary rational-basis

19   analysis and apply such analysis as long as the

20   government has some conceivable rational basis that --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's not -- you know

22   that that's not the position they took in their brief.

23   They said it's not a hypothetical, any conceivable.

24   They said that by qualifying -- even in the at-will

25   category, the government has to articulate a reason

1    rooted in the facts of this case, not a hypothetical.                 A

2    hypothetical reason is not good enough.

3                 MS. METCALF:          Agreed, Justice Ginsburg.     If

4    -- we don't agree that that would be the test.              We think

5    that the Court should stick to the customary

6    rational-basis test as it's applied in other contexts,

7    and say if there is any conceivable rational basis, that

8    even if --

9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It seems to me that you

10   want us to write an opinion that says there are some

11   instances where the government can act arbitrarily and

12   unreasonably.

13                MS. METCALF:          We would ask you to write an

14   opinion, Justice Kennedy, that says that, within the

15   public employment context, there are no class-of-one

16   equal protection claims.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, you think the answer

18   is yes, I mean, because --

19                MS. METCALF:          Yes.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:             -- because the

21   Administrative Procedures Act forbids arbitrary,

22   capricious action.      So you're saying the Constitution --

23                MS. METCALF:          Yes.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:             -- does not

25   constitutionalize all --

1                  MS. METCALF:        Yes.

2                  JUSTICE BREYER:           -- arbitrary, capricious

3    behavior --

4                  MS. METCALF:        Yes.

5                  JUSTICE BREYER:           -- of the Federal

6    Government --

7                  MS. METCALF:        And there --

8                  JUSTICE BREYER:           -- or the State government.

9                  MS. METCALF:        There will and probably are

10   going to be other remedies, but not a Fourteenth

11   Amendment remedy.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

13                 MS. METCALF:        Absolutely.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So the answer is yes.

15   Okay.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that's because of

17   existence of other avenues of redress.

18                 MS. METCALF:        Not solely.            That, I think, is

19   a factor.   It's because of, again, this Court's

20   recognition in other contexts that public employees

21   simply are not on the same footing as private citizens

22   generally with regard to their employers, and that

23   Federal court is simply not the appropriate forum in

24   which to review the day-to-day decisionmaking of public

25   employers; and because of recognition of the inherently

1    subjective nature of public employment decisions.

2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I understood that the

3    argument --

4                  JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- your opponent's

5    statement that this really has not generated an awful

6    lot of litigation.      Do you think he's right or wrong on

7    that?

8                  MS. METCALF:         I think so far as anyone can

9    determine, he's right to date.                Obviously, we have some

10   real concern that if this Court were to say that there

11   were such a cause of action, that things might change.

12   Beyond that, I think the relatively few number of cases,

13   and in particular the very, very small to-date number of

14   successful cases is an argument against extending

15   class-of-one equal protection analysis into this

16   context, because there will be an adverse effect on

17   public employer discretion if the Court were to extend

18   the analysis.   Public employers would have to worry

19   about what happened in this case, that their decisions

20   are subject to later second-guessing in Federal court.

21   It may well chill the exercise of public employer

22   discretion.   And I think the most common complaint about

23   public employer discretion, it is that it's

24   underutilized not overutilized, and there would be a

25   real danger that for the price of a very few successful


                                         38

1    cases you would chill the exercise of public employer

2    discretion.

3                  So, we actually think that that point is an

4    argument against the extension, not for it.                 But I would

5    agree that we can't point to any enormous flood of cases

6    to date.

7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            In Oregon, is -- would

8    there be a civil service remedy available to someone in

9    this situation?

10                 MS. METCALF:        There would be admittedly very

11   limited remedies under the civil service laws, per se.

12   The decision about whether to advance her as a manager,

13   of who would pick her as a manager was one really solely

14   within the employer's discretion.                 With respect to the

15   decisions about the layoff and the bumping into someone

16   else's position, she had essentially what were

17   procedural remedies under her collective bargaining

18   agreement, which -- which the union would have had to

19   assert on her behalf.       If the union had failed to do so

20   and she had thought the union erred in doing so, she

21   could have filed an action against them.

22                 She did have a common-law State-law claim in

23   this case, which she brought, one for intentional

24   interference with her employment relationship, which she

25   was successful in both in the district court and which

1    we did not challenge in the Ninth Circuit.               So that

2    State-law claim is certainly still a viable claim --

3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           But as far as the Federal

4    law claim is concerned, you'd urge us to come out the

5    same way, even if this case came up before the

6    Administrative Procedure Act was passed, right?

7                  MS. METCALF:        Yes.       Yes, we would.

8    Although, again, that provides yet an additional remedy

9    to --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The Administrative

11   Procedure Act doesn't apply to State -- to State

12   procedures.   It's a Federal act --

13                 MS. METCALF:        Right.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- governing Federal

15   agencies.

16                 MS. METCALF:        Right.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But as to Federal

18   employment, you'd say the same?

19                 MS. METCALF:        Yes.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you'd say the same as

21   if there were no State remedies for --

22                 MS. METCALF:        Yes.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- employment

24   discrimination by the State.

1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Because the State has a

2    right to employ at will?

3                MS. METCALF:         Yes, subject to whatever

4    limitations there may be and other affirmative sources

5    of law such as a collective bargaining agreement or some

6    other State or Federal statutory remedy.                Yes.

7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What exactly is the

8    analytic basis of that?        I mean, do you think that --

9    you don't think the Equal Protection Clause applies at

10   all to this situation where it's just a class of one?

11   Or do you think that the clause is always -- the claim

12   of violation under the clause is always rebutted

13   automatically?   What is the --

14               MS. METCALF:         The former -- the former

15   within the context of public employment.                We certainly

16   again are not -- not taking issue with Olech.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But what authority do you

18   have for us to parse different governmental actions and

19   say some are subject to the Equal Protection Clause and

20   some are not?

21               MS. METCALF:         Well, again I don't know --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Other than the convenience

23   of the government -- it might be more efficient for the

24   government -- you want us to say that the government can

25   act arbitrarily with respect to employees?

1                MS. METCALF:          And, again, I don't know that

2    the Federal Government discusses peremptory challenges,

3    and I'll leave that to them.             But, again, stepping

4    outside the Fourteenth Amendment context for a moment,

5    this Court certainly and without explicit textual

6    support has recognized the existence, for example, of

7    the First Amendment rights of public employees

8    vis-a-vis --

9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Oh, but that's very

10   different, because those cases say that those

11   individuals have no First Amendment rights.                 In other

12   words, in the public employee context, talking about

13   their official obligations, there is no First Amendment

14   right to do that.    I think it's quite a different

15   situation to say there is no equal protection right in

16   government employment.

17               MS. METCALF:          But -- but -- maybe I

18   shouldn't say again.       Your Honor, I think that what we

19   are asking for in this case is the same sort of line

20   drawing outside textual, atextual line drawing that this

21   Court has done in other contexts such as the First

22   Amendment context, where it has said that government

23   simply can impose obligations, restrictions on its

24   public employees that it could not on citizens generally

25   and --

1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why can't you simply say

2    that they are not being denied equal protection of the

3    law?    The law that applies to her and to everybody else

4    employed by the government is that the employment is at

5    will?

6                  MS. METCALF:        And --

7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's certainly an equal

8    protection.    She could be fired at will and everybody

9    else can be fired at will.

10                 MS. METCALF:        Agreed.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why isn't that equal

12   protection of the law?

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Except this wasn't --

14   this wasn't employment at will, right?

15                 MS. METCALF:        Not precisely.         But the

16   decision whether or not to promote effective or not

17   might have been at will in the sense that was a decision

18   subject solely to the discretion of the employer.                  So,

19   in a sense, it's analogous.             I wouldn't say that it is

20   precisely at will with respect to any of these

21   decisions.    And, again, because she had only limited

22   rights under the collective bargaining agreement,

23   outside of those limited rights the employer really had

24   full discretion as to what decision it would make.                  So,

25   again, I think there is an analogy to at will.

1                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           What proportion of your

2    workforce is really hired at will?                  Haven't they all got

3    some kind of protections under your statutes?

4                  MS. METCALF:        As a matter of fact, none of

5    the assistant attorneys general, including me, have any

6    protection.    Most -- most State employees have some kind

7    of collective -- I'm arguing against myself in this case

8    -- most employees in the State of Oregon have some kind

9    of collective bargaining protection.                     So at will is the

10   exception, not the rule.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Don't have you some kind

12   of civil service system, too?

13                 MS. METCALF:        Not precisely.            It's much more

14   a matter of collective bargaining, but it amounts to

15   much the same thing in the end.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So that implies people who

17   are employed at will are the exception rather than the

18   rule?

19                 MS. METCALF:        Absolutely.            And I would

20   readily concede that fact.

21                 If the Court gets to the second part of the

22   case and the question becomes what sort of test,

23   assuming that the Court finds a class-of-one analysis

24   should apply in this context and the question becomes:

25   What's the test?   Really, all the State is asking for

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1    here is an application of the customary, rational-basis

2    test in which if any conceivable rational basis can be

3    offered by the government, the case should be at an end.

4                  That position was raised below by the State

5    defendants, who raised the point both in their summary

6    judgment motion and in their trial memo and urged the

7    district court to take this case away from the jury on

8    that basis, and the district court refused to do so.

9                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           What do you say to the

10   argument that the conceivable-basis test is appropriate

11   when we are judging legislation, because we don't know

12   what goes through the minds of individual legislators.

13   Whereas, these kinds of decisions, employment decisions,

14   are, in fact, very specific state-of-mind kind of

15   decisions; and, therefore, the equal-protection standard

16   ought to take that into consideration and look to the

17   specific reasons?

18                 MS. METCALF:        I think the difference is not

19   that great.   I think, admittedly, the actual rationale

20   is harder to discern in legislative cases, in part,

21   because you have so many decisionmakers.

22                 But here, for example, it is similar because

23   the decisionmakers might have had a number, and probably

24   did have a number, of elements in mind from dislike to a

25   preference for a certain kind of background.

5                       ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

6                             AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7                     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

8                  MS. BLATT:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9    please the Court:

10                 There are two types of class-of-one claims

11   that should not be recognized in the public-employment

12   context.

13                 The first is a claim of residual ill will or

14   bad-motive complicitor, and the second is a simple

15   demand for a rational basis for an adverse personnel

16   decision.

17                 The problem with those claims is that they

18   would constitutionalize routine employee grievances and

19   impose a for-cause requirement on public employers,

20   notwithstanding the long tradition of at-will public

21   employment.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Ma'am, the reason that we

23   didn't say that same thing in Oleck is because in the

24   taxation area or the easement area we simply don't have

25   the great number of cases and also because animus is

1    more easily established.

2                   MS. BLATT:      It is similar.             And in the

3    regulatory context a personality conflict is not a

4    legitimate basis for adversely treating citizens.                      But a

5    personality conflict between a supervisor and a

6    subordinate is generally, if not always, a legitimate

7    basis for adversely treating an employee.

8                   JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, I wondered if I was

9    right, you know; that I thought that maybe, looking

10   back, that there is something about zoning and taxation

11   where it normally is alleged that it's rule-making

12   activity.

13               And that perhaps you would apply all of

14   these things you are talking about where what the --

15   even if it is employment, where what the employer is

16   doing, or anyone else is doing, is creating rules, is

17   classifying.    And not a made-up classification like you

18   put me and one other fired person in the fired- person

19   category.   I don't mean that.              I mean like taxation and

20   zoning and legislation.          Is there anything to that?

21               MS. BLATT:         There is some support in the

22   case law, but what I think your concurring opinion was

23   trying to do was to help local and State governments.

24   And it is one thing to say the mayor denied my building

25   permit, and I'm going to make the employee allege

1    animus, and that might be difficult to do.                   But for

2    someone on the mayor's staff, it's not that difficult to

3    allege animus on the part of your supervisor.

4                 Employment frictions are inherent in the

5    workplace, and perceptions of unfair treatment readily

6    arise by an employee who thinks he or she was unfairly

7    treated.

8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I agree with

9    all of that, but -- so the Equal Protection Clause

10   doesn't apply?

11                MR. BLATT:        Sure, it applies.            It just

12   doesn't give you a right to collect what this plaintiff

13   did:   Punitive and compensatory damages based on

14   residual ill will.

15                She ran an equal-protection claim on race,

16   gender, national origin, sex.               She had a statutory claim

17   for imposing unlawful conduct under Title VII.                   The jury

18   rejected all of that and imposed punitive damages, and

19   it went to the jury on a legal question that has always

20   been decided by this Court and the courts about whether

21   there was a rational basis or whether, instead, it was

22   solely based on vindictive, arbitrary, or malicious

23   reasons.   It went to the jury, and there was no

24   allegation that --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So you think the

1    Equal Protection Clause applies --

2                MS. BLATT:         Yes.

3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   -- in any case of

4    public employment -- what -- that's satisfied?

5                MS. BLATT:         It doesn't -- no.            If you have a

6    membership in an identifiable group classification as

7    opposed to purely subjective and individualized

8    criteria.   Here the class was:               I was a thorn in my

9    supervisor's side.      That is not a class.               And if it is a

10   class, it would lose, because you would always have a

11   rational basis.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But the Equal

13   Protection Clause doesn't balk about classes.                   It talks

14   about any person.

15               MS. BLATT:         That's correct, and -- and in

16   First Amendment -- and that's a different amendment, but

17   in the Fourteenth Amendment there is the Batson context.

18   It's just -- just like in the Batson context, the high

19   cost of litigating every single claim to try to ferret

20   out what would truly be an irrational decision is not

21   worth the cost when there is such an overwhelming

22   likelihood that a truly irrational decision would

23   already be prohibited by some other contract or

24   statutory source.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It doesn't talk about equal

1    protection, actually, it talks about equal protection

2    the law; and if -- if the law in the government

3    employment context is that you can be dismissed at will,

4    or for a number of reasons, so long as everybody is

5    subject to that same law, it would seem to be no

6    discrimination in the law?

7                  MS. BLATT:      Well, we are not relying on the

8    text of the Equal Protection Clause.

9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, don't rely on the text,

10   certainly.

11                 (Laughter.)

12                 MS. BLATT:      What we are relying on are two

13   principles.   And there is just a longstanding principle

14   that the Constitution is not the appropriate forum to

15   resolve routine employment disputes.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            When you do that with the

17   two cases that I raised with Miss Metcalf?               That is, the

18   bribe case and the scapegoat case, they are out, too.

19   If public employment is taken out from this

20   class-of-one, those two cases would go as well.

21                 MS. BLATT:      Right, well, one is criminal

22   conduct, and on the scapegoat case I actually don't

23   think that's such a bad thing.               One can recharacterize

24   scapegoating as public accountability, and their side

25   would allow Federal courts and State courts to

1    second-guess a local employment's response to a public

2    crisis.    So if there is a school board or some tragic

3    accident in the city, and a group of employees are

4    fired, their side would give constitutional claim for

5    punitive and compensatory damages based on a finding of

6    ill will; and although the other side comes up here and

7    tells a story about traditional rational basis, in this

8    case it was submitted to the jury, about whether there

9    was a rational basis or whether whatever articulated

10   basis was a mere pretext; it was treated basically like

11   a sex, or gender, a race claim, and not a rational basis

12   claim.    This should have never gone to the jury.                 It's

13   not a fact question whether there is a rational basis.

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Can we -- can we meet your

15   objection --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           In a mixed motives case,

17   both ill will and a -- some reason, she was also late to

18   work -- you would win that case.

19                 MS. BLATT:      Well --

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           If you have one good

21   reason and one bad reason, the bad reason doesn't trump

22   the good reason.

23                 MS. BLATT:      That's right.              In a mixed-motive

24   constitutional case involving a fundamental right, it's

25   a fact question for the jury.              In a rational basis case

1    it would be a question for the court whether there is a

2    conceivable rational basis.

3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But a public employee

4    applies for a 30-foot easement that he is entitled to,

5    and doesn't receive it; and the mayor says and by the

6    way I don't like you, so you're fired:                    A, you don't get

7    the easement, B, you're fired.                Why -- why do we treat

8    the cases differently?         Other than the floodgate

9    argument etcetera?

10                 MS. BLATT:       Well, if the mayor doesn't give

11   the employee a grievance, in her capacity as a citizen

12   she has a suit under Olech; but in her termination

13   claim, she -- unless she can allege membership in an

14   identifiable class, she doesn't have an equal protection

15   right to be free from just pure arbitrariness -- -

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that just states your

17   conclusion.   I want to know why this is.

18                 MS. BLATT:       Why?       Because personality

19   conflicts have no role in the regulatory context and

20   they generally if not always are the legitimate basis

21   for a personnel decision.            It's just that -- they say

22   this example, well, employer doesn't like you; that's

23   sufficient; but the other side never tells you how far

24   they would take that.        Is it because the conflict arose

25   in the workplace; is it because it arose from their


                                         52
                           Alderson Reporting Company

1    neighborhood; is it because it arose from the high

2    school debate team or law review or cheerleading squad

3    and that's why the person wasn't hired?                   And we would

4    have courts having just to go, judge by judge and court,

5    and in their case, jury by jury, for these kinds of

6    decisions; and these shouldn't be constitutional cases.

7    These are more properly resolved under merit service

8    protection laws and collective bargaining agreements.

9                JUSTICE SOUTER:              Would it meet your concern

10   if we held number one, yes, there may be a class of

11   claim in the public employment context, but any reason

12   that would be a lawful reason for discharge under the

13   at-will rule is a -- a reason that would satisfy the

14   test; and therefore it would be the real outlier that

15   would ever get to the jury?

16               MS. BLATT:         Well, in the at-will context, if

17   an employer says you're fired and gives no reason,

18   that's legitimate; but in their case at least by the

19   time a lawyer is hired and the case goes to court, the

20   State is having -- has to articulate a basis that could

21   be second-guessed.      If you write -- if you are going to

22   apply class-of-one and write a very broad opinion saying

23   almost anything goes in the employment context, that's

24   certainly preferable than having us go to juries based

25   on pretext and bad motive, which is what happened in


                                         53

1    this case.

2                  But I still think it would impose a

3    for-cause requirement that's inconsistent with your due

4    process cases, which presuppose that the personnel

5    entitlement must spring from someplace other than the

6    Constitution.

7                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, let me ask you this.

8    I mean, I wasn't trying a trick question but I -- let me

9    be explicit about this.         If we adopted the rule that

10   said anything that goes under the at-will rule goes

11   under equal protection class of one, would there be

12   anything left?

13                MS. BLATT:       No.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       So the reason is, if

15   we opted that rule you'd win across the board.

16                MS. BLATT:       Yes.       Yes.       Unless you leave --

17   right.   There is not point.            I mean the at-will rule is

18   that no reason be given, or it could be a bad reason.

19   And if there is any concern about the line drawing, I

20   would urge you just to look at the verdict form in this

21   case.    All that was submitted to the jury, after there

22   was the rejection of the national origin, the gender,

23   the race, the color, the retaliation for reporting

24   sexual harassment, was just a simple case of without any

25   rational basis, and solely for arbitrary, vindictive or

1    malicious reasons.

2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So we should cite there is

3    no constitutional right to be a policeman?                   We can

4    revise that?

5                 MS. BLATT:        Well, no.           I mean, there are

6    lots of constitutional limits on public employment.

7    What we are talking about is where you've reduced at

8    will for a null set, and there is any claim for

9    arbitrary conduct.      I mean, we would allow under our

10   theory any claim that is not just a residual ill will or

11   bad motive states a valid equal protection case.                  And

12   this is many, many statutory protections as well.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

14   Ms. Blatt.

15                Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes remaining.

16                  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18                MR. KATYAL:         The Ninth Circuit in this case,

19   Your Honor, has cut out all claims conceivable or

20   otherwise, and that is contrary to the text of the Equal

21   Protection Clause in this Court's precedent.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Do you agree with me that

23   if we adopted a rule that says that anything that goes

24   for at-will employment goes for one-person-class equal

25   protection, and that that in effect would eliminate any

1    cause of action?

2                 MR. KATYAL:       It would, Justice Souter, under

3    the formal rule; that is, no reason alone is sufficient.

4    That of course as a practical matter is not the way

5    at-will works anymore, because of the panoply of rules,

6    Title 7 and otherwise that force employers to articulate

7    rationales when they terminate at-will employees.              So as

8    a practical matter the no-reason firing doesn't exist

9    anymore because those employees, those at-will employees

10   who are going to sue are going to sue anyway.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:          You keep stressing the text

12   of the Equal Protection Clause.              Don't you think it's

13   late in the day to be arguing that Equal Protection

14   Clause should be read with that kind of literalness?

15               MR. KATYAL:        No.      This Court has

16   consistently held that the text of the Equal Protection

17   Clause encompasses personal claims.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:          It talks about laws, but it

19   extends to situations where what's being -- the unequal

20   treatment is not stemming from the law, but from

21   executive or administrative action.

22               MR. KATYAL:        That's quite right, Justice

23   Alito.   And in fact since 1879 this Court has said --

24               JUSTICE ALITO:          And in the other example,

25   are there not situations where it's been held to apply


                                       56
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1    that might not fall within the literal language of the

2    clause?

3                  MR. KATYAL:       I'm not sure I got that down,

4    sir.

5                  JUSTICE ALITO:         You think in all other

6    respects it's read literally?

7                  MR. KATYAL:       I'm not sure if in all other

8    respects it is, but with respect to the relevant

9    questions here -- that is, does this clause apply to

10   individual agency actions, this Court has held so in

11   1879 in Missouri versus Lewis, and has held so

12   consistently ever since.

13                 So in this case the government put forth one

14   rationale which was an objective one, we -- and

15   disclaimed all the others, the subjective ones; and we

16   do think that that subjective rationales in employment

17   is different, and would almost always be a rational

18   basis.    In this case they disclaimed all those other

19   ones.

20                 So here the government is using its power,

21   its raw power, surely for its own personal ends and that

22   is contrary to the whole notion of why employment should

23   be different within government efficiency.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What is your answer

25   to their Batson analogy?

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1                MR. KATYAL:       Batson I think supports exactly

2    what we are saying, which is this Court has said we

3    don't review on rational basis, actions by a prosecutor

4    that are motivated, strikes that are motivated by the

5    trial, that are -- that are for a good trial; but if the

6    rationale of the prosecutor is I don't like the disabled

7    person, or I don't like --

8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, but you're

9    adding the class aspect.        If the rationale of the

10   prosecutor is, I don't like this person, under Batson

11   you don't get to bring an equal protection challenge to

12   that.

13               MR. KATYAL:       I don't quite think that this

14   Court has confronted that specific issue about whether

15   it's an individual class-of one juror case.                But the

16   language of Batson says that we don't --                that this

17   Court won't review on rational basis a claim when it's

18   related to the government's motivation.                They are to

19   have a fair trial, a good trial.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought if you have a

21   peremptory challenge it means that you can't challenge

22   on any basis other than the group -- the groups that

23   Batson has recognized.      You - you said you could

24   challenge a peremptory, exercise a peremptory challenge

25   if it's unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury.

1                Well, I thought that a peremptory, outside

2    of the class cases, is matter of the prosecutor or the

3    defense attorney don't like this juror.

4                MR. KATYAL:       Justice Ginsburg, the language

5    in Batson and J.E.B. was qualified by as saying so long

6    as it related to the task at hand; and the Seventh

7    Circuit and indeed, the D.C. Circuit last year referred

8    to that language and talked about an exemption if the

9    prosecute's motive was personal, as it is in this case.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Has there ever been a

11   challenge to the exercise of peremptory challenge on the

12   ground that the challenge was unrelated to the selection

13   of an impartial jury?

14               MR. KATYAL:       In the Seventh Circuit decision

15   the court said this would stay the cause of action.

16   This was after this Court's decision in J.E.B., yes.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

18   The case is submitted.

19               (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the

20   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
