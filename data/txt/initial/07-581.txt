 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8                 MR. SALVATORE:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10                 There are three reasons why this Court

11   should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on

12   collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum

13   selection clauses.

14                 First, the Second Circuit ignored section

15   (a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which

16   Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their

17   employees over anything germane to the working

18   environment, including methods of workplace dispute

19   resolution.

20                 The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard

21   falls squarely in that authority.                  Indeed, forbidding

22   unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an

23   arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the

24   labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and

25   deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's


                                          3

 1   national labor policy.

 2               Second, the Second Circuit failed to

 3   consider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace

 4   arbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301.

 5               Third, the Second Circuit erroneously and

 6   exclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver.

 7   Gardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not

 8   about enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory

 9   claim.

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Mr. Salvatore, you take the

11   position that the only thing that is at stake here is

12   simply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum.

13               What do you -- what do you say to the

14   argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the

15   collective bargaining agreement the employee is subject

16   not merely to the right of the union to choose the

17   arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim

18   at all?   What -- what is your answer to that?

19               MR. SALVATORE:          Your Honor, in -- in our

20   collective bargaining agreement, the collective

21   bargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the

22   employee tenders the claim to the union.                And in the

23   majority of cases the -- the employee and the union's

24   interests will be aligned, and the --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But here it wasn't.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.       What -- what --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Here we are dealing with

 3   claims that the union said:              Sorry, we are not going to

 4   process these claims because we have some tension since

 5   the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent

 6   them.

 7                 So you are proposing, as far as I understand

 8   it, a situation where these workers would have no

 9   individual right at all if the union says:                  We -- we

10   won't represent you.

11                 MR. SALVATORE:         No, Your Honor.        The -- the

12   clause requires all claims to be arbitrated, and "all

13   claims" means that the individuals then have to go to

14   arbitration with their private counsel in this case and

15   -- and have their claims heard in the arbitral forum.

16   So that no one is denying --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Where does -- where does

18   the contract say anything about the -- the individual

19   succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the

20   union and the employer?

21                 MR. SALVATORE:         Your Honor, I'm looking at

22   the petition appendix.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought that only --

24   only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an

25   individual.

 1              MR. SALVATORE:          No, Your Honor.         That's --

 2   that's not the -- the way the contract reads.                I'm

 3   looking at the petition appendix page 48a, which is the

 4   "no discrimination" clause.

 5              And just -- just as a quick prelude to --

 6   before I -- I go through that language, I just want to

 7   -- to note that this argument that these employees were

 8   not bound to go individually to arbitration was never

 9   raised below.

10              The Second Circuit did not consider it.

11   Indeed, the Second Circuit found that the clause covered

12   these employees, and -- and this only came up in the

13   Respondents' brief in this Court after cert was granted,

14   the red brief.

15              So that this -- this argument is one that

16   the factual premises for were never considered below in

17   the district court or in -- in the court of appeals.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Just so I'm clear --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I don't -- I don't wish to

20   delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the

21   decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the

22   background the consideration of the -- that the -- the

23   potentiality that the union might do just what it did

24   here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our

25   decision on the question that you are presenting.

 1              Now, whether or not it's properly raised

 2   here, I do agree with you it comes rather late.                   But

 3   isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?

 4              MR. SALVATORE:          Yes, Your Honor.            And --

 5   and, indeed, the collective bargaining agreements --and

 6   we'll look at the language in one second -- are -- are,

 7   as this Court has recognized, a little more complicated

 8   to understand than -- than average contracts.                   You have

 9   to look at the practice and the custom.

10              The practice here for this union has been to

11   turn over claims to the individuals.                   We've had this

12   clause in place for nine years.             The New York courts

13   have enforced it repeatedly and -- and --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is this included in the

15   question presented anyway?

16              MR. SALVATORE:          It was -- it was not, Your

17   Honor.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Does it have anything to do

19   with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?

20              MR. SALVATORE:          It does not, Your Honor.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             The Second Circuit simply

22   said you could not deprive an individual of the right to

23   a court trial.

24              MR. SALVATORE:          Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And the issue is whether --


                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   now, if -- if we held that you can require the

 2   individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we

 3   could confront the question of whether, if the union is

 4   in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the

 5   individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal,

 6   that would invalidate it.

 7                But it has nothing to do with the question

 8   presented:     Is an arbitration clause which clearly and

 9   unmistakably waives the union member's right to a

10   judicial forum enforceable.

11                MR. SALVATORE:           Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

12   That is my argument with respect to why this does not

13   need to be taken up now.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:              I -- I hate to get into

15   this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the

16   union and -- and the employees.

17                MR. SALVATORE:           There is no factual record,

18   Your Honor, for it in the record at all.                  And --

19                JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, there is at least

20   some.   The collective bargaining agreement is in here.

21   And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to

22   decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit

23   was correct.

24                The question is posed in generalities, but

25   we are not going to decide the general question in total

 1   ignorance of this case.          And in this case we've got the

 2   particular collective bargaining agreement in front of

 3   us, and you started to answer the question that -- that

 4   I and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the "no

 5   discrimination" clause.

 6                 MR. SALVATORE:          Yes, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             And will -- will you go on

 8   to that?

 9                 MR. SALVATORE:          I will.             The clause is -- I

10   am looking at petition appendix 48a, the "no

11   discrimination" clause.          This is the -- the clause at

12   issue in this case.       It covers any present or future

13   employee.     It goes on to state the -- the types of

14   protected characteristics that are covered by this

15   clause as well as the -- the relevant statutes

16   incorporating statutory law, public law, in the -- in

17   the clause.

18                 And then in the second-to-last sentence five

19   lines up from the bottom it states:                       "All such claims

20   shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration

21   procedure, Articles 5 and 6, as the sole and exclusive

22   remedy for violations."

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             What does that mean?          Does

24   that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the

25   union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so

 1   insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?

 2              MR. SALVATORE:             What this means, Justice

 3   Scalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court.

 4   They have to go either through the union, as has been

 5   the practice here, or the union will turn the claim over

 6   to them and let them go by themselves.

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Where did we get this

 8   phrase -- where do we get the language "or the union

 9   will turn over to them"?           The only thing that I can see

10   in here that addresses that is on page 46a.                   And the --

11   the clause there reads:          "All union claims are brought

12   by the union alone, and no individual shall have the

13   right to compromise or settle any claim without the

14   written permission of the union."

15              There is -- there is a lot of gray area in

16   that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the

17   union has total control over any claim, including an

18   arbitration claim.

19              And that seems to lend some substance to the

20   -- to the point made by the other side that if we accept

21   your position here, we are accepting a position not

22   nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural

23   designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in

24   fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory

25   Federal right is also being ceded.                   Now, why doesn't

 1   that language from section 46 support that?

 2                MR. SALVATORE:         Your Honor, it does not

 3   support it for the -- for the following reason.                    The --

 4   the section 30 clause on page 48a.                 The "no

 5   discrimination" clause, was added in 1999.                    It was added

 6   after the Court's decision in Wright.                    It was added to

 7   comply with Wright.     That's an undisputed fact.

 8                It -- it was added as a separate section

 9   with a separate arbitration promise because "all claims"

10   is broader than "union claims."              "Union claims" was

11   something that goes back for 75 years, but before we put

12   in section 30 --

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, then, "all such

14   claims" -- "such claims" refers among other things to

15   the statutory right.

16                MR. SALVATORE:         That's correct.

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:           And if the statutory right

18   is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement

19   and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration

20   agreement, then it follows that the union has got

21   ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory

22   right.

23                MR. SALVATORE:         No, Your Honor, not unless

24   -- not if the union turns that over.                    The employee's

25   reading --

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Where -- where is the

 2   guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want

 3   to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has

 4   the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to

 5   sue?   Where do you find that?

 6                MR. SALVATORE:          Your Honor, that -- that

 7   right is -- is described from this language, "all such

 8   claims."    There is another route.               What Articles 4, 5,

 9   and 6 describe is that -- that the -- you must go to the

10   office of the contract arbitrator, and it doesn't

11   specify whether you go with the union or you go by

12   yourself.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:          Has any court decided this

14   issue of the interpretation of the collective bargaining

15   agreement in this particular.

16                MR. SALVATORE:          No court has decided this

17   very issue like this, Justice Alito.                     But what the New

18   York courts have said is in interpreting this clause

19   over the last nine years, that they compel the

20   individual union member to go to arbitration when they

21   have brought claims in court in violation of this

22   clause.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Salvatore, I -- I

 1   particular contract, which is not an issue of national

 2   importance.    Why -- why must we decide the case here?

 3                 Could we not simply decide that the Second

 4   Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would

 5   be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you

 6   cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining

 7   agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of

 8   Title VII claims?    Why couldn't we just decide that?

 9                 And then if there is any issue of whether

10   such concession to the union deprives an individual of

11   even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be

12   decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?

13                 MR. SALVATORE:         Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the Second Circuit

15   could look into all of these details.

16                 MR. SALVATORE:         Absolutely.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And inquire into the New

18   York law that you're talking about now and that I don't

19   recall being in any of the briefing.

20                 MR. SALVATORE:         Justice Scalia, as cited in

21   our briefing, there is a long footnote listing the

22   cases.   But -- but you're right, the -- the issue here

23   really is can the union agree to this?                   And that goes to

24   Congress's giving the union the power under section 9(a)

25   of the National Labor Relations Act to be the exclusive

 1   bargaining representative --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I ask you -- let me ask you

 3   a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a

 4   misunderstanding.     But my understanding is that suppose

 5   you are -- you are an employee.                You believe your

 6   employer discriminated against you, say, on gender

 7   grounds.   You have to go to the EEOC.

 8                 Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often

 9   what they do is they don't really resolve it.                   They just

10   give you a letter that gives you a right to sue.

11                 So here Congress was so worried about this

12   kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you

13   know, won't be the bottom line.                People will go there

14   and then they have a right to sue later.

15                 Now, that's how Congress felt about this

16   particular statute.       Why would they want the union to be

17   the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself

18   hasn't agreed?     I mean, the employee might agree in the

19   first place.     He might say I'm going to take that

20   letter, I'm not going to bring my suit.                   That's up to

21   him or her.    But here the employee wants to bring her

22   suit, just like the EEOC letter.

23                 MR. SALVATORE:          Well, Justice Breyer, the

24   ADEA provides not only a right to go to court after

25   you've gotten your right-to-sue letter or waited 60

 1   days, but -- but it also provides multiple, as this

 2   court recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that

 3   Congress wants to use:      Conciliation, persuasion,

 4   conference --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            Exactly.         That's my point,

 6   is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable

 7   effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass

 8   and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to

 9   court probably can do it.         It's not definite.           The EEOC

10   doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right

11   to sue, but probably can do it.

12              And if that's a situation where you have

13   this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is

14   a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the

15   union and the employer together to be able to cut that

16   right to sue off, at least not very easily.

17              MR. SALVATORE:          Justice Breyer, you have

18   competing policies here because you have the policies of

19   the labor laws which say that unions should have a -- a

20   broad portfolio of -- of topics to bargain about.                 This

21   Court has said that anything germane to the working

22   environment, dispute resolution mechanisms --

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the union could not

24   bargain about these anti-discrimination rights.                 These

25   are rights given to individuals by Congress.                 The union


                                      15

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   couldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about

 2   collective rights, the way it bargains about wages and

 3   hours and -- and other things.                This is, this is not a

 4   bargainable right.      This is a right Congress says you as

 5   an individual have a right not to be discriminated

 6   against.    This is nothing that the union can bargain

 7   about.

 8                MR. SALVATORE:           Justice Ginsburg, I agree to

 9   the degree we're talking about -- you're talking about

10   substantive rights.       What we are talking about here is a

11   procedural switch.      As this Court has approved in

12   Gilmer, what we are talking about is moving the forum

13   from the judicial one to the -- to the arbitral one.

14   And here in the -- the scheme of a collective bargaining

15   agreement where arbitration is the preferred remedy and

16   has been used for many, many years very successfully in

17   the -- in the -- by those parties.

18                It's -- it's taking employment arbitration

19   and putting it in the collective bargaining context.

20   And -- and there is, unions do this in many different

21   ways.    Unions bargain about substantive rights.                    We are

22   not talking about substantive rights here, though.                      We

23   are talking about procedural rights.                      And the policies

24   of the labor laws are served and the policies of the

25   ADEA and the anti-discrimination statutes are not

 1   disserved in any way.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Salvatore, would you --

 3   would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that

 4   says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union

 5   arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate

 6   it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on

 7   his own?

 8              MR. SALVATORE:           That's -- that's the

 9   practice under this agreement, Your Honor.                 We would --

10   we would wholeheartedly endorse that -- that rule

11   because, that's the practice here.                 And there is -- when

12   you're talking about statutory rights, why would the

13   union want to interfere with the ability of the employee

14   to get a forum if their interests are not aligned?                 This

15   goes to the tension that this Court has -- has

16   recognized in its prior cases.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, that -- that means

18   that if there is z totally frivolous claim and the

19   employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going

20   to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to

21   then proceed?   The employer hasn't gotten very much.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             He has got an arbitration

23   instead of a lawsuit.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If you would -- if you

25   would answer the question.          The employer hasn't gotten


                                       17

 1   very --

 2              (Laughter.)

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- very much for the

 4   bargain.

 5              MR. SALVATORE:          Justice Kennedy, the

 6   employer has gotten arbitration and --

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In the hard cases.

 8              MR. SALVATORE:          Well, in --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it hasn't got the

10   ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous

11   claims.

12              MR. SALVATORE:          Well that's true.    The

13   union -- the union wouldn't play that function, except

14   that we have in this industry, the real estate industry

15   in New York City, a longstanding relationship that --

16   that goes back decades.       And -- and -- so it's a mature

17   collective bargaining arrange -- arrangement.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm

19   not sure that employers nationwide would -- would --

20   would accept -- would accept that view.

21              MR. SALVATORE:          Well, I think that --

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And again, maybe that's --

23   that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case.

24              MR. SALVATORE:          Well, one of the issues

25   that -- that Congress allows the bargaining parties to


                                      18
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   figure out is what the scope of their collective

 2   bargaining arrangement should be.                That's one of the

 3   hallmarks of the NRLA.       So, yes, some collective

 4   bargaining parties may make that choice, Justice

 5   Kennedy; others may make a different choice.

 6               What is the alternative here?                The

 7   alternative is that employers can bypass the union.

 8   They can just go around the union and -- and have

 9   individual Gilmer agreements signed up.                 That's what the

10   D.C. Circuit said en banc in -- in -- in the ALPA Pilots

11   case.

12               And indeed, the -- the union in that case

13   was arguing the position that we are arguing here, that

14   this is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and this is

15   right in the union's portfolio of -- of what they should

16   be using to -- to bargain with the employer because it's

17   a procedural right and there are no substantive outcomes

18   that are diminished in any way whatsoever.

19               Unions are deemed trustworthy enough to

20   bring lawsuits in the federal courts on behalf of their

21   members.   Under principles of associational standing,

22   associational standing, the members are bound by

23   their -- their union's actions.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And nonmembers, too?

25   What about the people who -- who are not members of the


                                       19

 1   union, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the

 2   union's services in collective bargaining?                They would

 3   be bound as well?     They couldn't --

 4                 MR. SALVATORE:          Absolutely, Justice

 5   Ginsburg.     The -- the -- the -- and this type of service

 6   is one of the core functions that an agency payer would

 7   have to pay for.     The LM2 that 32B, the local, filed

 8   here on behalf of 80,000 employees has two agency fee

 9   payers out of 80,000.        So it's not really an issue in

10   this case.

11                 But that's what unions are for.             When

12   Congress makes them the exclusive bargaining

13   representative you're -- you're in for it one way or the

14   other.     You're -- you're -- either you're in or you're

15   out.     And if you're in, then you have to go along with

16   the -- the -- the entire collective bargaining deal that

17   is made --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You said -- the -- fine.

19                 I -- I grasp your answer to that.             But you

20   said that the employee would have the absolute right if

21   the union says, "sorry, for whatever reason we can't

22   represent you," absolute right to that arbitral forum.

23   What -- who pays then?

24                 I mean, if the union is in it, then the

25   union and the employer are going to split -- split the


                                         20

 1   cost.    But what happens when the union drops out and you

 2   have the individual and the employer in this arbitral

 3   forum?

 4                MR. SALVATORE:           In -- in this situation the

 5   employer pays.     That's the only -- the Office of the

 6   Contract Arbitrator is an -- essentially a mini-

 7   American Arbitration Association that these parties have

 8   set up, and the -- the RAB, which is the multi- employer

 9   organization that represents all the real estate

10   employers in -- in New York, they pay for the

11   arbitration, because the union in this case has said we

12   are not going to pay.

13                As you point out rightly, if the union is

14   not involved, they -- they shouldn't pay.                 So there is

15   no cost to the employee for that arbitration and -- and

16   as Justice Edwards said in the D.C. Circuit Kohl case,

17   that -- that that procedure is -- is a fair one, to have

18   the employer pick up the -- the costs given -- given the

19   -- the balance between the -- the two of them.

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Salvatore, are you

21   going to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver

22   before you're all through?

23                MR. SALVATORE:           Yes -- yes, Your Honor,

24   Justice Stevens.    Gardner-Denver is -- is a case, as

25   this Court has described, that -- that didn't involve


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate.           The

 2   Gardner-Denver line of cases, McDonald and Barrentine

 3   and Gardner-Denver, had the quite different issue as

 4   this Court said in Gilmer, of whether a contract-based

 5   claim precludes subsequent judicial resolution of a

 6   statutory claim; and so that distinguishes the rule.

 7   But factually these cases are very different as -- as

 8   well.

 9               Mr. Alexander in Alexander v.

10   Gardner-Denver, the contract there, the collective

11   bargaining agreement, had a plain vanilla arbitration

12   clause.   It didn't have a clause like the one we looked

13   at page, petition appendix 48a, that incorporated all

14   the -- the statutes and gave the arbitrator the power to

15   sit and -- and to apply those statutes and apply the law

16   under those statutes and apply the remedies that derive

17   from those statutes.        In that case, the arbitrator sat

18   as the proctor of the bargain between the collective

19   bargaining parties, and didn't have that broad

20   authority, as this Court has -- has recognized.

21               And -- and we agree that arbitration that --

22   that resolves just a collective bargaining agreement

23   claim should not be dispositive of a statutory claim.

24   They're fish and fowl.         So that Gardner-Denver is

25   correctly decided.      Gardner-Denver puts out the rule for


                                         22

 1   -- for that situation.        This is a different situation

 2   that we are talking about.

 3              And -- and here, unlike in Gardner-Denver,

 4   where Mr. Alexander would have had no access to the --

 5   to have his Title VII claim heard if this Court had

 6   affirmed the Tenth Circuit, he -- the door to the

 7   courthouse would have been shut in that case for

 8   Mr. Alexander -- here we are trying to move to compel

 9   arbitration so that there is a forum, and -- and that

10   these individuals -- these employees --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:              But not a judicial -- not

12   a judicial forum.

13              MR. SALVATORE:            An arbitral forum, Your

14   Honor.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Salvatore, would you

16   just clarify something for me?               I thought that the union

17   ceded its rights to the employees and said that they

18   could use this collective bargaining agreement's

19   arbitral regime so long as they paid for it.                    But you

20   tell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer

21   pays everything.

22              MR. SALVATORE:            That's -- that's correct.

23   That's the union counsel's affidavit.                    He was saying he

24   doesn't -- the union doesn't want to pick up the costs,

25   Justice Ginsburg, but the collective bargaining

 1   agreement says there is two payers in the Office of the

 2   Contract Arbitrator, the RAB and the union.                 If the

 3   union is not paying, then the RAB has to pay.

 4               Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the

 5   rest of my time for rebuttal, please.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10               MR. FREDERICK:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

11   Justice, and may it please the Court:

12               The Second Circuit's judgment should be

13   affirmed for three reasons.            First, a collective

14   bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control

15   over workers' grievances.          Second, unions have inherent

16   conflicts of interest with respect to individual

17   statutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions

18   lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual

19   workers' substantive ADEA rights.

20               With respect to the first point, a

21   collective bargaining agreement generally gives the

22   union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances

23   on behalf of workers and how such grievances are

24   pursued.   In such circumstances -- which is this case,

25   the workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to

 1   arbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to

 2   satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively

 3   vindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination

 4   rights.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:           Under your first point, are

 6   you saying it's impossible for there to be a collective

 7   bargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore

 8   reads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective

 9   bargaining agreement which says that the union's -- that

10   the grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done

11   either by the union, or if the union declines to pursue

12   it, by the individual employee?

13              MR. FREDERICK:           Justice Alito, I've looked

14   comprehensively through the cases.                 We've never found a

15   collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of

16   interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case.

17   Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective

18   bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the

19   rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to

20   vindicate that?   I would acknowledge it's theoretically

21   possible, but it has to be done within the confines of

22   whether there is actual consent by the individual to the

23   arbitration, whether the individual has control over the

24   mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the

25   structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates

 1   the individual's substantive rights.

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:            But there is nothing in

 3   Federal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of

 4   a collective bargaining agreement like that.

 5              MR. FREDERICK:            Nothing except this Court's

 6   case in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may

 7   not bargain away an individual's rights where there

 8   would be a conflict between the union's interests and

 9   the individual's.     Here, because this is a

10   discrimination claim, unions are often brought as

11   defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances

12   as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that

13   gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by

14   these workers.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Even in a case in which you

16   don't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of

17   argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or

18   the conflict issue.      I understood you elsewhere to be

19   arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing,

20   intelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose

21   a collective bargaining agreement will never include.

22   So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of

23   your argument that in any -- in any case in which

24   arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a

25   right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer --


                                        26

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there would have to be, not merely the collective

 2   bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the

 3   employee to -- to go ahead and do that.                 Is that right?

 4              MR. FREDERICK:           That -- that's correct.           And

 5   that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential

 6   here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito.                 Because in

 7   Gilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be

 8   such individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself,

 9   and knowing and individual waiver is necessary before

10   the person can waive the substantive ADEA rights.                   That

11   would need to be part of the hypothetical collective

12   bargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice

13   Alito.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Right.

15              JUSTICE ALITO:           Would that mean --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Go ahead.

17              JUSTICE ALITO:           Would that mean that the

18   employer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration

19   requirement on employees?

20              MR. FREDERICK:           I think that would follow,

21   as that would be a condition of employment that could

22   not be imposed.   The airline --

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It wouldn't be

24   unilaterally imposing, right?             He would say if you're

25   going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that


                                       27

 1   could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual

 2   employee.     And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole

 3   benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't

 4   happen.     You say, well, the employer has a lot of

 5   leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would

 6   not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the

 7   individual and the company.

 8                 MR. FREDERICK:          That's correct, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, but there are two different points at which the

10   condition of employment arose.                I understood the

11   questions on this side to be after the agreement had

12   taken place and the worker was already on the work site.

13   Under your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance

14   to the work force and is asked, "will you sign this,"

15   there is individual consent in that circumstance.                That

16   is the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the one thing that's

18   uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective

19   bargaining agreement alone can never subject the

20   employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?

21                 MR. FREDERICK:          That's -- that's how we read

22   this Court's statutory --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is also true -- is that

24   also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of

25   suit?

 1               MR. FREDERICK:           Sorry.         With an ordinary --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             A tort suit.      It says, some

 3   -- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not

 4   concerned with discrimination; we are concerned with

 5   workplace safety.     Somebody is hurt as a result of

 6   machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate

 7   notice or so forth.      Is your view the same there?

 8               MR. FREDERICK:           Well, I think that those

 9   category of cases do stand in a different position

10   because there is less of an inherent conflict of

11   interest.   The union there --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:             Why?

13               MR. FREDERICK:           Well, the union is not going

14   to be the Defendant typically in a tort case where the

15   employer is responsible.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:             Doesn't this allow

17   discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination

18   by the employer?

19               MR. FREDERICK:           It refers to discrimination,

20   and as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are

21   provisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are

22   specifically directed at union discrimination.                 The

23   legislative history of these statutes indicates that

24   discrimination by unions was one of the concerns

25   animating Congress --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:               Now, you say section 30

 2   doesn't say anything about union discrimination

 3   particularly; it just talks about discrimination.

 4              MR. FREDERICK:             Yes.       In fact --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:               Fine.       So you think

 6   sometimes unions do discriminate?

 7              MR. FREDERICK:             And that's why --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:               All right.           And sometimes

 9   unions also would rather have the more effective machine

10   or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to

11   read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can

12   replicate anything you might think.                       We can think of

13   tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and

14   employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of

15   discrimination suits.        Most unions don't want

16   discrimination.     I mean, most of the time.                    And most

17   unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time.

18              So if I decide for you in this case, am I

19   also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort

20   suits or contract suits or just whether or not the

21   workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites?

22   I mean, you know?

23              MR. FREDERICK:             I think, Justice Breyer,

24   that the discrimination cases do stand in a different

25   category because of the inherent conflict of the --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:               That's the only reason?

 2   Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason

 3   why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that

 4   I see no more reason today why a union would like

 5   discrimination, then I can see a reason why they would

 6   like a dangerous machine?

 7              MR. FREDERICK:             I don't think Congress --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:               If I think that, then I

 9   should decide against you?

10              MR. FREDERICK:             Well, no, because there are

11   two other reasons:      The exclusive control over the

12   machinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper.

13              I'm not aware of tort suits being subjects

14   of collective bargaining, Justice Breyer.                 Nor am I

15   aware of cases in which the unions have given up

16   individuals' tort claims in situations, principally

17   because unions are not the persons against whom such

18   tort suits are brought.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, but those -- I'm

20   sorry.

21              Those examples are examples.                   You're getting

22   down to individual cases.            I thought you drew the global

23   line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's

24   question by saying the -- in the cases that we're

25   talking about here, Congress has passed a statute giving

 1   a specific individual right and that individual right

 2   cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in

 3   violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the

 4   global line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at

 5   the individual situation rather than draw a categorical

 6   line.

 7                MR. FREDERICK:         Yes, you would, but the

 8   principles this Court has applied in looking at that

 9   broad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be

10   situations in which those principles, where the union is

11   serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person

12   to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context,

13   to be not --

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I agree with you, but I

15   think -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's

16   mouth --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           Very helpful of you.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But I thought what he was

19   getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to

20   have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has

21   in effect a tort claim which is subject to an

22   arbitration clause?

23                MR. FREDERICK:         And the answer is no.     I

24   thought --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           Then I replicate my

 1   question because what I'm thinking is simply that there

 2   are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims

 3   that people go to arbitration over.                    And what I'm

 4   wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of

 5   such claims that I have now said that a union, through a

 6   collective bargaining contract, can force the employee

 7   against his will to go to arbitration over?                    I don't

 8   have a feeling for that from the briefs.                    I don't have a

 9   feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims

10   are special in that regard, that there's no line in that

11   regard, or that there's some other line.

12              MR. FREDERICK:          Well, Justice Breyer, I

13   think that your question really is getting at the theory

14   behind collective bargaining agreements and what extent

15   the union can exercise control over the individual

16   rights and circumstances of employment.                   That question

17   is a very complex question over which many, many --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, can you give me a

19   hint as to the principle?

20              (Laughter.)

21              MR. FREDERICK:          I -- well, I think that

22   there are limits, of course, on the union's authority

23   that have been recognized in this Court's decisions, and

24   I don't think that ruling in the workers' favor in this

25   circumstance opens up any kind of Pandora's box at all,

 1   because all we are arguing for is that the

 2   Gardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court

 3   unanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of

 4   the land, as the Court has reaffirmed --

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:          What if a collective

 6   bargaining agreement requires the arbitration of

 7   discrimination claims that are not based on Federal law?

 8   Maybe they are based on -- they are based on State law

 9   that goes further than Federal law, or maybe they are

10   based on a type of discrimination that's prohibited

11   neither by Federal or State law.              Maybe it's

12   discrimination against young people under 40.              Could

13   those be -- those would still be discrimination claims

14   with the same potential for -- with a potential for a

15   conflict of interest.     Could they be subjected to

16   mandatory arbitration?

17              MR. FREDERICK:          I -- I think that is a

18   harder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer

19   under this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points

20   the way here, in footnote 19 of the decision.              Where the

21   union controls that process and where the union is a

22   potential defendant in that circumstance, the workers'

23   individual rights cannot be subordinated --

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about --

25              MR. FREDERICK:          -- to the union's control.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             --     if it's not a

 2   statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge?                    One

 3   practical problem is so often these are overlapping

 4   claims.   You can say, "I was discriminated against

 5   before because of my age.          I was arbitrarily

 6   discriminated against.       It was a wrongful discharge.                  It

 7   was a discharge without just cause."                    Usually, there's

 8   multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would

 9   be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I

10   mean if it was just a question of the worker says, "I

11   was discharged without just cause," no Title 7 or

12   anything else, that would come under the arbitration

13   clause, wouldn't it?

14               MR. FREDERICK:          Yes, and I think that there

15   have been conditions of employment and discharge that

16   have been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a --

17   an issue there where -- except where that intersection

18   with the statutory discrimination rights occurs.                   And

19   Congress has made a different policy judgment with

20   respect to individual waivers of such rights in --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why has it?         Why has it?     I

22   mean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is

23   that he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two

24   months.   Now, you can't take away my right to that

25   unless I voluntarily waived it.              What is sacrosanct

 1   about the fact that my grievance here has some

 2   discrimination attached to it?

 3                Your briefing talks as though it is

 4   something totally apart from a mere economic right.

 5   Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about

 6   economics.   "I was fired because of discrimination."         "I

 7   wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore

 8   I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of

 9   money."

10                Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the

11   employee would have to go through the union-prescribed

12   arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the

13   last three months but does not have to do it for an

14   economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?

15                MR. FREDERICK:         Well, I'm not sure actually

16   in answering your hypothetical that they would

17   necessarily have to go through the union on the

18   nonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case.

19   This Court in Barrentine said that, where an FSLA claim

20   is at issue, the worker does not -- is not confined or

21   precluded after arbitrating at the union grievance

22   process from bringing an FLSA suit in court.

23                So I want to reserve, accepting all of your

24   hypothetical, Justice Scalia, but in further answer to

25   the point, I think it's important to keep in mind that

 1   in the discrimination context, you're talking about more

 2   than just money.     Here my clients are older workers who

 3   are forced into more physically strenuous positions that

 4   they had gotten away from by virtue of their growth in

 5   seniority at the building.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, isn't that

 7   kind of conflict always present whenever you have

 8   collective action?      I mean, you may be a particularly

 9   good worker and could demand a higher wage than the

10   union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the

11   collective bargaining agreement.                 That happens in every

12   situation where you have collective action.

13              MR. FREDERICK:             Certainly, Mr. Chief

14   Justice, but where Congress has made a choice that

15   individual claims for individual anti-discrimination

16   rights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and

17   where this Court's --

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, they don't

19   have to be vindicated in particular ways.                   The

20   individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and

21   they would be -- the arbitration would be binding.

22              MR. FREDERICK:             Certainly, but there is

23   individual consent in that circumstance.                   I would like

24   to make a couple of other points before closing.

25   One is that on pages 4 to 5 in the brief in opposition

 1   to cert we specifically raise the issue that the union

 2   controls the arbitration, and there is no opportunity

 3   for individual arbitration under this collective

 4   bargaining agreement.

 5              There is nothing in the provision set out in

 6   the petition appendix that gives individual rights, the

 7   individuals the right to arbitrate under this collective

 8   bargaining agreement.       The payment provision calls for

 9   50 percent by the employer and 50 percent by the

10   employee with the employer having the sole right to

11   terminate the arbitrator for any or no reason at all.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:              You did raise that issue,

13   but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue

14   was that you win.    You said the consequence of the fact

15   that that issue was involved in this case was a good

16   reason not to -- for us to accept cert.                  And we didn't

17   take your advice on that.

18              MR. FREDERICK:            Well --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              But it's a totally

20   different issue whether because of that question you --

21   you should -- you should win the case.

22              MR. FREDERICK:            Certainly, the

23   interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is

24   fairly included within the question presented.                  And as

25   this Court found in Wright in a situation where it


                                        38
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   granted certiorari on the very same question here but

 2   then looked at the specific provisions of the collective

 3   bargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under

 4   the facts there a different rule applied for a clear and

 5   unambiguous waiver.

 6              All we are saying here is that under this

 7   provision there is no opportunity for the individual to

 8   arbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to

 9   the one that is in Wright.          We think that is fairly

10   included within the question presented, and that the

11   Court can affirm on that basis, certainly where the

12   Second Circuit had relied on precedent that said that

13   where the individual doesn't have a right, that it is

14   union control of arbitration.             That is consistent with

15   Gardner-Denver.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             It doesn't have to be

17   within the question presented.              You -- you can sustain

18   the judgment below on any ground.

19              MR. FREDERICK:           Well, I think that --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:             The only question is

21   whether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire

22   into new ground.   That's all.

23              MR. FREDERICK:           My only point is that this

24   is one of these fuzzy areas where we are not making

25   independent, alternate ground of affirmance.              I think


                                       39

 1   our argument is fairly included within the question

 2   presented and can be affirmed on the basis of that

 3   argument.

 4                If the court has no further questions --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the argument

 6   that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting

 7   the employee to a worse situation because the employer

 8   will simply say:    Fine, I don't have to bargain anything

 9   with the union.    If you want to work in this workplace,

10   you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no

11   access to the court, and you have to -- just like in

12   Gilmer, just like in Circuit City.

13                MR. FREDERICK:          Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

14   guess I would answer that question by saying we will pay

15   our money and take our chances in the sense that the

16   unions here are supporting the workers where the unions

17   are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of

18   interest, and the question of whether or not imposing

19   arbitration on the individual workers would be a

20   condition of employment.          That is a question that you

21   can safely leave for another day.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, they may go

23   the other way.    They may say:            Look, we don't like to

24   arbitrate.   In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit

25   to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these

 1   claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees.

 2                 Most of them like the idea that the union is

 3   going to stand up for them and take it to management,

 4   but they could say:       Look, we don't want it.                If -- if

 5   you are discriminated against, you know, sue us.

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:          Mr. Chief Justice, in fact,

 7   empirically that is not correct.                 There is a study that

 8   is cited in a footnote in one of the amicus briefs that

 9   arbitration is more expensive than bringing civil

10   litigation.     And it is because the -- under -- under

11   their provision if you pay 50 percent of the

12   arbitrator's costs, you can run up quite a big tab that

13   you would not have to pay --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But under my

15   scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for

16   arbitration.     There would be -- there would be no

17   arbitration at all.

18                 MR. FREDERICK:          Well, under your scenario, I

19   think where the employer would control the arbitral

20   process, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his

21   bread.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.    There is no

23   arbitration.     The employer says:              Look, I don't think I

24   discriminate.     I've got a good record.                  I'm not going to

25   agree to arbitrate claims.            I'm going to make people go

 1   to court because there will be fewer claims brought.

 2                MR. FREDERICK:           And -- and that has been the

 3   law for 30 years, and we think it should continue to be

 4   the law, Mr. Chief Justice.

 5                If the marketplace is going to help weed out

 6   those claims, that's certainly the province of lawyers

 7   taking these cases and clients deciding whether or not

 8   to tell everybody to --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But the point is

10   there are benefits to employees from arbitration as

11   well.

12                MR. FREDERICK:           Certainly --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  The employer may not

14   agree to it.     If he doesn't have any protection, if it

15   doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to

16   court, what's the -- what's the point?

17                MR. FREDERICK:           That's why this Court has

18   always said that individual consent and agreement is a

19   fundamental precept of arbitration.                       Where that

20   agreement is absent, a worker should not be forced.

21   Thank you.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

23   Mr. Frederick.

 1              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 2                       AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 3                  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 4              MR. GANNON:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 5   please the Court:     Respondents' fundamental right to a

 6   workplace free of invidious, class-based discrimination

 7   is something their union has no power to barter away in

 8   collective bargaining, and the union --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:               I -- I just want to be sure

10   that at some point you answer this question, if you can.

11              I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us,

12   as I see it, is just what you said:                       When can a union

13   require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a

14   court case in an instance where the union member has not

15   signed a special waiver?           That's the question, right?

16   Okay.

17              And what I think some of us were struggling

18   for here is:   If we say yes to you they can force them,

19   or no to you they can't, what's the principle?

20              Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend

21   to think they can force the worker into arbitration is

22   where the right grows out of the collective bargaining

23   agreement, period.

24              Then we have what we were talking about with

25   Justice Souter, a common law tort claim.                       Then we might


                                         43
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have a State law giving a claim.                 Then we might have a

 2   Federal law like this one giving a claim.

 3              And we just heard -- I would assume if

 4   Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response

 5   was, which was the FSLA:           Oh, well, maybe we can't, you

 6   know, force the worker to give that one up either.

 7              So what is the line here that we are drawing

 8   with this case?     Is it a line that says discrimination

 9   laws, Federal or special?            Federal laws are special?

10   State laws are special?          Common law is special?

11   Collective bargaining, too?              What is the principle?

12              MR. GANNON:           Yes, Justice Breyer.        This

13   Court's cases have not yet described a specific law, and

14   --

15              JUSTICE BREYER:               That's why I am asking you

16   for the principle.

17              MR. GANNON:           I think that the -- the best

18   line that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver

19   and Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are

20   related to collective activity, and especially economic

21   activity, are the kinds of things that are normally

22   delegated to the union.          Those are the sorts of things

23   that the union can actually engage in collective

24   bargaining about.     And when the union negotiates the

25   underlying right, then it makes perfect sense that the


                                         44

 1   labor arbitration framework that's set forth here would

 2   continue to resolve disputes that are arising under --

 3   out of that specific right.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why -- why doesn't this

 5   come within that?

 6               MR. GANNON:         Because --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why don't many of these

 8   cases, if not most of them, come within that?                 The union

 9   negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the

10   person says:   I should be at this level.                The only

11   reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated

12   against.

13               MR. GANNON:         Well, I -- I think, Justice

14   Scalia --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You -- you call it a

16   non-economic theory.       Phooey, it's an economic case.

17               MR. GANNON:         But I think what's important,

18   Justice Scalia, is -- is, though -- is the line that the

19   Court stated in Barrentine:             That if a statute is

20   designed to give specific, minimum protection to

21   individual workers, then that's the sort of thing that

22   the union doesn't have the power to engage in collective

23   bargaining over.

24               And so your salary may well be something

25   that the union can normally bargain about.                 But if you


                                        45

 1   want to assert that the -- that the employer or the

 2   union -- because both are the types -- the types of

 3   entities that can be charged with discrimination under

 4   Title VII or the ADA or these other statutes -- the

 5   reason that they gave you a lower salary was on the

 6   basis of something for which you had a Federal statutory

 7   protection, then -- then you have an independent

 8   statutory right that the union's majoritarian

 9   decisionmaking processes should not be in the process of

10   controlling --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is not taking away the

12   right.     The -- the union is not taking away the right.

13   It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to

14   arbitration instead of to the courts.

15                 MR. GANNON:        Yes.       And the difference is

16   that the union is making the decision about where the

17   claim will be vindicated.            And in this case in

18   particular, the union is going to control whether the

19   claim will actually be able to be officially vindicated.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You have -- you have

21   focused on the fact that Congress has given individual

22   rights.    But for the many matters that you say are the

23   subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a

24   statute.     I don't need a statute to negotiate with

25   someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour

 1   for a particular job.      And, yet, that is something that

 2   you give up when you join the union, and you are subject

 3   to collective bargaining.

 4               MR. GANNON:        Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, why isn't it

 6   -- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights?

 7   Why aren't they subject to collective bargaining as

 8   well?

 9               MR. GANNON:        Well, I -- even the employer

10   here is not claiming that the underlying statutory right

11   is subject to collective bargaining.                   They are just

12   saying --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.    No.   I am --

14   the -- the forum for asserting the right.

15               MR. GANNON:        Well, in this instance Congress

16   gave individual employees the right to bring a civil

17   action in a judicial forum as a means of enforcing their

18   antidiscrimination claims.         And although arbitration may

19   always provide an alternative forum for that, this Court

20   has repeatedly made clear that arbitration is always a

21   matter of contract.     And it does not impose on the

22   employer any more than on the employee a requirement

23   that they arbitrate a claim when they --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why would any

25   employer want to agree to arbitration under this system?

 1   He gets nothing from it.         You said you get the ben -- to

 2   arbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.

 3               MR. GANNON:        Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

 4   don't think that that's true.             Since 1974, this has been

 5   the law of the land, and it's been even after Gilmer in

 6   every circuit --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That just begs the

 8   question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is

 9   correct.

10               MR. GANNON:        Well, it -- it is the

11   prevailing interpretation in every circuit that has

12   considered the question since Gilmer except the Fourth

13   Circuit.   And if you look at the empirical data that's

14   mentioned in some of amicus briefs, including the

15   particular amicus brief of the National Academy of

16   Arbitrators, it is true that even when there is just a

17   labor arbitration machinery that was invalid under the

18   terms of Gardner-Denver and would not be binding on the

19   employee if the employee happens to lose in that

20   arbitration, in most of those cases when the employee

21   loses that arbitration, he does not go on to file an

22   independent case in federal court.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Your position -- so

24   their position is going to hurt most employees, because

25   assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union

 1   gets something in return for agreeing to that.                  I don't

 2   know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree

 3   to arbitrate all these claims.               Well, you don't get that

 4   anymore, because and employer is not going to agree to

 5   arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to

 6   arbitrate.

 7                 MR. GANNON:       Well, we don't think that there

 8   is any reason why the employees will not be able to make

 9   a grievance with the employers, as was made possible in

10   Gilmer.   And so that the point is that it just can't be

11   a vicarious agreement to arbitration on behalf of the

12   individual.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, the employees

14   have no -- no leverage.         I mean, if the -- if the

15   employer wants to say, look, if you want to work here,

16   look, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees

17   don't have bargaining leverage.               That's the whole reason

18   you have a union.

19                 MR. GANNON:       Well, there was an argument in

20   Gilmer that they didn't have leverage, either.                  And the

21   Court stressed that as long as the employee has actually

22   agreed to it, that -- and -- and as long as the arbitral

23   forum is going to be adequate to provide for effective

24   vindication of the underlying statutory rights, then --

25   then the arbitral forum would be adequate.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose the employer did

 2   have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it

 3   tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration

 4   form, could the union in its collective bargaining

 5   negotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and

 6   that you shall not impose this obligation?

 7               MR. GANNON:        Well, that's -- as

 8   Mr. Frederick mentioned and is as discussed in several

 9   of the briefs, that's an undecided question of labor

10   law.   The National Labor Relations Board --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm asking in your view if

12   it came up to it, how would that be decided --

13               MR. GANNON:        Well --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Because I'm concerned it's

15   the same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just

16   don't think the employer is going to get very much under

17   this interpretation.      And that may, ultimately, hurt the

18   employee.

19               MR. GANNON:        We think that as long as the

20   employee have been -- have been able to indicate exactly

21   the same level of individual agreements that was upheld

22   in Gilmer and that the arbitral forum itself is going to

23   be adequate, that that takes care of that half of the

24   question.

25               The National Labor Relations Board which


                                       50
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   has -- which would be entitled to deference on this

 2   question and which has never spoken to the labor law

 3   question of what role the unions might be able to play

 4   in helping facilitate the agreements negotiated between

 5   the employers and the individual employees, it could

 6   come out in at least three different ways.

 7                One of them is the arrangement outlined in

 8   the Abbott D.C. Circuit decision that -- that

 9   Petitioners rely upon.        But, of course, that's an

10   instance where there were two completely separate

11   agreements that the employment arbitration was agreed to

12   by the employees before they are even represented by the

13   union.    It was at the outset of the establishment of the

14   employment relationship, which Mr. Frederick discusses.

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But doesn't it boil down --

16   doesn't your argument really boil down to this:             That

17   the only case in which it's really going to matter is

18   the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a

19   clause that gives the union plenary authority over the

20   disposition of the claim?           And I say that for this

21   reason.   If -- if this is outside the subject of

22   mandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it;

23   in effect, as a matter of individual contract.

24                If it's within the subject of mandatory

25   bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee


                                        51

 1   also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he

 2   is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only

 3   case in which it's going to make any difference as to

 4   whether you win or he wins is the case in which the

 5   agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union

 6   plenary authority to dispose of the claim.

 7                Isn't that correct?

 8                MR. GANNON:       Well, not necessarily, Justice

 9   Souter, because there are all sorts of other attributes

10   of the arbitral forum that might -- might well be

11   relevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to

12   effectively been -- rights.            In Gilmer itself, the Court

13   specifically considered whether the employee,

14   Mr. Gilmer, would have an opportunity to play a role in

15   selecting the arbitrator.

16                In this instance, even under Petitioner's

17   view of the CBA, which we don't think is supported by

18   the text of the CBA, this -- these employees are still

19   stuck with an arbitrator who has been chosen by the

20   employer and by the union.          And those are the two

21   entities that have already decided that their claim is

22   meritless.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:         -- more variables of Justice

24   Souter's question, if those variables are satisfied,

25   what's -- what is your answer to his question?

 1                 MR. GANNON:        If the variables are --

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:          You're saying that this

 3   might -- this might not be true and that may not be

 4   true, but suppose all of those other requirements are

 5   satisfied?

 6                 MR. GANNON:        We think that there needs to be

 7   individual agreement in order to comply with Gilmer

 8   because of the underlying inherent tension between the

 9   collective interest of the union and the individual

10   interests of the employees, especially in

11   anti-discrimination statutes.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

17                 MR. SALVATORE:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

18   Justice.     A couple of quick points in response.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Salvatore, would you

20   straighten out this business it seems about who pays?

21   Mr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid

22   by the employee.     If the union bows out and there is

23   just the employer and the employee in the arbitration,

24   that employee would have to pick up 50 percent.                   I think

25   I understood him to say that.

 1               MR. SALVATORE:           And I refer you, Justice

 2   Ginsburg, to page 47a of the joint -- of the petition

 3   appendix, which contains the main frame arbitration

 4   Article 6 of this collective bargaining agreement, the

 5   last paragraph --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What page did you -- did

 7   you reference?

 8               MR. SALVATORE:           47a of the petition

 9   appendix, the last paragraph on that page.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Article 7, no.

11               MR. SALVATORE:           I'm sorry?

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You said Article 6.       Isn't

13   it Article 7, if it's on 47a?

14               MR. SALVATORE:           Article 6 starts on 43a.           It

15   goes all the way over to 47a of the petition appendix,

16   right after the ellipses at the bottom of the page.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Oh, I see.       Okay, so you

18   are on 6.   I got you.

19               MR. SALVATORE:           The cost of the office of

20   the contract arbitrator shall be shared equally in a

21   manner determined by the union and the RAB.                  The way

22   that the parties -- the bargaining parties have

23   determined that these costs be shared is that if -- if

24   the union is not involved in a case, the employer pays.

25   And -- and so, that's -- I mean, that's right from the

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where does that appear?

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is that written down

 4   somewhere?

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where does that appear?

 6                 MR. SALVATORE:          That's -- that's the -- the

 7   agreement between the collective bargaining parties.

 8   It's not -- it's not written down beyond that -- that --

 9   that place.    The office -- that place in the contract.

10   The office of the contract arbitrator is -- is -- is a

11   place.   It's an arbitration forum.                  It's like going to

12   the American Arbitration Association.

13                 It has hearing rooms.                It -- it -- there --

14   it has administrators who assign the arbitrators.                   The

15   arbitrators aren't picked out of -- you know, by one

16   side or the other.      Yes, they are put on the panel by --

17   by the bargaining parties, but they are picked by a case

18   administrator.

19                 There's 700 arbitrations that go on in this

20   industry every year and that's why instead of going to

21   the American Arbitration Association, these parties a

22   long time ago set up their own.                A couple --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             If the -- if the idea is

24   that the union sees this right to the worker, then

25   doesn't have to -- doesn't the burden go with the right

 1   as well?     I mean, the -- if the union would pay, you're

 2   saying that the employer will just accept that the

 3   employer picks up the entire tab?

 4                 MR. SALVATORE:          Yes, Justice Ginsburg.          And

 5   there are -- are several points.                 First, there is no

 6   conflict here in this case.              The union did the right

 7   thing.     It turned the claim over to the individual

 8   employees with their private counsel and let them go

 9   arbitrate it themselves.           They refused.          This isn't a

10   Magnavox situation.       The union is not --

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I mean, they didn't turn it

12   over, did they, until the action had been brought in the

13   Federal court?    I mean, they didn't -- maybe I'm wrong

14   in this, but I didn't think that on day one they -- they

15   said, oh, well, because the union doesn't want to

16   proceed with this, you're welcome to chug ahead by

17   yourself.

18                 MR. SALVATORE:          Let me explain that time

19   frame, Justice Souter.         What happened here was the claim

20   was originally tendered by these employees to the union

21   to bring an arbitration.           The union decided after the

22   first hearing day with the arbitrator that they couldn't

23   go forward for whatever reasons -- it's not in the

24   record -- and then they, several months went by, these

25   employees filed with their counsel at the EEOC under

 1   Waffle House, we did nothing and waited and the --

 2   representing the employers, and then the -- the lawsuit

 3   was filed.

 4                At that point the record is clear that

 5   demand was made on -- on the employee's counsel,

 6   Mr. Kreisberg -- it's in his affidavit -- that -- that

 7   he returned to Arbitrator Pfeiffer to the pending

 8   arbitration and continue in that forum, and he refused

 9   to.   That was the basis of the motion to compel.
