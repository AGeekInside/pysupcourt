 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. CLEMENT:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The crime of extortion under the Hobbs Act,

12   like the related crimes of larceny, burglary and

13   embezzlement, is at bottom a property crime.

14   Accordingly, understanding the scope of obtainable

15   property under the Hobbs Act is critical to deciding the

16   scope of the basic criminal prohibition.

17               The Government has offered you a definition

18   of property that only a prosecutor could love:                       Any

19   intangible right with economic value, but that

20   definition is fundamentally incompatible with this

21   Court's precedence and with Congress's conscious

22   decision in the Hobbs Act to criminalize the State --

23   New York State crime of extortion, but not the New York

24   crime of coercion.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                If the jury had -- had

                                         3

 1   returned the verdict which is at JA142, and it had

 2   marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the

 3   commitment, you might still maybe have some causation

 4   arguments, but I assume the property argument you're

 5   about to make is just irrelevant.

 6                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I don't think it's

 7   irrelevant, Justice Kennedy.              I would have a different

 8   argument.   I think that I would stand first and foremost

 9   on this Court's decision in Cleveland, where it

10   recognized that something like, I think the commitment,

11   certainly the video poker license was at issue there,

12   the Court also referenced an unissued patent.

13                And it recognized that there are things that

14   have value once they're issued, but in the hands of the

15   Government, they don't have value, and therefore don't

16   qualify as property.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Could -- could the case

18   have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in

19   which what they were taking was the commissions that

20   would ultimately have been generated?

21                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Kennedy, it

22   might have been possible to say that what was obtained

23   here was money, but I think if the Government had

24   prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove

25   that somehow the Government paid too much.              I don't

                                       4

 1   think it can point just to the commissions.

 2                 And I would analogize it to the McNally

 3   case.   In the McNally case, you know, there was this

 4   scheme in which various sort of friends of government

 5   officials were getting the commissions from a workmen's

 6   compensation policy.       And what this Court said is, well,

 7   it would have been one thing if the Government had come

 8   in and said that the Government paid commissions that

 9   were too high, or the Government had received inferior

10   quality insurance.

11                 But what the Government did there instead

12   was sort of take the shortcut and plead that what had

13   happened is, the Government had been deprived of its

14   interest in having the honest services -

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, here, what the

16   Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately.               And

17   you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's

18   real money.    It's for the Government to answer, not you,

19   but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge

20   that?

21                 MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I think the reason that

22   they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold.

23   One is that a commitment under New York law and practice

24   is not quite as what it sounds; it's not really a

25   commitment.    And the best evidence of that is with the

                                        5

 1   last fund for this particular management company, they

 2   got a commitment from the State and there was no

 3   ultimate investment made.

 4                 So there's a subsequent step down the road.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I see.       I see.

 6                 MR. CLEMENT:          So I think that's part of it.

 7                 The other thing I would say is as in

 8   McNally, I think they would have had to prove that the

 9   management fees were somehow excessive or something like

10   that, so they didn't do that.                 They focused on this

11   recommendation.

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Mr. Clement -

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I took you away from

14   your argument about intangible property.

15                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Mr. Clement, just along the

16   same lines.    What you're saying is that it still would

17   not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's

18   position runs an investment company, wants an

19   investment, wants the fees that come along with that

20   investment.    Goes to -- let's say that there's a single

21   person who gets to decide whether to make that

22   investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that

23   person, threatens that person with something terrible

24   happening to him.

25                 You're saying that that does not count as

                                         6

 1   extortion, that there's a reason that the Government

 2   didn't charge it like that?

 3                 MR. CLEMENT:         I would say that that -- I

 4   would say a couple of things.                I would say that's a

 5   harder case than the one I have before you today.                   I

 6   would say that I don't think that's actually extortion

 7   if what they charge is the commitment, not the money

 8   that goes -- that flows from the Government.                   And then

 9   what I would say -- and the reason I would say that is

10   because of Cleveland.

11                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, they want the

12   investment with -- and the fees that come with the

13   investment.    So -- and that's why they're threatening

14   the person.

15                 MR. CLEMENT:         Right.          And I would say that

16   under McNally, in that kind of case, what the Government

17   has to prove is that if they want to make the property

18   the money interest that the Government is paying out and

19   the person is obtaining, they have to show that there's

20   some sort of excessive commission or excessive sort of

21   management fee.

22                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Even -- even though they

23   wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't

24   have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force

25   or -- or violence?

 1                MR. CLEMENT:           Again, that would be my

 2   position.   And I think it would follow from this Court's

 3   decisions in cases like Cleveland and McNally, because

 4   in McNally, of course, the people who were part of that

 5   fraudulent scheme, they were getting commissions from

 6   the workmen comp program.

 7                And the Government's theory was that just

 8   interfering with the Government's decision about who to

 9   give the workmen -- where to place the workmen's comp

10   policies was enough of an interference to support a

11   fraud conviction.     And this Court said no.                And one of

12   the things it then said is well, it would be different

13   if -- if the Government went in and proved that the

14   commissions that were paid were too high, or that the

15   Government somehow got inadequate insurance.

16                But if all they're doing is saying that

17   what's going on here is sort of the interest of the

18   Government in having its employees serve them honestly

19   and in their best interest, and not in some third

20   party's best interest, that brings you squarely into

21   honest services.    And nobody's saying that doing that's

22   a good thing, but it's -- it's the traditional office of

23   the State law crime of coercion.                    It's -

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But it's -- the coercion

25   crime, at least under New York's definition, requires

                                         8

 1   force.     And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an

 2   embarrassing fact.

 3                  So, what -- am I right about that, that the

 4   coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State

 5   crime, requires a threat of force to restrict him of his

 6   freedom?

 7                  MR. CLEMENT:         I don't believe that's

 8   correct, Justice Ginsburg.

 9                  This was charged by New York State

10   authorities as coercion.            So the very crime that

11   Congress didn't incorporate into the Hobbs Act, the New

12   York crime of coercion, was charged here, and it's my

13   understanding that the New York crime of coercion, like

14   the earlier version of coercion in the racketeer- -- in

15   the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, like the traditional

16   model penal code definition of coercion -- it's the -

17   the threat part of it is the same as extortion.

18                  So it covers a threat to a person or to

19   property.     And it's been interpreted certainly to

20   include threats to disclose information like this.

21                  So I think the real difference between the

22   crime of extortion and the crime of coercion, both as a

23   general matter and under New York law, is whether or not

24   property is obtained.         And that's ultimately what's so

25   problematic about the Government's definition here,

                                         9

 1   because their definition is essentially the property

 2   includes the autonomy interest of a business to operate

 3   free from coercion.

 4                  JUSTICE ALITO:            What is your definition

 5   of -- of property?      In your reply brief, you begin by

 6   saying that you're -- you are not arguing that the

 7   property has to be tangible and includes some forms of

 8   intangible property.

 9                  How would you draw the line?

10                  MR. CLEMENT:         I would say that for property

11   to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on

12   obtaining property, it has to be alienable,

13   transferable, moveable.           That's the critical thing.         So

14   the distinction is not between alienable and

15   inalienable.

16                  A patent is an inalienable -- I mean,

17   rather, a patent is an intangible property right, but

18   it's transferable, it's obtainable, it is sellable, and

19   so it has the characteristics of things that I think

20   come within the traditional definition.

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:            What about -- what about

22   the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead

23   or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is

24   because they have a monopoly, some other grocery who's

25   connected has a monopoly.             And they threaten him.       Now,

                                        10

 1   does that violate Hobbs Act?

 2               MR. CLEMENT:         I think -

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            What he did was -- and

 4   he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.

 5               MR. CLEMENT:         Right.          I -- I would say that

 6   that hypothetical THAT you've given me would be

 7   coercion; it would not be extortion under the Hobbs Act.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now -- now, in fact,

 9   they're doing it to get money, and they do get money,

10   but via the means of the other grocer.                 And there is

11   nothing in the words of this Act that says that the

12   property has to be taken from the individual whom you

13   coerce.

14               It's easy to imagine situations where the

15   coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special

16   and so forth, with the person who has the money.                 So

17   what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person

18   without the property so that he will do a thing such

19   that the person with the property gives them the

20   property?

21               MR. CLEMENT:         I think, at least as I

22   understand your hypothetical, where the relationship

23   between the two parties, basically the competitors, I

24   would say that that's two distinct relationships.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Now just make

                                     11

 1   it different.     What they do is they get the assistant

 2   bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing

 3   such as shout at a certain time where they know that

 4   that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank.

 5   I mean, you know, it's easy to think up.

 6                What I can't figure out here is, is there

 7   some requirement that the person who is coerced has to

 8   be the same person as the person who gives them the

 9   property.   If the answer to that's no, then none of the

10   Government's chamber of horribles is horrible, because

11   there's a way around it.

12                MR. CLEMENT:           Well, I think the answer to it

13   is, it depends.     I don't think I can give you a

14   definitive that the -

15                JUSTICE BREYER:              And you haven't found

16   anything on this.     You'd be making it up now, is that

17   basically it?

18                MR. CLEMENT:           Well, what -- what I would

19   tell you is I think the assumption of most of the cases

20   is that the person that is the pressure of -

21                JUSTICE BREYER:              Is the -- is the one?

22                MR. CLEMENT:           Is the person who's offering

23   up the property.     This Court's -

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Isn't that what the word

25   "extort" means?     You extort something from someone?               It

 1   means you get it from him, you don't get it from some

 2   third party.

 3                  MR. CLEMENT:         I think that's basically

 4   right, Justice Scalia.          What I would say, though, is I

 5   think there's an exception to the -- at least to the

 6   following extent, which I think it would be open to the

 7   Government, to basically say that within an entity, if

 8   you sort of put the pressure on one agent of the

 9   corporation and you actually get the money from another

10   agent of the same corporation, that that's probably

11   close enough.

12                  And so in this case, if the pressure was put

13   on a particular individual and they obtained like actual

14   cash from the Government, that might be a different

15   case.   But, of course, here what they received was this

16   commitment, which I think is analogous to the video

17   poker license in the Cleveland case, so I don't think

18   that's -

19                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But if you think the

20   commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash,

21   real property, right, then it wouldn't matter under

22   that -- under what you just said, that the threat was

23   made to the general counsel rather than to the final

24   person who issued the money, isn't that right?

25                  MR. CLEMENT:         I -- I don't disagree with

                                        13

 1   that, Justice Kagan, but I think that's because they're

 2   all sort of agents to the same principal.                     And I'm not

 3   sure you get all the way to what Justice Breyer was

 4   suggesting, which you can sort of run it through

 5   competitors or something like that.

 6               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Right.          But you wouldn't

 7   say, well, we're dealing with an organization, so it's

 8   only extortion if you threaten the person who writes the

 9   check?

10               MR. CLEMENT:          No.       I -

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:             If you threaten the person

12   who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the

13   check, that's good enough.

14               MR. CLEMENT:          Exactly, Your Honor.             But what

15   I would also say is, you know, this is a real case and

16   there are real jury findings, and as Justice Kennedy

17   alluded to, there were a variety of theories of property

18   put in front of the jury.           They were invited to circle

19   as many of them as they could, as many as they found

20   satisfied, and the only one they circled was the

21   recommendation.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Clement, what is -

23   I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to

24   get the word "property" to do the work of the "obtain"

25   part of the statute, because when you answered

                                      14

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Justice Alito you were using the terms of "obtain" to

 2   define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange

 3   way to do things, okay?           Property generally means value

 4   of some sort and you don't use any of those words in

 5   your definition.

 6                  So, what you're using in my mind, and not

 7   illogically, is to say that the second part of the

 8   statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that

 9   you're taking something of value away from someone else.

10   That makes logical sense to me.                   And I understand the

11   second piece of your argument, which is the

12   recommendation -- not the recommendation, but his honest

13   services wasn't being given to your client, it was being

14   given to the employer.

15                  So your client obtained nothing of value for

16   himself.     He didn't get anything transferred to him.

17   And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me.

18   And I tease it out of your brief, but I don't know why

19   you're trying to get our definition of "property" to do

20   that work.

21                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well -

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Why isn't the work in

23   the "obtain" part?

24                  MR. CLEMENT:         Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy

25   to have you rule in favor of my client on "obtained" or

                                        15

 1   "property" and, as Scheidler II demonstrates, those

 2   terms are really kind of married together.                And I guess

 3   the reason I sort of think that the "obtained" and the

 4   "property" should be construed together is twofold.

 5   One, structurally that's what the statute does.                So when

 6   you're talking about in the statute property that can be

 7   obtained, I think that's a clue that you're not talking

 8   about property in its broadest manifestation.

 9               And you contrast that with, say, the Clayton

10   Act that talks about disjunctively property and -- or

11   property rights, and there you have a clue that Congress

12   means a very broad conception.               When it's talking about

13   it in conjunction with "obtained," I think it has a

14   narrower ambit in mind.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So take the Government's

16   definition that property is anything of value.

17               MR. CLEMENT:         Right.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.   And let's

19   assume, because it -- as I said, that seems to have some

20   sort of conceptual appeal.            Then make the argument for

21   me.

22               MR. CLEMENT:         Well -

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Then make your argument

24   for me why this isn't an obtaining.

25               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, what I would say is

                                     16

 1   obtaining, as this Court made clear in Scheidler II, is

 2   not some metaphysical obtaining.                   I mean, the argument

 3   was made to this Court that the abortion protesters

 4   obtained the autonomy interest of the business in -- the

 5   clinics, in deciding whether -- who to serve and when to

 6   serve and when to be open and when to be closed.

 7               And this Court said no, and it said

 8   principally that that's not obtaining, but it's -- but

 9   it also noted, I guess you'd call it dictum, that

10   what -- what -- obviously, what the Hobbs Act, based on

11   its common law roots in extortion, is talking about is

12   the kind of property that can be deprived, it can then

13   be transferred, sold, exercised.

14               And I do think.              Just to get the second part

15   of my answer out if I could, it's just -- the common law

16   roots here are also where you see the definition of

17   property can't be as broad as the Government suggests.

18   Because extortion is one of the classic common law

19   property crimes.   The definition of property for

20   purposes of extortion ought to be the same as the

21   definition of property for larceny, embezzlement,

22   burglary.

23               You can't go into somebody's house and steal

24   their honest services or their autonomy interests.                   So

25   the kind of property you can obtain for purposes of the

 2   moveable property.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Suppose -- suppose that the

 4   person coerced here was a -- was a corrupt person and

 5   had put his recommendation out for bids.               Okay?    He

 6   said, you know, I'll -- I'll recommend whoever pays me

 7   the most money.   Would that alter this case?

 8               MR. CLEMENT:          I don't -

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             If -- if then somebody

10   comes in and says, well, I'm not going to pay you the

11   money, but I'll -- I'll break your knees if you don't

12   recommend me, would that be extortion?

13               MR. CLEMENT:          It would not, Justice Scalia,

14   and I would say because -- the State of Louisiana in the

15   Cleveland case, if there was a corrupt official who was

16   putting those video poker licenses on sale on the on the

17   sly, I don't think that would change the result there.

18   This Court said that those kind of government things do

19   not have value in the hands of the government.                 The fact

20   that somebody, you know, could sort of be corrupt and

21   therefore have a little auction on the side I don't

22   think changes that basic fact.

23               I would say, too, that there's an important

24   difference here between a hypothetical case where what

25   somebody's trying to do is kind of get something for

                                      18

 1   nothing and essentially get the benefit of the work of a

 2   government official.       But that's not what's at issue

 3   here.

 4               This is not a client who's trying to get -

 5   like, you know, they wanted an opinion on how to

 6   incorporate in the State of New York and they thought,

 7   well, the lawyers are kind of expensive in the private

 8   sector, so I'm just going to coerce it from this

 9   government official.       All they care about in this case

10   is the bottom line, thumbs up, thumbs down

11   recommendation.

12               I don't think this case would be any

13   different if there were an investment committee within

14   the State government and you had to get unanimous assent

15   to an investment and there was one holdout.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Why isn't that -

17   you focused on transferability when you began.                     Why

18   isn't that completely transferable?                     I have leverage

19   against this official and if you want him to recommend

20   yes on your investment, you have to pay me a certain

21   amount of money.   And you can transfer that.                    You've got

22   everybody in, say, you know, the association or whatever

23   and you can auction that off.                It seems to me it's

24   perfectly transferable from the defendant to anyone

25   else.

 1                 MR. CLEMENT:         With respect,

 2   Mr. Chief Justice, I wouldn't think so.                      Now, there are

 3   some voting rights that are transferable in that sense.

 4   I mean, if you have a stock -- a proxy in a stock, or

 5   something like that, that may well come within the

 6   definition.    But when you have these essentially voting

 7   or autonomy interests that are really -- you know,

 8   they're -- they're sort of inherently inalienable,

 9   because this recommendation matters because it's the

10   general counsel and the Comptroller's Office

11   recommendation.    And -

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but the

13   lawyer's going to make recommendations in many other

14   cases as well.    And if you have an application coming up

15   and you want a favorable recommendation, you can go to

16   the -- the individual that has the leverage and say, I

17   will pay you this much money if you can get the person

18   to give me a favorable recommendation.                      And that's

19   transferable from the person with the -- the leverage

20   to -- to someone else.

21                 MR. CLEMENT:         Well, the confident -- I may

22   not be understanding the hypothetical.                      Certainly, the

23   confidential information that the potential coercer has

24   may be transferable, and under this Court's decision in

25   Carpenter, that may be property.                   But the voting right

 1   within the State government or the role within the State

 2   government's internal deliberative process, that really

 3   belongs to the general counsel, and he can't -

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, just let me make

 5   sure that I understand your position.                        Suppose roughly

 6   these facts:     The general counsel is threatened with

 7   something very serious, let's say violence, unless he

 8   makes a favorable recommendation.                        He does.   They act on

 9   that recommendation, it's -- it's a substantial cause in

10   making the investment, and the investment is made and

11   they get the money.       Violation?

12                  MR. CLEMENT:         I would say no, but I would

13   say it's a much more difficult case.                        And the reason I

14   would say no is because the Government -- or I'd say

15   potentially no.     I would still say that the Government

16   has to prove something more, which is that it's an

17   investment where there either was not the optimal

18   investment or they paid too high a commission.                         And -

19   and I take that from McNally.

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but -- but that's a

21   causation argument, not whether or not you received

22   property.

23                  MR. CLEMENT:         Right, because -- but my point

24   is simply that if the Government -

25                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But so far as the property

                                        21

 1   point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to

 2   the contract and the contract leads to the commission

 3   and the commission means money in your pocket, that's

 4   property.

 5                 MR. CLEMENT:         Yes.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And so then we just have a

 7   causation argument, not a property argument.

 8                 MR. CLEMENT:         I think that's right.       If

 9   what's obtained is money, and that's what the Government

10   focuses its prosecution on, then that is -- that

11   satisfies the property requirement of the Hobbs Act.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It has to be more property,

13   more money, more money in return for less services or

14   something than otherwise.            That's what you're saying.

15   But I don't think that's -- I mean, right.                But the

16   answer -- go ahead, because I -- that's the

17   qualification you're making, the McNally qualification.

18                 MR. CLEMENT:         Right, exactly.       Exactly,

19   exactly.    So you obtained the property, so that box is

20   checked, but the -- sorry.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What about -- you said

22   transfer, sell, but there's also exercise.                And the

23   theory is that the defendant sought to take away the

24   officer's right to make this recommendation, take it

25   away from the officer, exercise it himself.                So why

                                       22

 1   doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right

 2   taken from one and exercised by another?

 3                  MR. CLEMENT:         Justice Ginsburg, I would say

 4   that what you've just articulated is exactly the

 5   Government's theory, and the problem is that I can use

 6   that same theory to take any autonomy interest and turn

 7   it into property that can be exercised, it can be

 8   obtained by somebody and then exercised by them in a way

 9   different from the way that the person would otherwise

10   exercise it.

11                  And whatever -- I mean, you know, we're

12   talking about one word in a three-word phrase in

13   Scheidler II.     And the first thing I would say is I

14   think it's a mistake to read that phrase the way you

15   would read a statute.

16                  But the second thing I would say is the one

17   thing the Chief Justice did not mean with respect to the

18   word "exercise" is it meant that it opened up a big gap

19   so you could take every coercion case and turn it into

20   an extortion case.

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is this -- there is, I

22   take it, no Federal crime that this conduct would fit?

23   You said New York State has a coercion crime which you

24   say this conduct might fit.               But there's no Federal

25   crime.

 1                MR. CLEMENT:         There's -- there's no Federal

 2   crime and that's the result of a very deliberative

 3   decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act.

 4   Of course, they had in front of them the model of the

 5   Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 that prohibited both

 6   coercion and extortion.         Congress made a conscious

 7   decision to, in the Hobbs Act, prohibit robbery and

 8   extortion, but not pick up the prohibition on coercion.

 9                And so there isn't a Federal crime directly

10   on point, but it's a very conscious decision by

11   Congress.   And, of course, the New York crime on point

12   is exquisitely on point, because not only is there a

13   coercion offense under New York statute, but it is an

14   aggravated offense if the victim is a government

15   official discharging their public duty.

16                And so this is really a situation where the

17   State courts have a crime that directly fits.                 It's

18   as -- I mean, it's almost amazing, because it's not just

19   any State; it's the State of New York.                 And Congress, in

20   passing the Hobbs Act, was looking at New York law.                  And

21   they looked at New York law and they said, New York has

22   a coercion prohibition and extortion prohibition.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And why did -- why did

24   New York -- was the New York case dropped and the State

25   officials urged the Government, the Federal Government,

 3   that.   What happened is there were some pretrial

 4   rulings.   And one of the pretrial rulings gave the

 5   defendant an opportunity to do some discovery on the

 6   State government to figure out whether this was really

 7   done in the discharge of public duties or maybe this was

 8   sort of a political thing that was going on.

 9                And once that State law discovery happened

10   into the government of Albany, all of a sudden the State

11   prosecution didn't seem like such a great idea anymore.

12   And the Federal prosecutors are just down the street, so

13   they were very happy to lateral it to the Federal

14   prosecutors and have them take it over.                And because the

15   Federal offense doesn't have an element of interfering

16   with the public duty, they didn't have to worry about

17   the discovery.

18                And that is just a very concrete

19   illustration of the problem of over-federalizing crime,

20   because this -- we're talking -- this is the opposite of

21   the typical public corruption case where you think,

22   well, maybe there are people in the State government who

23   aren't going to -- State prosecutors won't be willing to

24   prosecute one of the bigs in the State government, so we

25   need the Federal Government to step in.

 1               The one thing a State doesn't need extra

 2   incentive to do is to protect the integrity of its

 3   internal deliberative process from coercion or

 4   extortion, for that matter.            But the -- the real cost

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

10               ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON

11                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12               MS. HARRINGTON:            Thank you,

13   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

14               I'd like to start, if I could, where Justice

15   Kennedy began and ended, which is asking whether there

16   would have been extortion if the jury had found here

17   that what -- that the property that was obtained was the

18   commissions at the end of the day after the investment.

19   My friend Mr. Clement says no, no, no, McNally says no.

20               But what McNally actually said was the case

21   would have come out differently if the property that had

22   been alleged to be deprived was either money or

23   property, but it also said it would have come out

24   differently if the Commonwealth had been deprived of

25   control over how its money was spent.                    And that's the

                                     26

 1   type of property that's at issue here, control over a

 2   property right.

 3                Now -

 4                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Ms. Harrington, just to go

 5   back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was

 6   there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me

 7   to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in

 8   order to get an investment and in order to get fees to

 9   put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's

10   extortion.   So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the

11   theory of the case?

12                MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, he was charged with

13   attempting to obtain the commitment, which in most cases

14   ends up being the investment itself.                   That's not what

15   the jury found was the property that was obtained, so

16   it's not the verdict that we are here defending today.

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Do you think there's an

18   obstacle to charging a case that way?                   Mr. Clement seems

19   to think that there's an obstacle, that even though

20   there's property in that case, there's some other

21   problem with charging the case that way.

22                MS. HARRINGTON:            No, that's what I'm saying.

23   What he's saying is that the obstacle is you'd have to

24   prove that the State was out more money than it would

25   have been if it had invested in the company it wanted to

                                      27

 1   invest in.   What I'm saying is no, McNally said the

 2   result would have been different if the State had been

 3   deprived of control, of the ability to control its

 4   money, and that's the property that would have been

 5   obtained in that kind of a case.                    Because property and

 6   control of property are just -- are just different

 7   aspects of the same property.

 8                This Court has said repeatedly that

 9   exclusive control of property is one vital aspect of

10   private property.     And that's the -- that's the type of

11   property that was charged, that was -- that was obtained

12   in this case.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:              The obvious problem, which

14   you might want to address at some point, is that -- that

15   if you take your definition that this recommendation,

16   legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said,

17   you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if

18   that's property, we're back to the honest services

19   statute, because anyone in government and anyone in

20   business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs

21   always require you to do things.

22                So if every time somebody threatens a person

23   and says, we don't want you to do the thing you're

24   supposed to do, we want you to do the thing like this,

25   well, then you're violating this property statute.

 1                 MS. HARRINGTON:             But -

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Now, that seems very far

 3   reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case -

 4   the abortion clinic case, etcetera, and it is easy to

 5   reconcile with the honest services case.

 6                 MS. HARRINGTON:             Well, I guess I would have

 7   two points.     The first is that this is not about honest

 8   services, because the victim here is not the State of

 9   New York, it wasn't the citizenry of New York.                        That's

10   the kind of -

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, I mean, that sounds

12   technical.    You see, the problem I'm interested in is,

13   by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within

14   the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is

15   an appropriate threat which has as a condition the

16   person doing the job differently?                        That's true of

17   whether it's a postman, you know, any public official,

18   any private official, anybody.

19                 MS. HARRINGTON:             Whatever -

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:             That seems very

21   far-reaching.     So -

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Just to add to

23   Justice Breyer's question, it's -- suppose the

24   secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with

25   typing the letter "I do not recommend" and they bribe

                                        29

 1   her and she says "I recommend."                   She has an interest in

 2   her integrity to give an honest transcription.                         Under

 3   your view, and this is what Justice Breyer is getting

 4   at, I think, that -- that secretary has property that

 5   you are taking.     That's very far-reaching.

 6                  MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, I want to separate

 7   again the question of what is property and when property

 8   is obtained.     Under the Hobbs Act -- the Hobbs Act

 9   absorbed the New York State extortion law.                      And in

10   that -- in the -- in the cases construing that law, they

11   had construed the word "property" to include the running

12   of a business, the engagement of a person in their

13   occupation, and the doing of a job.                      People have

14   property interests in doing those things because those

15   are the source of economic wealth for those people.

16   They generate a stream of revenue for people to live

17   their lives on.

18                  Now, it's a different question -- not every

19   time you interfere with someone's doing of their job are

20   you obtaining that property.                Here, what Petitioner was

21   trying to do was not keep the general counsel from

22   making a recommendation; he was attempting to dictate

23   the substance of what the recommendation was.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, I understand that.

25   But I still would like an answer to my question, and

                                        30

 1   it's well-phrased with an example by Justice Kennedy.

 2               Every secretary in the United States who is

 3   about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to

 4   college or some other thing then is faced with a threat,

 5   you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of

 6   no, and is under your definition that person's property,

 7   that what she does the taking of property?                The answer

 8   is either you think yes, in which case I would like you

 9   to defend it -

10               MS. HARRINGTON:              Yes.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:              Or the -- yes.    Okay.     Then

12   what conceivable ground?           I'm not -- I don't want to -

13   that sounds a little pejorative, but I'll say:                What

14   ground is there for a definition that is so broad that

15   it sweeps within it all working people in the United

16   States in the performance of their ordinary jobs?

17               MS. HARRINGTON:              The ground is the general

18   particularized meaning that the word "property" has

19   obtained in the law, and including in New York cases

20   construing the very law on which the Hobbs Act was

21   based.

22               A person has a property interest in running

23   their business.    They also have a property interest in

24   doing their job.    When -- when someone comes along and

25   uses threats of harm or threats of force or violence to

                                       31

 1   try to get them to do their job in a different way, what

 2   they are doing is they are taking control of that

 3   property interest that the person has.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what is -- I have a

 5   property interest in doing my job?                       I don't know what

 6   that means.     I mean, just throwing words around.                    You

 7   are calling doing a job a property interest.                       Normally

 8   when I think of property, I think of something that can

 9   be conveyed.     Can I convey the -- the doing of my job to

10   somebody else?

11                  MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, you can convey your

12   labor to your employer in that sense.                       When you enter an

13   employment contract, you are selling your labor to your

14   employer.     And the -- the extent of your right to do

15   that job is then defined by the parameters of your job.

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            But I'm not talking about

17   my labor.     I'm talking about my doing the job that the

18   employer has assigned to me.

19                  MS. HARRINGTON:            But that is your labor.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not my -- not my labor

21   in the abstract.     Nobody is taking my labor away from

22   me.

23                  MS. HARRINGTON:            But in this case what

24   Petitioner was trying to take was the fruits of the

25   general counsel -- counsel's labor.                       His job was to give

 1   his recommendation to his client about what was in

 2   keeping with the client's -

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can you cite me one -- one

 4   extortion case at common law -- or let me put it another

 5   way.   What is the closest extortion case at common law

 6   that you can allude to?

 7                MS. HARRINGTON:             I can't, because at common

 8   law the person -

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:             We -- we are using a common

10   law term here, "extortion."

11                MS. HARRINGTON:             Yes, but it was a different

12   crime at common law, because it only involved public

13   officials taking money or other thing of value in

14   exchange for doing something -

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Whatever.         What's the

16   closest that comes to this abstract "the doing of my job

17   is property"?

18                MS. HARRINGTON:             I don't have an example of

19   that, but what I do have are examples from the New York

20   cases which were construing the New York State extortion

21   law, and this Court has noted again and again that

22   that's the basis for the Hobbs Act.                     Congress was

23   explicitly trying to evoke that law.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:             What -- what's the closest

25   New York case?

 1                 MS. HARRINGTON:            So I think there are two

 2   cases.   The Barondess case and the Short case are the

 3   best cases.    And in the Barondess case, which is from

 4   1893, I think, the -- the Court said that the running of

 5   a business was property.           And in the Short case the

 6   Court said that, just the same way that the running of a

 7   business is property, a person's doing their job is

 8   property, and that that can be damaged -

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How was it -- could you

10   tell us a little more?         How was it taken?

11                 MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, in those cases the

12   property wasn't taken.         Under the New York extortion

13   law, the law used "property" in two different places,

14   and this is noted in our brief.                  First, it was something

15   that could be taken, that could be obtained through

16   extortion; and second, it was -- one of the means of

17   committing extortion with doing violence to property, it

18   was harming property.        And the court was construing

19   property -- in those cases, it was -- it was in the

20   latter sense of what qualified as harm to property.

21                 But the court said in the Short case, which

22   is from 1911 -- the court noted that property is used

23   in -- in both provisions, Section 850 and Section 851,

24   and said it was construing it as it was used in both of

25   those sections.    And in that -- that was the case that

                                       34

 1   said doing a person's job, the person has a property

 2   interest in doing their job.

 3                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Ms. Harrington, go back to

 4   the Scheidler example, because that was a case where we

 5   said there was not extortion when there were threats of

 6   violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's

 7   operations.    What you are suggesting is that if those

 8   threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion

 9   clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic

10   to shut down their operations because they were a

11   violation of law, that it would be an entirely different

12   case.   Now, how could that be?

13                 MS. HARRINGTON:            We -- that's absolutely

14   what we are saying, in the same way that we said that if

15   the target of the -- if the -- if the protesters, excuse

16   me, had been trying to get the clinics, if they had been

17   trying to take over the clinics and get them to provide

18   a different type of service, to get them to be a

19   restaurant or to provide a different type of medical

20   service, then they would have been obtaining the right

21   of the -- of the clinic the right to run -- to operate

22   their business.

23                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            So -- so you think if -- if

24   they targeted the -- the clinic's lawyer or the -- if

25   the threats were, Don't shut down the clinic; instead,

                                       35

 1   start delivering babies, that that would be extortion,

 2   whereas in the real case it wasn't?

 3               MS. HARRINGTON:            Yes, because Scheidler came

 4   out the way it did not because there wasn't property at

 5   issue, but because there wasn't an obtaining.               And I do

 6   think it's important to try to keep those two things

 7   separate.

 8               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, because there

 9   wasn't -- and there's nothing obtained either way.               I

10   mean, you are trying to change what the person is doing,

11   but you are not getting anything from it.

12               MS. HARRINGTON:            But you are dictating the

13   substance of what they are doing, and so you are

14   obtaining their right to exercise their property right.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that -- that's the

16   problem with your New York cases as well.             You -- you

17   are focusing on property in another context, where the

18   property is harmed, not whether property is taken.

19   You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other

20   common law case involving extortion where the property

21   taken consists of somebody's doing his job.

22               MS. HARRINGTON:            It's true, but the New

23   York courses -- the New York cases said that they were

24   construing the word "property" to mean the same thing as

25   used -- used in both places in the statute.

                                     36

 1                 And there is no reason to -- to define the

 2   word "property" to include the concept of being

 3   obtainable, because the statute already separately

 4   requires that property be obtained before there is

 5   extortion.

 6                 Just, if I can just note that -

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm not sure that

 8   obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one

 9   and the same thing, I'm really not.

10                 MS. HARRINGTON:            They might not be, but they

11   are both -- but property is property.                     That's our

12   position, that there is a legal meaning of property, it

13   includes the right to run a business, the right to -- to

14   engage in an occupation.           In a particular instance that

15   property may not be obtainable and then there won't be a

16   Hobbs Act violation.       But you don't have to read the

17   obtainability into the definition of "property."

18                 It's the same thing.                 The Hobbs Act also

19   says that you can commit a violation by committing

20   physical violence against property.                     Now, in their

21   opening brief, Petitioner said, well, if something can't

22   be physically harmed, it can't be property.                     We are

23   happy to see in the reply brief they sort of gave that

24   up by saying, "Okay, yeah.              Well, business secrets are

25   property.    A patent is property.                 Those things can't be

                                       37

 1   physically harmed.

 2               But there is no reason to read "property"

 3   means different things.          If something can't be

 4   physically harmed, it won't be the basis for liability

 5   under that provision of the Hobbs Act.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You are -- you are

 7   contradicting what you yourself said a little bit

 8   before, which is that property means the same thing for

 9   both provisions -

10               MS. HARRINGTON:              No, that's exactly what I'm

11   saying.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- for both the obtaining

13   and the harming.

14               MS. HARRINGTON:              That's exactly -

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But it doesn't mean the

16   same thing for the harming, because there is some

17   property that can't be harmed.

18               MS. HARRINGTON:              Right.         But that doesn't

19   mean that property means something different.                     It just

20   means if it's property that can't be harmed, then it -

21   it won't be a basis for liability under that provision.

22               I'm just saying you don't want to give a

23   different definition to the same word used different

24   times in the same statute, when the concept is -- is -

25   where the work is carried by other words in the statute.

 1               I think if I could point to -

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 I -- I -- going back a

 3   little bit to Justice Breyer's question, how do you gain

 4   possession of someone's advice or how they do their job

 5   when it's not giving you a direct benefit; it's

 6   something that belongs to someone else?

 7               MS. HARRINGTON:              What you are doing is -

 8   what happened in this case is Petitioner was attempting

 9   to obtain control over the fruits of the general

10   counsel's labor.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 That's the problem, this

12   obtaining controlled concept.

13               MS. HARRINGTON:              Right, so what -

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Because you're -- you're

15   equating taking control with possession.                 And that's

16   where I'm having difficulty.

17               MS. HARRINGTON:              Well, this Court has

18   repeatedly said that property and exclusive control of

19   property are just different aspects of the same thing.

20   They're different sticks in the bundle that make up the

21   property.

22               Here, what Petitioner was trying to do was

23   he was trying to dictate the substance of the

24   recommendation, and in doing so, he was trying to

25   exorcise the General Counsel's right to make the

                                       39

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   recommendation, his right to do his job, and that was

 2   his property.    He wasn't just trying to keep him from

 3   going to work; he was trying to literally dictate what

 4   the recommendation was.          And that's how it was charged

 5   in the indictment, that's what the jury found.                That was

 6   where the obtaining came in.

 7                 The -- the concept of property and control

 8   of property is well illustrated by this Court's decision

 9   in Carpenter.    There the property -- one of the pieces

10   of property at issue was confidential business

11   information, which was taken from The Wall Street

12   Journal.

13                 But it wasn't -- it wasn't really taken from

14   The Wall Street Journal because The Wall Street Journal

15   still had the information at the end of the day.                What

16   the Court found was taken from The Wall Street Journal

17   was the ability to control, to have the exclusive

18   control over the information.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            As I think about it in

20   terms of the New York cases, as you write them up here,

21   it sounds as if someone was trying to get control of a

22   business.    So I think business, land, labor, and

23   capital.    All right.     I can see why somebody who's

24   trying to get control of a whole business is trying to

25   take land, labor and capital.                There may be no land

                                       40

 1   there, but so what.      And -- but a person's trying to

 2   take control of another's job by just telling him what

 3   to do 2 percent of the time seems well across some kind

 4   of line.

 5                MS. HARRINGTON:             Well, I mean, you might

 6   have an obtaining question if it's only 2 percent of the

 7   time.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no.        No attaining

 9   question.   I'm just thinking is it reasonable to call a

10   secretary doing one job which takes 3 percent of her

11   time that hour property, in a way is that different from

12   taking control of Macy's -

13                MS. HARRINGTON:             Well, you should -

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             -- and -- and it seems to

15   me that probably it is.

16                MS. HARRINGTON:             Well, I guess -- I mean,

17   it's sort of two -- two different kinds of responses.

18   One is that when you're asking if something is property,

19   you want to look at it sort of on a class-wide or

20   aggregate basis.   If you have one, single unauthorized

21   download of a copyrighted song, that's not necessarily

22   going to cause harm to the record company -

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no, I'm not worried

24   about copyrights or other intangibles.

25                MS. HARRINGTON:             No, I understand.

                                       41

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:            That's not the issue.

 2                  MS. HARRINGTON:            But I'm just saying you

 3   want to look at something in the aggregate on a

 4   class-wide basis, and persons doing their job on a

 5   class-wide basis is something that is economically

 6   valuable to them.     And therefore, it's property.

 7                  I lost track of what my second response was

 8   going to be.

 9                  So anyway, the -- the Hobbs Act clearly was

10   targeted -- was trying to get at racketeering activity;

11   it was trying to get at organized crime families.                        And

12   Congress knew that one of the main means that organized

13   crime families use was taking control of businesses.

14                  Now, those cases might seem easier, because

15   taking control of a brick and mortar business may seem

16   more obviously like property than taking control of a

17   person's occupation or their job.                        But a person's right

18   to labor is economically valuable to them and is

19   property to them in the same way that the running of a

20   business is.

21                  Now, Petitioner's view would -- if it -- I

22   mean, his real view is that he'd want to wipe out the

23   heartland of Hobbs Act organized crime prosecutions, but

24   I think his fallback position is that he would want to

25   wipe out any extortion of a business that provides

                                        42

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   services instead of providing a tangible good.              But that

 2   doesn't make sense either.

 3                If Petitioner had threatened harm to a

 4   plumber if the plumber didn't come and -- and fix his

 5   leaky faucet, he would have been extorting that

 6   plumber's labor, and the same thing for a gardener, if

 7   he tried to get a gardener to come and mow his lawn.

 8   Now, he wouldn't end up with anything tangible at -- at

 9   the back end, but what he would have taken from those

10   laborers would be their right to labor, their right

11   to -

12                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, yes, he would have

13   ended up with something intangible in those

14   hypotheticals.   He would have ended up with the mowed

15   lawn.   He would have ended up with the thing that the

16   service was providing them.

17                MS. HARRINGTON:            But he wouldn't -

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:            The -- the problem here is

19   that there is no obtaining of anything that the person

20   is getting from your theory.

21                MS. HARRINGTON:            It's the same kind of

22   obtaining here, because he wouldn't take the mowed lawn

23   from the -- from the gardener, he wouldn't take a lack

24   of leaking from the plumber.              What he's taking from them

25   is their services in order to get a particular result.

                                      43

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                It's the same thing here; he's trying to

 2   take from the General Counsel his service of making a

 3   recommendation that's in his client's best interest and

 4   he's trying to dictate the substance of the

 5   recommendation to try to get him to give a particular

 6   recommendation, a positive recommendation.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why is that valuable to me?

 8   Why is it valuable to me -- I can see how the job is

 9   valuable to me.   I get paid to do the job.               But why

10   making one recommendation rather than another is

11   valuable to me?   I don't think it's valuable to me.

12                MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, that's what I'm

13   saying -

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's only because I'm an

15   honest person that I want to make the proper

16   recommendation, but to say that it has any economic

17   value that I recommend A rather than B?                It's -- it's

18   totally neutral whether one is -- is more economically

19   valuable than the other.

20                MS. HARRINGTON:            It has economic value

21   because the lawyer's job is to give his advice in

22   keeping with his client's best interest.                It's the same

23   thing as the record company.              A single unauthorized

24   download -

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's all very true and an

                                      44

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove

 2   that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give

 3   the right advice rather than the wrong advice.

 4               MS. HARRINGTON:               It is.         If Petitioner had

 5   tried to blackmail the General Counsel every week to

 6   give a different recommendation than what he wanted, the

 7   result would have been the General Counsel would have

 8   lost his job.    He would have lost his stream of revenue.

 9   He might have been disbarred.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Oh, I see.         I see.

11               MS. HARRINGTON:               That's economically

12   valuable to him.     It's the same thing as a single

13   download of a -- of a record that might not cause

14   economic harm to a record company, but it's still taking

15   property, because in the aggregate, the rights of that

16   copyright or trademark have -- the property right has

17   value to the record company.

18               It's important to keep in mind the factual

19   scenario here.     Here, Petitioner was trying to use

20   blackmail to coerce a State agent into doing something

21   that was against his -- his will in order to get a

22   $35 million investment from the State.                      Now, again, this

23   might seem like a harder case than if he was trying to

24   coopt the running of a brick and mortar business, but

25   what he was trying to do is coopt an individual's doing

                                        45

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   of his job.    He's trying to dictate the substance of the

 2   recommendation.    In doing that, he's obtaining property

 3   from the victim.

 4                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm

 5   just confused, and this goes back again to

 6   Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't

 7   charged in a much simpler way where the property is not

 8   a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other

 9   person can get, but where the property was the contract,

10   was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the

11   theory was that a threat was used in order to get that

12   investment and fees.

13                 And why wasn't -- why isn't that just -- you

14   know, I look at the facts here and I say extortion, but

15   not on your theory, on my theory.                       And why wasn't that

16   simple theory used?

17                 MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, it was charged on

18   several different theories, and one of the theories was

19   that he was trying to gain the commitment to the

20   investment.    Now, the jury was given choices.                     The jury

21   circled the lawyer's positive recommendation as the

22   property that was obtained.              I assume that's because the

23   evidence in the case, the e-mails from Petitioner to

24   General Counsel talked about the recommendation and so

25   that was a tangible thing in the jury's mind.

                                       46

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  It was sort of that there was a really

 2   direct connection between what Petitioner was saying,

 3   what he was trying to do, and the recommendation.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is what -

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But you don't think that

 6   there's any reason why it, in a future case, it couldn't

 7   be charged just the way I said it?

 8                  MS. HARRINGTON:            I don't think -- I think it

 9   could have been charged that he was trying to get the

10   money here.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Was that one of the choices

12   the jury had?

13                  MS. HARRINGTON:            That he was trying to get

14   commitment; that was one of the choices.                     What they

15   circled was the recommendation.                   Now, who knows why a

16   jury does anything.       I assume, like I said, it's because

17   that was what the e-mails were about, they were about

18   the recommendation.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I didn't think they

20   circled recommendation.           They circled his honest advice,

21   didn't they?

22                  MS. HARRINGTON:            No, they circled -- it says

23   the General Counsel's recommendation -- this is on the

24   JA 142.   That's where it -

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm sorry.

 1                  MS. HARRINGTON:            JA 142.        What they circled

 2   was the General Counsel's recommendation to approve the

 3   commitment.     And I think that wording is very helpful to

 4   us, because it's not just that he's trying to obtain a

 5   recommendation from the General Counsel.                     He's trying to

 6   obtain a particular recommendation, the recommendation

 7   to approve the commitment.               I think that encapsulates

 8   both the property and the obtaining that is the theory

 9   of our case.

10                  The General Counsel's job was to give his

11   legal advice.     The Petitioner was trying to dictate the

12   substance of that legal advice.                   His property interest

13   was in doing his job.         The General Counsel -- the

14   Petitioner was trying to take control of the doing of

15   the job, and therefore trying to take the General

16   Counsel's property.

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It -- it does seem to me

18   important that you can't give us a common law case

19   because common law is extortion -- at common law is

20   extortion, it's usually the other way around.                     It's

21   usually the official who's doing the extorting.

22                  MS. HARRINGTON:            It was always the official

23   who was doing the extorting.

24                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             At -- at common law, could

25   anyone ever extort an official, or we just don't have

                                        48

 1   those cases?

 2                  MS. HARRINGTON:            No.       At common law, it was

 3   only limited to acts by an official.                     There was no -

 4   and -- and the Court has recognized that when Congress

 5   enacted the Hobbs Act, it expanded the -- the reach of

 6   extortion in that sense, in the same way that New York

 7   did when it enacted the State extortion law.

 8                  And I do think it's important to keep in

 9   mind that the -- the Hobbs Act is based on the New York

10   law and we don't want to just ignore the New York cases

11   that construe the word "property" to mean the running of

12   a business and the doing of a job.

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            But not the obtaining of

14   property.

15                  MS. HARRINGTON:            But it wasn't -- I mean,

16   it's true there weren't cases -

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's true.       Not the

18   obtaining the property, right?

19                  MS. HARRINGTON:            I concede that point.          I

20   concede that point.       But it was -- it was defining the

21   word "property" and that property is used twice.                       And

22   so, again, it's a separate question here whether the

23   property was obtained.          We think it's clear that there

24   was property.     We think it's clear the property was

25   obtained as well, but those are two separate questions.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     You -- you point

 2   out, of course, that it was based on the New York law,

 3   but what do you do with the point that they did not

 4   carry forward the separate crime of coercion, which was

 5   in the New York law but not in the Hobbs Act?

 6                  MS. HARRINGTON:            That's true -- I mean, it

 7   was a separate crime of coercion.                        There was a separate

 8   crime of coercion under New York law.                        I think, you

 9   know, the Congress conceived of the Hobbs Act as a

10   property -- as a crime of -- against property, and so it

11   didn't want to include coercion.                    It included extortion

12   and robbery.

13                  Of course, every extortion crime -

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     What do you do with

15   the fact that the State authorities did charge it under

16   coercion?

17                  MS. HARRINGTON:            In this case.           Well, I

18   think it's important to note, and Petitioner doesn't

19   mention this, that the attempted extortion charge he was

20   initially charged with was a misdemeanor and the

21   attempted coercion charge he ultimately ended up being

22   charged with in State law was a felony.                        So I think that

23   explains what was going on there.

24                  And it's a good example -- it's a good

25   illustration of why it's hard to judge ex-post what

                                        50

 1   happened, you know, what was motivating different

 2   charging decisions.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:              What do you think would be

 4   covered by coercion that wouldn't be covered by the

 5   Government's extortion theory here?

 6                Give me an example of -- of coercion?

 7                MS. HARRINGTON:              Anything that doesn't

 8   involve property.     So if you're trying to coerce -

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, for example -

10                MS. HARRINGTON:              So, trying to coerce

11   someone to marry someone they don't want.

12                I think, in the Scheidler case -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Why -- why isn't that

14   property?   Why.    You know, my -- my choice of marrying

15   whom I want, why isn't that as much property as -- as my

16   ability to -- to perform my job the way I want?

17                MS. HARRINGTON:              Because it's -- I think

18   it's more properly viewed as a liberty interest.                  It's

19   not a source of economic value in the sort of

20   traditional sense.      I think if you take the Scheidler

21   case -

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:              A lot of people marry for

23   money.

24                (Laughter.)

25                MS. HARRINGTON:              It's true.     I walked into

                                        51

 1   that one.

 2               I think -- so let's take the Scheidler case

 3   for an example.   There were different types of property

 4   that were initially alleged in that case.                     One of them

 5   was the right of women to access the services of the

 6   clinic.

 7               This Court -- this Court distinguished that

 8   from the other alleged property interests, which were

 9   the running of the business that was the clinic.                     And

10   the Court said that the right of women to access the

11   services of the clinic was really more of a liberty

12   interest and the running of a business was really more

13   of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't

14   have to decide that, but it said that's really more in

15   the nature of property.         That was the property

16   right alleged.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     It seems to me you

18   could characterize the right to work as more of a

19   liberty interest than a property interest.

20               MS. HARRINGTON:             I think it's both.          And

21   so someone -- the general counsel could have been

22   coerced in this case if he had been prevented from going

23   to jobs, to his job.      But here what Petitioner was

24   trying to do again was to -- to take the substance of

25   the job, where he was trying to take the fruits of the

                                      52

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   labor of the general counsel by trying to dictate the

 2   substance of the recommendation.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So you draw a

 4   distinction between extorting someone not to go to work

 5   and extorting him how to do his job once he's at work?

 6                MS. HARRINGTON:            Not on the basis of

 7   property, but on the basis of obtaining.                     The former

 8   is -- there's no obtaining and in the latter there's

 9   obtaining because what you're doing is you are

10   exercising the person's right to do their job.

11                And the Court has said again and again that

12   exclusive control of property is an essential element of

13   all personal property, of all private property.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            Why -- why, just as long as

15   we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C.                      875,

16   "Whoever with intent to extort from any person anything

17   of value"?

18                MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, we did use it, and he

19   was -- I mean, there are five convictions under 875.

20   What happened is in this case we conceded that Section

21   875 uses the word "extort."             We conceded in the court of

22   appeals that "extort" has the same meaning as

23   "extortion" under the Hobbs Act.

24                And so if there wasn't extortion under the

25   Hobbs Act, there wouldn't be -

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            You don't have -- you don't

 2   have property in there.         You have a thing of value -

 3                MS. HARRINGTON:            That's -

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- is there some -- I mean,

 5   it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger

 6   position when you say that the recommendation not to buy

 7   or to buy a particular service from somebody is a thing

 8   of value.

 9                MS. HARRINGTON:            That's true.         In this case,

10   again, we have treated them as the same.                    But I think

11   you would want to reserve for another case the question

12   whether Section 875 -

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            Have they in the Court been

14   treated as a thing of value means property?

15                MS. HARRINGTON:            I think "thing of value" is

16   a broader term than "property."

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            So no.

18                MS. HARRINGTON:            Right.         So we haven't made

19   an argument about 875 here.             We've conceded that

20   whatever the result is as to the Hobbs Act would control

21   as to 875.   But I do think that's a question for another

22   case if we don't prevail in this case.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it -- it at least

24   makes available the argument that you don't have to go

25   this far, that there are other provisions that would

                                      54

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   enable you to get to this person.

 2                MS. HARRINGTON:            Well, again, I don't think

 3   we are going too far -

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So why -- instead of

 5   inducing us to define property so broadly that it's

 6   unrecognizable, as far as I am concerned -

 7                MS. HARRINGTON:            But, Justice Scalia, you

 8   have already defined it this broadly in cases dealing

 9   with Section 20 of the Clayton Act, the Due Process

10   Clause, the scope of a court's equity jurisdiction.                      The

11   Court has said that the running of a business is

12   property.   The Court has also said that pursuit of an

13   occupation is property.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            We're talking about

15   property for purposes of extortion, the common law crime

16   of extortion.

17                MS. HARRINGTON:            I hear what you're saying.

18   But what I am saying is that property is property.                      And

19   it's true that in extortion the property has to be

20   obtained for there to be a crime.                      That work is done by

21   the word "obtained."

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think property is

23   property.   I think property can -- can have a -- a

24   different meaning with -- with regard to various

25   provisions of the law.        And -- and the provision of the

                                      55

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   law defining extortion brings with it a whole baggage

 2   of -- of common law cases.               And that may well be

 3   different from the word "property" used in some other

 4   Federal statute that does not invoke the common law of

 5   extortion.

 6                MS. HARRINGTON:              But this Federal crime of

 7   extortion brings with -- brings with it the baggage of

 8   the New York State extortion law, and the New York cases

 9   said in that law the word "property" includes the

10   running of a business and doing a job.

11                It's true that that wasn't the property

12   being extorted in those cases, but that's what they said

13   property means.     And if you are worried that those

14   things can't be obtained, you don't need to worry -- you

15   don't need to have a special definition of property to

16   take care of that, because the Hobbs Act already

17   requires that property be obtained before there is

18   extortion, so there is no need to have a redundancy

19   built in for that.

20                Again, I can understand how -- how the main

21   Hobbs Act, sort of heartland cases which involve the

22   co-opting of a brick and mortar businesses, seem like

23   easier cases.     And you might want to draw a line between

24   the running of a business and the doing of labor.

25                But a person has a property interest in

                                        56

 1   doing their job the same way that they have a property

 2   interest in running a business.                   The fact that they work

 3   for someone else shouldn't mean that they have less of

 4   an interest in doing their job than if they run their

 5   own business.

 6               Doing a job is a source of economic value to

 7   a person and the Court should construe it as property,

 8   and the right to exercise control over doing their job

 9   is also property.

10               If the Court has no questions?

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Thank you, counsel.

12               Mr. Clement, 5 minutes.

13             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

14                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15               MR. CLEMENT:            Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16   A couple of points in rebuttal.

17               Ms. Harrington started by pointing to the

18   language in McNally.        And she is absolutely correct that

19   at the same time that McNally got rid of the honest

20   services prosecution that was brought there, they

21   reserved two possible prosecutions.                       One would be the

22   obtaining of money, where there was a difference in what

23   the government paid for and what the government got.

24               The other thing that she alludes to is

25   there -- the Court did say, well, maybe there's a

                                        57

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   possibility that you could prosecute based on the

 2   government's loss of control over its allocation of

 3   these workman's comp policies.

 4               The problem is, of course, that McNally

 5   precedes Cleveland.      And in Cleveland, the government

 6   seized on that language and said, well, even if the

 7   video poker license isn't property, the right to control

 8   who gets it is property, and that got exactly zero votes

 9   from this Court.   So I think that argument is no longer

10   viable.

11               Ms. Harrington also points to these New York

12   cases about the scope of property for purposes of 851 of

13   the New York Penal Code.           But of course, what we're

14   talking about is 850 of the New York Penal Code, the

15   kind of property that can be obtained.                  I think it's

16   common ground that -- they are not co-extensive.                  There

17   are -- there is property that you can obtain that you

18   can't threaten.

19               Indeed, the classic thing you obtained in -

20   in an extortion case is money, and I'm not sure how you

21   really threaten money.         You can threaten to take money

22   from someone, but you don't really threaten the money.

23   So these are different terms.

24               So relying on the Barondess case, which is

25   the same case that Justice Stevens relied on in dissent

                                       58

 1   in Scheidler II just doesn't work.

 2                Now, she's also absolutely correct that

 3   extortion at common law only involved official

 4   extortion, but that doesn't mean that there aren't

 5   common law places to look for a relevant definition of

 6   property.   Because the same basic concept was in the

 7   larceny statutes, the -- not statutes, the common law

 8   crime of burglary, larceny, and embezzlement.

 9                And indeed to this very day, New York refers

10   to extortion as larceny by extortion.                  And if you go to

11   those New York cases, the place I would point you to is

12   the Ashworth case, which is cited in both of our briefs.

13   This is a case that makes very clear that under New York

14   law, they didn't even think that services at all were

15   property.

16                This is a case where the foreman of a mill

17   gets the bright idea that he's going to do some work for

18   his own company using the mill's facilities.                  And he's

19   charged with larceny.

20                And the court in that case says:                 No, that's

21   not larceny, you didn't obtain any goods.                  Classic sort

22   of common law property is in order to be the kind of

23   property that you can steal or extort it has to be

24   moveable.   One of the elements of the common law crime

25   is exportation, removing it -

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Clement, when you

 2   finish -

 3                 MR. CLEMENT:         And if I can just sort of put

 4   the point:    They say all of that and they reject that

 5   argument.    And they use a line which I think really

 6   captures what's going on here.                 They say, well, maybe

 7   you can conceive of such a conception of property, but

 8   they say to conceive this requires a certain

 9   intellectual flexibility which is probably not possessed

10   by the average person.         And I would simply submit it

11   also is not the kind of flexibility that should be

12   possessed by the average judge in a criminal case.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Let -- look, I think if

14   we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what

15   you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's

16   Tropiano decision, and the large progeny of cases that

17   come from it.

18                 The most common is the threat to a business

19   that says pull out of this market because we don't want

20   you in it.    And we want all the customers.               And courts

21   routinely have said that's a Hobbs Act violation.

22   You're using the threat of force to tell people to keep

23   out of a particular market.

24                 Today you are telling us that under your

25   theory of the Hobbs Act and your definition of property,

                                       60

 1   that doesn't count as a Hobbs Act violation.

 2               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, a couple of things,

 3   Justice Sotomayor.     I went back to the Tropiano case,

 4   because it is sort of the pro genitor of this whole line

 5   of Second Circuit cases, and I noticed two things.

 6               One, I noticed it was written by a district

 7   court sitting by designation.              So, I mean, I -- I don't

 8   mean anything by that other than this is not Marbury.

 9               Second, I would say that the second thing I

10   noticed is that the debt -

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Oh, I think when I sat

12   as a district court judge, I would have been insulted by

13   that.

14               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, it's not -- it's a good

15   thing you're no longer sitting in that capacity, Your

16   Honor -

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Okay.    It's really -

18               MR. CLEMENT:         -- because I -- I certainly

19   mean you no offense.       You could write Marbury here.

20               So the -- the difference is, Your Honor,

21   that that could have also been, I think, actually

22   prosecuted as a property crime, because in that case,

23   there were customer accounts that were obtained, and

24   those customer accounts, as the facts of Tropiano

25   discussed it, actually had value; they could have been

                                     61

 1   transferred from one business to another.

 2               So I think what would happen in the Second

 3   Circuit, if you decide this case the way we would like

 4   you to, is the Government's going to have to be careful.

 5   They're going to have to write their indictments to

 6   focus on things like money or obtainable property, and

 7   they can't get sloppy and put together these autonomy

 8   interests and call them property.

 9               Thank you, Your Honor.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

11               The case is submitted.

12               (Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the

13   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
