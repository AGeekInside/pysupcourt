 8                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. KENT SAFRIET

 9                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10                 MR. SAFRIET:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                 Today we ask this Court to expressly

13   recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in

14   terms of relevant precedents, which redefines

15   century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates

16   the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

17                 The Florida Supreme Court suddenly and

18   dramatically redefined littoral property rights,

19   converting oceanfront property into oceanview property

20   to avoid the finding of a taking.             It did so in the

21   context of a beach restoration project which could have

22   been accomplished without taking any private property at

23   all.   Given this Court's jurisprudence that a State's

24   legislative and executive branches cannot violate the

25   Fifth Amendment, we see no reason why the judicial

                                      3

 1   branch should be treated any differently.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought your basic

 3   position in the litigation in Florida was that the

 4   Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and

 5   so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the

 6   legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say,

 7   because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow

 8   is complicit in this violation by the legislature

 9   implemented by the administrative offices.

10               MR. SAFRIET:        That is correct, Your Honor.

11   Below, the case was litigated as one of a taking by the

12   legislature when it passed the Act.

13               When it passed the Beach and Shore

14   Preservation Act, it contained a provision within

15   section 161.141, which is a savings clause, that said to

16   the extent the beach restoration cannot be accomplished

17   without taking property rights, the requesting

18   authorities have to use eminent domain proceedings to

19   take those rights.

20               At the First District Court of Appeal, they

21   agreed with us that the littoral rights were being taken

22   by the Act of the legislature and that those had to be

23   compensated for.     When we arrived at the Florida Supreme

24   Court, again, all of the parties were arguing those

25   issues, whether there was a physical taking of these

                                       4

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   rights or a regulatory taking of these rights by the Act

 2   and whether the savings clause would apply.

 3                 To everybody's shock, the Florida Supreme

 4   Court said:     We're going to go back to step one and

 5   decide you don't have any littoral rights.             The

 6   legislature didn't eliminate any protected littoral

 7   rights that you thought you once had for over a hundred

 8   years as the relevant precedents in common law indicate.

 9   So it was that decision of the Florida Supreme Court,

10   that said you have -- no longer have property, that

11   gives rise to the issue before this Court is, can the

12   Florida Supreme Court redefine those 100-year-old rights

13   to no longer exist?

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Applied in a new

15   situation.    It was never the kind of situation

16   involved here with the beach restoration project.               The

17   -- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation

18   that this case presents.

19                 MR. SAFRIET:      Yes, Your Honor.       There is no

20   precedent with respect to the Beach and Shore

21   Preservation Act as it has ever been applied.                We do

22   concede that.

23                 However, there are two fundamental

24   principles of Florida law that have existed for more

25   than a hundred years, and those are property that must

                                       5

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   ­- property that borders the mean high-water line and

 2   must remain in contact with the mean high-water line to

 3   possess common law littoral rights.                If that connection

 4   is not there, there are no common law littoral rights.

 5   Common law littoral rights are constitutionally

 6   protected and cannot be taken without due process and

 7   just compensation.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, they're -- they're

 9   eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the

10   water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right?

11                  When there's -- when there's avulsion, even

12   at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen

13   that some land between the property owner and -- and the

14   water will be owned by the State.

15                  MR. SAFRIET:     That is correct, Your Honor.

16   Under the --

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, why wasn't this an

18   avulsion?

19                  MR. SAFRIET:     Well, because the avulsion in

20   this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State

21   cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away,

22   and -- and it was --

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, well, well, well.

24   There were -- there were two avulsions.               One was the

25   avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the

                                       6

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   -- the rapid replacement of sand.             That -- that is not a

 2   natural, gradual phenomenon.

 3                MR. SAFRIET:     That is right, Your Honor, but

 4   the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle

 5   that says avulsion can occur by artificial means.            So

 6   there is -- the beach restoration, where they placed

 7   sand on the beach, is not avulsion.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:         If there's no case law, it

 9   seems to me you've lost your case.

10                MR. SAFRIET:     No, the case law specifically

11   says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences,

12   by the action of the wind and the water.            That's what

13   avulsion is in Florida and has been -- you know, for at

14   least 50 years, I believe.          It's --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:         They have a new situation.

16   It's sort of like an avulsion.          It's sort of like an

17   accretion.   The only precedent of -- you keep talking

18   about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in

19   a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland

20   property owner has the right to touch the water.

21                So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court

22   says the purpose of that was to make certain that the

23   upland property owner could go to the water.            And so

24   here we have a case that assures he can go to the water,

25   and they have a new situation, which, as I think

                                     7

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an

 2   avulsion, though of course there are differences.

 3                  So it sounds like a typical common law

 4   situation.     A new situation arises.             You try to apply

 5   old precedent, and they reached the result they did.

 6   Now, what's your response to that?                 Because that's the

 7   argument the other side makes.

 8                  MR. SAFRIET:     The response to that, Your

 9   Honor, is the doctrine of avulsion -- as part of the

10   doctrine of avulsion is the doctrine -- or the right to

11   reclaim what was lost by the landowner.                 So when an

12   avulsion event occurs, the landowner that has lost

13   property has a right under common law to reclaim what

14   they lost.

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:        You didn't lose any.

16   It just went out the front door there.                 The land ended

17   here, and the new avulsion comes in and extends it

18   further.     You didn't lose one inch.             All you lost was

19   the right to touch the water.             But the court here says

20   you in effect have that right because you can walk right

21   over it and get to the water.

22                  MR. SAFRIET:     What -- what was lost in this

23   case, Your Honor, is the right to contact the mean high-

24   water line, and I think there's a distinction between

25   the right to contact the mean high-water line and the

                                       8

 1   water's edge.   The Florida Supreme Court didn't address

 2   the former issue, contact with the mean high-water line.

 3   That's --

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:          Don't you have a right to

 5   walk across and put your boat in the water and swim, and

 6   nobody can stop you?

 7                MR. SAFRIET:       Right.       Across the foreshore,

 8   yes, Your Honor.   And also, as part of the common law

 9   rights of access --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:          Now you have that right.

11   They didn't take that away from you.                 The statute gives

12   it to you.

13                MR. SAFRIET:       That's correct.           We have that

14   right --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If somebody wanted

16   to put up a hot dog stand on this new land, would you

17   have the right to tell them they can't?

18                MR. SAFRIET:       Absolutely not, Your Honor,

19   and that's the point I was getting to.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:          You say "absolutely not."

21   I thought there was a provision in this law that said

22   they cannot put anything on that strip which destroys

23   your right of enjoyment of the upland right.                 Now, if

24   they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at

25   night, doesn't that violate the statute?

 1               MR. SAFRIET:     I think the statute provides

 2   no permanent structures can be constructed on that new

 3   property.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:        It doesn't say anything

 5   about your right to peaceful enjoyment?

 6               MR. SAFRIET:     It certainly does.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:        And what does it say?

 8               MR. SAFRIET:     It says that the -- you know,

 9   your regular common law uses that cannot be --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:        So what does the statute

11   say about your right to have peaceful enjoyment of your

12   land?

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, you can have quiet

14   hot dog stands during the daytime.

15               (Laughter.)

16               MR. SAFRIET:     Yes.      Yes.       It's says no uses

17   of that property can be injurious to the common law --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:        Injurious, okay.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But do you have any

20   --

21               MR. SAFRIET:     Of course, now --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do you have any

23   reason to suppose that that's a redefinition of -- of

24   property that the legislature isn't free to change

25   tomorrow?

 1                MR. SAFRIET:     Yes, the legislature can

 2   change this definition of property.              They can define

 3   property in the State of Florida as to whatever they

 4   want it to be, but if they do so and take property, they

 5   must pay for it under the just compensation clause.

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, before this

 7   legislation, in the seaward side of the land that

 8   belonged to the State, from the mean high-water mark, a

 9   hot dog stand could have sat in the water, correct?

10                MR. SAFRIET:     If somebody wanted to put one

11   in the water, yes, Your Honor.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And someone could have

13   stood there, a boat could have docked there, assuming

14   that it -- it was a shallow boat.

15                You had no control over anyone placing

16   anything on the seaside submerged lands that belonged to

17   the State, outside of whatever regulations the State

18   decided it wanted to impose?

19                MR. SAFRIET:     We had no exclusive right to

20   exclude them from that property.           But they could not

21   unnecessarily interfere with our right to view or our --

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         The ECL that has been

23   created by this legislation -- you gave up any challenge

24   to it -- it was established at that mean water mark,

25   wasn't it?

 1                 MR. SAFRIET:     Yes.      The ECL in this case, as

 2   the case was litigated, was assumed to be located

 3   directly on top of the mean high-water line.            We did not

 4   abandon a challenge to the ECL.            What we abandoned was

 5   any challenge as to where the ECL was placed in relation

 6   to --

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, right now, we just

 8   have to assume that it was -- that it -- it has

 9   established the line at a point where the State owns all

10   the land seaward of the ECL, correct?

11                 MR. SAFRIET:     Yes, Your Honor.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So after this project

13   finishes, that hot water -- that hot dog vendor will be

14   on stateside land, correct?

15                 MR. SAFRIET:     That is correct, Your Honor.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No different than what

17   exists today, before the legislation, which is if the

18   hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it

19   could have?

20                 MR. SAFRIET:     It certainly could sit in a

21   foot of water.

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.   So none of

23   your actual use rights, pleasure rights, or anything

24   else has been changed.       What you're arguing is that --

 1   the Florida State Supreme Court described as the

 2   contingent future possibility that the high-water mark

 3   might change and you could push that hot dog vendor back

 4   another foot or two.

 5                 MR. SAFRIET:     That is correct, Your Honor.

 6   Anybody allowed --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Of course, such -- such

 8   boats floating in -- in the water below the mean high

 9   water mark are available with respect to all littoral

10   properties.    Isn't that right?

11                 MR. SAFRIET:     That is right, Your Honor.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        But what can't happen with

13   other littoral property is that folks can't come in and

14   lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so

15   that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your

16   house?

17                 MR. SAFRIET:     That is correct, Your Honor.

18   The --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        And people pay a lot more

20   money for beach -- beachfront homes, for that reason,

21   don't they?

22                 MR. SAFRIET:     Absolutely, Your Honor.     The

23   value of beachfront property is a premium.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        And that's quite different

25   from having a house behind the beach at Coney Island,

 1   isn't it?

 2                  MR. SAFRIET:     Absolutely, Your Honor.           And

 3   in this case --

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, can you -- can you

 5   explain something that's unclear to me from the briefs

 6   and the records?     That is, there -- this -- what is

 7   referred to as "the foreshore," was that wet all the

 8   time?    I thought the suggestion was that that was in

 9   effect beach, public beach, that people could walk on,

10   not swim in.

11                  MR. SAFRIET:     The foreshore, Your Honor, is

12   typically the land area between the mean high-water line

13   and the low high-water line, and depending on the tide

14   cycles of the day, some of that foreshore is dry, and

15   then at other times --

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And the -- and the public

17   -- what -- what was the situation here?                Was there a

18   strip of dry land that the public has been using?

19                  MR. SAFRIET:     There's -- the foreshore, Your

20   Honor, which is periodically dry on any given day and

21   periodically wet -- the public can use that, and they

22   have always been able to use that.                 That is State-owned

23   land, and they can use that to traverse up and down the

24   beach.    But, again, because it's wet every day, you

25   don't have hot dog vendors putting hot dog stands in the

                                      14

 1   water.   You don't have people laying their blankets in

 2   the water to enjoy that beach.

 3               And what we're talking about here is the

 4   exclusive right to use the dry sand area that stays dry

 5   all of the time in our case, which in our case was a

 6   200-foot stretch of beach before this project began, and

 7   we had 200 feet of beach, and we had the right to

 8   exclude commercial vendors or anybody else from that

 9   property.

10               Now what we have after that, according to

11   this project, is another 80 feet to 100 feet of dry sand

12   beach owned by the State where the landowners have no

13   ability to exclude commercial vendors or any other

14   obnoxious uses of that property.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Who owns that land?     I

16   mean, when it was submerged it belonged to the State.

17   And is it your position that the owners in your

18   organization, that they have title to that land that was

19   once owned by the State?

20               MR. SAFRIET:      Absolutely not, Your Honor.

21   It's our position that the State, as a matter of public

22   use under the Takings Clause, can condemn that property

23   and make a public beach in front of a private one.              They

24   absolutely can do that.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           No, I mean -- I mean,

                                    15

 1   without condemning it, you say the title is held by the

 2   private owners even though the title was held by the

 3   State when the land was submerged.

 4                MR. SAFRIET:     No, Your Honor, I'm not saying

 5   that the landowners own that new 80-foot stretch of

 6   beach now, as it currently exists.               What we argue is we

 7   own to the erosion control line, which is the property

 8   boundary that the State created in this case.               And the

 9   State, by operation of the Act, claims title to the new

10   80-foot strip of beach.     And what we're trying to obtain

11   here is the State to go through eminent domain

12   proceedings to pay us compensation for the loss of

13   littoral rights that they're taking by creating this

14   public strip of beach.

15                Now, the State may at the end of the day

16   say, well, we're not going to claim title to that; we're

17   going to reinstate your boundary as the mean high-water

18   line -- that would be 80 feet further out -- and no

19   compensation, in that case, would be due.               But --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It would be -- what

21   would your position be, assuming you still have title,

22   you still have the right of littoral title, contact with

23   the water?   Would you concede that the State has

24   different regulatory interests with respect to that new

25   strip of land versus the old strip of land?

                                    16

 1                  It's still your property.             The State can

 2   regulate your property.       Presumably, they regulate your

 3   beach property now.     Would their different -- would

 4   their authority to regulate be greater with respect to

 5   the new area?

 6                  MR. SAFRIET:     As the owner of the property,

 7   Your Honor?     If the State owned that property?

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No.   Your -- you

 9   would still have the title to the property.

10                  MR. SAFRIET:     Okay.

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It's still your

12   property.     You know, the State regulates property all

13   the time, in zoning -- would their authority be broader

14   with respect to that new land than with respect to the

15   old?

16                  MR. SAFRIET:     No, Your Honor, I don't think

17   so.    The State already has broad authority to regulate

18   property already, and then would -- I wouldn't see any

19   need for them to have any broader authority for that new

20   strip of beach if our members owned it.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Sometimes -- and I

22   don't actually know what the law is on this.                  Sometimes

23   the State builds, you know, sidewalks in front of

24   people.     Maybe they do it on their own land, and they

25   say:   We're putting this easement, and people can walk

                                      17

 1   across it.     Would this be in the same category of public

 2   project?     They say, well, it's your land because you

 3   have a right to the mean high-water land, but we built

 4   it so we have greater rights with respect to regulation

 5   than we might have with respect to the natural beach.

 6                 MR. SAFRIET:      No, Your Honor, I don't think

 7   they would have any greater rights to that.               I mean, if

 8   -- if the landowners are the fee-simple title owner,

 9   then the State has its basic police powers to regulate

10   as it would any other land, absent some type of easement

11   or reservation of our agreement with the landowners that

12   give them greater rights and --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         The State gave you some

14   quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is

15   projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly,

16   because your -- your property is being eroded, which is

17   the reason the State went into this.               And what the State

18   has given you in exchange is that if and when there is

19   further erosion, you will continue to own up to whatever

20   this new line is called.

21                 MR. SAFRIET:      ECL.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         The ECL.     You will continue

23   to -- to own up to there, despite the fact that under

24   common law when there's more erosion, your -- your line

25   would recede to the new mean high-water mark.               So, you

                                      18

 1   know, who -- who knows?     Maybe that's sufficient

 2   compensation.   You know, if you go in and ask for

 3   compensation, the State might say, you know, we've given

 4   them -- given them this property right in exchange, and

 5   the difference between that and what they have now is

 6   two dollars.

 7                MR. SAFRIET:     That -- that may well be the

 8   case, Your Honor, but, again, they haven't provided us

 9   the opportunity to go to that trial, that jury trial, to

10   argue that these -- the value of this new 75-foot

11   stretch of beach on top of the 200-foot stretch of beach

12   provides value above and beyond the taking of the --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let me ask you this

14   question on Florida valuation.            Assume you prevail,

15   there's a cause of action for a taking.            You have a

16   beachfront area, beachfront home, in which there's a

17   hurricane and there's a loss of the beach and a sudden

18   drop, so that it's now a 60-foot -- a 60-foot drop.             The

19   State comes in and says the only way we can fix this

20   is to extend the beach and make it a larger beach on

21   what was formerly our submerged land.            And it does that

22   that.   Under -- and it -- and it has the same rule.

23                Under your view, is the State required to

24   pay you for the loss of your right of contact to the

25   beach, your littoral right, because there's let's say

                                    19

 1   another 100 foot of new beach?              Are they entitled to

 2   offset that against the enhanced value to your property

 3   by reason of the fact that they've saved it from further

 4   erosion and have given you a beach where there was none

 5   before?

 6                  MR. SAFRIET:     Yes, Your Honor, they are able

 7   to offset that, and the -- the statute provides for that

 8   offsetting such that in an eminent domain proceedings

 9   whatever value the landowners lost as a result of their

10   -- losing their contact with the mean high-water line,

11   that any benefit provided by the additional sand would

12   be offset --

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So the enhancement from

14   the post-project benefit is a credit to the State in the

15   takings action?

16                  MR. SAFRIET:     That -- that is according to

17   the statute that was passed, Your Honor.

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Did any of these beachfront

19   owners think this was a good deal, that the State has

20   prevented further erosion of their land and, you know,

21   the price they pay for that is that they have this

22   60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and

23   that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're

24   lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back?

 3   it's a bad deal.    And they're guaranteed against --

 4   against further loss of property because they will

 5   continue to own up to that -- to that new line, even

 6   if it's all covered by water.

 7                 MR. SAFRIET:     No, Your Honor.      Our --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Nobody -- nobody thought it

 9   was a good deal?    Everybody thought that they had been

10   done out of something?

11                 MR. SAFRIET:     With respect to the

12   Petitioner's members, they thought it was a bad deal,

13   Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Petitioner's members, but

15   other people along -- along the same coast?           I mean, if

16   I had a place and it's being -- it's being eroded by

17   hurricanes constantly, you know, I -- I'm not sure

18   whether I wouldn't -- wouldn't want to have the sand

19   replaced, even at the -- at the cost of having a 60-foot

20   stretch that the State owns.

21                 MR. SAFRIET:     I think that's the fundamental

22   misunderstanding in this case.           The beach was not

23   eroding.   It was not lapping under these houses.            There

24   was 200 feet of dry beach, and the beach is accreting,

25   meaning it grows gradually, day by day or week by week.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But what happened?      There

 2   were a succession of hurricanes, I thought.

 3                 MR. SAFRIET:     With the exception of

 4   hurricanes.    But hurricanes are, again, avulsive events

 5   that don't change the property boundary line.               We talked

 6   about the right to reclaim earlier.               So this is an a

 7   accreting beach, 200-foot accreting beach.               These

 8   property owners did not view that they were gaining

 9   anything.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        It may not change the

11   property line, but all of your property might be under

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Could the State sell

 7   this new land to somebody else?

 8                MR. SAFRIET:     Yes.        There's no reason they

 9   couldn't, because they own the fee-simple title to it,

10   as well as they could send the sovereign submerged lands

11   in front of the property.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it would be subject to

13   the easement that the State acknowledges you have, which

14   is the easement of access?

15                MR. SAFRIET:     I'm not sure it would be, Your

16   Honor.   The statute provides that right of access --

19   easement per se that inheres in our title.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, no.     As I understand

22   and exclusive -- or exclusive -- or exclusive, common

23   law littoral rights:   right to have access, right to

24   reasonable use of the water, right to accretion and

25   reliction, right to the unobstructed view.               They can't

 3   law rights anymore, Your Honor, because we don't --

 6   line.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The -- the hypothetical is

 8   the State says that the property owner, the upland

 9   owner, has these rights.      The Chief Justice asked you,

10   could this property be sold?            I think the answer would

11   be yes, but it would be subject to the continuance of

12   that easement in the dominant estate.             That has to be

13   the answer under the supreme court's opinion.             Now, you

14   may not agree with that.

15                MR. SAFRIET:     Under the supreme court's

16   opinion, yes, because it purports to reserve common law

17   rights across this new stretch of State-owned beach.

18   It's our contention that all common law rights have been

19   lost when we lose connection to the mean high-water

20   line.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           All right.   That gets to

22   the question, if we agree with you that there is such a

23   thing as a judicial takings, what is the standard by

24   which we decide when the Federal courts can and must

25   intervene to disagree with the -- with the State law and

                                    24

 1   to characterize it as a taking when the State has said

 2   that it is not?     Would we just find all sorts of

 3   adjectives -- it's sudden, unexpected, unfounded -- we

 4   just have a string of adjectives, sort of like an

 5   adequate independent State ground rule or something?

 6                 MR. SAFRIET:      Yes, Your Honor, that would be

 7   the test that we would suggest, as Justice Stewart noted

 8   in his concurring opinion in Hughes.               And the test we

 9   would propose is that a judicial taking occurs when a

10   State court effects a sudden and dramatic change in

11   State law, unpredictable in terms of relevant

12   precedents, that have no fair or substantial support in

13   well-established background principles of State law.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Okay, I'm familiar with

15   that opinion.     Now, in this case, number one, it seems

16   to me that in order to do that, we have to become real

17   experts in Florida law.

18                 Number two, once we do that it seems to me

19   that this opinion really addresses something that's --

20   that's new, and it's -- it's grounded in common law

21   doctrines.    It's a close case.            It might have gone

22   either way.     Let's assume that.           Does there have to be

23   some finding that the State decision is clearly

24   unreasonable?     I mean, if it's a close case, does the

25   State win under your test?

 1                 MR. SAFRIET:      Your Honor, I think the test 

 2   - again, the fair and substantial support -- provides

 3   adequate deference to the State court.              And in

 4   objectively reviewing the precedents, this Court doesn't

 5   have to become an expert in State law.              It merely has to

 6   review those precedents to make sure that the Florida

 7   Supreme Court in fact relied on background principles of

 8   law rather than creating nonexistent rules of State

 9   substantive law --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, it seems to me that,

11   reading the opinion, I -- I can get there.              There was

12   some talk about the Belvedere case as helping you.              I

13   thought it did not at all.          That was a very odd case

14   where the easement is wholly separated from the

15   dominant.     It's the reverse.           They take the main

16   property and leave the easement, rather than vice versa.

17   So I just thought that was irrelevant.

18                 MR. SAFRIET:      Yes, the case law, Your Honor,

19   and the incremental changes that we are dealing with

20   here that would be part of your test is the government

21   or the State can gradually change these property rights

22   or property laws so long as they leave the owner with

23   the rights.     And in this case what the Florida Supreme

24   Court has done is said:       We're not just gradually

25   changing them and leaving you with these common law

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        I thought Martin was -- the

10   Martin case was -- was pretty close, the lake that --

22   didn't they cite it?

23                  MR. SAFRIET:     It's not weird, because in

 2   that case dealt with a property boundary dispute.                It

 8   you think that's true?      When I read it, it seemed to me

 9   to deal with reliction precisely.

10                MR. SAFRIET:     I do think that's true,

 1               Let me go ahead and address some issues that

 2   have come up about Florida law.          Number one, this idea

 3   of artificial avulsion that was discussed earlier, the

 4   Bryant v. Peppe case, which cites the Martin -- that was

 5   discussed in the Martin case, talks about when the State

 6   comes in on its own property and either lowers the water

 7   or, in this case, puts sand on the -- on the State side

 8   of the property line, that that's an artificial

 9   avulsion, the State retains title to its State lands,

10   the upland owner, the private property owner retains

11   ownership of their land.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I suppose it depends

13   on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens.              I

14   mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot

15   a year, is that an avulsion or accretion?

16               MR. MAKAR:     Well, it would be an avulsion.

17   It would still be the State adding sand to its side of

18   the line.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, is your view

20   whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion?

21               MR. MAKAR:     If it's on -- if it's on its

22   property, that's absolutely the case.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why is that?        I thought

24   avulsion by definition is a sudden change.

25               MR. MAKAR:     No, no.       Under, Florida Law the

 1   Bryant v. Peppe case, which was an avulsion case that

 2   arose out of a hurricane, where there was land that

 3   was previously submerged, it came up, it was over State

 4   property, the private owners wanted to get the -- get

 5   it, and they asserted that it was theirs in accretion,

 6   and the court said no, and it cited to Martin.               There's

 7   no right to having contact with the water.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why -- you're -- we're

 9   wandering off the point.       Why wasn't it an avulsion?          It

10   was an avulsion in that case, wasn't it, because it was

11   sudden?

12                 MR. MAKAR:    But it was done by the State.

13   I'm sorry, maybe I'm confusing cases.

18   avulsion is an accretion if it's done by the State?

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Or vice versa.       What would

23                 MR. MAKAR:    No, no, no.           An -- an accretion

12   it's gradual, even though the State is doing it, it can

13   be an accretion, right?

15   perceptible --

22   years --

 1   of accretion and avulsion to things that are done by the

 2   State?    If someone owns beachfront property, they

 3   accept -- they -- they understand the risk that a

 4   hurricane may cause avulsion, a hurricane may knock down

 5   their house.    Does that mean the State could come in and

13   You're taking a concept that has to do with a risk that

14   you bear because of the -- the vagaries of -- of the

15   weather and storms, and you're applying it to something

 1   applied it to things that are produced by the State.

 2                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, there's no question under

 3   Florida law that the State has the right on its

 4   sovereignty lands to control those lands and use those for

 5   the public trust.    And what the Florida legislature did

 6   40 years ago -- keeping in mind this has been on the

 7   books 40 years, 200 miles of beaches have been restored

 8   over those years, and no one has complained that this is

 9   a taking of property.      That -- it's a reasoned response

10   for the Florida Supreme Court to come in and say, okay,

11   they're challenging the Act.             They say it denies

12   them two things:    the right to future accretion and the

13   right to have contact with the water.

14                 Martin v. Busch and Bryant v. Peppe say,

15   look, if -- you don't have a right of contact with the

16   water, if you have avulsion or if you have it in -- in

17   Martin, it was a State drainage project.

19   arguing about the application of a doctrine to this

20   case.    I'd like to step back if I can and talk about

21   the doctrine through a hypothetical, if that's all

22   right.

 1   beachfront property is now where the sand starts, and

 2   not the mean high-water mark but the mean high-sand

 3   mark.   All right?   And -- and then -- so that's sued.

 4   You -- you sue under that, and the court says:                 Yes, of

 5   course, that's a taking; our precedents have always said

 6   it's the mean high-water line and nothing else.

 7                 Florida has judicial elections.               Say,

 8   somebody runs for election for the Florida Supreme Court

18                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, I think it would -- if

19   it -- if it's -- it sounds like this is the Cannon Beach

20   situation, where the court judicially said, okay, you

21   don't own to the mean high-water line; now you own up --

22   only up to the vegetation line.             Or something along

23   those lines where it was an ouster.               Here there's no

24   ouster of property rights.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, no.   I know.

 1   You're changing --

 2                MR. MAKAR:     Right.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I understand you

 4   have a different view about here.             But under my

 5   hypothetical, would you agree that the action of the

 6   Florida Supreme Court is a taking?

 7                MR. MAKAR:     Yes, I would -- I would

 8   countenance that -- that here we have a far different

 9   situation, which we have an act of the legislature that

10   draws this line, and that the two attributes that they

11   are claiming have no basis whatsoever in background

12   principles of Florida law.         There is no case they can

13   point to, to say that we have a right of contact --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, what they say is the

15   following -- this is what they say, I think:                They point

16   to a case called Sand Key, and in Sand Key it says

17   littoral property rights include the following vested

18   rights:   One, the right of access to the water,

19   including the right to have the property's contact with

20   the water remain intact.       That's what the court said.

21                 And in the court's opinion what it says

22   about that is it says, in this case, the Act expressly

23   protects the right of access to the water, which is the

24   sole justification for the subsidiary right of contact.

 1   in Sand Key, and they're asking why was it there in Sand

 2   Key, and that's what they come up with.

 3                  Now, after this sentence I just read you,

 4   there is no citation.       So I want you to add anything you

 5   would like to say why this is, that sentence I read you,

 6   justifiable under Florida law.

 7                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, you're talking about the

 8   legislation.

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:        No --

10                  MR. MAKAR:    I'm talking about the Sand Key

11   --

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:        I'm giving you what I took

13   was -- I don't want to characterize the answer.             I might

14   have found it sufficient, others might not have.             I

15   don't know.     I'm saying they point to Sand Key.          I've

16   read you what I thought was the answer.

17                  MR. MAKAR:    Oh, sure.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Tell me if I'm right, and

19   if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer,

20   justify it, if you can.

21                  MR. MAKAR:    Sure.        What they're citing to is

22   some dicta in Sand Key that had nothing to do with the

23   holding of that case, and if you try to go back and look

24   at the citations to the cases that Sand Key cites for

25   that proposition of contact with the water, none of them

                                      37

 1   have to do with contact with water.

 2                Instead, the most important point is to look

 3   at Martin v. Busch, which was a case where the State

 4   lowered the water in a lake, the upland owners at -- the

 5   property line was determined not to have moved, they

 6   didn't have any contact with the water any longer, and

 7   the submerged sovereignty lands became the State's

 8   property.   There's no right of contact there.        It's --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Sand Key's statement

10   strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think

11   that's -- that's the view of the common law.         I -- I

12   don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida.          I

13   think it would be very strange to have a principle that

14   all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to

15   access the water and not the right to be on the water,

16   to have his property on the water.

17                I think -- I think in every State,

18   beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that

19   that's the case.

20                So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key

21   was just expressing what -- what was the common law.

22   And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the

23   contact with the water is so that you can have access,

24   that is -- is that not silly?

25                MR. MAKAR:    No.      Well, two points here I

 1   would like to make.     Number one, let's assume there was

 2   an avulsive event that added sand on the State's

 3   property along the beach line, so now we have the

 4   property line not changing, it's exactly where it was

 5   before, but now we have, say, 75 feet of sand, new sand

 6   seaward, over the State's property.                 That's the State's

 7   property --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But that's not the

 9   question.   I mean, you just said that, let's assume the

10   -- assuming the property line doesn't change.                 The other

11   side is saying the property line is the mean high-water

12   line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State,

13   mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do

14   that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean

15   high-water line.

16                 MR. MAKAR:     But -- but -- well -- but under

17   this avulsive event where there is sand added seaward,

18   the contact by the upland owner with the water no longer

19   exists, and that's been on the books in Florida for --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Yes, but that's

21   because you think the property line is the ECL rather

22   than the MHWL.

23                 MR. MAKAR:     I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

24   What I'm talking about is put the Act aside and just say

25   at common law in Florida.         If the sand is added through

 1   avulsive events, the upland owner has no contact with

 2   the water any longer.      They certainly have access.                And

 3   the Florida Act is so solicitous of protecting the

 4   property rights of riparian ownership.                 You go through

 5   the statute, and you see they preserve common law

 6   littoral -- littoral rights.              They have a section --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would that person still be

 8   considered a littoral owner?

 9               MR. MAKAR:       That was my second point.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:           After there has been the

11   avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60

12   feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a

13   riparian owner?     I thought --

14               MR. MAKAR:       Absolutely, absolutely.            And

15   that's a major misnomer in this case, is that the upland

16   owner here, even after the beach restoration project,

17   has riparian littoral property.             That's what the Florida

18   Supreme Court has held, that's what the Florida

19   legislation says.     There's --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but it's not

21   -- it's not the same as the property right he held

22   before, right?

23               MR. MAKAR:       I -- I would disagree with that,

24   Mr. Chief Justice.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So he can exclude

 1   people from the additional 60 feet?

 2                 MR. MAKAR:    But it's not his -- it's not

 3   their property.    It's the State's --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But, that's what

 5   the case is about.

 6                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, I -- I agree that's what

 7   they have tried to make it about.             What they've said is

 8   the State now has this swath of sand.               It's a barrier to

 9   protect against erosion.       It's no wider than this

10   courtroom.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, suppose that --

12   suppose that a city decided that it wanted to attract

13   more students who are going to the beach in Florida for

14   spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going

15   to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned

16   homes.    Under the decision of the Florida Supreme Court,

17   I don't see anything that would stop the city from doing

18   that.    So you could have -- you could have televised

19   spring break beach parties in front of -- of somebody's

20   house.    Now, in -- as a practical matter, doesn't that

21   have a real effect on the value of the property?

22                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, Justice Alito, in

23   response, what I'd say here is keep in mind this is the

24   Beach and Shore Preservation Act.             It isn't designed to

25   create some recreational playground for spring breakers.

 1   It's designed to --

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:       No, I understand that, but

 3   if the -- but the Florida Supreme Court said that there

 4   isn't any right -- if there is a manmade extension of

 5   the beach, there is no right to exclude people from it;

 6   it's -- the beach is owned by the State.                So all of that

 7   could take place, couldn't it?

 8                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, not under the Act, because

 9   -- here's why:     Under the Act, what has to be done is a

10   survey.     And you'd have the --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        He's not talking about the

12   Act.     He's just talking about your theory of the case.

13   Your theory of what the rights of beachfront owners

14   consist of would permit this to happen, if not under

15   this Act, under some other act, right?

16                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, if there was -- if there

17   were some other act where the legislature passes a

18   law --

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Right.       Well, it's the

20   Spring Break Act of 2010, okay?

21                  (Laughter.)

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        They could do that,

23   couldn't they?

24                  MR. MAKAR:    Well --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Under your theory of the

 1   case?

 2                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, they -- they would, but

 3   the point being is that they would have to preserve the

 4   littoral rights of --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why do we have to say

 6   that?    I mean, they're writing a -- a -- an opinion here

 7   against a background of an act, and as I read that

 8   opinion -- you can add something to this if you want --

 9   I make a list of what they say in effect provides, not

10   perfectly, but provides, roughly, the same kind of

11   protection that the Sand Key statement provided.

12                 One, you can go to the water; two, you have

13   a right of ingress and egress, if that's any different

14   from the first.    I'm not positive.              Three, you have a

15   right under the Act that nobody can put anything on that

16   strip which is injurious to the upland owner.                All

17   right?

18                 So those are at least three things, and I

19   think there's a fourth.      Yes, the fourth is that nobody

20   can build anything there that is harmful, except if it's

21   to do with the environment; that's not harmful, that's

22   helpful to the beach owner.          It's supposed to be

23   helpful.   And, five, you get your beach guaranteed.

24                 So all of those things are things you get

25   under this Act in an intermediate case where it's a

                                     43

 1   little like an avulsion and a little not like an

 2   avulsion.    Now, do I add anything to my list?              And do

 3   you have to go beyond that?

 4                 MR. MAKAR:    No, well, there's -- there's

 5   even more, Justice Breyer.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay, that's what I wanted

 7   to know.    What more?

 8                 MR. MAKAR:    What the legislature in Florida

 9   did as well is to say that when they do the survey, as

10   you see in the document attached in the joint appendix,

11   they have to set out what the width of the berm will be,

12   the sacrificial sand that's there to erode away over

13   time.   They put the width in there.              And in this

14   particular instance, it's about 75 feet.                And it's going

15   to erode away.    That cannot be increased without the

16   consent of the owners.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So why doesn't --

18   why don't you take your list and Justice Breyer's list

19   and submit that in the just compensation hearing?                When

20   the landowner comes in and says, look, you have taken my

21   property and it is worth $100,000, and you come in and

22   say oh, no, no; it's not worth $100,000; look at all

23   these things we saved and gave you.               It's only -- what

24   you have lost is only worth $20,000.                And a court will

25   review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what

 1   you get.

 2                MR. MAKAR:     Well, because, Mr. Chief

 3   Justice, under background principles of Florida law,

 4   they have no right to contact with the water, and this

 5   accretion right is --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Again, that is what

 7   the whole case is about, whether they have a right to

 8   contact the water or not.        It seems to me if your only

 9   answer to every question is they don't have the right,

10   you're just completely begging the question.

11               MR. MAKAR:    But under -- with due respect,

12   under Florida law, they don't.           And the --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:      Well, isn't the question

14   here that the reason they don't under Florida law is in

15   a situation where the law isn't clear, we draw the

16   Florida law this way rather than that way, and that is a

17   reasonable common law decision because of the six points

18   that we've listed on the list?

19                MR. MAKAR:     Absolutely.           Given this --

 1                  (Laughter.)

 2                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, certainly our position is

 3   that there's no --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        You won't disagree with

 5   that.

 6                  (Laughter.)

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Do you know the answer to

 8   the question that was asked of your colleague?                 That is,

 9   here we have an organization representing several

10   landowners.     Is there any indication about how these

11   beachfront owners in these communities -- what their

12   view is, that they are benefited, that they are harmed?

13   Is there any indication of that?

14                  MR. MAKAR:    Other than these Petitioners,

15   Justice Ginsburg, no one has complained about this and

16   said that -- and brought an action or -- or otherwise.

17   This is a very beneficial program.                 It's basically a

18   beachfront property protection act, so it's sort of

19   anomalous that anyone would complain.

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the problem with the

21   argument that I'm having is that in the last colloquy

22   with Justice Breyer, we heard how reasonable this act

23   was.    That's one thing.     But you have taken the position

 2   not a taking.     But what about -- what do you call those

 3   -- the spring fling, the spring break --

 6   permanent oceanography museum?

 7                 MR. MAKAR:     Sure, Justice Kennedy.           We have

 8   cases in Florida, for example, where a bridge was built

 9   entirely across the view of the -- of the river, and the

10   upland owner in that situation had a total impairment of

11   their right to view, and that's compensable.               So -- so

12   -- but here what we have --

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And this statute

14   provides --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This very statute says if

17   -- if what happens is a taking, then there's

18   compensation.

19                 MR. MAKAR:     Right.         That said --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And you think there's a

21   taking as a matter of Georgia -- pardon me, of Florida

22   law if enjoyment of the view and access is substantially

23   impaired?     I mean, is that the test?

24                 MR. MAKAR:     That's the law in Florida,

25   Justice Kennedy, is that if there's a substantial

 1   impairment.     There's cases that say that --

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So on behalf of the

 3   State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the

 4   list of good things that the land owner gets, if the

 5   legislature next year takes them away, that would be a

 6   taking?

 7                  MR. MAKAR:    Sure, if they took away the --

 8   the swath of littoral rights or a substantial portion,

 9   that would be highly problematic and likely be a taking.

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you think that either

11   all of the time or some of the time a public beach

12   would -- that intervenes between the upland and the

13   water would be a substantial impairment of the upland

14   owner's rights?

15                  MR. MAKAR:    No, no, no.           The -- the State

16   owns the beach, and let me make this analogy.

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That -- that's exactly my

18   point.     You say that the State owns the beach, and it's

19   okay because there's a protection against unreasonable

20   use.     And I'm asking whether or not a State beach with,

21   what do you call them, port-a-johns and hot dog stands

22   and so forth, isn't a substantial impairment of the

23   upland owner's use?     And you say, well, the State owns

24   it --

25                  MR. MAKAR:    Well --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that takes away from

 2   your earlier argument that we don't need to worry

 3    because there can be no interference with substantial

 4   enjoyment.   And it seems to me that Justice Alito's

 5   question has still not been answered in your argument.

 6                MR. MAKAR:    Well, I believe the answer is

 7   that this is a facial challenge.            There could be an

 8   as-applied challenge.     Keep in mind, the association

 9   here owns no property.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I want you to talk to me

11   about what the constitutional law ought to be in this

12   case as a general matter.       We'll figure out facial and

13   -- and as-applied later.      I still see that your argument

14   leaves open this question in my mind raised by the

15   concerns that Justice Alito has expressed.

16                MR. MAKAR:    Well -- and the Florida Supreme

17   Court was very careful in narrowing its decision and

18   saying that the actual property owners may pursue, if

19   they feel -- beyond this opinion, they may pursue an

20   as-applied claim, where they -- this has no takings

21   record before this Court whatsoever, and that would have

22   to be developed, keeping in mind that much ­-

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But when they do, they're

24   going to be met by you when you're in the trial court

 1               MR. MAKAR:       Well, just because the State

 2   owns the property doesn't mean there cannot be an

 3   impairment of the -- of the right.                 This is an analogy

 4   to say this was a road where -- if I might --

 6   your thought.

 7               MR. MAKAR:       Sure.        That if this were a road

 8   and the traffic -- there's a country road and there's

 9   very little traffic, and over the years the traffic

10   built up, that somehow the owner of the property along

11   that road would have a cause of action.                 It's just not

20   please the Court:

21               From the outset, this case has been a

22   challenge to the actions of the Florida legislature and

23   its executive branch in enacting and implementing the

24   Beach Restoration Act.

25               That is a conventional takings claim and

 1   that is the way I think it is most useful for this Court

 2   to approach it.    Rather than seizing on particular

 3   statements in the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court

 4   and regarding the Florida Supreme Court's judicial act

 5   as itself a taking, it's best to focus on the Act

 6   itself.

 7               And with respect to the Act itself, what --

 8   what has happened here is the State has exercised, not

 9   just sovereign regulatory rights; it has exercised

10   critical sovereign proprietary rights.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Kneedler, that's

12   a clever ploy.    We're talking about judicial takings and

13   you say, don't look at what the court did; look at what

14   the legislature did.    That changes the whole ball game.

15               MR. KNEEDLER:        Well, but -- but, in

16   fairness, first of all, that's how this case originated,

17   was a challenge --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                There's no choice.

19   If their argument is what the court did constituted the

20   taking, they couldn't have raised that earlier --

21               MR. KNEEDLER:        No.     My --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- and said, oh, we

23   think we know that the court is going to change things.

24               MR. KNEEDLER:        My -- my point isn't -- isn't

25   so much about whether it could have been raised earlier.

 1   It is that what -- what is -- what is being objected to

 2   here is a -- is a -- this was not a judicial

 3   declaration, for example, that somebody who has littoral

 4   property can walk up to the edge of the water and can't

 5   touch it.   There was no abstract declaration on littoral

 6   rights.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Judicial -- judicial

 8   taking if that were the case?

 9                  MR. KNEEDLER:      That -- that would be more

10   like Hughes.     I'm not sure that I would analyze it as a

11   judicial taking.     I think another way --

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        No, no, no --

13                  MR. KNEEDLER:      -- to come at this --

14   and this may even be suggested in -- in Justice Scalia's

15   dissent in the Cannon Beach case -- is that the -- the

16   usual principle that where State law is interposed in a

17   way that would -- would defeat a Federal constitutional

18   right, a court can look to see whether there is a fair

19   and substantial basis for it.

20                  That's not really a -- there's no need to

21   fashion a new judicial taking doctrine when you have --

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why not?        Because --

23   because what they said is:          We have a right to touch the

24   water, and you've taken it.           That's what they said this

25   Act does.

 1                MR. KNEEDLER:        Right, and --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:          The court said:      You've

 3   never had that right.      And it's just like a person who

 4   owns 40 acres in the middle of Vermont, and the State

 5   wants to build a nuclear power plant, and they say, you

 6   have to pay us.     No, says the State.            And the court of

 7   the State upholds it on the ground there is an implicit

 8   easement under Blackstone to take land for power plants

 9   without paying for it; it's called the power plant

10   easement.   Okay?

11                Now, in such a case, it would be the

12   judicial taking because their ground is not -- whatever

13   you normally have, but their ground is you never had

14   that property right in the first place.

15                Now, how -- if that ever were to happen --

16   and that probably, perhaps, is not this case, but if

17   that ever were to happen, wouldn't there have to be a

18   remedy under the Constitution for it?

19                MR. KNEEDLER:        And -- and maybe so, but --

20   but, again, I think it -- it would be possible to -- to

21   review it under the general principle about whether a

22   State interpretation of State law that would defeat a

23   claim to Federal right would be without any fair or

24   substantial basis, without -- without saying that the

25   supreme court itself has committed an unconstitutional

 1   act.    It -- it could be looked at that way.

 2                But if I -- but if I could turn to the --

 3   the operation of this statute, what -- what has happened

 4   here is -- as this Court has recognized in numerous

 5   cases, the authority of the State over its submerged

 6   lands is a critical aspect of sovereignty.                It is held

 7   in trust for the public and for public uses, and what

 8   has happened here is the State, with respect to its own

 9   sovereign lands, has filled that land.                That does not

10   change the ownership of the sovereign lands.

11                They remain sovereign lands, and the State

12   has done it for a critical public purpose, to protect --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Accretion --

14   accretion, of course, would change.

15                MR. KNEEDLER:       Accretion --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It would take

17   submerged State land and give it to the landowner.

18                MR. KNEEDLER:       Accretion would, but -- but

19   avulsion or rapid change would not.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So a foot -- I'll

21   get back to what I raised earlier.                A foot a year, if

22   the State does it and it's a foot a year, does the

23   property owner get the foot, or does the State get the

24   foot?

25                MR. KNEEDLER:       I -- I don't want to quibble,

                                     54

 1   but I think it depends.      The -- the Florida Supreme

 2   Court's decision in Sand Key was a situation where the

 3   State had -- had erected a jetty or an offshore

 4   structure that caused sand to accrete on the -- on the

 5   property, and the Florida Supreme Court said that

 6   belongs to the littoral property owner under the

 7   doctrine of -- of accretion.

 8                On the other hand, if the State came along

 9   once a year, on one day, and added a foot, that would

10   not be gradual and imperceptible, but would be quite

11   perceptible because the State would have added a foot of

12   property.   And even though it's a small avulsion, I

13   think it -- I think it would still count as an avulsion.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So it makes a

15   difference whether it's done in a day or done in a

16   month?

17                MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, the -- the difference

18   between accretion and avulsion is whether it's gradual

19   and imperceptible or whether it's -- whether it's

20   dramatic or --

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What authority is there in

22   Florida law or in general law to say that the act of

23   an -- an artificial person is an accretion or avulsion,

24   instead of just an act of nature?            What -- what case do

 1               MR. KNEEDLER:         Well, the Florida Supreme

 2   Court's decision in the -- in the Peppe case relied on

 3   Martin v. Busch, which -- I agree with Justice Scalia,

 4   it's very critical here, where there was State action in

 5   draining the lake, which exposed the surface -- the --

 6   the formerly submerged land, and the Florida Supreme

 7   Court said that land belongs to the State, it was action

 8   by the State in a dramatic way.

 9               And Florida --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But -- but did they call

11   it an avulsion?

12               MR. KNEEDLER:         They -- they did not there,

13   but in -- but in --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              That -- that -- so that

15   doesn't answer my question.

16               MR. KNEEDLER:         No, but my point was, in

17   Peppe, where -- where there was actually an avulsion,

18   the court characterized what happened in Martin v. Busch

19   as an avulsive act.     But you don't need to label

20   avulsion, because there's a separate doctrine that when

21   the State fills its own land, it remains its own land.

22               And I'd like to point out -- this is not

23   a unique doctrine --

24               JUSTICE ALITO:          Can I just ask you this,

 1   I agree, Martin v. Busch seems to be the case that's

 2   most -- provides the greatest support for what the

 3   Florida Supreme Court did here.           But what do we do about

 4   the fact that the Florida Supreme Court didn't rely on it?

 5                MR. KNEEDLER:      I -- I think it is

 6   surprising, although the Florida Supreme Court did

 7   discuss avulsion, but if -- if I could just make one

 8   point.   This is not a -- a unique notion in Florida law.

 9                This Court's decision in

10   Hughes v. Washington, which dealt with accretion,

11   responded to the -- to the point that was -- that was

12   made there and said, well, the -- the littoral property

13   right is vulnerable anyway because the owner of the

14   adjacent submerged lands can always take action on his

15   own lands that could affect what the upland property

16   owner did.

17                And this -- and this Court said, yes, that's

18   right, but we're talking, here, about natural causes.

19   And in -- in Hughes, the Court cited two cases, one in

20   Washington State, for example, where the -- where there

21   was an absolute right to fill the submerged lands even

22   if that completely cut off access.

23                It also pointed out another case, from New

24   Jersey, where -- where the -- a case of this -- from

25   this Court, where the Court said, you have a right to

 4   your --

 7   what is your view on the hypothetical I posed to your --

 8   to your friend?    The legislature moves it to the

 9   vegetation line.    The State supreme court says that's a

10   taking.   Somebody runs for election to the State supreme

11   court, saying, I'm going to change that.                 He's elected.

12   He changes the law.

13                 Is that a judicial taking?

15   analyze it under the fair and substantial basis.                 But,

16   yes, if there -- if there is no justification in

17   background law, if it's basically pretextual in the

18   same way that -- that any --

20   it's not pretextual.

 2   unforeseen and indefensible.

 3               I mean, if -- if there's just -- if there's

 4   just -- if it's just ipse dixit.           But there -- but

 5   there -- but that's by no means true here.           And it's

 6   important that Martin v. Busch was cited in the two --

 7   and distinguished in the two principal cases on which

 8   the Petitioner relies here.

 9               In Sand Key, the court distinguished Martin

10   v. Busch on the ground that in Sand Key it was an

11   accretion, but -- and it distinguished Martin v. Busch

12   on the -- on the ground that there it was a -- it was a

13   sudden, dramatic action by the State, and the -- and the

14   same thing was also true in the Florida National case,

15   where the -- the court again distinguished --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel --

17               MR. KNEEDLER:       -- Martin v. Busch on that

18   ground.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Would you have

20   answered Justice Scalia's question that there's a

21   common -- a generally understood common law right,

22   littoral right, to contact with the water?           Would you

23   say there is not?

24               MR. KNEEDLER:       I would -- I would say

25   there -- I would say it's tied up with the right of

                                    59

 1   access, as long as the littoral property owner remains

 2   adjacent to the water.

 3                But what you have here is a neighboring

 4   property owner, the sovereign, exercising critical

 5   sovereign rights over its property, which has its own

 6   property interests, and if under Florida law the -- the

 7   State is permitted to put sand on the beach -- this is

 8   -- this is not filling for an amusement park.                This is

 9   adding something that is very germane to the maintenance

10   of the beach, for critical public purposes, the very

11   reasons --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It could be -- it

13   could be adding an amusement park, though, under your

14   theory, right?

15                MR. KNEEDLER:       No, it -- I don't think

16   there's any universal theory of this.               As I -- as I said

17   in -- in the Port of Seattle case --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It's the State's

19   property.

20                MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, I --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It's the State's

22   property.    If they want to put an amusement park on,

23   they can.

24                 MR. KNEEDLER:      No.     It varies.       And in --

25   that may be true in the Port of Seattle case discussed

 1   in Hughes, where the State had the -- you're balancing

 2   the rights of adjacent property owners, just like --

 3   just like

 4   nuisance or other principles do.            In Washington State,

 5   apparently, you could completely fill the submerged land

 6   and the upland owner had no rights.

 7               In Florida -- Florida is actually more

 8   protective than that.    It has limited rights.             You have

 9   a -- you maintain a right of view, a right against

10   unreasonable interference.        So there's no one

11   constitutionally based rule.            It's a question of Florida

12   property law.   And the background principles of Florida

13   property law under Martin v. Busch and the fact that the

14   State owns the adjacent land, I think, not only is there

15   -- there is more than a fair and substantial basis here.

16   There is a -- it's very solidly grounded in State law.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Let's see if there

18   are any further questions.

19               (No response.)

25               First, Martin v. Busch does not stand for

 1   the principles that the Respondents suggest they do.

 2   The court in Sand Key said, and in -- and in

 3   distinguishing the Martin v. Busch case, and I quote,

 4   "Our subsequent decisions show there was no intent to

 5   change common law principles regarding the right to

 6   accretion and relictions in Martin v. Busch."

 7                 And even if it did stand for that principle,

 8   the Martin v. Busch case didn't discuss whether the

 9   landowner was entitled to compensation for the severance

10   of their waterfront property as a result of the lowering

11   of the water.

12                 What also must be noted here is the State

13   is changing the deeds.       They're changing the legal

14   description and the deeds of the Petitioner's members.

15   These Petitioner's members own to the mean high-water

16   line.    They have a right, not only under Florida common

17   law to own to the mean high-water line; under their

18   deeds, that's what they purchased.                And there has been a

19   lot of discussion and, I think, maybe some confusion

20   about this right to contact the water.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        They wouldn't own to the

22   mean high-water mark if there were an avulsion, if --

23   right?    If --

24                 MR. SAFRIET:     No, Your Honor.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        If by nature, this 60-foot

 1   beach had been put in, then their deed would be

 2   changed, wouldn't it?

 3                  MR. SAFRIET:     Temporarily, Your Honor,

 4   because under the doctrine of reclamation, they can

 5   reclaim the boundary line that they lost, just as if in

 6   a case where the hurricane washes sand away, the

 7   landowner, under common law, the doctrine of

 8   reclamation, can bring in sand where the water is to

 9   reconnect to that mean high-water line that would be

10   underwater following a hurricane.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Now, how does that work?      I

12   mean, I have a beachfront property; I wake up one

13   morning and there's a little half-mile island attached

14   to half of it, and there we are.             Mean high-water mark

15   is half a mile away.     You say I can reclaim that under

16   Florida law?    What's that mean?

17                  MR. SAFRIET:     Yes, Florida law allows, under

18   the doctrine of reclamation, which is what the Florida

19   Supreme Court relied on --

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Which is -- how does it

21   work?

22                  MR. SAFRIET:     You'd have to remove the sand.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        You shovel away the sand.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Oh, no, no.    This is -- you

25   can't.   You can't.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        What if it's going the

 2   opposite way?    What if it's -- if they built up sand?                     I

 3   mean --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:        It's rock.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.

 6                 (Laughter.)

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay, so what happens?

 8                 MR. SAFRIET:     I'm not sure the common law

 9   envisioned rock coming up to --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:        It can happen.          Okay.     So

11   my point is, I think, which is the same, I think, as

12   Justice Scalia, that he -- that the upland owner no

13   longer, under the law of Florida, has a way of getting

14   his land out to the mean high-water mark.                Am I right or

15   wrong?

16                 MR. SAFRIET:     I think that's wrong, Your

17   Honor.    Under the doctrine of reclamation --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.        Because?

19                 MR. SAFRIET:     Under the doctrine of

20   reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line.                     If

21   that's by depositing new sand where the water is to

22   reach the mean high-water line, where it was prior to

23   the hurricane.    They can do that.

24                 Conversely, if sand is washed up as a result

25   of a hurricane, they can remove the sand to bring the

                                     64

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   water line back to them.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:          They can go on the State

 3   land to do that?    Because that sand is sitting on State

 4   land.

 5               MR. SAFRIET:       That wouldn't be State -- they

 6   can -- the common law allows them to reclaim what

 7   they're lost -- what they lost, Your Honor.           And the

 8   Florida Supreme Court tries to rely on this doctrine of

 9   reclamation in this case.        It asserts that the State is

10   only doing what it was allowed under common law,

11   reclaiming the land that it lost.

12               But in this case, the Florida Supreme Court

13   -- or the State of Florida didn't ever possess any dry

14   sand land, so they can't reclaim any dry sand land.             The

15   only thing they have ever owned was the foreshore and

16   the sovereign submerged lands.           So that's the only thing

17   they can reclaim.

18               I think there was another question about the

19   support for this case.      There is more than five

20   landowners that don't support this case.           In the lower

21   courts, there was another group, Save Our Beaches, that

22   had, I believe, roughly 150 members that opposed this

23   project as well in the City of Destin.

24               In this case, we're also dealing with a

25   physical taking.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why did they drop out?

 2               MR. SAFRIET:        Lack of standing at the

 3   administrative hearing, Your Honor.

 4               What we're dealing with in this case is a

 5   physical taking.     What rights were physically possessed

 6   by the Respondent's members -- the Petitioner's members

 7   in this case are now possessed by the State.             It's a

 8   wholesale transfer of these rights, along with the

 9   transfer of the deed -- or the description of the deed.

10   We're not asking this --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I don't understand why

12   isn't it -- it is equally an addition to the private

13   property owners' rights when they had a narrow beach and

14   now they're claiming that -- that it's all theirs, the

15   full 75 feet.

16               MR. SAFRIET:        I'm sorry, Your Honor, I

17   didn't hear your question.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They have, under your

19   theory, much more property than they had before.             They

20   have a wider beach that's theirs, so they have gained

21   property, but that doesn't count?

22               MR. SAFRIET:        Well, they haven't gained

23   property, Your Honor, because the State's claiming title

24   to that new beach.    So our -- the Petitioner's members

25   owned exactly what they owned as of September 7, 2003,
