 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We will hear

 4   argument next this morning in Case 11-889, Tarrant

 5   Regional Water District v. Herrmann.

 6               Mr. Rothfeld?

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. ROTHFELD:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed

12   that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity

13   of water that is located in Oklahoma.                    Oklahoma is now

14   trying to back out of that bargain.

15               What its argument to this Court in support

16   of its position is essentially that the Court should

17   disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact

18   because that language is superfluous, that the Court

19   should read into the Compact language that does not

20   appear there, and that the Court should not give the

21   text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes

22   as talismanic significance.

23               Our very different view is that the plain

24   text of the Compact must control.

25               Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and

                                      3

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to

 2   allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River

 3   Basin.   The Compact divides that basin into large areas

 4   called reaches and subdivides the reaches into

 5   subbasins.   As to some of those areas, the Compact

 6   expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line.

 7   It says that the States may use the water within their

 8   boundaries exclusively.

 9                But in the section of the Compact which is

10   at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a

11   very different and unique language.                    That section -

12   that subbasin includes the territory of three of the

13   four compacting States.         The boundaries of that subbasin

14   are drawn not by State lines, but by reference to the -

15   the last downside dam sites before tributaries to the

16   Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river itself.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Rothfeld, we are told

18   that in other compacts when they really mean to give one

19   State the right to take another State's water, the

20   provision in the compact is much clearer, much more

21   definite.

22                This clause, the one that you rely on, is

23   kind of sketchy, isn't it?             Doesn't say how they're

24   going to get it, if they're going to pay for it.

25   There's a lot to be filled in.

 1                  MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, the provision that we

 2   are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all.               It

 3   is quite clear that all four of the compacting States

 4   are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to

 5   the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the

 6   subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent

 7   of the water.     That -- that is quite express as to what

 8   is required.

 9                  In -- it's difficult to read that language

10   to mean anything other than that the States can take -

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            What is the exact language?

12   Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh

13   our recollection?

14                  MR. CLEMENT:         It appears -- it is reprinted

15   on page 8 of the blue brief in the indented text, and it

16   says, "Within this -- within this subbasin, the

17   signatory States have equal rights to the use of," and

18   then it defines the water that they have the rights to

19   the use of, "at times of normal flow" -- with the flow

20   of the Red River at 3,000 cubic feet per second at the

21   Arkansas/Louisiana border -- "provided that no State is

22   entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in excess

23   of this amount."

24                  So the -- the gist of the language is States

25   have -- all -- all four signatory States have equal

                                         5

 1   rights to the use of -

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:            It doesn't say that.     It

 3   says, "No State is entitled to more than 25 percent."

 4   It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what

 5   happens if in fact there's a State that because of

 6   cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it

 7   is entitled.     It just doesn't say anything about it.

 8                  MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I have to disagree with

 9   that.

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Where does it say something

11   about it?

12                  MR. ROTHFELD:          It says that -- the section

13   is designed to allocate the water of the subbasin, and

14   it says, "Within the subbasin, States have equal rights

15   to use of the runoff."          That's the first part of it.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

17                  MR. ROTHFELD:          The second part of it then

18   says, "provided that no State is entitled to more than

19   25 percent" -

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.     Does that mean

21   that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the

22   river, go into some other State and take the water out

23   of that other State?        I mean, I would have thought, if

24   that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for

25   doing it; that you'd have some authority set up by the

                                         6

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Compact that would decide where, whether it's really

 2   true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no

 3   such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which

 4   it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State

 5   courts in different States to try to do what is an

 6   extremely complex and controversial administrative job.

 7                 MR. ROTHFELD:          A couple points to say about

 8   that.    First of all, it is not at all a complex job.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It's not at all complex

10   when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to

11   the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say,

12   I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus.

13   And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in

14   fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are

15   going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs

16   to us.

17                 And Texas will say, no, we aren't.                      And then

18   we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into

19   the river at different places and what are all these

20   different pipelines are going to take out.                      You

21   understand what I'm saying.

22                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Right.             But -

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I would have thought a

24   mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.

25                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Okay.         Again, several things

                                        7

 1   about that.     First of all, in all these other compacts

 2   to which Justice Ginsburg alludes that are cited by our

 3   opponents, which expressly allow for cross-border -

 4   virtually none of them provide any of the kinds of

 5   details that you are describing.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine.          But they do say

 7   expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in

 8   the other areas.     And here it does not say anything

 9   about it.     That's why I think we're here in the Court,

10   because all it says is you can't take more than

11   25 percent.     It doesn't say what happens when Texas is

12   unable to get its 25 percent from the south.                       I'm now

13   repeating myself, but you point to the language that

14   says what I just say is not consistent with the

15   language.

16                  MR. ROTHFELD:          What I say -- I guess I will

17   say two things about that.               One, I think what you just

18   say is, in fact, with respect, is not consistent with

19   the language.     I think that -

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Which language is it not

21   consistent with?

22                  MR. ROTHFELD:          Equal rights to use of

23   specified water.     It -- the -- the subbasin is defined,

24   again, not by State lines; it's defined by -- by

25   downstream dam sites.         So it has created a pool of water

                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in the -- in this subbasin, and it says that all four

 2   States have equal rights to use of this water, provided

 3   that none takes more than 25 percent.

 4                 It seems to me that on the face of it, that

 5   is saying State lines are not relevant and that what we

 6   are looking at is a pool of water the States can come

 7   and get it.    And it is particularly so -

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Excuse me.

 9                 MR. ROTHFELD:          If I may just -- I'm sorry.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, no.   Finish.

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:          And I think to the extent

12   that there could be any ambiguity in the -- in that

13   language viewed in isolation, in the context of the rest

14   of the Compact, there are places where the drafters of

15   the Compact, in fact, did refer to State lines.                    They

16   said that States are entitled to use the water within

17   their State values, the respective States may use the

18   water within their boundaries.                 They did not -- the

19   framers did not use that language in this provision.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I think under your

21   argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that

22   Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the

23   flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right

24   into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't

25   know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent.

 1   Does that make sense in terms of the language?

 2                 MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, I will -

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I mean, you're talking

 4   about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be

 5   a little easier to cross the borderline.                       But what's

 6   Louisiana going to do?

 7                 MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, let me make two points

 8   about that.

 9                 First of all, I think that not only does it

10   make sense in the language; it's compelled by the

11   language, because the language says within this subbasin

12   all four States have equal rights.                       Separately, there is

13   another separate reach.           Reach V of the Compact is

14   Louisiana's, and so the water flows into Louisiana.

15   When the water gets to Louisiana, it's no longer within

16   the subbasin, it's somewhere else.

17                 So the plain language of the Compact compels

18   the reading -- compels the -- the point that Louisiana

19   could take its water from within the subbasin.

20                 Now, could it do that?                     The subbasin runs

21   through to Arkansas to Louisiana, so it could go to

22   Louisiana -

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Go back to the first one,

24   because what you have done is you've pushed me back to

25   the equal rights.     And now if I am going to fight you on

                                        10

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal

 2   rights to water arising within its boundaries.                    And all

 3   you have to say is equal rights to water arising

 4   anywhere in the subbasin.

 5                 And if I just heard that, then I might say

 6   okay, I think yours is a little better.                    But -- but we

 7   have this enormous administrative mess that would seem

 8   to be created, and both those interpretations seem

 9   possible.

10                 So let's go back to that and let me hear

11   quite clearly, now that I've focused it:                    What's the

12   answer?

13                 MR. ROTHFELD:          If I may just finish with

14   Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that?

15                 I think the second answer to the question

16   is, the States are going to take the water from the

17   closest point where they can get it.                    And so Louisiana

18   is not going to go to Oklahoma.                  If it's going to go

19   into Subbasin 5, it's going to go to Arkansas directly

20   across the State line.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How -- how does it do it?

22   Does it have to apply to Texas?

23                 MR. ROTHFELD:          It has to apply to

24   whichever -

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              To Oklahoma.

 1                MR. ROTHFELD:           If it's going to Oklahoma,

 2   and this is partially responsive to Justice Breyer, it

 3   would have to apply to the water authorities within

 4   Oklahoma.   So what is going on here, Tarrant, the Texas

 5   water district, is applying to the Oklahoma Water

 6   Resources Board.   It will seek a permit.                  This will

 7   operate precisely in the same way as if an Oklahoma

 8   applicant is seeking a permit.

 9                You will go to -- you will go and say, I

10   want to take water out of this point.                   The Water

11   Resources Board will apply its ordinary standards to

12   determine whether or not that can be granted.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Who -- who erects the

14   facilities to accomplish this diversion?

15                MR. ROTHFELD:           Tarrant presumably will do

16   that.   If Tarrant needs to obtain rights of way,

17   Oklahoma law provides for exercise of eminent domain, or

18   Tarrant can simply purchase the property to do that.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              It's -- it's my

20   understanding that there is a place where Texas can put

21   a line into the river, and then a subset of that

22   question is, the main stem of the river, through -

23   without going through Oklahoma property, other than

24   perhaps just the bank itself.

25                MR. ROTHFELD:           That -- that I think is not

                                       12

 1   correct as a factual matter.              The -- the Red River lies

 2   entirely within Oklahoma, and so Oklahoma, in order to

 3   get water out of the main stem, if -- if Texas were to

 4   do that, it would have to go into Oklahoma.               And -- and

 5   in fact, this is in response to -- in part to what -

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But you say entirely

 7   within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the banks?

 8               MR. ROTHFELD:           Because -

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or because of there's

10   also some intervening property between Texas and the

11   bank that Oklahoma owns?

12               MR. ROTHFELD:           The -- the border between

13   Oklahoma and Texas is the south vegetation line of the

14   Red River, so therefore it is out of the river past the

15   bank to the vegetation line.              So in order to get water

16   out of the main stem, Oklahoma and -- Texas would have

17   to go into Oklahoma.      Now, there is -

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Do -- do the current laws

19   prohibit that -

20               MR. ROTHFELD:           Oklahoma's current laws

21   would, I would think, prevent -

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              At any point?

23               MR. ROTHFELD:           At any point, because the

24   laws that Tarrant is challenging here are laws that are

25   discriminatory Oklahoma laws that prevent any use of

                                      13

 1   water originating in Oklahoma outside.

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:            When you say Texas has the

 3   right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that

 4   phrase.   That's -- that's very striking.                       I mean, it

 5   sounds like they are going to send in the National Guard

 6   or the Texas Rangers.

 7                  MR. ROTHFELD:          Right.             And that -- if I may,

 8   Justice Alito, that is -- that's a very misleading way

 9   of looking at it.      And I think Oklahoma's brief suggests

10   that the Texas Rangers are going to descend on Tulsa

11   and seize the water.        That is not what -- what is

12   contemplated.

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:            But you were saying that

14   Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma

15   to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent

16   domain if necessary.

17                  MR. ROTHFELD:          No, I -- there is an -- there

18   is an Oklahoma statute that says in order to -- someone

19   who has a permit to obtain water can exercise eminent

20   domain.   An Oklahoma person can do this.                       A Texas person

21   can do this.

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     How does -- how does

23   Oklahoma apply its law in this situation?                        I assume

24   there is normal priorities and they will get

25   applications from a lot of people.                        But they have to -

 1   what do they have to give Texas?                  Up to 25 percent?

 2                I mean, they can't just say -- deny it,

 3   because another Oklahoma user has priority, or all this.

 4   How does that fit in with the existing administrative

 5   structure?

 6                MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, Oklahoma cannot use

 7   more than 25 percent of the water within the subbasin.

 8   I think that our friends concede that, because the

 9   language of the Compact says no State is entitled to

10   more than 25 percent.

11                Within each State's 25 percent allocation, a

12   resident water user of the State will apply to the

13   Oklahoma -- if they are seeking to take their water from

14   Oklahoma, it will apply to the Oklahoma Water Resources

15   Board, which will assess that permit precisely as it

16   assesses permits from Oklahoma residents.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But it's got to give

18   Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right?

19                MR. ROTHFELD:          If -- if there is a request

20   for that much water from a Texas user, and the Texas

21   user has priority as a permit applicant against others

22   who are seeking to take water from this particular -

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I guess what I'm

24   asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority

25   apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would

                                      15

 1   be?

 2                  MR. ROTHFELD:          No, it does not.    It's -

 3   all -- all the Compact says is that Texas is entitled to

 4   take water from within the subbasin, its 25 percent.

 5   Now when it applies in a particular place, as Tarrant

 6   has done here, it's going to apply -- be consistent with

 7   the Oklahoma Water Resources Board permit application

 8   policies, as it has done.

 9                  The resources board will assess that permit

10   application just as it would assess an application

11   from -

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            And what does that mean

13   exactly?     What would Oklahoma do to evaluate that

14   application and to compare it to other applications from

15   Oklahomans, and also maybe to compare it -- maybe there

16   is more than one Texas application.

17                  How does the Oklahoma board make those

18   decisions?

19                  MR. ROTHFELD:          It -- a permit applicant

20   submits an application, which has to demonstrate that it

21   satisfies the standards for obtaining the water.               That

22   will be assessed on its merits by the Water Resources

23   Board.

24                  If there are competing applications for the

25   same water, then it's -- it's done in the terms of

                                        16

 1   priority -- of -

 2                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'm really asking you to

 3   tell me what the Oklahoma board is going to do.                       I mean,

 4   why doesn't the Oklahoma board just say, you know,

 5   sorry, we like Oklahomans?               Would that be all right?

 6                  MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, that is their current

 7   policy.     That would not be all right.

 8                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            What -- what -- what

 9   different kind of priorities do they have to use, and

10   why do they have to use them, as I think -- somewhere

11   along the lines of what the Chief Justice was asking?

12                  MR. ROTHFELD:          I suppose there -- there are

13   two points there.     One is, if there is enough water to

14   go around for everyone, as in fact there is, then they

15   simply assess it in terms of priority in time.                       Whoever

16   makes the first application will get it.

17                  However, Oklahoma can only get -- use

18   25 percent of the water.            And therefore, Texas has the

19   right, so long as there is water available and Texas has

20   not used its 25 percent of the subbasin water, Texas has

21   the right to seek that anywhere it can get it in the

22   subbasin.

23                  If I may, Mr. Chief Justice.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

 1                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,

 2              FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 3                    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 4                MS. O'CONNELL:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 5   it please the Court:

 6                The court of appeals concluded that Oklahoma

 7   may categorically foreclose Texas water users from

 8   accessing Reach II Subbasin 5 water in Oklahoma, and the

 9   court reached that conclusion for reasons that in the

10   view of the United States are wrong.

11                First, the court of appeals erred in

12   applying a presumption against preemption to determine

13   whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the

14   Compact.   The rationale for that presumption where it

15   has been applied is one of federalism, but the States

16   themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact,

17   and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context

18   requires enforcement of the Compact according to its

19   terms.

20                Second, the court of appeals relied on

21   general Compact provisions to conclude that the Compact

22   gives States unrestricted authority to regulate the

23   water within their boundaries.                But the general

24   provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's

25   regulation of water has to be consistent with the

                                      18

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   allocations made under the Compact, and each State's

 2   obligations under the Compact.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I -- I am not quite

 4   sure I agree with your reading of the court of appeals'

 5   opinion.   It seems to me the court of appeals' opinion

 6   is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they

 7   looked at the terms of the Compact.

 8                 And it seems to me that you may be right

 9   that the Compact either says you get the water or you

10   don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just

11   irrelevant.     But I read the opinion of the court of

12   appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition.

13   You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact.                  The

14   dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have

15   much to do with it.

16                 MS. O'CONNELL:             Well, we agree with that.

17   We don't think that the dormant Commerce Clause comes

18   into play here.     We think that whether Texas can access

19   the water in Oklahoma through the Oklahoma permitting

20   process depends entirely on whether the Compact gives

21   them that right or not.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But that's the way I

23   read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at

24   39A, when it starts talking about the point of --

25   Section 5.05.

                                        19

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1               MS. O'CONNELL:            Right.           And we don't

 2   disagree with that, that the -- that the commerce clause

 3   shouldn't come into play here.

 4               Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals

 5   is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that,

 6   regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the

 7   purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its

 8   share of water under the Compact, that that State law

 9   should prevail under the Compact.                     So the Compact makes

10   clear that those general provisions preserving State

11   water law need to be consistent with each State's

12   obligations under the Compact.

13               And if I could -

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, where, if

15   you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do

16   you come up with this idea that States first have to try

17   to get their 25 percent from water within their borders?

18   I don't see that anywhere.

19               MS. O'CONNELL:            Well, first of all, we think

20   that that's an issue that, if the Court decided that -

21   that there are errors in the court of appeals opinion

22   that should be corrected, we think that's something the

23   court of -- that the lower courts could consider on

24   remand.

25               But I'll tell you where it comes from, which

                                     20

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is Sections 2.01 and 2.10(a) of the Compact, which

 2   preserve the application of State water law.                    Section

 3   2.01 says that, "Each State may freely administer water

 4   rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that

 5   State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to

 6   the availability of water in accordance with the

 7   Compact."

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, it seems to me

 9   that you like some provisions of State law, but not

10   others.

11               MS. O'CONNELL:            No.      What we're saying is

12   that if there's a State law that conflicts with the

13   allocation or poses an obstacle to the allocation of

14   water under the Compact, then it's preempted.

15               But, for example, if Texas could access

16   25 percent of the water from within its State, then

17   the -- the application of a State law that would bar

18   Texas water users from obtaining a portion of its water

19   in Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be preempted, because

20   it wouldn't pose an obstacle to the allocation.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What do you do -

22   what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's

23   Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than

24   the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas.

25   Do they have to incur the additional expense to get

                                     21

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get

 2   Oklahoma water?

 3               MS. O'CONNELL:             Well, we think -- again, we

 4   think this is a -- an issue for the court of -- for the

 5   lower courts to look at on remand, but we think there's

 6   a -- there's a good argument to be made that, so long as

 7   Texas could access 25 percent of the water within its

 8   boundaries, then application of an Oklahoma law that

 9   would prohibit Texas from going through the Oklahoma

10   permitting process wouldn't necessarily be preempted.

11               And again, we -- these -- these -- there are

12   lots of issues, as we point out in our brief and we did

13   at the invitation stage, that would need to be

14   addressed, perhaps, in further proceedings or perhaps

15   before the -

16               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a

17   reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view?             I mean,

18   if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out

19   that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty

20   of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you

21   submitted, it gives you kind of a headache.             That -

22   that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult

23   the process is.

24               And then you look at this provision, and

25   maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but

                                      22

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer

 2   suggested, be read as a cap, "no more than 25 percent."

 3                  So as between those two possible readings,

 4   the complexity of your way of reading this, which would

 5   have -- why?

 6                  MS. O'CONNELL:            Justice Kagan, I'd like to,

 7   if I could, go to the second point, which is on the -

 8   the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement

 9   or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just

10   to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in

11   favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an

12   equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the

13   water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just

14   an opportunity.

15                  But the interpretive comments that follow

16   Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint

17   Appendix -- refer to a "right."                   The first full

18   paragraph there says, "When the flows" -- I'm sorry;

19   it's the -- the second line.                "If the States have

20   competing uses and the amount of water available in

21   excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all

22   such uses, each State will honor the other State's right

23   to 25 percent of the excess flow."

24                  The Red River Compact Commission also

25   approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're

                                        23

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix.           I might

 2   have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong.

 3               But the -- the Red River Compact

 4   Commission's rules and regulations say that when the

 5   flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that

 6   Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second,

 7   "each of the signatory States shall be entitled to

 8   25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow."

 9               So I think it -- it's pretty clear that

10   based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the

11   interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River

12   Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just

13   that you can take whatever is in your borders even if

14   that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each

15   State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that

16   if that involves going into another State within this

17   geographic area that's not defined with respect to State

18   boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact.

19               And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the

20   States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in

21   the Compact, they did so.          There are several subbasins

22   that span more than one geographic -- or more than one

23   State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you

24   can take whatever you want within your boundaries.

25               And I also don't think that this is going to

                                     24

 1   be particularly troublesome to administer.                     I mean,

 2   there may need to be some further proceedings on that,

 3   but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would

 4   happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for

 5   a permit to appropriate and divert water from within

 6   Oklahoma.

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:            And what does that mean?

 8   What would Oklahoma do?

 9               MS. O'CONNELL:            Well, the Oklahoma Water

10   Resources Board would just apply its normal procedures

11   and laws to determine whether this particular use of

12   water could be put to beneficial use.                     If -- they would

13   just apply whatever laws they would apply to any

14   applicant, regardless of whether they are from Texas or

15   Oklahoma.

16               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, people keep on saying

17   that, and I -- I guess I just still don't understand

18   quite what it means.

19               MS. O'CONNELL:            Well -

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:            I mean, let's say Oklahoma,

21   the board is sitting there and it gets lots of

22   applications from Oklahoma users.                     And let's say it also

23   gets multiple applications from Texas users.                     That it's

24   not just one county, it's four counties.                     What does

25   Oklahoma do to -- to decide who gets the water?

 1                  MS. O'CONNELL:            Well, I think just as -- as

 2   Petitioner's counsel pointed out, there's a -- a

 3   priority in water law, where whoever submits the

 4   application first would -- would get the water if it's

 5   available and they can put it to beneficial use.

 6                  And I -- and I -- the Court shouldn't be

 7   concerned.     I know all -- I know there are amicus briefs

 8   submitted by other Texas entities that would like to

 9   have water from this particular subbasin as well.

10   They're all part of the same Region C, and they -- I

11   think they have some way to work it out.                  It's not like

12   they -

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, I don't understand

14   your answer.     If -- if you're correct, wouldn't the

15   Oklahoma board have to give priority to the Texas

16   applicants in order to make sure that Texas got its

17   share of the water?       It couldn't just treat -- it

18   couldn't just be indifferent as to whether it was an

19   Oklahoma or Texas applicant.

20                  MS. O'CONNELL:            That -- true, to the extent

21   that Texas was not receiving its water.                  I mean,

22   under -- under our theory, which we think could be

23   developed more in the lower courts, if Texas was already

24   receiving 25 percent of the water, then Oklahoma would

25   not have to give it any kind of special priority.                  But

                                        26

 1   if it -- if it was not, then the Oklahoma Water

 2   Resources Board would treat it just like an Oklahoma

 3   applicant.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:            Is it correct that -- that

 5   there are reservoirs in Texas that flow into -- from

 6   which water is released into the Red River?

 7                MS. O'CONNELL:            Yes.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:            Okay.           And -

 9                MS. O'CONNELL:            And in Oklahoma as well.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:            And what if Texas didn't -

11   what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that

12   water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose

13   not to do so, so it could take other water out of the

14   river?

15                MS. O'CONNELL:            This -- this is the last

16   point made in the Respondent's brief -

17                JUSTICE ALITO:            Yes.

18                MS. O'CONNELL:            -- and -- and the response

19   to that would just be that all of the States would have

20   the opportunity to do that.             In fact, the whole subbasin

21   is defined by the last major dam site on the tributaries

22   that are running in.      So Oklahoma could do the same

23   thing.

24                And also, when the reservoirs are full,

25   they're full.   It's not like Texas could keep all of the

                                      27

 1   water that's -- that's there from flowing into the

 2   bottom portion of that tributary.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, we're only

 4   considering the instance where there isn't enough water

 5   to meet the 25 percent in Texas.                   And in that instance,

 6   I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma,

 7   but also in Arkansas, where they might get some.                      And

 8   all my question, and I think that was being asked, is

 9   there anything else you want to say as to why that's an

10   easy matter to decide?

11                 MS. O'CONNELL:            Well, I -- it's -- we don't

12   think it needs to be decided in this particular

13   proceeding.    I think there are two errors that the court

14   of appeals made in applying a presumption against

15   preemption and in concluding that a Texas water user

16   could never divert water from outside of its State.

17   Those could be developed -- those additional problems

18   could be dealt with by the Oklahoma Water Resources

19   Board or as you said, perhaps in the original action.

 1                  If I could just address two sort of factual

 2   questions.

 3                  Under the -- the actual Red River Boundary

 4   Compact, the lawyer for Tarrant was wrong.                       There's

 5   actually a strip called Shawnee Creek, from the Denison

 6   Dam to the Shawnee Creek, that actually belongs to

 7   Texas.     So there's a piece of the Red River in this very

 8   subbasin that is -- it's in the express Boundary

 9   Compact.

10                  Moreover, all of the Red River and Lake

11   Texoma that is in Texas is part of the main stem, and

12   that is not only in the land of Texas, Texas users draw

13   water, quite a lot of water, from Lake Texoma.                       So

14   that's two places on the main stem.

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Are they licensed?

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So I'm sure -- you're -

17   you're saying that the State of Texas can take water

18   directly from the main stem?

19                  MS. BLATT:       It can and does.

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's my point, yes.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Anywhere close to of

22   the 25 percent they claim entitlement to?

23                  MS. BLATT:       Well, who knows?

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I was hoping you

25   did.

 1                 (Laughter.)

 2                 MS. BLATT:       Who knows?               Texas has more than

 3   a dozen fresh tributaries running from Subbasin 2 and

 4   Subbasin 4.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I'm talking about

 6   Subbasin 5.

 7                 MS. BLATT:       Subbasin 5, these are all -

 8   excuse me -- these are tributaries that run into

 9   Subbasin 5.    There is more than a dozen tributaries in

10   Subbasin 5.

11                 For 30 years no one has ever kept track of

12   any kind of accounting whatsoever, so when we say "who

13   knows?"   that is the way the drafters -- it's not only

14   the way the drafters intended, but that has been the

15   state of play for 30 years.

16                 So nobody -- and in the laws of Louisiana

17   and Arkansas don't even track diversions.                      So -

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Just to be clear, in your

19   view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property,

20   take water from the main stem in Basin 5?

21                 MS. BLATT:       In Subbasin 5, there is only up

22   from Denison Dam east to Shawnee Creek.                      So that's just

23   anywhere from a half a mile to three-quarters.                        It runs

24   from the -- from the middle of the channel.

25                 East -- excuse me, west is Lake Texoma, and

 1   if you want to look at the map, it's a big old lake.

 2   That is a lot of water.           And they definitely do take -

 3   and that's in the brief -- they take lots of water from

 4   that lake from the Texas side.

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But my question was, can

 6   they take it from the main stem -

 7                  MS. BLATT:       Only in that -- that little slip

 8   of land to Shawnee Creek.             It's -- it's a part of

 9   Texas -

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Is that the part that,

11   under their allegation at least, is saline?

12                  MS. BLATT:       Well, again, they drink the

13   water in Subbasin 5.

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             All right.         Is that the

15   part that -

16                  MS. BLATT:       Yes.        They think -

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- they are referring

18   to -

19                  MS. BLATT:       Yes.

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- when they say it's too

21   saline?

22                  MS. BLATT:       Yes.        They think all the water

23   that their residents drink is salty, but they still are

24   drinking it.

 1                 MS. BLATT:       They're drinking it.          In fact,

 2   they're -- footnote 3 and footnote 4, their water

 3   planning documents, say this is a -- quite a -- a

 4   drinkable source of water.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            When they -

 6                 MS. BLATT:       I understand they think it's

 7   salty, but they drink it.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            When they take water from

 9   the main stream of the Red River, how do they know how

10   much of that water is from Reach V?

11                 MS. BLATT:       Well, the -

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They are -- they are

13   entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V.

14   Is everything that -- that comes into Texas in the main

15   channel of the Red River water from Reach V?

16                 MS. BLATT:       So if you look at the -- if you

17   look at the map in the red brief that's got all the -

18   the colors, and the pink is Subbasin 5.                 So where they

19   divert water from is all up and down those blue

20   tributaries that are in pink south of the Red River.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now what page are you

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yeah, yeah, yeah.          I didn't

 2   know -

 3               MS. BLATT:         So they -- and then if you look

 4   at that -- that blue lake that looks like a dragon, that

 5   is also where they are -- they are taking water.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              What -

 7               MS. BLATT:         That just happens to be in Reach

 8   I.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Reach I.          Okay.

10               MS. BLATT:         But their water planning

11   documents show that all the water in the pink on the

12   Texas side is a very valuable source of drinking water.

13   And if you see, all the way down to Lake Texarkana, they

14   can -- they are taking that water, too.

15               And when we say about what we know, no one

16   has ever done any accounting because the Equal Rights

17   Clause has always been read as equal rights to the use

18   of the water without prejudice to or from each other's

19   State, and, in that sense, it means that if one State

20   took an earlier use of the water, it wouldn't gain a

21   priority indefinitely over the other States.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Well, it never -- it

23   never says that.   I mean, that's why we have a case.                     It

24   never says it has to be from your State.

25               And I appreciate your -- the focus in your

 1   argument on State sovereignty, but this is an interstate

 2   Compact.   And the whole point of interstate compacts is

 3   that we have to -- each State has to give up a little

 4   here or a little there to solve a problem.

 5                So I -- I guess it's -- I don't know why

 6   these basic principles of State sovereignty apply in the

 7   context of an interstate compact.

 8                MS. BLATT:       Right.          I mean, it is our

 9   position that the States would have never agreed to this

10   extraordinary right without an -- an unequivocal

11   explicit statement.

12                But I do think it is absolutely critical to

13   understand that what they are asking for is

14   unprecedented, Mr. Chief Justice.                      There has never been

15   a cross-border diversion -- ever -- under any State

16   water compact.   And the two examples they cite in their

17   reply brief are inexplicable -- absolutely inexplicable.

18   They cite the Niobrara Compact with no cite.                      They -

19   they cite the Compact, but they never say there has been

20   a cross-border diversion.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Say that again, because

23   we have a green brief that gives us samples of

24   provisions for cross border.

 8                  And what they tried to say, because we have

 9   been saying all along how unprecedented this would be to

10   sort of read in silence on borders, they tried to come

11   up with two examples in their reply brief.

12                  And that's what I'm talking about.                    The

13   reply brief is not only -- is devoid of a citation, but

14   Nebraska and Wyoming told both us, and Wyoming told

15   Tarrant's counsel, that there have never been

16   diversions.     And Nebraska was quite -- like, "Wow, we

17   hadn't known that."       And it shows the danger of their

18   position.     They think if it's silent as to borders, the

19   State of Wyoming can go hundreds of miles into Nebraska

20   and take the water across the border.

21                  The other example they cite is fascinating

22   because it's a lawsuit before you.                       They cite the Rio

23   Grande Compact as a basis of saying El Paso can walk

24   into New Mexico, but their lawsuit to you is based on

25   the notion that Texas can't go into New Mexico.                       It's

 1   New Mexico has a downstream delivery.                    So -

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:               But there was a point, it

 3   seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 -

 4   the '70s, when they drafted this.

 5               MS. BLATT:          I'm there.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:               So they are in the room,

 7   and there are representatives of all four States, and as

 8   they argue, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet,

 9   what happens?   And Louisiana would say, we want at least

10   25 percent; done.     Arkansas, 25 percent; done.

11   Oklahoma, same; done.         Texas, same; done.

12               But everybody in the room knows that Texas

13   could never get more than 12 percent within its borders.

14   And since it could never get 12 -- more than 12 percent,

15   Louisiana would be sitting there with not really

16   25 percent but with 38.           And so -- so -- - - - - -

17               MS. BLATT:          But with all due -- sorry.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:               -- that would suggest that,

19   hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must

20   be some way for Texas to get the extra; otherwise, why

21   were they saying 25 percent for Texas?                   If -

22               MS. BLATT:          Justice Breyer.           Justice Breyer.

23   It's just not true.       What they cite to is a 1970

24   engineering report -

25               JUSTICE BREYER:               You know, this is an

 1   example I made up, because I think -

 2               MS. BLATT:       Oh.       Well, the -

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- an imaginary

 4   conversation.

 5               MS. BLATT:       Oh.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            But if in an imaginary

 7   conversation -

 8               MS. BLATT:       Well, okay.               34 percent of the

 9   watershed is in Texas, so there is no reason to think

10   anyone thought Texas couldn't get its share.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?

12               MS. BLATT:       There's no -- because there's no

13   evidence there was any discussion about any State and

14   whether -- Texas never complained.                    No one ever said

15   Texas couldn't get its water.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Wouldn't that be a fairly

17   easy thing to check going back to 1970 -

18               MS. BLATT:       If you -

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- to found out whether,

20   you know, Texas was just on some little salt flat -

21               MS. BLATT:       Sure.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- near the river and -

23               MS. BLATT:       We did.           They did in their

24   brief, and they came up with an 11 to 16 percent.                    Our

25   engineers ran the numbers after correcting their

                                     37

 1   three-series method -- methodological errors, and we

 2   came up with 29 percent.

 3                They -- they double-counted streams.                   They

 4   forgot that Subbasin 5 is not only runoff but also rain.

 5   And then -- this one's humorous -- they didn't count the

 6   excess.   So all the -- all the math that they did

 7   favored Texas, so the math didn't come out that way.

 8                But what's interesting about the Tarrant's

 9   view in juxtaposing with the United States' view,

10   Tarrant's view is it could have all the water, but they

11   could get all of it still from Oklahoma.                    So Louisiana,

12   Arkansas, and -- and Texas could come take all their

13   share from Oklahoma, forcing Oklahoma to have to go

14   south.

15                Now the United States' view, and this is

16   I -- they read a border limitation in there.                    They say,

17   "Look, borders are here, but if Texas really needs it,

18   you got to let them come in."               That -- that's the United

19   States.

20                They definitely -- which I don't understand

21   their reliance on the Russello principle, because they

22   read borders into this.         Texas has actually disavowed

23   this view.   Tarrant's disavowed it.                   They disavowed it

24   to the Tenth Circuit when the Tenth Circuit asked for

25   what their standing would to be to press it.                    They said,

 1   "We've never claimed this."

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So what do you think is

 3   the remedy?     Meaning -

 4                 MS. BLATT:        The remedy?

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I -- let me just posit

 6   the point; okay?     I understand your point to the Chief

 7   that there's been no proof that Texas doesn't get its

 8   25 percent or that it couldn't get it from the main stem

 9   or somewhere.     I accept that.

10                 But let's, for the hypothetical, say that

11   there's a major drought and Texas can't get it from its

12   portion.    What's its remedy?

13                 MS. BLATT:        Okay.         Yeah.

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So that -- that it's not

15   getting -

16                 MS. BLATT:        Okay.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                -- 25 percent -

18                 MS. BLATT:        Yeah.         So let's -

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                -- as the Compact

20   entitles it to.

21                 MS. BLATT:        Okay.         It's the last statement.

22   The Compact no way, no how entitles the parties to equal

23   25 percent.     It just doesn't say equal rights to a

24   numerical share.     It doesn't say equal rights to a

25   numerical quantity.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               It says "shall have

 2   equal rights to the use of runoff originating in

 3   Subbasin 5."

 4                  MS. BLATT:       Right.          And you and I could have

 5   equal rights to the use of the family car or equal

 6   rights to the use of the highway.                        That doesn't tell me

 7   anything about how many hours I can spend on the

 8   highway.

 9                  But here's the problem.                     The real problem is

10   with the cap.     Okay?     Their view is that the first

11   clause gives you an absolute equal right to a fixed

12   25 percent; no exceptions.               But then you have this

13   provided clause which does no work for them.                        The

14   provided clause, which says you don't get any more than

15   25 percent, they are saying, "Well, by definition, if

16   you get exactly 25 percent, the State can take no more

17   than 25 percent."     So they actually just sort of combine

18   the two.

19                  The other -- I hate to point this out,

20   because I -- I feel a lot of affinity for the United

21   States, but their proof -

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     You feel a lot of

23   what?

24                  MS. BLATT:       Affinity for them.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Oh.

 1                 MS. BLATT:       But listen to their proof for

 2   why there's an equal 25 percent.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You are representing

 4   Oklahoma.

 5                 MS. BLATT:       I am, but I used to work for

 6   them.

 7                 They say well, we're guaranteed an equal

 8   25 percent share, and they cite the compliance rules on

 9   page 19.    And entertainingly so, the rules that they

10   cite just disprove what they said.

11                 The first rule they cite only gave 3 States.

12   They divided it by 3 instead of 4.                      Their view, the

13   United States' view, is there's a guarantee of

14   25 percent of any amount that's in excess of 3,000.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, this is a -- a

16   perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I

17   want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question.

18                 At least as I understood it, it's this:                     I

19   want you to assume -- I know you don't agree with

20   that -- I want you to assume that the Compact gives

21   Texas a right to 25 percent of the -- of the excess -

22   of the water above the cubic foot.

23                 MS. BLATT:       The excess, yeah.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I want you to assume that.

25   Now, wouldn't the Compact be meaningless if Texas

                                       41

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   couldn't actually reach that water?

 2                 MS. BLATT:       That is -- that is the United

 3   States' view, and they'd have to go above it.                 What they

 4   would have to do, which no one else -- no one has

 5   done -- and I think the drafters thought it was

 6   ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana,

 7   is call for an accounting and actually figure out what

 8   the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up

 9   the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to

10   happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to

11   the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in

12   fact ever happen because of the riparian laws of

13   Arkansas and Louisiana.

14                 But -- so in other words, if we lost this

15   case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the

16   United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a

17   pickle trying to prove they couldn't get their

18   25 percent.    And so I read Tarrant as saying, don't you

19   dare send us back to try to prove that.                 We want to be

20   able to go whole hog into Oklahoma.

21                 And if I could get to the point that Justice

22   Kagan was talking about, what's on the ground happening,

23   and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of

24   cross-border right, because what Tarrant is doing is

25   exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the

                                       42

 1   assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust

 2   that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma.

 3                And there are three ways where Oklahoma

 4   would not have agreed to this, and it would have been

 5   carefully articulated in a Compact.

 6                The first is prior appropriation.                    There are

 7   4 Texas entities that have signed up for permits:                        The

 8   Upper Trinity, the North Texas Municipal Water District,

 9   Irving and Tarrant.     And poor Oklahoma City got

10   sandwiched in the middle.           It beat -- it beat Trinity to

11   the permit office by 24 hours.

12                And so, not surprisingly, it's open season

13   for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and

14   sought a permit and there's priority.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But that's the same

16   problem.   Even if you take within State, all of these

17   people, if they were applying for water in Texas as

18   well, there'd be the same issue there.                     One of them

19   would beat the other one.           It's a question of priority.

20   You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should

21   have -- well, not absolute priority, but -

22                MS. BLATT:       Well, I have two points.               First,

23   had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't

24   heard about this until Tarrant filed its application,

25   Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line

                                      43

 1   faster.   And second of all, the whole point of this

 2   Compact -- and if you think about your equitable

 3   apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water

 4   first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently -

 5   this was the point of the Compact.                     Louisiana and

 6   Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and

 7   Oklahoma were much more economically developed States,

 8   and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit

 9   office.

10                Let me get to the second aspect what's a

11   problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the

12   points of diversion.      The last place Oklahoma would have

13   picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River,

14   and Tarrant is saying, not surprisingly, it's the most

15   desirable.

16                And the third is the eminent domain.

17   Eminent domain law in Oklahoma proceeds on the

18   assumption that those are Oklahomans who got the permit,

19   and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and

20   Tarrant, not surprisingly, would like to come in and do

21   that.

22                And none of this is happening with the

23   normal political checks in Oklahoma.                     Oklahoma can't

24   vote out of office the Tarrant officials.                     It cannot

25   vote out of office the Upper Trinity or the North Texas

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 -- permit out-of-State

11   use of its water?

12               MS. BLATT:          It has not.                It could, but

13   the -- but Tarrant is correct that there are facial

14   differences with respect to out-of-State.                        So

15   out-of-State users would have to get the water going

16   faster, it's subject to a review.                        And there's a

17   statement in there that you need to look and see if

18   there's a better use for Oklahoma.

19               Now, I hope you ask them this, because I

20   gather their view is under the dormant Commerce Clause

21   is all of those laws are constitutional with respect to

22   99 percent of the Compact, which is it's allocated to -

23   to Oklahoma for its free and unrestricted use.                           So

24   they're basically saying there's 1 percent of this

 1                 And not only is it 1 percent, the minute it

 2   drops below 3,000, all of a sudden, it became.                      And on

 3   this, we'd like to talk to the Russello principle.                         I

 4   also hope you ask them, this is on page 15A of -- 14A of

 5   the 15A brief.     There are border references arbitrarily

 6   and they're missing, they're there.                      It's completely

 7   inconsistent.

 8                 And this -- their view would make complete

 9   mincemeat out of 4 other provisions of the Compact.                            And

10   ironically, it would march a lot of States into Texas.

11   But back to (b) -- (b)(2) and 5.05(c) operate identical

12   in that they're basically downstream delivery, where all

13   States have to release 40 percent of the water

14   downstream.     So they -- they're the same.                   They're

15   absolutely identical.

16                 You hold on to 60, you let 40 percent go.

17   But only (c) contains that border reference.                      Only (c)

18   says "within their respective States."                      And yet even in

19   (c), it's completely redundant and unnecessary, because

20   you can't release water from without your State.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Where is this?         Where is

22   this?   Where is this?

23                 MS. BLATT:        This is on page 14A and 15A -

24   sorry -- of the red brief.               So only (c) says within

25   their respective States, but (b)(2) is the exact same

                                        46

 1   functioning provision, and it's missing the border

 2   reference.    And I -- you don't have time now to ask the

 3   United States' view, but I think the United States would

 4   agree with us that if you give this border thing kind of

 5   the magical meaning, borders kind of appear and

 6   disappear with the water flow, which is very strange.

 7                 Tarrant thinks that there's some heretofore

 8   unheard of crediting system, but they don't have an

 9   explanation on how (b)(2) and (c) -- but more

10   importantly, if you could just turn to 9A for just a

11   minute, which is 402, I want to walk you through this -

12   I'm sorry, 401(b).     This is a provision that -- this is

13   water wholly within Texas.              And you don't have to

14   understand much to know that Texas keeps 60, Oklahoma

15   gets 40.

16                 So you have a big chunk of Texas, and Texas

17   is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40.              Now,

18   under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to

19   borders and because Oklahoma is not in this reach, it's

20   not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma

21   either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water

22   from Texas.    And this pattern repeats itself -- this is

23   on page 41 of our brief -- throughout the Compact, where

24   the Compact is silent as to borders, and under their

25   view -- and their Louisiana view is somewhat

                                       47

 1   entertaining.

 2               I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go

 3   into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border

 4   to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under

 5   this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the

 6   contract -- the State that's not in the basin, because

 7   there are no borders and because, I guess under their

 8   view, the only way that Oklahoma to get its water would

 9   be to go into Texas, and that's why they're sort of

10   taking this bit about, oh, this Russello principle, if

11   it's here, it must mean -- it must have had

12   significance, would make a complete mess of the Compact.

13               If I could also just turn to the remand of

14   the United States.     I just wanted to make -- to make

15   three points.   And that is, I do think it is significant

16   that it's pointed -- it is addressed to a problem that

17   Texas itself has never asserted.                  They're saying well,

18   poor Texas can't get its water.                 And remember, Texas is

19   upstream, so this sort of poor Texas is only to Texas.

20   No other State is going to have this problem because the

21   rest are downstream.

22               So this you have to be able to get to your

23   25 percent is a uniquely pro-Texas provision that

24   apparently at the same time for 20 years of drafting

25   history when Texas was trying to buy this water, and the

                                      48

 1   three States were saying "no way, no how," they either

 2   subconsciously or unconsciously or unintentionally

 3   enacted this provision for Texas's benefit.

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:            In Subbasin 1, that's

 5   mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or

 6   the other way around?         It looked to me like Subbasin 1's

 7   in Oklahoma.

 8                  MS. BLATT:       Which reach?

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Subbasin 1.          It says

10   Subbasin 1.

11                  MS. BLATT:       Are you talking about 401?

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, 401.

13                  MS. BLATT:       Okay.         So that's in Reach 1.         So

14   that's on this map -- the next map.                       So none of it -

15   it's all within the green, the same with the panhandle

16   of Texas.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.          I get it.   I get it.

18   Anyway -

19                  MS. BLATT:       Yes.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            -- because of that and

21   because during the time when, let's say, there's

22   5,000 feet of the -- of the 2,000 extra, you know,

23   Louisiana has to get 500.             Okay.         How do they know

24   whether they're getting it?               I mean, how -- there must

25   be some system of measurement going on or how does this

 1   all work?

 2                MS. BLATT:       Justice Breyer, you have to

 3   trust me.   There has never been an accounting ever,

 4   ever, ever, ever under this Compact.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            So, so -- - in other

 6   words -

 7                MS. BLATT:       No measurements have ever been

 8   taken with respect to this.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine.          So that -- I don't

10   know how that cuts, because certainly the people who

11   drew this must have thought at least in those other

12   provisions they are going to develop a measurement

13   system in case of controversy.

14                MS. BLATT:       Well, there are gauges.               So

15   they -- I mean, it would not be impossible, although

16   very expensive.   And just so you know, Section 211, and

17   in the interpretive comments of 211, the State said the

18   last thing we want is this accounting because it's

19   expensive and burdensome.           And Louisiana and Arkansas,

20   if you look at the minutes, they are complaining because

21   their laws are not set up for accounting.                     They are

22   riparian States, so they don't track diversions.                     They

23   just -- they don't do it.

24                So this was -- this is -- when you talk

25   about how this cuts, you have 20 years of silence -

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I -- I don't understand

 2   what you just said:     They're riparian States, so they

 3   don't track diversions.

 4                MS. BLATT:       Okay.         So when you comment -

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why does that follow?

 6                MS. BLATT:       Right.          Okay.    So in the -- the

 7   Oklahoma and Texas, in their permitting system, what

 8   they permit, they track how much you take under the

 9   permit.   They measure.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

11                MS. BLATT:       Louisiana, if you are a

12   landowner, you just draw from the water and it's a -

13   it's a voluntary reporting system, so you don't

14   necessarily have to tell the State how much you took

15   out.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

17                MS. BLATT:       So one is a permitting system,

18   and in Louisiana and Arkansas -- and, I think, again,

19   the minutes just talk about we hope Louisiana and

20   Arkansas will develop their laws to do better tracking

21   of diversions.   But again, this would be the problem of

22   an accounting.

23                But I -- so in terms of the 20 years of

24   history, you have complete silence on this, even though,

25   under our view, it always -

                                      51

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:            The relevant legal

 2   argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us

 3   about this reach in the subbasin.                        60 percent goes to

 4   Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma.

 5                  MS. BLATT:       Right.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.           Now, they've never

 7   measured it.     That's because they never fought about it,

 8   I guess.   And now we have a fight.                       So why is it any

 9   easier to develop the necessary measuring system

10   there -

11                  MS. BLATT:       Well -

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            -- than it would be here?

13                  MS. BLATT:       -- the -

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And that argues against you

15   because your main point, really, is that this is all too

16   complicated.

17                  MS. BLATT:       Justice Breyer, the disaster

18   would be and the affront to sovereignty is throughout

19   the Compact, not so much the measuring that's a problem:

20   Oklahoma would be able to insist on crossing Texas's

21   borders to draw that 40 percent.                    And no one has ever,

22   ever envisioned any of the Compact as not applying

23   borders.   It's not so much the measurement.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, I thought that

25   was what your -- the other side does envision, that it

                                        52

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders but it's bound

 2   by the agreement, the Compact.                 Compacts compromise the

 3   individual State sovereignty.                That's the whole point of

 4   them.

 5                MS. BLATT:        Okay.         But their view -- I mean,

 6   it is that they have to -- again, our view is that if

 7   they had wanted, like all the other cross- border

 8   rights, to allow for an extraordinary right, they would

 9   have made an explicit statement and then spelled out

10   exactly what that meant, most importantly the point of

11   diversion.   Here, at most you have silence on the issue.

12                Now, the Government reads into borders

13   sometimes, because they say you do have borders unless

14   there is a need.   Under Tarrant's view, which I think is

15   the most jarring and remarkable view, this is all a

16   borderless common, and every State could have

17   criss-crossing pipelines into every State, because you

18   don't have an exhaustion requirement.                       So Texas, even

19   though it's got plenty of water in its fresh water

20   streams and currently uses them, could take their whole

21   25 percent from Oklahoma; Oklahoma could take its whole

22   25 percent from Texas; Arkansas could come into

23   Oklahoma -- and that's their view of the world.

24                And I think the United States thought, no,

25   that doesn't make too much sense.                       Let's at least make

                                       53

 1   Texas exhaust.

 2                 But the provision -- the Compact doesn't say

 3   this.   Again, the United States and Tarrant proceed on

 4   the assumption that there is a numerical share, that

 5   it's equal rights to an exact 25 percent, exact

 6   25 percent.    Well, that's not what it says.                      It just

 7   says equal rights to the use subject to a cap, and we

 8   think a cap by limiting the use is not a guarantee that

 9   you can reach the cap, much less that you can cross

10   borders to reach the cap.

11                 And if I could just make one more sense -

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Ms. Blatt, the solicitor

13   general here today spoke of lots of different examples

14   where the language of entitlement and rights was used.

15   Do you have a view as -- as to that?

16                 MS. BLATT:        So they -- you mean the two

17   compliance rules they cited?                They cited -- so they

18   say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is

19   because what they cited disproved what they were trying

20   to assert it for.

21                 So if you -- you don't even have to read

22   the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules.

23   Just read page 19 of their brief.                        They say in the same

24   sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right

25   to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000.                        So that means

                                        54

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four

 2   equally.   And then they cite a provision that only

 3   divides by 3.   And then the next provision they cite

 4   didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water.

 5                I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable.

 6   I can't tell you why they did that.

 7                And the only other thing I want to say on

 8   the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think

 9   there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there

10   clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification,

11   which the States immediately did long-term water

12   planning without so mentioning of this right.             And

13   Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for

14   $1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent

15   with the notion that they had this right all along.

16   They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never

17   mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they

18   were actually offering to pay 1.7 million.             And the

19   amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we

20   were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant

21   mention this right.

22                And the other thing, I do think the water

23   planning documents are highly significant because not so

24   much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take

25   water planning very seriously because of their prior

                                      55

 1   appropriation systems.          There are hundreds of thousands

 2   of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this

 3   right.     Again, they cited something in their reply

 4   brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close

 5   to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5.                       Again, ironically

 6   it mentioned a portion of Oklahoma where Texas would

 7   have to actually buy the water.

 8                  We'd ask you to affirm.                    Thank you.

11   remaining.

12              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

13                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14                  MR. ROTHFELD:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15                  A couple of points.                First, my friend, Ms.

16   Blatt, said that it would make mincemeat and a complete

17   mess out of the Compact to apply its terms as they were

18   written.     We think that this Compact was negotiated over

19   a period of 25 years.         If you look at the Joint

20   Appendix, you will very painfully see that there are

21   reams and reams of commentary on the -- on the

22   negotiations.

23                  I think the Court has to assume that when

24   the drafters of the Compact used language and referred

25   to State lines in one place and not in another place,

                                        56

 1   they had some idea of what they were doing and they made

 2   these different choices intentionally.                   So I think the

 3   Court simply should read the terms of the Compact -

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So how do you deal with

 5   all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to

 6   the 60/40 division?       I can't make rhyme or reason of

 7   those provisions that don't use within State boundaries,

 8   but it has to mean that.

 9                 MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, I don't think that it

10   has to mean that.     If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to

11   take -- if it makes more sense for them to do it, they

12   can.    If not, they can just wait for the water to flow

13   down.

14                 I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt

15   did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5

16   operates.    If you look at the map that was pointed out

17   to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about

18   here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but

19   extremely narrow.     It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to

20   south for most of its length.

21                 The reason the drafters drew this is because

22   the States all take -- the assumption was all of the

23   water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water,

24   literally excess water.           The States all take the water

25   that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so

                                        57

 1   the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to

 2   by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1; they are not in

 3   Subbasin 5.    The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is

 4   water that the States assumed was going to be surplus.

 5   And so it would make no sense, having divided this water

 6   evenly between the compacting States, to think that the

 7   drafters would have required a water user in Texas at

 8   the far west end, which would get its portion of the

 9   25 percent share two miles across the border in

10   Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to

11   get it out of Texas.

12                 That is not what the drafters intended to

13   accomplish by this.      They created, by the plain terms of

14   the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined

15   by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State

16   equal rights to access that water so long as they did

17   not use more than 25 percent.

18                 Your response to a question which was raised

19   by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the

20   practical application of this is very simple.                    One

21   simply has to apply to the permitting authorities,

22   wherever you're submitting your application from, they

23   will apply their ordinary standards.                    Oklahoma Water

24   Resources Board does that now for applications from

25   within Oklahoma; it can do it just as well for

                                       58

 1   applications from Texas or other from other States.

 2                  And, again, the practicality of this is,

 3   water users are going to want to use water as close to

 4   where they are located as they can.                       They're going to go

 5   right across the State line within Subbasin 5 if that's

 6   the place to get the water.               It makes no sense to

 7   require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it.

 8                  Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the

 9   25 percent limitation out of the Compact.                       I think her

10   reading reads the equal rights language out of the

11   Compact.     They read the Subbasin 5 language as being all

12   capped and no entitlement.               It does two things:          It

13   gives equal rights to the water, and then says that you

14   can't take more than 25 percent within your State.                         So

15   it's designed to do two things.                   It's designed to give

16   you an entitlement and to say you can only use

17   25 percent of it.

18                  And finally, Ms. Blatt raised questions of

19   sovereignty and political concern.                       As the Chief Justice

20   suggested, this is a Compact that's an agreement between

21   coordinate sovereigns.          They have decided what they want

22   to do.     And the thing that gives respect to sovereignty

23   is to read the plain language of the Compact as the

24   framers wrote it.     Again, they spent 25 years writing

25   it.   They took considerable care, as you can tell if you

                                        59

 1   look at the negotiating history, in using the words for

 2   each provision.   Those words should be given meaning.

 3               If there are no further questions.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Thank you, counsel.

 5               The case is submitted.
