 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation

 5   versus Reliant Energy Services.

 6                Mr. Frederick.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK,

 8                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 9                MR. FREDERICK:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, and may it please the Court.

11                In 1988, the Government of British Columbia

12   created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions

13   including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated

14   by development of the Province's natural resources

15   pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States.

16                The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex

17   its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State

18   entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal

19   court.

20                Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction

21   issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors

22   by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ

23   status.   First, the court articulated the wrong test for

24   determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign

25   State.    The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive


                                         3

 1   are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court

 2   overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public

 3   functions that are the best indication of its sovereign

 4   status.     The British Columbia Government receives and

 5   distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations,

 6   supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to

 7   provincial laws not applicable to private companies and

 8   grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from

 9   taxation.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Mr. Frederick, are you

11   going to get to the 1447(d) problem?

12                 MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.       Let me address that

13   now.   The court's -- the district court's remand order

14   was appealable because it was not issued under 1447(c).

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The district court

16   thought it was and one we did, the district court said I

17   have no authority in -- under -- over any of these

18   people.   So back it goes.

19                 MR. FREDERICK:          The district court made two

20   mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper

21   and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.                     Because

22   of that inconsistency, the court of appeals --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Removal.        Removal was-

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- talking that -- where

25   are these statements?

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:               You said remand was proper.

 2   That's the --

 3              MR. FREDERICK:            Sorry.         That removal was

 4   proper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d)

 5   and 1442(a).    It also then said it lacked subject matter

 6   jurisdiction.

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But at the point it was

 8   acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was

 9   not that it thought the removal had been proper; the

10   basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked

11   jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.

12              MR. FREDERICK:            But immunity was the basis

13   of the district court's thinking that it had to remand.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               It may have been, leaving

15   aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it

16   may have been wrong.       But what it thought it was doing

17   it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a

18   jurisdictional reason.

19              MR. FREDERICK:            And what this Court's cases

20   say, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a

21   ground cognizable under 1447(c).

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Those cases are all

23   -- all based on Thermtron.           You don't have any doubt

24   that Thermtron would come out the other way today, do

25   you?

 1                 MR. FREDERICK:         I certainly do --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- in light of, in

 3   light of the statutory language as it exists now?

 4                 MR. FREDERICK:         Mr. Chief Justice, the

 5   Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four

 6   times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory

 7   amendments.    It has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on

 8   the basis of statute is the strongest form of stare

 9   decisis.   So I do --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But stare decisis on

11   the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the

12   statute's been changed.

13                 MR. FREDERICK:         Mr. Chief Justice, the

14   Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the

15   Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead --

16   from the time it was decided even through statutory

17   amendments.    Our submission is that if Congress intended

18   to change that rule, it could have done so clearly.                  And

19   we note that the Respondents here don't ask for

20   Thermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the

21   amicus on their side, that the only way you could rule

22   in favor of the Respondents in this case would be to

23   overrule Thermtron.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But Thermtron was such a

25   far cry from this case.         In Thermtron the district judge

 1   said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so

 2   I'm going to toss this case back to the State court.

 3               MR. FREDERICK:          But here, Justice Ginsburg,

 4   the court did have jurisdiction because removal was

 5   properly effectuated once the entities that we moved

 6   were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign

 7   sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal

 8   sovereigns in the case of BPA.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But we go into that

10   question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity.              I mean, if

11   in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether

12   indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to

13   be able to appeal every case.

14               MR. FREDERICK:          No, you're not,

15   Justice Scalia, and here's why.              Immunity is not a

16   ground for remand because it is not a precondition for a

17   removal by a sovereign.        It is a separate freestanding

18   issue.   It is a status determination that determines

19   whether removal is proper by those sovereigns.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:             That would be fine if

21   1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the

22   basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it

23   says.

24               MR. FREDERICK:          But if in Thermtron the

25   court, the district court had said my docket is too

 1   busy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and

 2   remand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt

 3   that the courts would look beyond the label given.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I don't think the court

 5   said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject

 6   matter jurisdiction.

 7              MR. FREDERICK:            I'm speaking hypothetically,

 8   Justice Ginsburg.    My point is that the label the

 9   district court attached here was the wrong label, and

10   that's why the court of appeals to satisfy --

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Why?          Why was it wrong

12   when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district

13   court said I have -- these people are totally immune

14   from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.

15              MR. FREDERICK:            Because it is inconsistent

16   with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive

17   effect to remand a case on the ground that the

18   sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate

19   their immune status in State court.                      That is precisely

20   why Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Then what you are really

22   arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is

23   that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with

24   foreign sovereign immunities.

25              MR. FREDERICK:            That's our backup

 1   submission, Justice Souter.             You do not need to reach

 2   that if you agree with our principal submission and --

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But the trouble with the

 4   principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have

 5   said that even if the district court has come to an

 6   erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it

 7   understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling,

 8   that is not appealable.

 9               MR. FREDERICK:          But Justice Souter, it did

10   so.   The case -- the cases in which the Court has said

11   so have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds

12   cognizable under 1447(c).          Immunity from suit is not

13   such a ground, because the purpose of having the removal

14   provision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal

15   courts to decide the immunity status.                   If the court

16   sends the case back to State court on immunity grounds,

17   it does not have preclusive effect in the State courts.

18   The State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign

19   immunity status and there will be no recourse except

20   through appeal through the State court --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you're into your

22   backup argument now.

23               MR. FREDERICK:          No.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             The backup argument that

25   you're now making, that not your principal argument.

 1              MR. FREDERICK:            No, Justice Scalia, that's

 2   not our backup argument.          Our point is that in this

 3   case, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of

 4   the successful removals, which everybody conceded were

 5   correct, that the label that it attached, immunity is

 6   subject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground

 7   recognized in 1447(c).        So it was appropriate for the

 8   court of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to

 9   determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory

10   remand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type

11   this Court has recognized in the Cohill case.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Did you request -- when

13   the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was

14   before the district court, did you request that the

15   district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court

16   remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the

17   case -- the question up on appeal?

18              MR. FREDERICK:            I don't believe that we did,

19   Justice Ginsburg.    This case was remanded.             A motion --

20   motions for clarification were subsequently brought.

21   But a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Because that would have

23   taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay

24   the remand to allow this question of law to be

25   determined by the court of appeals.

 1                 MR. FREDERICK:          It is certainly the case

 2   that in searching through the docket entries, you'll

 3   discover that there was a holding by the district court

 4   of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure.

 5                 But the point that is important here is that

 6   even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction

 7   pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose

 8   subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity

 9   claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign

10   sovereigns.     And it is their theory that the district

11   court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that

12   has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes

13   behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the

14   opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in

15   Federal court.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They don't care whether it

17   had subject matter jurisdiction or not.                   It's not an

18   essential part of their case.               Their case is even if it

19   did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end

20   of case.

21                 MR. FREDERICK:          Their submission in this

22   Court, however, is that there was no subject matter

23   jurisdiction.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's their backup

25   argument, I think.

 1                 MR. FREDERICK:         Well, their backup argument

 2   should be rejected by the Court as wrong.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           If in fact it goes back to

 4   the State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you

 5   raise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two

 6   things the statute guaranteed you?                  One was a

 7   determination in the Federal court that you're an organ

 8   of a Federal State, and second, a bench trial?

 9                 MR. FREDERICK:         Justice Breyer, there's no

10   provision --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, but could you?

12                 MR. FREDERICK:         By the time the appeals in

13   the State court would have been exhausted, the very

14   benefits --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I'm just asking could

16   you, yes or no.    I --

17                 MR. FREDERICK:         We would certainly make the

18   argument.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, okay.       Now if you lost

20   in the State court, could you then use that as a basis

21   for asking this Court to accept jurisdiction?                   And if

 1   want to foreclose any arguments that we might try to

 2   make; but let me point out to you that in the years that

 3   it would take to march through the State court system,

 4   Powerex, as a sovereign, would be denied its right to

 5   have a bench trial --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:               See, what I'm getting at is

 7   whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical

 8   problems that you raise are present.                      And they're awful.

 9   I don't deny them.      I mean, they're right there in the

10   statute, it foresees them.            So I wonder, is there any

11   difference in this case from every case where the remand

12   is erroneous?

13              MR. FREDERICK:             I do think foreign

14   sovereigns are different, and Congress intended to treat

15   --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:               In terms of the legal right

17   to get the trial to which the law entitles you on your

18   view of the law, there is no difference.

19              MR. FREDERICK:             The foreign sovereign is

20   entitled to a bench trial.            It is entitled to other

21   procedural protections with respect to treatment of

22   garnishment, other --

23              JUSTICE BREYER:               And you would get those

24   eventually, it would just have to happen.

25              MR. FREDERICK:             It would be after -- it

 1   would be --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But that's purely --

 3   pure question begging.        I mean, the whole issue on the

 4   merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not.                         And

 5   you can't assume that you're correct when the remand

 6   provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been

 7   remanded doesn't care whether you're correct.                       The idea

 8   is, you can get a correct determination in State court

 9   through up to review by this Court eventually, as you

10   can in Federal court.       There's no reason to assume that

11   the Federal court is the only place you would get a

12   correct determination.

13                 MR. FREDERICK:         But Mr. Chief Justice, the

14   point of having Congress enact these removal provisions

15   and to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for

16   sovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to

17   vindicate those rights and interests.                      If Powerex were

18   sued for not --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's -- it's the same with

20   diversity jurisdiction.         You can make the same argument.

21   There's nothing distinctive here.                 This statute says

22   that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a

23   right to be tried in Federal court.                      Fine.   But the

24   statute also says that if you're a defendant in a

25   diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal

 1   court.

 2               And I don't know why this is any more

 3   demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary

 4   diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're

 5   entitled to trial in federal court.

 6               MR. FREDERICK:          Diversity is different,

 7   Justice Scalia, and here's why.

 8               When a case is removed on diversity grounds,

 9   the court of appeals -- the district court is obliged to

10   examine the bases of diversity.              That is what the

11   court's removal duty is.         When a foreign sovereign

12   removes a case, the district court's duty is to

13   determine is this a foreign State within the meaning of

14   the FSIA.   If it is, I have jurisdiction.

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Frederick, may I just

16   follow up on Justice Breyer's question?                 It seems to me

17   that your answer suggests that you have two bites at the

18   apple because you -- all the way along, you might win.

19   And if you won, then it wouldn't matter.                If you lose,

20   you always have the argument that you've made here,

21   let's go back and start over again.

22               MR. FREDERICK:          Justice Stevens, I don't

23   think we would win at all in that circumstance because

24   we would be forced as a foreign State to litigate in

25   State court contrary to Congress's will.

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but --

 2                 MR. FREDERICK:          Whatever arguments that may

 3   be preserved --

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But you might win that

 5   litigation.     It's not impossible, is it?

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:          It is certainly not

 7   impossible, but the point --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And if you lose, you

 9   always have a point on appeal and may start all over

10   again later on.

11                 MR. FREDERICK:          It is unclear to me, and I'm

12   not sure that I've seen any of this Court's cases that

13   would suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural

14   right would be grounds for reversing a State court

15   judgment.   And our position is that Congress intended to

16   protect the bench trial right, the immunity defenses of

17   a foreign sovereign, because the organ status

18   questioned --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did anybody in this

20   case -- did any of the Defendants in this case request a

21   trial by jury?

22                 MR. FREDERICK:          I don't recall whether the

23   Defendants do, but it is clear that the Plaintiffs would

24   be entitled to a jury trial --

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And have they asked for

 1   it?   Has any party asked for a jury trial?               If not, that

 2   part of the case seems academic.

 3               MR. FREDERICK:          Well, the case has settled,

 4   Justice Ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of

 5   trial procedures, and so --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The case is settled?

 7               MR. FREDERICK:          As explained in the cert

 8   petition papers, the case is on appeal in the State

 9   court system on objections to the settlement, and it

10   will not be mooted during the course of this Court's

11   action on the case.

12               But the invocation of jury that would be

13   done normally just before trial has not been an issue

14   that's been presented.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, that's different

16   than it is in the Federal courts.                You have to -- can't

17   wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.

18               MR. FREDERICK:          Well, what the Plaintiffs

19   here assert is that they would be denied their right to

20   jury trial, and I presume that that means they intend to

21   ask for one and to perpetuate that request.                Our

22   position, as we explain in a footnote in our reply

23   brief, is that they have a jury trial right as against

24   Duke and Reliant; they do not as against the foreign

25   sovereigns that they have sued.

 1               So at root, the case is about the kind of

 2   comity and dignity that the courts of the United States

 3   will accord to foreign sovereigns.                  If Powerex were sued

 4   on the basis of non-commercial acts, it would not be

 5   entitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the

 6   district court is held to have no jurisdiction,

 7   notwithstanding the proper removal under 1441(d).

 8               I'd like to save the reminder of my time for

 9   rebuttal, please.

14                ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

15         AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

16               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Mr. Chief Justice,

17   and may it please the Court:

18               This Court has recognized repeatedly that

19   the bar on appellate review in 1447(d) applies only to

20   remands under 1447(c).        This Court has held that the

21   courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a

22   remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of

23   1447(c).   In fact, just this term in Osborn, the

24   district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c)

25   for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Osborn made it very clear

 2   that was an extraordinary case where Congress had

 3   explicitly ordered two conflicting things.                       One, it said

 4   no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no

 5   review of remands.      So the Court was as clear as it

 6   could be that only when you have those conflicting

 7   signals does that court -- does that case have any

 8   application.

 9              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                        Your Honor is

10   absolutely correct.       Osborn concerned a particular kind

11   of categorical exception from 1447(c).                      Our argument is

12   that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in

13   this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c).                        That

14   although the District Court termed the sovereign

15   immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not

16   jurisdictional in the relevant sense.                      And this Court

17   held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case.

18   There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the

19   district court on the basis of its immunity and the

20   district court certified that holding as a

21   jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this

22   Court.

23              Yet this Court looked beyond that label

24   attached by the district court and held that sovereign

25   immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense

 1   because it does not limit the authority of the Federal

 2   courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule

 3   that would preclude suit in State court as well.

 4   Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that

 5   the defendant is immune.

 6                 When Congress authorized sovereign

 7   defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate

 8   their immunity, it did not intend that when the district

 9   court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to

10   State court which would be free to disregard the Federal

11   court's decision.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:               One technical question.

13   The same one.     I would to be -- imagine it is a

14   diversity case.        Imagine that a Federal court

15   erroneously remands it.             A trial gets up to this Court.

16   And we say it was diverse.               It shouldn't have been

17   remanded.     Now what's -- is that like -- can that

18   happen?     I guess.     And is the remedy then wipe out the

19   State proceedings, go back to Federal court?                          What

20   happens?     Has that have ever been a case like that?

21                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                        Yes.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:               What happened?

24   Pacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on

25   review of a State court judgment following remand cannot

 1   review the remand order itself.                It can review issues of

 2   Federal law that were decided by the State courts on

 3   remand but --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And it is called, the case,

 5   Missouri --

 6                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Missouri Pacific

 7   Railway case.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, what --

 9   what do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after

10   removal joinder might defeat subject matter

11   jurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit

12   joinder and remand the action.                In other words, you have

13   got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute

14   contemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose

15   subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there.

16   And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari

17   materia with (c) so that the remands would not be

18   subject to review.      It seems to me the same situation

19   here.   You have got allegedly subject matter

20   jurisdiction.    It is later defeated, and it is remanded.

21   Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)?

22                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     What, what's

23   notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same

24   time that it amended 1447(c).               It provided in 1447(e)

25   for an authority to remand in a particular instance

 1   where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction

 2   post-removal.   It had of course been the rule since this

 3   Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that

 4   post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's

 5   jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit

 6   that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was

 7   removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.

 8              And when Congress amended the language in

 9   1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in

10   removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited,

11   it at the same time -- and added the language, or

12   changed the language in the second sentence that raises

13   problems for our argument; at the same time, it added

14   1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to

15   remand based on post-removal events that would have been

16   unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was

17   intended to confer general authority to remand on the

18   basis of post-removal events.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But you don't have

20   any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered

21   by 1447(d), do you?

22              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      No.   And the courts

23   of appeals that have considered that question likewise

24   hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari

25   materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on

 1   whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable

 2   decision appealable under Waco or not.                      But -- but that

 3   issue is not presented.

 4                 But what is significant is that had Congress

 5   intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for

 6   the first time remand on the basis of post-removal

 7   events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet,

 8   the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that

 9   Congress believed that in the absence of that provision,

10   the Court would have been limited to two alternatives.

11   Authorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss

12   the case.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           How is that relevant here?

14   Where is the post-removal event?

15                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    The post-removal

16   event here is the recognition of the defendant's

17   sovereign immunity.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that's not an event.

19   That's -- that's an epiphany, it's not an event.

21                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, according --

22   well, apparently the district court viewed it as a

23   post-removal event that deprived it, or defeated,

24   divested --

 2               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Well, I -- Your

 3   Honor --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean the sovereign

 5   immunity didn't exist from the outset.                      Nothing changed.

 6               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      But -- but the

 7   district court's order is clear.                And it is absolutely

 8   correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed

 9   at the outset.    So the court does not lack removal

10   jurisdiction.    The reference in 1447(c), second sentence

11   to "lacks subject matter jurisdiction," refers to lacks

12   removal jurisdiction.       And in fact, this Court used that

13   shorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe

14   1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction.                     This Court --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             When did it say that?             I

16   really find it very hard to accept that argument, when

17   its says -- you know -- it doesn't use lacks removal

18   jurisdiction, that's what it means.                      It is such an easy

19   thing to say.

20               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Well, the Court has

21   to go back to the history of the statute, how it's

22   evolved.   Clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only

23   if it was removed without jurisdiction.                      And so the

24   question is when Congress changed the language to lacks

25   subject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal

 1   jurisdiction?    Which it --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Under the -- under the

 3   district court's view, would there have been original

 4   jurisdiction against Powerex?

 5                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     No, it would not

 6   have.    Bit that's because of the peculiarities of the

 7   difference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA,

 8   section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the

 9   FSIA.    Whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a

10   conclusion that the defendant is not immune, Congress

11   conferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign

12   sovereign is defended.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Then can you --

14                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Likewise in

15   1442(a), which was about the Federal --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can, can you tell me, if

17   the Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back

18   to the State court.      Can the immunity argument be raised

19   in the State court?

20                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     The immunity

21   argument could be raised in State court.                      That's what

22   this Court held in Kircher.             But the defendant would be

23   forever denied its right to a bench trial under Federal

24   law.    That right is limited to suits in the Federal

25   courts by its term; 1441(d) --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In other words the State

 2   court couldn't say well you know, this district court

 3   was wrong; there's really immunity under the Federal

 4   statute.   The State court can't hold that?

 5               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     The State --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Because then you'd have

 7   constant -- eternal shuttling back and forth, that's

 8   why.

 9               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     The State court

10   could reconsider Powerex's status as a foreign

11   sovereign, but it wouldn't have many, if any,

12   implications in the State court because Powerex isn't

13   claiming immunity in this case.              It's only invoking the

14   procedural benefits of the FSIA which include that the

15   case be litigated in the Federal court before a judge

16   rather than a jury.     And it would be forever denied the

17   benefits, those important procedural benefits of the

18   statute if this Court doesn't uphold review of the --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, we don't know --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In other words, the -- the

21   Federal determination bars the State court from

22   redetermining that there's immunity?                     That the State

23   court can't say, "Federal court, you're wrong?"

24               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     The issue of

25   immunity of Powerex was never raised in this case.                        It

 8              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. SIMON,

 9                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10                 MR. SIMON:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court.

12                 There are two reasons, independent and

13   sufficient reasons why there is in appellate

14   jurisdiction in this case.           The first most narrow and

15   simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of

16   jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which

17   accept the district court's remand order for what it is

18   and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject

19   matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under

20   1447(d).   That is a simple direct route to that result.

21                 There is a second approach suggested by a

22   lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors

23   have heard this morning.          And I want to lay it out

24   briefly for the Court.

25                 And it is that, as the law professor amici


                                        27

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the

 2   lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of

 3   1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to

 4   1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of

 5   appeal.

 6               And the Court could clear out some of this

 7   underbrush, mooting many of the issues that

 8   Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have

 9   raised.   Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the

10   question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring

11   opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron

12   does not say what many of the lower courts think it

13   does.   Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it

14   does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by

15   Carnegie Mellon.   The notion that the only proper remand

16   is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie

17   Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand

18   covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also

19   ancient history.

20               Congress has given us a simple and strong

21   message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when

22   the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith

23   disputing forum, State court versus Federal court,

24   Congress has said take one shot at it, let an Article

25   III judge determine whether the forum is State court or

 1   Federal court, and move on to the merits.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, what, what reason

 3   would Congress have for wanting a system that says --

 4   and there are many, many, many people in the United

 5   States who would like to sue Pakistan.                   They would like

 6   to sue China.    They would like to sue Russia.                 There are

 7   all kinds of places they would like to sue.                   And why

 8   would Congress want to have a system that says to those

 9   countries, you can come into Federal court and get your

10   claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a;

11   but by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake,

12   there you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one

13   of 50 different states?         In front of juries, the very

14   thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have

15   to do.

16                Now what would their theory be?

17                MR. SIMON:       It --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can I, -- I'm not sure it

19   is even that he made a mistake.               It is even worse than

20   that.    If he gets it right and finds that you are a

21   sovereign --

22                MR. SIMON:       Let me try to answer it --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- you can go back to State

24   court.    I mean, that's even worse.                He gets it right.

25                MR. SIMON:       Let me try to answer both

 1   questions.   The problem is whether he gets it right or

 2   wrong, we spend two years in a court of appeals.            But

 3   Your Honor, you're assuming there's an immunity issue in

 4   this case.   With due respect, my adversaries are arguing

 5   someone else's case.      There is no immunity claim in this

 6   case by Powerex.   There is one petition, one petitioner.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           They were saying they were

 8   an organ of --

 9                MR. SIMON:      They were saying they were an

10   organ.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yeah, and therefore they

12   are immune unless -- unless they fall within an

13   exception.   And it may be they do.

14                Is that not right?

15                MR. SIMON:      No.       They conceded that they

16   fell within the exception.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, I'm saying, that's

18   how the statute works.

19                MR. SIMON:      Right.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           But I take it if you win

21   this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person

22   who has total immunity.

23                MR. SIMON:      No.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           Why not?

25                MR. SIMON:      I would disagree Your Honor.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why not?


 2                 MR. SIMON:      A party who has total immunity


 3   --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yeah.

 5                 MR. SIMON:      Would have removed the case the

 6   same way --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yeah.       Yeah.

 8                 MR. SIMON:      And it would have presented two

 9   arguments to the district court.                It would have argued

10   number one, we are a foreign sovereign; maybe it wins,

11   maybe it loses.    And number two.              We are immune.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

13                 MR. SIMON:      There is a solid line of cases

14   that suggests the decision on immunity -- first of all

15   let me say, I think it is somewhat far-fetched that a

16   party that would actually be immune, say the King of

17   Saudi Arabia, would end up being in this third lowest

18   category of foreign -- purported foreign sovereigns and

19   end up in the position Powerex is in.

20                 But if it did, in other words we have three

21   categories.    We have immunes, we have non-immunes who

22   got Federal court, and then we have would-be foreign

23   sovereigns like Powerex, who end up in State court.               And

24   I'm suggesting for a party to fall from the first

25   category to the third in front of an Article III

 1   judge --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:            And a Judge makes a big

 3   mistake --

 4                MR. SIMON:       Makes a big mistake.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            China comes in --

 6                MR. SIMON:       Right.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            And says of course you're

 8   China.    And then it signs a remand order.

 9                MR. SIMON:       I would submit, Your Honor, the

10   question has never been addressed by this Court.                  The

11   lower courts suggest that that is a collateral order.

12   The immunity issue, not the remand issue.                  We actually

13   now have a Waco type case.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            No.     Well, after all -- if

15   you're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on

16   appeal.

17                MR. SIMON:       The immunity --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:            Is it or not, in your view?

19                MR. SIMON:       In my view, the immunity issue,

20   but not the remand is reviewable on appeal --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine.       And now all they

22   want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.

23                MR. SIMON:       Right.          And the difference is --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            And what's the difference

25   between the one and the other?


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. SIMON:       The difference is that the

 2   immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a

 3   line of court of appeal cases -- a majority, not a

 4   unanimous majority, never blessed by this Court -- which

 5   suggests that immunity is so important, don't need a

 6   lawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you

 7   don't spend a dollar, you walk away -- so important that

 8   you are entitled to an immediate --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay, and you agree with

10   that?

11              MR. SIMON:       And I agree with that.

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine.       Then why is it in

13   your opinion that the immunity thing is so important

14   that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ

15   thing is not so important since all, what turns on that

16   is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.

17              MR. SIMON:       Well, I want to come back

18   non-jury trial and answer Justice Ginsburg's question

19   because I don't think she got the right answer.                But the

20   reason it's more important is this is, as Justice Scalia

21   said, like a diversity decision, this is a litigation

22   who sells power in the Pacific Northwest and admits that

23   it competes with Enron, Duke, and Reliance, and it is

24   disputing whether it belongs in a State court in San

25   Diego or the Federal court across the street in San

 1   Diego, leaving aside the jury issue.                   And that is

 2   precisely the kind of dispute that Congress suggested in

 3   1447(d) and its predecessors, which have been on the

 4   books for more than 100 years, ought to be done once.

 5   What do they say, one and done?             Is that what they say

 6   in the district court?

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:         You're saying this all turns

 8   on our assessment of the strength of the interest in

 9   remaining in Federal court?           Is that what it boils down

10   to?

11               MR. SIMON:      No, it turns on the strength of

12   getting an immediate decision on the immunity question.

13   The immunity question I think is a question of an

14   entirely different nature than the question of forum.

15   In the --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The immunity question,

17   the immunity question is the same as State or Federal

18   court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign

19   sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State

20   court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court

21   jurisdiction because Congress said so.

22               But with respect to the commercial

23   enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a

24   Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial.

25   That doesn't apply to State courts.

 1               MR. SIMON:       That's correct.             But Congress

 2   said, we're going to give you a Federal forum and a

 3   bench tribal if you convince us that you are an agency

 4   or instrumentality of a foreign State.                  This, this

 5   corporation Powerex failed to make that convincing

 6   showing.   Having failed to make that convincing slowing,

 7   again, they are debating in the appellate courts and

 8   tying litigants up for two, five years over whether this

 9   case should be litigated in State court or in Federal

10   court.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was a sovereign

12   party who said:   I'm out of this; I have suit immunity.

13   And that was the B.C. --

14               MR. SIMON:       B.C. Hydro.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What happened to B.C.

16   Hydro?   Because as I understand the district court sent

17   that party back, too.

18               MR. SIMON:       The district court found that

19   they were immune, properly followed the law, but

20   determined because it believed it had no subject matter

21   jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point,

22   that it should just walk away from the case and remand

23   it, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the

24   parallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power

25   Administration.   The Ninth Circuit when it erroneously

 1   took the appeal on the remand also clarified or

 2   straightened out that issue.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes, but it couldn't --

 4   if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should

 5   have touched this case.        So what happens to the three

 6   parties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are

 7   entitled to suit immunity?

 8               MR. SIMON:       Well, what's happened so far is

 9   nothing, which might tell us that in the practical world

10   when a Federal district judge says that B.C. Hydro is

11   immune and then remands a multi-plaintiff,

12   multi-defendant, multi-cross defendant-cross defendant

13   case to San Diego Superior Court, it is exceedingly that

14   the San Diego Superior Court will reconsider the

15   immunity.   But if it did --

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          But could it?

17               MR. SIMON:       I suppose it could, but if it

18   did that matter is subject to appeal and subject to

19   ultimate certiorari review in this Court.               So I think

20   we're talking about a frolic.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          I thought the argument you

22   were making a few minutes ago, if I understood it

23   correctly, was that B.C. Hydro would not have been

24   barred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the

25   remand; is that correct or not.

 1              MR. SIMON:       I think B.C. Hydro could have

 2   taken a collateral order, a collateral order appeal.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:          Whether it's a collateral

 4   order or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291.

 5   It doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447.

 6              MR. SIMON:       B.C. Hydro could have attempted

 7   to appeal the immunity decision under a series of

 8   decisions which suggest that immunity is so important

 9   that it ought to be decided right then.

10              JUSTICE ALITO:          The difference between that

11   immunity and Powerex's status is what?                 It's simply the

12   fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing

13   immediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of

14   the determination of the remand of a party that claims

15   to be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an

16   organ?

17              MR. SIMON:       Among several other things.

18   There is a stronger interest in that, and we are not

19   debating about the forum.         Again, we have the Kircher

20   case from last term saying State courts are perfectly

21   capable of resolving this issue.              That is a quotation

22   actually from the Missouri Pacific case.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If we think that Powerex,

24   that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain

25   in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the

 1   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer

 2   to get around 1447(d)?

 3                MR. SIMON:      I think Justice Scalia was

 4   correct to say there is just as strong an interest in a

 5   diversity case in having a New York corporation trying

 6   to escape --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I'm having, I'm having

 8   the same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer.

 9   Can you say in just a few sentences the difference

10   between the case where there is sovereign immunity,

11   China, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's

12   organ immunity?

13                MR. SIMON:      Yes, if I could --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You're telling us that one

15   is more important than the other, but there's no textual

16   basis in the statute for us to make that distinction.

17                MR. SIMON:      I think there are two

18   differences, so if I could.            One is textual and one is

19   important.   Let me start with the textual difference.

20   The textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to

21   remands, and so to the extent the district court

22   remanded the matter to State court the remand is

23   untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d).

24   And if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body,

25   lobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department


                                       38

 1   doesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get

 2   that fixed quite easily.

 3               There are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d)

 4   for class actions, for Native Americans, for civil

 5   rights cases, and they can get their own exceptions.                   So

 6   to the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is

 7   untouchable.   That is my textual answer.                It's a remand,

 8   i.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is

 9   untouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or

10   indispensable party is reviewable.                 So what I would say

11   is, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of

12   immunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral

13   order; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito.

14               I meant that line of cases about going

15   straight up even though the case was continuing.                   While

16   the case continues in State court, where it belongs

17   under 1447(d), it would appear under this line of

18   collateral order cases that the denial of immunity

19   per se could go up on its own --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm asking why is denial

21   of immunity for sovereign status different from denial

22   of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial,

23   etcetera?

24               MR. SIMON:       Possibly, possibly this could

25   would decide that question the other way.                 But --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            We have this very old judge

 2   like me.    China is there.         And he says:         This isn't

 3   China; Formosa is China.          So he says remand.          So there

 4   we are, China is now in the Western District State Court

 5   for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money.

 6   Now, you said, I thought, before that where that

 7   happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they

 8   could, China, appeal in the Federal system.                  I thought

 9   you said that.

10                MR. SIMON:       Yes.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.

12                MR. SIMON:       But not the remand.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            What?

14                MR. SIMON:       But not the remand.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            All they want is a

16   definitive appeal that this is really China, all right.

17   Now, can they do that, yes or no?                 You said yes.

18                So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was,

19   if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly

20   the same way on the question of whether they're an

21   organ.    What's the difference?

22                MR. SIMON:       The first difference is what I

23   said in response to Your Honor's question was I think

24   they could do that under some cases from the courts of

25   appeal.    I know they can't appeal the remand because we

 1   have an act of Congress which --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't care.      I don't call

 3   this an appeal of a remand.            What this is, it is an

 4   Appeal of the determination precedent to remand that

 5   Powerex is not an organ.

 6               MR. SIMON:       Well, Justice Breyer --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            That would make them just

 8   as happy, I believe.

 9               MR. SIMON:       Justice Breyer, think about a

10   multi-party case and maybe my answer will be clearer to

11   you.   In a multi-party case my position is the remand

12   stands, the case goes back to Missouri or Mississippi or

13   wherever your hypothetical was, but at the same time, I

14   do believe that the potentially immune party, which is

15   not here in this courtroom today, the potentially immune

16   party, could seek to review of what is a dispositive

17   ruling.

18               Remember, that's a dispositive ruling.                They

19   win the case.   That's very different than a venue

20   ruling.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Regardless of how they

22   would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the

23   immunity question, our series of questions is why do we

24   draw or why should we draw a distinction between

25   immunity and federal bench trial?                And your answer is, I

 1   take it, immunity is dispositive; Federal bench tribal

 2   is not?

 3              MR. SIMON:        Immunity is dispositive and

 4   Federal bench trial is not -- and is no different from

 5   the day to day decisions district courts make all the

 6   time about the choice between a State court and a

 7   Federal court in the area of remands and removals.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Immunity, suit immunity,

 9   is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not

10   in Federal court; you can't be sued, period.                 But now it

11   is admitted that you can be sued.                That's not in dispute

12   in this case, right?

13              MR. SIMON:        That's correct.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So the only question is

15   where.

16              MR. SIMON:        And that is my core --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The question is if --

18              MR. SIMON:        Excuse me.            That is my core

19   point, that Congress told us when the only question is

20   where, we stop after one level and we move on to the

21   merits.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Can you help me with --

23              MR. SIMON:        I would like to answer your

24   question about a jury, but I think I interrupted

25   Justice Stevens.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I just want to be sure

 2   your position.    Assume that there is a remand that was

 3   improper and cannot be appealed under your theory and

 4   the Powerex argues all along, I was entitled to a

 5   Federal forum and a non-jury trial.                      And the State court

 6   says no all the way up.         Can they file a petition for

 7   certiorari saying, we had a Federal right that was

 8   denied us, not the remand but our entitlement to a bench

 9   trial?    Can they petition for certiorari at the end of

10   the State proceeding in your view.

11                MR. SIMON:       Other than the jury question, I

12   think the answer would be no because of 1447(d), because

13   I think 1447(e) would suggest that that's an appeal of a

14   remand.   But again, you're asking questions that I

15   believe have not been addressed by this Court or even

16   lower courts.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm just wondering what

18   your position is.

19                MR. SIMON:       A clever enough lawyer I suppose

20   could argue that at that point that we're no longer

21   challenging the remand, the remand has happened and been

22   completed and the trial has taken place; we're now

23   simply challenging the results.               And maybe that clever

24   lawyer would win the day.

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:            And in effect he would say


                                        43
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is,

 2   State court, cannot try me at all.                   The feds can do what

 3   they want about remand and it gets back here.                   But

 4   because I'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me

 5   at all.   Isn't that the argument?

 6               MR. SIMON:         Oh, I think in State court a

 7   clever litigant could argue all these points over again,

 8   because 1447(e) --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But his clever opponent

10   would say --

11               (Laughter.)

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- that what 1447(d) means

13   is that you can be tried in State courts.                  That's

14   precisely what it says.

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:              And ultimately when the two

16   clever parties got to the State supreme court, they

17   would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if

18   we granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it.

19               MR. SIMON:         This Court would ultimately

20   decide it and they would ultimately decide questions

21   such as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the

22   bench trial issue has been preserved.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:              Why not say, depending on

24   the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be,

25   why not just say Congress intended that you do get an

 1   underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at

 2   stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but

 3   rather significant and important rights attach in the

 4   Federal court that do not attach in the State court.

 5   And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when

 6   they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by

 7   doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and

 8   the necessity to hire clever lawyers.

 9                 MR. SIMON:       Well, Congress has said --

10   Congress has said the contrary.                And there are often

11   important differences between State and Federal courts.

12   Justice Breyer, I think you have some experience in

13   California.     We have 9 to 3 jury verdicts.              You will

14   have a litigant here next year saying that the

15   difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous

16   jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really

17   important.

18                 Now, I would just briefly like to go back to

19   Justice Ginsburg's question about a jury because I don't

20   think she got the full answer.                Let me give it to you,

21   Justice Ginsburg.     The jury issue is virtually -- I

22   would say not virtually.           The jury issue is out of this

23   case based on my adversary's reply brief.                 I will tell

24   why you.     We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we

25   were upset about the whole notion of this case being

 1   removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in -- we

 2   never sued Powerex -- losing our right to a jury trial

 3   on this important case.

 4               Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote

 5   4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that

 6   our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that

 7   under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct

 8   they do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our

 9   right to jury trial would survive even though he would

10   have a right to a bench trial under his theory.

11               Well, there is no right to a jury trial on

12   the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client.             The

13   cross claim in the California court, which got this

14   whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for

15   equitable indemnification and declaratory relief,

16   equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury

17   trial.   So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury

18   trial.   We are arguing someone else's case.            Some day a

19   litigant will appear in this Court and present the issue

20   of jury trial --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But they raise that there

22   is still the question of Federal forum over State forum.

23               MR. SIMON:       There is, and that's the issue

24   that I think Congress has clearly and definitively said,

25   the State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good

 1   juries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to

 2   this Court.     In Kircher, the Court's opinion says, "the

 3   State courts are perfectly competent to resolve these

 4   issues."

 5                 The cost of this case being frozen for 3 or

 6   4 years while we debated these issues -- and these

 7   issues are very difficult.            I would say, we don't only

 8   have a backup position, we have a backup backup

 9   position.     Because we think, number one, the court

10   should be taken at its word.              We think, number two, the

11   court had no subject matter jurisdiction.                 Removing

12   jurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction.                 If you

13   look at the book, Chapter 89, Section 1441, et cetera,

14   it's titled Removal of Cases From State Courts.                 You

15   won't find the word "subject matter jurisdiction" in

16   there anywhere.

17                 A removal petition removes a case from the

18   State court to the Federal court, where if it's a

19   foreign sovereign immunities case, the Federal court

20   decides if it has subject matter jurisdiction.                 That's

21   what 1330 says in haec verba.               It's what this Court's

22   decision in Verlinden versus Central Bank of Nigeria

23   says in haec verba.       Verlinden says every court that

24   gets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine

25   at the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction

 1   by determining if the foreign sovereign is immune.

 2                 Which means that Judge Whaley was correct

 3   when he decided that by concluding he had an immune

 4   party in front of him, he had no jurisdiction.                    And it

 5   was equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined

 6   that United States versus Myers says the same thing, so

 7   that he had no subject matter jurisdiction.                    And in

 8   addition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine.

 9                 This notion of "removal jurisdiction" quote

10   unquote, it's a term we all use.                 The Court used it in

11   Kircher.     I use it.     Other people use it.              But if you

12   start getting serious about your words, it's meaningless

13   in this context.     We have subject matter jurisdiction

14   and it is conferred in the area of 1330, 1331, 1332.                       It

15   is not conferred in 1441, 1442, or 1443.                    It's simply

16   not there.

17                 So my backup argument is, he was right on

18   every point.     And my backup argument beyond that is

19   again, please, reread Carnegie Mellon.                    Put it next to

20   Thermtron and look at what the lower courts have done.

21   They have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in

22   cases that have no business being in the courts of

23   appeals.     They don't have immunity issues.                 They don't

24   have foreign sovereign issues.                They don't have

25   anything.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, the reason why they

 2   may have done that is because they've seen case after

 3   case where absolute power corrupts absolutely.                 And

 4   because district judges know that remand orders are not

 5   reviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for

 6   reasons that are clearly improper.                 That may be the

 7   reason.

 8               Now on your first argument, you say that

 9   what the district judge says is dispositive.                 You mean

10   if the district judge says I lack subject matter

11   jurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not --

12               MR. SIMON:       No.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          That's not --

14               MR. SIMON:       No, Your Honor.            I overstated.

15   Let me say it more clearly.            Kircher, decided last term,

16   makes clear the line between what can and can't be done.

17   It discusses precisely this point and it refers to the

18   Ryan versus Contra case and it refers to the Principi

19   case.   And it says that when the court is patently wrong

20   about whether the issue it is discussing is subject

21   matter jurisdiction, then this Court may enter into --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, it's a good

23   thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you

24   fall back very quickly.        I would have thought your

25   answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if


                                       49

 1   it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or

 2   otherwise.     And if it's remanded for a silly reason,

 3   that will be corrected on review of the State supreme

 4   court by this Court.

 5                 MR. SIMON:       That would be my first answer,

 6   and the Chief Justice said it much better than mine,

 7   than I have.     But I think, Your Honor, looking at

 8   Kircher, to be fair, looking at Kircher, I believe that

 9   is the position Justice Scalia took, it is concurring

10   opinion.     And I didn't want to suggest that

11   Justice Scalia's concurring opinion was the opinion of

12   the Court.     The opinion of the Court wrestles with what

13   I thought was Justice Alito's question.                   What do you do

14   if the trial judge says he has no subject matter

15   jurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety

16   jurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue

17   is?   It's really failure to state a claim.                 It's really

18   something else.     And we of course have the Steele case

19   which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often

20   get confused about them.           And the Court answered the

21   question by saying, only when the trial court is

22   patently wrong, patently wrong not about the

23   jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a

24   jurisdictional question, only when the court is patently

25   wrong do we second guess the court.

 1              So --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That certainly

 3   changes the argument.      So the notice of appeal that's

 4   filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court

 5   wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals

 6   has to consider that before determining whether it has

 7   jurisdiction to review the remand order.

 8              MR. SIMON:        If the court wants to adopt

 9   Justice Scalia's view in the prior case, in the Kircher

10   case, my clients would be pleased with the results --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I recommend that.

12              (Laughter.)

13              MR. SIMON:        But I think, Justice Roberts --

14   I think, Mr. Chief Justice -- I apologize.                Because my

15   time is running short, I would say the key point in this

16   case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in

17   the Ninth Circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing

18   and argument, and it was denied.               That was the point at

19   which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase "this is

20   patently wrong," would likely in most circuits before

21   most panels have lost.       And this matter would have gone

22   back to the State court 2-1/2 years before it got

23   affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and five years before

24   today.

25              Unless the Court has any further questions,

 1   I think I've completed my comments.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 3   Mr. Simon.

 4                Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes

 5   remaining.

 6           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                MR. FREDERICK:         Mr. Chief Justice, a

 9   non-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity.                     This

10   Court's cases have recognized that.                     In footnote 6 of

11   the Government's brief, the Government cites the Lehman

12   case which makes this point clear and argues that the

13   point should be applicable to sovereigns in the context

14   in which we are faced here.

15                The question of whether a foreign entity,

16   and it's more complicated often in the real world,

17   Justice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply

18   with questions but with the kinds of entities that

19   foreign governments create to advance public purposes.

20   The intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of

21   entities tested in State court to determine whether or

22   not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural

23   protections of the FSIA.         And it is not simply a

24   question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose

25   to recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of


                                       52

 1   instrumentalities that were created by those governments

 2   to advance public purposes, to serve as separate

 3   political entities, and who would be performing the

 4   kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and

 5   --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And Congress said, those

 7   entities don't get any immunity, they get two things:

 8   They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial.

 9   That's all that's at stake.

10               MR. FREDERICK:           That's not all that's at

11   stake, Justice Ginsburg.          There are also rights with

12   respect to foreign states to be free of punitive

13   damages.   There are rights to have certain property of

14   the sovereign that would be subject to different

15   attachment rules.

16               The FSIA has a whole string of procedural

17   protections that are afforded to foreign states and

18   their instrumentalities.          And this case ultimately is

19   about the fact that Powerex is being subjected to

20   multiple suits in State court, but as a result of the

21   Ninth Circuit's holding in --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Are those -- have they

23   been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or

24   have they always been brought in by defendants?

25               MR. FREDERICK:           They have been directly sued

 1   by the People of the State of California whom my brother

 2   here represents.    They have been sued by the California

 3   Attorney General.    They have been sued by the California

 4   Department of Water Resources.               And under the Ninth

 5   Circuit's precedent in this case which I urge you to

 6   overturn, Powerex has been remanded to State court, has

 7   not been permitted to appeal the remand order, and is

 8   stuck in State court in these cases without any

 9   opportunity to test what is a clearly erroneous, and

10   what my brother doesn't make any attempt to defend, the

11   merits of the decision, that Powerex has performed

12   public functions, it's serving at the direction of the

13   Government of British Columbia, and is performing these

14   functions to advance clearly public purposes.

15              And yet, we are now in this Kafkaesque work

16   world between State and Federal court where if we try to

17   litigate all the way up through State court, it is not

18   entirely clear whether we will ever have our organ --

19   our status as a foreign organ ever vindicated.                  Thank

20   you.
