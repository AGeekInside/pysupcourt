 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We will hear

 4   argument next in Case 06-1413, MeadWestvaco v. The

 5   Illinois Department of Revenue.

 6               Ms. Brinkmann.

 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

 8                       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MS. BRINKMANN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11               The ruling of the Illinois Appellate Court

12   in this case radically expanded the Court's

13   operational-function tax.          The State tax at issue

14   violates the principles of constitutional limitations on

15   state taxing authority for at least two reasons.

16   First, the factors relied on by the appellate court here

17   for functional -- for operational function would mean

18   that ownership and investment would meet that standard.

19   But that's what this Court rejected in Allied-Signal.

20               A State does not have the authority to reach

21   out to tax all investments owned by a company that does

22   business in the State.       The operational function demands

23   more.   It applies --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You are saying to me, Ms.

25   Brinkmann -- we talk about an asset, an investment.


                                        3

                           Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   This was one company.         This -- it's strange to talk

 2   about unitary basis or investment.                    This is a division

 3   of one company.      And we are talking about a sale of

 4   assets.   Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary.

 5                So what more is there than this is one

 6   company, it sells some of its assets?

 7                MS. BRINKMANN:            Well, Your Honor, the fact

 8   that it's a division does not mean that it meets either

 9   the operational-function test or the unitary-business

10   test.   A long line of cases from this Court tell us

11   that.   It --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Do we have any cases --

13   do we have any decisions that go against the state

14   taxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to

15   subsidiaries?

16                MS. BRINKMANN:            No, but the Exxon case

17   involved divisions, and it went in favor of the state

18   taxing authority.      But the Court applied a

19   straightforward, unitary business analysis to that.

20   And, Your Honor, this dates back to the Adams Express

21   case of 1897.

22                The Court in that case said it's not

23   ownership.      It's about the use, the unitariness of use,

24   not of ownership.      Mobile followed on that.               Mobile

25   talked about the fact that it's not the corporate form


                                           4

 1   that mattered.    It pointed out that that could have

 2   little to do with the underlying determination of

 3   apportionment, which depends upon whether it's a

 4   discrete business enterprise.

 5                And then following on the heels of that

 6   analysis in Mobil, the Court applied it to the Exxon

 7   case that involved divisions.              That was a vertically

 8   integrated corporation.         It's very different from the

 9   facts of this case, and it reached a different result.

10                Moreover, the Woolworth case involved

11   subsidiaries.    Three out of the four of them were 100

12   percent wholly owned.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can I go back to sort of a

14   fundamental question I'm not quite sure I know the

15   answer to.    Supposing we don't have corporations here,

16   but an individual resident of New York owned this whole

17   business and a big bunch of it was activities in

18   Illinois, and he sold the business.                      Would Illinois have

19   the authority to impose any tax on that transaction?

20                MS. BRINKMANN:          If it was a capital gain,

21   Your Honor, on the sale of investment, the Court's

22   longstanding cases teach that it is the domicile that

23   taxes that commercial gain.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm assuming it's not the

25   domicile.    The owner lives in New York.                    The business is


                                         5

 1   all over the country, but does millions of dollars of

 2   business in Illinois.        And they sell the whole business.

 3   Would the owner be subject to any tax of any kind in

 4   Illinois on that transaction?               Could he constitutionally

 5   be subjected to any tax?

 6              BRINKMANN:          If there was -- the domiciliary

 7   State generally is the State which has the authority to

 8   tax an income on a capital gain --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:                Assume it's not the

10   domiciliary State.

11              MS. BRINKMANN:             But what the Court explained

12   in Mobil, for example, if it is under the unitary

13   business principle, then the State in which --

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Could we get an answer

15   without reference to cases?               Do you think Illinois would

16   have the authority to impose a tax on that transaction?

17              MS. BRINKMANN:             If the -- there was

18   sufficient nexus to the company doing business --

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Millions of dollars of

20   business in Illinois, that's my assumption.

21              MS. BRINKMANN:             Yes, they would be able to

22   tax the ongoing business activity in that State.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               No.

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Could they tax the sale of

25   the business?

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I have the same --

 2                MS. BRINKMANN:         The sale of the business

 3   would be to the domicile of the seller.                   They would be

 4   able to --

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:            You're saying only the

 6   domicile could impose a tax?

 7                MS. BRINKMANN:         Yes, unless, as the Court

 8   recognized in Mobil, there is this unitary business

 9   exception, because the State's ability to tax begins at

10   the starting point at the territorial limitations of the

11   State.   And the Court has --

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But if they owned a truck

13   instead of a business, they could tax that transaction,

14   I suppose?

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You can't have a unitary

16   business -- a person who is a unitary business.                   I mean,

17   a person can't be unitary with Exxon.                   I mean, when you

18   speak of a unitary business you're talking about a

19   corporation which, you know, is unitary with another

20   corporation.

21                MS. BRINKMANN:         That's the area --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Once you put it into a

23   personal taxation scheme, it seems to me the whole

24   unitary business notion has no application at all.

25                MS. BRINKMANN:         Well, I agree with you, Your

 1   Honor.   But it does come back to the taxing, the right

 2   of the domicile State to tax on a sale --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What is -- what does the

 4   domicile State -- we have Ohio.              But you say as a matter

 5   of constitutional law, not State tax policy, as a matter

 6   of constitutional law, the only State that has authority

 7   to tax the capital gain is Ohio?

 8               MS. BRINKMANN:          That's right, Your Honor,

 9   unless --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Does Ohio -- would Ohio

11   give credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is

12   due?   What is, in fact, Ohio's tax law in this respect?

13   Does Ohio give credit to taxes paid by other States --

14   to other States?

15               MS. BRINKMANN:          Ohio would allocate the

16   entire gain as a capital gain on an intangible that was

17   sold in the State of Ohio.          That would be allocated in

18   its entirety to Illinois.

19               Now, what the Court has recognized is that

20   default principle sometimes gives way when that gain has

21   had enough connection to business activity in another

22   jurisdiction.   That's where these issues arise, because

23   there are States taxing multi- state activities.             And

24   that's --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Can I have an answer to a

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   very simple question?       If Illinois claimed the tax,

 2   would Ohio give credit for the tax paid in Illinois?

 3                MS. BRINKMANN:          Not if Ohio had the

 4   constitutional right to allocate that tax to Ohio, as it

 5   does.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do we know what -- what

 7   Ohio does in these situations?

 8                MS. BRINKMANN:          Yes.       It allocates it to the

 9   State of Ohio.    The only exception for that would be in

10   a situation, not the facts here, but if that capital

11   gain either served an operational function to the

12   business activities that were conducted in another

13   State, then that State would have a right to apportion

14   it and tax its portion of that or if the operational

15   function applied.    And that is because the activity now

16   has transformed from just a capital gain that's

17   connected to the domiciliary State of the seller to a

18   business income because it is part of this unitary

19   business.    That's why the other State has a right to

20   apportion.

21                JUSTICE ALITO:          What has Ohio done --

22                MS. BRINKMANN:          That's not the situation

23   here.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:          What has Ohio done up to

25   this point with respect to this transaction?

 1                MS. BRINKMANN:         Under Ohio's laws this would

 2   be allocated to that State.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                To Ohio?

 4                MS. BRINKMANN:         Yes, because it's a capital

 5   gain on a sale of an investment.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Ms. Brinkmann, you

 7   begin your brief by saying this, a paper company, that

 8   happens to own a data processing company.                 Why couldn't

 9   you equally say this is a data processing company that

10   happens to own a paper company?

11                MS. BRINKMANN:         No, Your Honor.            This has

12   been a paper company since 1846.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, and

14   Lexis/Nexis has been a data processing company since

15   whenever.

16                MS. BRINKMANN:         But under the Court's

17   unitary --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's not the

19   oldest -- whichever is oldest isn't the one that gets to

20   be regarded as the dominant partner, is it?

21                MS. BRINKMANN:         No.      But when you do the

22   analysis, you're looking at the taxpayer, which is Mead

23   Corporation.   And it clearly has a --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is General Electric

 1   company.

 2                 MS. BRINKMANN:          I would have to know many

 3   more facts in order to answer that questions, Your

 4   Honor.     But I -- and I don't mean to be evasive --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why isn't the answer

 6   both?    Why isn't the answer both, just as here it is

 7   both a paper or office supply company and a Lexis/Nexis,

 8   electronic data company?

 9                 MS. BRINKMANN:          It's an analytical construct

10   that we're doing here.         We're looking at the taxpayer

11   who is being taxed, the Mead Corporation.                   So you look

12   at its business that's being conducted in Illinois.

13   They have a unitary paper company that's vertically

14   integrated that's doing business activities in Illinois.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's because

16   they sell paper in Illinois?

17                 MS. BRINKMANN:          Yes.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, Lexis sells

19   data services in Illinois, too.

20                 MS. BRINKMANN:          Yes.       But when you're

21   looking -- and for both purposes, Your Honor, for State

22   tax on the operating income of both of those businesses,

23   Illinois does have a right to apportion those taxes.

24   And those taxes were paid without objection by both of

25   those businesses.

 1                We're talking about a tax on a different

 2   event, on a capital gain on a sale of the business in

 3   Ohio.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, why doesn't --

 5   I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has

 6   the right to tax Lexis under business activities in

 7   Illinois.    Illinois would argue the reason it has a

 8   capital gain is partly because they were doing business

 9   in Illinois and so we should be entitled to part of that

10   capital gain.    Almost -- I mean, it seems to me it would

11   be pretty easy if they get to tax 2 percent of Lexis's

12   business, well then maybe they should get 2 percent of

13   the capital gain when it's sold or tax 2 percent.

14                MS. BRINKMANN:          Your Honor, that is a

15   belated argument that the State of Illinois has raised

16   in this Court.    It did not present an argument to the

17   Illinois appellate court based on Lexis/Nexis's

18   connection to Illinois.         It raises a host of

19   jurisdictional, procedural and substantive bars.

20                Under the rules of Illinois, as we point out

21   in our reply brief, that argument is waived.                 This comes

22   to the Court from a State court, not a Federal court of

23   appeals.    Because of that waiver, it's an independent

24   and adequate state ground.

25                Moreover, that argument wasn't raised in the

 1   brief in opposition, either.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                They're raising it in --

 3   in support of the judgment.              So if it's novel, but it

 4   supports the judgment, then at least shouldn't the

 5   Illinois courts have a chance to look at it and say, oh,

 6   that's what we really meant, we just got -- explained it

 7   the wrong way?

 8              MS. BRINKMANN:             Well, that would certainly

 9   be a matter for the Illinois court rather than for this

10   Court, Your Honor.      But in addition, I think any

11   disposition on the merits of that issue would be a

12   ruling by this Court that would be trumping that

13   independent and adequate State ground waiver.

14              Moreover, this argument wasn't raised in the

15   brief in opposition, either.              And the Court's precedent,

16   of course, and practice would not be to address that.

17   Particularly in this case, it denied notice to the amici

18   who would be affected by this argument.

19              But turning to the substance of it --

20              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I think this is part of

21   the substance.   I thought that as part of one of your

22   answers you said that Ohio is free to allocate part of

23   this capital gains tax to Illinois?                       Did I hear you say

24   that, because I don't understand that?

25              MS. BRINKMANN:             No, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

 1   I apologize if I misspoke.         Ohio would allocate, I mean,

 2   take the entire gain for itself as the domicile State of

 3   the seller --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I see.

 5              MS. BRINKMANN:          -- of the investment.         In

 6   other factual scenarios, if it turns out that that asset

 7   actually was not an investment and in fact had enough

 8   connection to the business activities in Illinois

 9   because it was really the supplier of the raw materials,

10   or the two examples that this Court has given as

11   operational functions is the interest on the bank

12   account, which is the working capital, or the -- the

13   futures hedging against the raw material of corn.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, isn't it kind

15   of like futures hedging?        I mean, you've got a paper

16   company and then you've got something that is sort of

17   the paperless aspect, and they can look at it and say,

18   well, we're kind of hedging our paper business by

19   investing heavily in something that's supposedly going

20   to take away the need for paper.

21              MS. BRINKMANN:          No, Your Honor.         Under the

22   operational function test, it has to be a much closer

23   nexus to the operating, the operations of the paper

24   company; and short of that operational function -- or if

25   it were part of the unitary business, the domiciliary

 1   State would allocate.       And if I could turn --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are you saying this is a

 3   passive investment?

 4                 MS. BRINKMANN:         Yes, Your Honor.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           How can you call it a

 6   passive investment, not only when there was -- I think

 7   undisputedly -- as -- as much interest and activity in

 8   Nexis's business planning by the Mead people?             But to my

 9   mind even more importantly, when in fact Mead, I think a

10   couple of times, merged with -- with Nexis -- with Lexis

11   -- when that provided a tax advantage, by -- by giving

12   them loss carryforwards that reduced their taxes.               Why

13   isn't it fair to -- to say under the operational

14   function test that if -- if the company is -- if Nexis

15   is -- is mergeable with Mead when it produces a tax

16   advantage and is certainly in a very operational sense

17   functional then, because it's saving them a lot of

18   money -- and that's, that has nothing to do with passive

19   investment.    If it's usable in a merger scenario there,

20   it ought when the -- when the tide turns be -- be

21   regarded as close enough in operational function to be

22   taxable when the gain comes in.

23                 MS. BRINKMANN:         Your Honor, that's contrary

24   to the Court's long-standing recognition that something

25   that enriches the taxpayer is not necessarily part of

 1   the unitary business's operational function.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's -- that's right.

 3   But weren't the enrichment cases in which income was

 4   being generated by an investment?                The investor, of

 5   course, was the -- was the taxpayer company, and it

 6   simply reaped the benefits of a profitable investment.

 7   That's something very different from merging

 8   corporations, then unmerging them, and then merging them

 9   again to provide not merely enrichment, but great tax

10   savings; and if they are operationally close enough to

11   produce great tax savings, why shouldn't they be treated

12   as operationally close enough when in fact they -- they

13   produce a capital gain?

14               MS. BRINKMANN:          Because that isn't the

15   operational connection that justifies a State --

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:            The gain alone certainly is

17   not.   If they had absolutely done nothing but make their

18   investment and wait to see whether the ship came in, I

19   would understand your argument.              But between the

20   investment and the return of the ship, they were merging

21   these corporations back and forth for -- for their --

22   for Mead's tax advantage.          And that seems to me to take

23   it out -- take the facts of this case out of the sort of

24   the paradigm of the -- the operational or the

25   nonoperational function cases.

 1                 MS. BRINKMANN:         Your Honor, I think not, if

 2   we look at Allied-Signal, we look at Woolworth, and we

 3   look at ASARCO.    Allied-Signal was a sales and

 4   investment -- and getting back to the point about the

 5   argument really was waived about the connection with

 6   Lexis/Nexis in Illinois, those were the same facts in

 7   Allied-Signal.    The investment there was --

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It was a sale of stock in

 9   that case, wasn't it?

10                 MS. BRINKMANN:         Yes.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It was the sale of a

12   subsidiary.    And here we have a sale of assets of one

13   company, and that's why it's so hard for me to see this,

14   as, why are we talking about unitary or not?              There is

15   only one company; it's Mead.

16                 MS. BRINKMANN:         In Allied-Signal, the

17   investment there was also doing business within the

18   State.   In the Exxon case, there were divisions to which

19   this Court applied the entire unitary business

20   principle, because what the Court has said repeatedly in

21   Mobil, in Exxon, in all these cases, it's not the

22   corporate form; it is whether there is a discrete

23   business enterprise; and ASARCO speaks to this.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You told me that there

25   was no case that the tax -- taxing authority lost that


                                        17
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   involved divisions of a single company and sale of

 2   assets, rather than the sale of stock.

 3              MS. BRINKMANN:          That's correct.          We have

 4   four or five cases here.        One of them does involve

 5   divisions, Exxon, but in that case it was a vertically

 6   integrated corporation, and the State prevailed in that

 7   case, but it did not change the analysis that applied.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, we're talking about

 9   what Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking

10   us to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has

11   never been declared in any case.

12              MS. BRINKMANN:          It has, Your Honor.          It goes

13   back to principles that ownership do -- does not

14   determine; simply because there is a business operating

15   in the State, the State does not have the right to tax

16   every investment that's owned by that.                 That dates back

17   to 1897.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's not just that it's

19   an investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the

20   shares in another company.         It's both of these are

21   ongoing businesses, Lexis/Nexis and Mead, and they are

22   both generating income, and all along Illinois has been

23   taxing the income of both of them, right?

24              MS. BRINKMANN:          Yes, the operating income

25   within the State's apportioned.             But if you look to the


                                      18
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   business activity of the taxpayer Mead, operating in

 2   Illinois, it is that nexus on which Illinois is claiming

 3   that they have a right to tax here.                       And if we look at

 4   the Woolworth case, for example, I think that is also

 5   instructive.     Those were four subsidiaries.                    Three of

 6   them were 100 percent wholly owned, and the Court

 7   expressly said we recognize they are wholly owned

 8   subsidiaries.     These could be integrated divisions, and

 9   they said, that is not significant, if they are

10   independent, different business enterprises.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Weren't those foreign

12   corporations?

13              MS. BRINKMANN:             Yes, Your Honor.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                So running them as -- as

15   a single company would have been a little harder.

16              MS. BRINKMANN:             Well, no, in fact there were

17   also some foreign subsidiaries, I believe, involved in

18   the ASARCO case, for example, Your Honor, and the same

19   analysis applied -- you know, whether it was vertically

20   integrated and whether or not it met -- the unitary

21   business test goes back to three core principles, and

22   this Court has said at least four if not five times that

23   the unitary business principle is the linchpin of

24   apportionment.    That is whether or not there is

25   functional integration.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Don't we start -- I don't

 2   mean to cut off your argument, but don't we start with

 3   the assumption that this is not a unitary business?

 4   Wasn't that the finding of the trial court which was not

 5   disturbed on appeal?

 6              MS. BRINKMANN:           That's right, Your Honor.

 7   That's right.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:             You can say it if you want,

 9   but I wanted to make sure --

10              MS. BRINKMANN:           There is no virtual

11   integration; there is no sharing of centralized

12   management; there's no economies of scale.              We think

13   this is unassailable in the stipular record --

14              JUSTICE BREYER:             Am I thinking about that

15   part correctly?   I -- I found this difficult.             I go back

16   to the railroad; that seems the easiest case.              You have

17   a railroad in 50 States, and Illinois finds it very hard

18   to evaluate its -- evaluate its value, its railroad

19   property in Illinois, because the value of that depends

20   on service everywhere.       So the court says that's the

21   unitary principle; and really what you're supposed to

22   look at is whether when you look at the supposedly

23   separate part of the business, does that separate part

24   of the business contribute to the whole thing?              So that

25   if you were in fact trying to say what is Illinois doing


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   without considering that separate part, it would be

 2   tough to do.

 3                I mean, that's the underlying theme.

 4                MS. BRINKMANN:          We would --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            And if that's so, there is

 6   no second test.    I mean, I grant you there is language,

 7   but really what people have done is they've said, we are

 8   here in a special situation because we have an interest

 9   in another company, and that's a special part of our

10   business, and has nothing to do with the rest of the

11   business.   And then the argument is no, it does have

12   something to do with the rest of the business.             And if

13   it does, like it provides you with working capital, it's

14   just like the railroad track in California vis-a-vis

15   Illinois.

16                MS. BRINKMANN:          It's contributing to the

17   business.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:            And if it doesn't, it

19   doesn't.    So now, if that's right, then it's the form of

20   analysis rather than the result that's wrong in the

21   court below.    Because they start talking about two

22   separate tests and then people argue whether the second

23   should swallow up the first, and at that point I get

24   totally lost.    It's fairly long, but I'd appreciate your

25   evaluating what I've just said.

 1                MS. BRINKMANN:           Well, Your Honor, there --

 2   on this record, there's no question that the Lexis/Nexis

 3   cannot meet the unitary business test.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Yes, there is, Ms.

 5   Brinkmann.   The Illinois appellate court never got to

 6   that question.   Illinois argued all along this is a

 7   unitary business.     The only one who said it wasn't was

 8   this trial court, and the Illinois intermediate

 9   appellate court says, well, we don't have to deal with

10   that because if you use the other label, operational

11   function, that comes out all right, too.

12                But this argument was certainly the number

13   one argument that Illinois was making.                    It lost only in

14   the trial court on -- on it.              And the appellate court

15   said we don't have to get to it.                 So I think your answer

16   to Justice Souter really wasn't accurate because it

17   isn't --

18                MS. BRINKMANN:           Well, our position is on the

19   record here, Your Honor, the stipulated record, that

20   it's unassailable.      But we do --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              All we know is that a

22   trial judge said that was so.

23                MS. BRINKMANN:           And then that's our

24   position, obviously, on the record, Your Honor; but we

25   agreed this was properly raised in the appellate court,


                                         22
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   as opposed to the other argument which was not.                And

 2   this also was mentioned in the brief in opposition, as

 3   opposed to their other argument, which was not.

 4              So we do think the Court could reach this

 5   argument, and we maintain that on this record the

 6   linchpin of apportionment giving the right of a State --

 7   and this is a right to extend beyond its territory.

 8              The Court has already let it go beyond its

 9   territory to get to something outside the State if it's

10   part of the unitary business -- the railroad case, the

11   express case.

12              And in that situation there are three

13   factors, none of which can be met on this record.               There

14   was no shared, centralized management, none.             There was

15   no integrated functions, none.             And there were no

16   economies of scale.     Lexis/Nexis did not even get a

17   discount on any paper they bought from Mead.             They were,

18   you know, minor customers of each other.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Maybe when we're talking

20   about Due Process and Commerce Clause limitations on

21   what States can tax, we ought to ask ourselves if those

22   three -- is that it?      If we're trying to measure, is

23   there a sufficient relationship between Lexis/Nexis,

24   Mead, and the State of Illinois to make it fair for them

25   to tax?

 1                 And you say, oh, yes.               Each year when

 2   they're making income, when they are a going concern,

 3   Illinois can get a piece of it.               But when the assets are

 4   sold, assets that would have generated income for

 5   Illinois year after year, but when those assets are

 6   sold, Illinois can get nothing to represent -- to

 7   substitute for that stream of income that it would have

 8   gotten.

 9                 MS. BRINKMANN:         No.      It will continue to get

10   income tax on an apportioned basis before and after.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But Lexis/Nexis is gone.

12                 MS. BRINKMANN:         Well, Lexis/Nexis continues

13   to operate.    It's now owned by Reed Elsevier.              So it

14   would continue to pay an apportioned income tax.

15                 It's a different event here, Your Honor.               It

16   is the sale of an investment that occurred in Ohio.                  And

17   as the domicile State, Ohio has provided benefits to the

18   corporate headquarters, to management --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Suppose it had been

20   Delaware, and there was nothing there in Delaware except

21   it was a Delaware corporation.

22                 MS. BRINKMANN:         That's not the commercial

23   domicile, Your Honor.       There is a distinction in all of

24   these cases between the State of incorporation and the

25   commercial domicile.       The commercial domicile --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Ms. Brinkmann, one

 2   thing that concerns me is how this will complicate the

 3   process.    I think, with respect to ordinary income, the

 4   States work this out, and they figure we get 5 percent

 5   because we have 5 percent of the presence or business,

 6   whatever.

 7                Now, they're going to have that, and they're

 8   going to have an overlay on that.                  They're going to say,

 9   well, it's 5 percent; but, you know, we sold this asset

10   that doesn't have any connection to Illinois; and that's

11   part of the income we've got.               So you don't get quite 5

12   percent of all.

13                And another -- Illinois is going to come

14   back and say, well, yes, but you sold this other one;

15   and, as to that one, you've got sufficient connection

16   with Illinois.    It seems to me it's going to be

17   impossible to sort this out.

18                MS. BRINKMANN:           Your Honor, this has been

19   going on since at least 1992 in the Allied-Signal case.

20   The lower courts, the State courts, except for the court

21   in this case, have been able to apply that easily.

22                In order to take the expansive view of

23   Illinois here, you would be undermining Allied-Signal,

24   which had the same facts as in this case, not to mention

25   ASARCO, Woolworth.

 1              And I would just say, before I could reserve

 2   the remainder of my time, Allied-Signal was the case in

 3   which this Court was faced with new arguments raised by

 4   the States, at argument.         You went back and had

 5   resupplemental briefing and reargument, and questioned

 6   in your questions to those parties whether or not ASARCO

 7   and Woolworth should be revisited and overruled.

 8              So the Allied-Signal case took into account

 9   all of these concerns and came back with a ringing

10   affirmation of the linchpin of an apportionability for

11   state taxation being the unitary-business test with the

12   operational-function aspect.

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I don't like to intrude on

14   the white light, but if I could just ask one question.

15              If the unitary-tax argument has been

16   preserved and is met and if there's a finding that they

17   are unitary, does Illinois have the right to tax the

18   sale, or to -- to a portion of it?

19              MS. BRINKMANN:           We think that the finding is

20   that it is not unitary.

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, no.         Assume -- assume

22   it is unitary.   Can Illinois then, in your view, have a

23   part of -- tax part of the gain on the sale?

24              MS. BRINKMANN:           Yes, if it were unitary, but

25   we think there's no way this record could meet the

 1   standards compared to Woolworth, ASARCO.                   In all those

 2   cases, they were much closer.              Thank you.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Ms.

 4   Brinkmann.

 6                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN F. BAROV

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 8                MR. BAROV:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                Illinois is not attempting to tax income

11   earned outside its borders.             To the contrary, the income

12   it seeks to tax here is income earned by Mead on its

13   electronic publishing business, Lexis, which conducted

14   substantial business in Illinois.

15                Mead paid taxes on the income that the

16   electronic publishing business earned.                   Yet, it now

17   contends that the Constitution bars it from taxing any

18   of the gains it realized on the sale of Lexis, even

19   though Illinois undeniably contributed --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, if you did not

21   proceed on the unitary business there, let's take that

22   off the table.   It seems to me that Lexis's presence in

23   Illinois is quite irrelevant.

24                MR. BAROV:       No, Your Honor.             It's --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me that, under

 1   your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were

 2   not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.

 3                MR. BAROV:       If this - if they were unitary,

 4   yes, then Lexis's presence in Illinois would be

 5   irrelevant to this case, if they met the

 6   unitary-business doctrine.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's not the question.    I

 8   thought that the -- I agree with the same question

 9   Justice Kennedy had.       Suppose that I'm a Massachusetts

10   company that sells tables, and I sell some tables in

11   Illinois.    And one day I take some of the money, and I

12   buy an iron mine in New Mexico.               And then I sell the

13   iron mine.    And Illinois, not Massachusetts, wants to

14   impose a tax.    And suppose there is no connection

15   whatsoever between the iron mine and anything else but

16   for four, which are the four listed on page 13a:

17                One, that I have contributed capital support

18   to the iron mine.

19                Two, I approve the major capital

20   expenditures of the iron mine, sitting in my office in

21   Massachusetts.

22                Three, sometimes -- and this is a tougher

23   one -- I call the iron mine a division of my table

24   company.

25                And, four, I sometimes retain tax benefits


                                        28

 1   and control over the extra cash of the iron mine, but

 2   I'm not using it in my day-to-day work.

 3               Now, are those four things alone sufficient

 4   for Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine?                  That, it

 5   seems to me, is the way they presented it.                  Maybe it is

 6   a unitary business really, but I guess we have to send

 7   it back for that.

 8               MR. BAROV:        Under -- under those bare facts,

 9   probably there would be not a sufficient connection.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.       Then why isn't

11   that the end of this case?           That's what they said it

12   was.   That's what they said, perhaps wrongly, that this

13   isn't a unitary business.           And, therefore, we are left

14   with those four facts, and why not send it back and say

15   you haven't reached the unitary-business question; go

16   reach it?

17               MR. BAROV:        Because, Your Honor --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And if I can just add on

19   to that same question:        If you're going to have the

20   unitary-tax theory, that's -- that's very helpful.                  But

21   if we take the unitary-tax theory off the table, it

22   seems to me that you are confusing the law by having

23   some midway test.    I don't know what your theory is,

24   that -- in relation to this part of Justice Breyer's

25   question.

 1              MR. BAROV:          There's a two-part answer to

 2   that question -- those questions, Your Honor.

 3              First, there's a second avenue of State

 4   taxation that's been well recognized by this Court for

 5   at least 80 years, which is that if a business conducts

 6   business in a State, a State has a tax -- has the right

 7   to tax a share of that business.                 And that's all

 8   Illinois did here.      When it apportioned the income in

 9   this case, it apportioned the income only based on

10   Lexis's in-State Illinois presence.                       So under that

11   avenue alone, the tax is constitutional.

12              The second --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But Mead didn't receive --

14   pardon me -- Lexis didn't receive the money for the

15   sale, Mead did.

16              MR. BAROV:          Right.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Unless, again, if Mead's

18   presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what

19   happened here, absent a unitary theory.

20              MR. BAROV:          No, Your Honor.                Mead received

21   the tax -- the gain for the sale because Lexis was a

22   division of Mead, and the only tax-paying -- the only --

23   there is no -- there was no legal entity known as

24   "Lexis" at the time that Lexis was sold.                       It was assets

25   -- it was assets owned by the Mead Corporation.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              Now, Mead received the benefit -- the gain

 2   on the sale because Mead was the only tax-paying entity

 3   in this case.     So Mead was conducting a business in

 4   Illinois called "Lexis," and, therefore, Illinois could

 5   tax at least --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Do you think that if there

 7   had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a

 8   subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was -- it was

 9   sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois

10   then could have had a tax?

11              MR. BAROV:          Yes.       Illinois could have taxed

12   based on the --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               All right.      So, then, the

14   asset stock doesn't make any difference?

15              MR. BAROV:          But the -- but the point, Your

16   Honor, is that Lexis had a presence in Illinois.                  It was

17   conducting business in Illinois.                 That, alone, gave

18   Illinois the power to tax a share of the income --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               That gets back to Justice

20   Stevens's initial hypothetical.                If you live in New York

21   and you have an investment in a company that does a lot

22   of business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident

23   individual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois

24   could tax it.

25              MR. BAROV:          No.       Illinois can't tax that


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   State because there is no relationship -- there has to

 2   be some relationship, you know, between Illinois and the

 3   tax-paying activity and the taxpayer.

 4                 In Justice Breyer's hypothetical there was

 5   none.   But there is a -- but let me, if I can, address

 6   that prong of the analysis, also.

 7                 Here there was a much closer connection

 8   between Lexis and Mead than simply that of a passive

 9   investment.    It wasn't just that Mead helped Lexis buy,

10   make, handle acquisitions.            They were involved in the

11   actual acquisitions themselves, in purchasing and

12   contracting to make those acquisitions.

13                 Mead was involved in many of the -- in

14   controlling lots of their capital investment, its -- and

15   its -- it was also involved in manipulating excess -- in

16   their excess cash.      And there is a whole -- there was a

17   host of facts that supported a closer relationship

18   between Mead and Lexis than simply that, that passive

19   investment.

20                 So whether -- even if you are looking at it

21   from the operational-function point of view, there was

22   -- there was a -- a sufficient connection between Lexis

23   and Mead beyond that of Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:          If you traded places with

25   Ohio, how would you have treated this transaction under

 1   your tax laws?

 2              MR. BAROV:       Under our tax laws --

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:          Say that Mead was domiciled

 4   in Illinois but Lexis/Nexis operated in Ohio, would you

 5   have just taken -- would you have allocated or would you

 6   have claimed that -- the right to tax the entire capital

 7   gain?

 8              MR. BAROV:       This would have probably, I

 9   think, Your Honor -- I believe this would have been

10   apportioned as business income under Illinois law.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do you know what -- or

12   did you know what Ohio did in the --

13              MR. BAROV:       I don't know what Ohio did.

14   They -- Mead has never cited anything in the record to

15   support the contention that it has been -- that it was

16   allocated all to Ohio.      My understanding of Ohio law at

17   the time was they -- they have the same business-income

18   test, basically, that Illinois does.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, what would you say

20   -- I mean, we talk about apportioning income and

21   allocating income, allocating to the commercial

22   headquarters.

23              What in an enterprise like this would you

24   say is allocated to the commercial headquarters as

25   opposed to being apportioned among all the States?

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. BAROV:        Different States have different

 2   rules, Your Honor, and these are State-law rules, not

 3   constitutional rules, about allocation and

 4   apportionment.   Some States will allocate an intangible

 5   capital gain like this to their own domicile State.

 6              Other States will apportion it based on the

 7   share of income that is done in the State.

 8              Again, I don't know what Ohio did.                  But the

 9   point is that's a rule -- that's a State-law rule of

10   choice, not a rule of -- a constitutional rule.                 I think

11   this Court has been pretty clear in the Mobil Oil case

12   that these -- those -- that doesn't have a

13   constitutional significance.

14              That when a State, a domicile State, and a

15   State where a source -- which is the source of income,

16   when those conflict, in fact, this Court has signaled

17   that apportionment is the default rule.                 And that the

18   source State actually would have -- the source State

19   would win that confrontation.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Mr. Barov, I just want to

21   go back to an earlier answer to see how far you would go

22   with the position that you took.

23              Assume that, exclusive of Nexis, Mead is the

24   same kind of unitary corporation as under -- under

25   everybody's understanding now.              Assume, also, as you


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   suggested in a hypo, that Lexis was doing business in

 2   Illinois.   So that at least a -- a portion of its own

 3   activity could be taxed in Illinois.                    And assume, third,

 4   that the relationship between Mead and Lexis is simply

 5   one of passive investment.          Mead simply bought a lot of

 6   stock, maybe 100 percent of the stock at the right time;

 7   and, otherwise, it kept hands off.                 And at this point

 8   Mead now -- now sells.

 9               On -- on your theory, would -- would the

10   State of Illinois be able to tax a portion of the

11   capital gain?

12               MR. BAROV:       Yes, they would, Your Honor.

13   But they would be limited in how much of that capital

14   gain they could apportion.          They would apportion it

15   limited to the amount of income that arose in Illinois.

16   And that's what the auditor did in this case.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, but that would be, in

18   effect, the portion of the Nexis business, total

19   business that took place in Illinois, total sales, total

20   payroll, however you do it.

21               MR. BAROV:       Right, and then that would be

22   put -- that would be put into --

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       But the only point I

 1   trigger your theory?

 2               MR. BAROV:       Yes, it would be.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 4               MR. BAROV:       It is, Your Honor.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, why isn't

 6   your friend correct that you have waived any argument

 7   based on the presence of Lexis in Illinois?

 8               MR. BAROV:       Your Honor, two reasons:

 9               First, under the --              they have cited

10   basically two basis grounds for waiver, one under

11   Illinois law and under this Court's rules.                But they

12   misstate Illinois law in the -- on the waiver regard.

13               The cases and rules they cite to stand for a

14   simple proposition that a point not raised in a brief

15   before a particular court can't be raised on oral

16   argument.   But what the Illinois Supreme Court has been

17   clear on "otherwise" is that an argument, even if it's

18   not raised in the appellate court, as long as it's

19   raised in the trial court in support of a judgment, may

20   be raised in a reviewing court on further review.

21               I can provide a couple of cites, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And -- and I'm not

23   following your argument, because I thought that the

24   argument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in

25   the Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court


                                       36

 1   recognizes that it was made, and said we are not going

 2   to reach it because we have this operational-function

 3   test?

 4              MR. BAROV:         Yes, Your Honor.              That's --

 5   that's correct.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, but that's --

 7   they are very different from your current argument,

 8   which you emphasize that whether they are unitary or

 9   not, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois.

10              MR. BAROV:         That's correct, Your Honor.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Okay.   Now, as to

12   that argument, at least I am very reluctant to overturn

13   a State court on an argument that they didn't have an

14   opportunity to consider.          And whether it's technically

15   waived because you raised it in the trial court or not,

16   it certainly was not an argument you made to the

17   Illinois appellate courts.

18              MR. BAROV:         That's correct, Your Honor.                And

19   -- but I think, as this Court set forth in Caterpillar

20   v. Lewis, it is a predicate to the intelligent

21   resolution of this case.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, it wasn't in

23   Allied-Signal.    In Allied-Signal the asset that was sold

24   was in New Jersey, and that was totally irrelevant to

25   how we treated the issue in that case.

 1                MR. BAROV:       Certainly, Your Honor.       But New

 2   Jersey was taking a very different position in that

 3   case.    They were making a much broader argument than we

 4   are making here.    They were trying to overturn the

 5   entire unitary doctrine.

 6                And so they may have -- they may have chosen

 7   not to make that argument.           It may very well have been

 8   in that case that ASARCO's apportionment factors in that

 9   case were so minimal that it wasn't worth their making

10   that argument.

11                But, for whatever reason, they weren't

12   interested in taxing based on the source alone.

13                But here, as the facts show, Illinois did

14   tax.    We taxed Lexis, or the gain on Lexis, pursuant to

15   Lexis' in-state apportionment factors.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question

17   just -- it shows my ignorance, but if the

18   unitary-business approach to taxation was not applied in

19   this case, how did you compute the amount of the tax?

20                MR. BAROV:       It was computed -- what the

21   department did in this case is it -- it took the entire

22   gain that put -- that went into Mead's apportionable tax

23   base.    But, then, in order to find the Illinois-Lexis

24   share of the gain, he looked at the -- he looked at

25   Lexis's Illinois sales and Illinois's -- Lexis's


                                        38

 1   Illinois payroll and pulled that amount out, which was

 2   about four percent of the gain, and put that into Mead's

 3   --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:            So you use a different

 5   formula from the normal three-factor formula to compute

 6   the tax?

 7                MR. BAROV:       Right.         You use a different

 8   formula.    You use a two-factor formula, but it was just

 9   related to Mead's sales, not to --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it seems to me that

11   those factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale.

12   It's just whimsical.       It has nothing to do with the

13   sale.

14                The reason we use apportionment in other

15   cases is, just as in Justice Breyer's railroad example,

16   there is no other way to tell, and so forth.

17                But here the presence of Lexis in Illinois

18   is wholly accidental with reference to what went on in

19   the sale.

20                MR. BAROV:       No, Your Honor, it wasn't.           I

21   mean Lexis did considerable business in Illinois, and

22   the auditor was isolating Illinois's business in

23   attempting to accurately value the amount of gain that

24   should be attributable to Mead based on Lexis's Illinois

25   presence.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that's why

 2   it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the

 3   argument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois.

 4   That's the basis on which your auditor is claiming these

 5   taxes; and, yet, you don't even raise it before the

 6   Illinois appellate court as a ground for being able to

 7   reach the Lexis/Nexis income.

 8                 MR. BAROV:      -- the trial court -- actually

 9   the appellate court ruled on whether the State law tests

10   had been met at the time.           And when it went up on appeal

11   we -- we prevailed in the appellate court based on

12   operational -- I'm sorry, in the trial court, based on

13   the court's finding the operational function had been

14   met.    That's how the appellant framed the issue, and the

15   case sort of turned on really Illinois State law's

16   interpretation of Allied-Signal.                But, you know, at this

17   point the -- the facts and the law are clear and a

18   decision --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           In the Illinois courts,

20   they did argue that as a matter of Federal

21   constitutional law the tax is impermissible, didn't

22   they?

23                 MR. BAROV:      Correct, yes.              Yes, they did.

24   At this point, Your Honor, I mean, to render a decision

25   that doesn't take into account the facts of the case,

 1   the economic reality, accordingly would be artificial.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We couldn't do

 3   anything more if we said you haven't waived it, we

 4   couldn't do anything more than send it back.                     You're

 5   telling us Lexis has this presence in Illinois, but we

 6   have nothing in the record about that.

 7                MR. BAROV:      Yes, it is in the record.                The

 8   auditor's -- I mean, the stipulation itself shows that

 9   Lexis was in Illinois.       And the Illinois appellate court

10   made a finding that the presence of Lexis -- Mead to tax

11   Nexis with Illinois was undisputed.                     So the Illinois

12   appellate court recognized that Lexis had a taxing --

13   adequate taxing connection with Illinois.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Where is that?

15                MR. BAROV:      That is -- I don't have the page

16   cite handy, Your Honor, but the appellate court did make

17   a finding that it was undisputed that the --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I just -- usually

19   appellate courts don't make findings.                     That's why I'm

20   curious --

21                MR. BAROV:      I'm sorry.            Made a statement.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Was there any sort of

23   stipulation between the parties to say what each, what

24   Lexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing

25   in Illinois?

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. BAROV:      There was, there was a long

 2   stipulation, yes, Your Honor, and plus there was

 3   exhibits attached to the stipulation, which are

 4   reflected in our briefs, that discuss in detail what

 5   Mead and Lexis were both doing, at least their

 6   relationship to each other.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let me ask you about the

 8   theory that both the trial court and the intermediate

 9   appellate court went on, this operational function test,

10   which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I

11   don't know any that was decided.               Did we ever have any

12   case that turned on the operational function test to

13   hold for the State taxing authority?

14                MR. BAROV:      No, Your Honor.                But in

15   Allied-Signal there was -- examples were given of

16   certain --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.          But one of the

18   problems with applying it as you urge here is that that

19   would just override -- why would anyone go to the

20   trouble of making a case under the so-called unitary

21   business test, because the operational function test

22   would be much easier to meet?             So --

23                MR. BAROV:      I guess on that point I would

24   disagree with you a bit, Your Honor.                     I think there are

25   very -- they're different types that look at different


                                       42

 1   relationships.   So one doesn't -- while the same facts

 2   can support them in instances, you can have situations

 3   where a business is unitary but not operational or --

 4   I'm sorry, an asset is operational, but isn't

 5   necessarily --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            What?       What?    What could it

 7   be?   That is -- as I read this, I thought, well, there

 8   is no separate test.      It's just there's a certain

 9   situation that comes up fairly commonly where someone

10   claims that an asset of a company was really quite

11   separate, and therefore when they get income from it or

12   they sell it it has nothing to do with my business.                   And

13   the answer is:   It did have something to do with your

14   business, you used the working capital and so forth, in

15   which case it's part of the business.                   So how -- how is

16   it -- how is it different from that?

17               MR. BAROV:       I agree, Your Honor.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if you agree with

19   that, do you really agree, because if you agree with

20   that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong

21   to consider it separately, the lower court, and they

22   should have reached the question they didn't reach,

23   which was is this whole thing one single business, which

24   is normally called the unitary business test?

25               MR. BAROV:       Your Honor, on that point I


                                       43

 1   disagree.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            Good.       All right.

 3               MR. BAROV:       I think there is -- I mean,

 4   they're both ways of reaching the overall unitary

 5   principle, whether you can show the intangible flow of

 6   assets -- of value between a company -- I can give you

 7   an example, say, of a company that would be unitary but

 8   where the operational function analysis wouldn't apply

 9   is the Container Corp. Type fact pattern, where you have

10   a domestic -- a domestic parent providing value out to

11   the foreign subsidiaries, but there is nothing sort of

12   flowing back to the domestic parent.                    They're not really

13   using those subsidiaries in the domestic business.                    But

14   nevertheless, there is enough value being thrown out

15   that it passed the unitary threshold.

16               The unitary -- the unitary -- I'm sorry.

17   The operational function analysis or test or principle,

18   whatever you want to call it, arises in the examples

19   given in Allied-Signal.        As you said, you've got

20   something which isn't really part of the rest of your

21   business, but you're using it in that business to

22   support it way beyond just a passive investment.

23               And this -- in this case, that's how Mead

24   was using Lexis.   They were using it to support their,

25   the value of their multiple, their multi-state business,


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   by manipulating -- by making capital contributions,

 2   manipulating corporate structures, and bringing back

 3   that tax and net loss carryforwards, which increased the

 4   value, which increased their business activities.

 5              So this case actually is that -- is that --

 6   falls within that paradigm also.              It's not unlike any --

 7   like either of those hypotheticals in Allied-Signal, not

 8   unlike the use of working -- investment of working

 9   capital.

10              So, yes, both -- the test, while there are

11   facts that overlap them, they can show that there are

12   different relationships.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So say you -- but you

14   would be asking us, if you were going to go on that

15   operational function, to take two examples that were

16   given in Allied-Signal that are quite different from

17   what's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when

18   you recognize that we have never used that theory to

19   hold for a State taxing authority in the context of a

20   multi-state enterprise?

21              MR. BAROV:       Your Honor, I don't think you

22   have to create a separate doctrine again.              I think these

23   are both considered different ways of showing the

24   intangible flow of value, the significant links between

25   a business that give rise to constitutional


                                      45

 1   apportionment.   And whether they're considered separate

 2   analyses -- they have been described by some academics

 3   as corollaries of each other.             It's certainly, given

 4   this Court's signals in Allied-Signal, I think it's

 5   certainly appropriate where the facts arise to make the

 6   constitutional finding based on the operational function

 7   that an asset serves in a business.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this question.

 9   Does the record tell us whether other States have sought

10   to tax the capital gain on this transaction?

11              MR. BAROV:        No, it does not, Your Honor.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:             As far as we know,

13   Illinois is out on its own here?

14              MR. BAROV:        I don't know, Your -- I don't

15   know the answer to that, Your Honor.                    I hope not.

16              In any event, Your Honor --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You'd not wager, however,

18   right?

19              MR. BAROV:        In any case, Your Honor, as you

20   said, as I've said, there are two possible ways that --

21   two different constitutional paths or theories that we

22   can go down in this case to meet the -- that allows

23   Illinois to apportion.

24              Independent of the operational links, Mead

25   can tax the gain on Lexis simply because Lexis conducted

 1   business in Illinois.     A state may tax a nonresident's

 2   investment income based on its investment in a separate

 3   business, and that's exactly what Illinois -- that's

 4   another way to uphold the Illinois appellate court's

 5   decision.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If Illinois -- if Ohio

 7   is, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on

 8   the theory that this entire income should be allocated

 9   to Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation,

10   right?

11               MR. BAROV:      That's possible, Your Honor, but

12   it's -- first, there is no -- there's no evidence that

13   Ohio in fact did that.      But I think the Mobil Oil case

14   should have disposed of that, that contention, because

15   this Court rejected a similar argument that the mere

16   possibility of taxation by a domiciliary State

17   foreclosed taxation by a State where the business was

18   present.

19               And under Mobil Oil, when a resident State's

20   claim and a source State's claim conflict, this Court

21   indicated that the resident State's claim must yield to

22   that of the source State.         So there should be no issue

 1   where the appellate court said:                "Mead does not dispute

 2   that Lexis/Nexis had the requisite connection or nexus

 3   with Illinois."

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I thought -- I've

 5   been looking, too.      I thought 18A does say that they had

 6   $46 million of sales attributable to Lexis/Nexis.

 7                MR. BAROV:        Right.         Certainly.     There was

 8   hundreds of millions of dollars of sales in Illinois.

 9   So that's really not an issue in this case.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, only 46 million.

11                MR. BAROV:        I'm sorry.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It said 46, not

13   hundreds of millions.

14                MR. BAROV:        I'm sorry.            In 1994, yes, that's

15   correct.

16                The -- and again there's -- both Mead and

17   Lexis -- as both Mead and Lexis had adequate

18   constitutional connection here, there is no basis not to

19   sustain --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're taxing Mead, not

21   Nexis/Lexis?

22                MR. BAROV:        Correct.          That's correct.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So what relevance is it

24   that Nexis/Lexis has business in Illinois?

25                MR. BAROV:        It's --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean that's fine if

 2   that's who you're taxing.

 3              MR. BAROV:        Well, it's relevant if, only if,

 4   this Court finds that there was no operational

 5   relationship between Lexis and Mead.                    Then Lexis's

 6   presence in Illinois becomes relevant because in that

 7   case, whether you look at this as a separate business

 8   conducted by Mead or whether it was even a passive

 9   investment of Mead's, Illinois can still tax it in the

10   manner that it did by -- by isolating the values of

11   Lexis's -- that Lexis earned in Illinois.

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And that is different --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I might say that I don't

14   follow that.   It seems to me what you can establish from

15   the fact that it did a lot of business in Illinois is

16   that can you tax it and -- but I don't see how.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              There was no "it" to tax,

18   right?

19              MR. BAROV:        That 's correct.              There was no

20   "it" to tax and under this court's well-established case

21   law, International Harvester, J.C. Penney, a State can

22   tax a nonresident on an investment in that State as well

23   as the tax is properly prorated to the amount of income

24   that rose within that State.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              At the time of this sale


                                       49

 1   of Lexis/Nexis assets, there was only one taxpayer; it

 2   was Mead.

 3               MR. BAROV:       That's correct, Your Honor.

 4   There was one taxpayer and it was Mead.                  That was the

 5   only party that could have been taxed.                  That's correct.

 6               So here, in this case, Mead is taking an

 7   all-or-nothing approach to taxation but this could --

 8   this disregards the connections between Mead's

 9   electronic publishing business in Illinois.                  And the

10   Court should decline to rule in their favor.                 In fact --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you have any case like

12   that where your ability to tax a surviving corporation

13   has to do with, not whether the surviving corporation

14   itself has sufficient contacts with the State, but

15   whether some other corporation that has disappeared now

16   but that merged into it had sufficient -- it seems to me

17   you have to establish connection with the taxpayer.                    Not

18   -- not with somebody from whom the taxpayer made some

19   money.

20               MR. BAROV:       You have to establish a

21   connection with the taxpayer's activities in the taxing

22   State.   That's the constitutional touchstone.                So if

23   Mead -- whether Mead was running a business in Illinois

24   or investing in Illinois or had a unitary business that

25   operated in Illinois, those -- that's the -- that

 1   provides a sufficient link.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's fine.

 3                 MR. BAROV:       So that provides the taxing --

 4   the ability --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that isn't established

 6   by the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there.

 7   Ultimately you have to come down to connecting it to

 8   Mead, either by your unitary business doctrine or by

 9   this functional doctrine that you're relying on.

10                 MR. BAROV:       No, Your Honor.            Under

11   International Harvester, I think that the Court made it

12   very clear that even a passive investment can be taxed

13   by a State.    If Mead -- Mead can be taxed -- even if

14   LEXIS was a passive investor and Mead was only investing

15   in Illinois, Illinois could still tax Mead on the value

16   of its investment that arose in Illinois.                   And so Mead

17   realized the gain.      Mead is the taxpayer.               Mead can be

18   taxed as long as the tax is properly prorated to the

19   Illinois presence, which it was in this case.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But the proration, it

21   seems to me -- that should have nothing to do with the

22   extent of Lexis in Illinois --

23                 MR. BAROV:       Exactly.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- nor does it have to do

25   with the extent of Mead in Illinois.

 1                 MR. BAROV:      Well, no, Your Honor.          It's --

 2   under this -- then under this Court's precedent, that

 3   you're looking for the source State, the activity of the

 4   business was conducted in the source State.                Now, in

 5   this case it happened that the amounts are fairly close

 6   to each other.    So if there is any question about it,

 7   there's no -- you know, there is no constitutional

 8   problem that arises out of that.                But clearly this -- I

 9   mean it's settled precedent that a State can tax based

10   on income -- the income that arose in that State and

11   that's what happened here.

12                 Indeed, to accept Mead's contention which

13   also would create a constitutional loophole that for

14   income in ae State's marketplace helped create but which

15   a State cannot recover, the Illinois court's decision

16   permitting Illinois to tax a fraction of the gain should

17   be affirmed.

18                 And if the Court has no other questions --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can you tax me on stock --

20   on stock that I own on companies that do business in

21   Illinois?

22                 MR. BAROV:      In the abstract, yes, you could,

23   Your Honor.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do you know any State that

25   tries to do it.

 1              MR. BAROV:        No, Your Honor, but again, Your

 2   Honor --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's extraordinary.          I

 4   don't know of any tax that a State could possibly

 5   impose, that no State has imposed.

 6              (Laughter.)

 7              MR. BAROV:        Your Honor, this is -- but Your

 8   Honor, International Harvester is the perfectly precise

 9   fact pattern where this Court upheld a tax on a -- on

10   investors, on the shareholder's investment in a State in

11   which they were not present, so -- but in this case Mead

12   had an independent tax presence also in Illinois.                   So

13   that issue just doesn't arise in this case.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Counsel.

15              Ms. Brinkmann, you have three minutes.

16              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18              MS. BRINKMANN:          I have four very quick

19   points, Your Honor.     Two go into this new, very

20   breathtaking argument that the State is making based on

21   Lexis/Nexis's presence to the State.                   Concerning

22   Illinois law, if you look Repondents' brief in

23   opposition, on page 12 at note 4, they cite the same

24   Illinois law we do, trying to argue that we had waived

25   arguments in the brief in op, so we are on pretty solid

 1   ground there.   I think it's their cert page, they were

 2   agreeing with us on what the Illinois law meant.

 3               On the substance of it, I think Justice

 4   Scalia and Justice Kennedy brought out the weaknesses.

 5   Their position would lead to taxes on all stock sales.

 6   Any State where an investment was doing business could

 7   then reach out and apportion the gain on that.                 And as

 8   far as International Harvester and J.C. Penney, those

 9   were tax on the investment, not the investor.                 And the

10   dissent -- that was the dispute -- the majority.                 It was

11   the incident of the tax fell on the invest -- the

12   investment that was doing business in the State.

13               The State concedes, Your Honor, on Justice

14   Ginsburg's, the distinction between -- the sale of

15   assets and the sale of stocks that you were concerned

16   about.   On page 43, they concede and I think it's very

17   well recognized through Mobil and Exxon and Woolworth

18   that "apportionment has nothing to do with the form a

19   business organization takes."

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Ms. Brinkmann, your

21   final point.

22               MS. BRINKMANN:          Finally I would point out,

23   on the question you asked -- I think it was Justice

24   Ginsburg -- what Illinois would do in this.

25   Interestingly --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Ohio.

 2                MS. BRINKMANN:          -- the record in this case

 3   at -- it's not in the joint appendix, but it's at C-851.

 4   It's Exhibit 1, to the stipulation of facts.                  It

 5   indicates that interest and dividends allocable are

 6   allocable to Illinois if the commercial domicile is in

 7   Illinois.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Illinois or Ohio, were you

 9   talking about?

10                MS. BRINKMANN:          This is the Illinois return,

11   and the question was what Illinois would do?                  And they

12   say commercial domicile, we get your interest and

13   dividends.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Ms. Brinkmann, on

15   the waiver point -- I'm looking at page 18a -- it not

16   only says that Lexis/Nexis contributed $46 million from

17   its presence in Illinois; it begins the sentence by

18   saying "as the Department notes, $46 million of Mead's

19   income came from Lexis/Nexis activities in Illinois."

20   So that doesn't sound like a waiver of that point to me.

21                MS. BRINKMANN:          At one point, after they got

22   through the unitary business and operational functional

23   analysis, there was an argument about whether it was

24   grossly disproportionate, and that's where some of that

25   information came.    It was never in the context of this

 1   legal --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Initially, it's

 3   about the context in which -- what I regard as an

 4   important fact -- was raised, whether it was raised in

 5   the context of an argument on unitary business or

 6   whether or not they went too far, but the stubborn fact

 7   is still there.

 8                 MS. BRINKMANN:          There are facts, Your Honor,

 9   but the Illinois law is very clear; it's rule 341(h)(7)

10   and (i) which applies to applee.                 If you don't raise a

11   point in the appellate court, it is waived.                    That's an

12   independent and adequate State ground.                    And it's a very

13   breathtaking argument, as Justice Scalia pointed out,

14   that also wasn't brought forth in the brief in

15   opposition.     Thank you, Your Honor.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you.   The case

17   is submitted.
