 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. SCHWARTZ:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The question in this case is whether it is

12   fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act

13   that Congress revoked the district court jurisdiction to

14   declare acts of Congress unconstitutional in actions

15   brought by Federal employees.              The answer is no, for

16   several reasons.

17               First, the Civil Service Reform Act doesn't

18   say that it precludes section 1331 jurisdiction.

19   Congress could have said so.              Congress didn't say so.

20   And there's no inference of preclusion of the

21   Petitioners' claims that's fairly discernible from the

22   scheme itself.    And that's because challenges to

23   constitutionality of statutes are just not the type of

24   claims that are reviewed through the CSRA scheme.

25               Because of this, the Merit Systems

                                                                       4
 1   Protection Board dismisses challenge -- challenges to

 2   constitutionality of a statute routinely as outside of

 3   its authority.

 4                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Schwartz --

 5                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

 6                JUSTICE KAGAN:        -- suppose an employee is

 7   fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims,

 8   constitutional and statutory.            What would you think

 9   happens then?    Does he bring the constitutional claims

10   in one court but the statutory claims in another

11   court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission?

12                MR. SCHWARTZ:       No, Your Honor.      I believe

13   that, because of normal rules against splitting of

14   claims, the employee would have to make a decision.

15                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, that seems just as

16   bad.   In other words, that then, you -- it's not

17   inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the

18   employee to choose between her constitutional claims and

19   her statutory claims.

20                MR. SCHWARTZ:       That is correct.

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Why would we do that?

22                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Because of the importance of

23   making the constitutional claims available in -- in a --

24   for judicial review.     That is -- that's just one of the

25   options that the employee would have to weigh.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:        Why would you make

 2   that concession?   Why wouldn't it be possible in that --

 3   for an employee to choose?        If the employee had both

 4   constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps

 5   that employee could take advantage of the review scheme

 6   that's outlined by the Government.               But in the situation

 7   where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the

 8   employee would have the option of bringing the claim in

 9   one of the district courts.

10               MR. SCHWARTZ:       That -- that certainly is a

11   possibility, Your Honor.      And -- and it is a possibility

12   that the employee could bring his constitutional claim

13   in the district court and still pursue his statutory

14   claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board.

15   However, I'd like to point out that, while this is an

16   interesting hypothetical, we don't have to look at

17   hypotheticals in this situation because we have in the

18   Third Circuit since 1986 and in the District of Columbia

19   Circuit since 1995 -- those two circuits permit Federal

20   employees to bring their constitutional claims in the

21   circuit court.

22               We were unable to find a single instance in

23   which there has been one of these mixed claims of a -- a

24   constitutional claim and a statutory claim brought in

25   those circuits.

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       In -- in those cases, did

 2   the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional

 3   claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit?

 4                  MR. SCHWARTZ:      We -- we were unable to -- to

 5   find any example of -- of that happening.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes, well, that's -- that's

 7   the problem here.    I mean, yes, if all you have is a

 8   constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose

 9   would work.    You go to the district court.              But where --

10   where you have both, it's a problem.

11                  MR. SCHWARTZ:      I -- and I -- I agree that

12   that is a more difficult situation.                But it's not the

13   situation presented by the facts of this case at least.

14                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       You suggested that it's a

15   situation that doesn't often arise, and I guess that

16   puzzles me.    Why wouldn't it often arise?

17                  MR. SCHWARTZ:      I don't know why it doesn't

18   often arise.    It -- it might be that -- that people

19   prefer to leave their claims in the Merit Systems

20   Protection Board.    And --

24   if the employee is fired because of his or her religion

25   and he goes to MSPB?

 1               MR. SCHWARTZ:         Yes.

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And this is a First

 3   Amendment claim.    MSPB has to say, well, this is not

 4   adequate cause, and -- and then they find something else

 5   in the statute?    It can't look at the constitutional

 6   aspect of the claim?

 7               MR. SCHWARTZ:         Your Honor, if -- if an

 8   employee is fired because of his religion, there's --

 9   there's a -- a separate procedure for discrimination

10   claims such as could be brought under Title VII -- and,

11   in fact, those claims do go directly to the district

12   court.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, because -- well,

14   let's -- then I have to do a new hypothetical.

15               (Laughter.)

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Because he gave a -- a

20   global warming or something.

21               MR. SCHWARTZ:         Yes.       That claim now could be

22   brought before the Merit Systems Protection Board, and I

23   agree that -- that it can be brought before the Merit

24   Systems Protection Board, and I'm not urging this Court

25   to say that that --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Schwartz, I thought

12   you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute.

13                 MR. SCHWARTZ:      That's it exactly, Your

14   Honor.

16   claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an

17   official.    I thought that your point was when you're

18   challenging the constitutionality of a statute, then you

19   have a right to go to the district court.

 2                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.      I am drawing a

 3   distinction between a challenge to the constitutionality

 4   of a statute, as the Petitioners are doing here, and

 5   that is beyond the -- the authority of the Merit

 6   Systems --

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Are you talking about a

 8   facial challenge to the statute as -- and am I

 9   understanding you right?        A facial challenge goes to the

10   district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge

11   goes to the commission?

12                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.      And -- and that --

13   that's the procedure.       The as-applied challenge -- those

14   cases are bread-and-butter cases at the Merit Systems

15   Protection Board now.       If somebody says I was fired

16   because I wrote a letter to the editor that my boss

17   didn't like, he's not challenging the constitutional --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But I -- I was leading up

19   to the fact, why should there be a difference?               If the

20   MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it

21   have it for facial?      I mean, the expertise question

22   is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong

23   about that?

24                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Well, I would -- with due

25   respect, I -- I disagree with you, Your Honor.               The

 1   expertise required to decide the present Petitioners'

 2   claim and the letter to the editor claim is totally

 3   different.   In the letter to the editor claim, the facts

 4   concern the facts of the workplace, what was my boss's

 5   motivation, what were his actual reasons for firing me.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, and whether that

 7   reason was justifiable.      And isn't it the case that

 8   whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you

 9   would have an as-applied challenge, right?

10                MR. SCHWARTZ:      Yes.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:       So, why do you need a

12   facial challenge in addition?           I thought that we always

13   try to do as-applied first and facial second.          So, why

14   isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems

15   Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying

16   that this action was wrong and not allowed under the

17   statute?   And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong

18   was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the

19   problem?

20                MR. SCHWARTZ:      Justice Scalia, I -- I agree

21   that in the as-applied challenge where somebody says my

22   rights were violated, that case now goes and should go

23   to the Merit Systems Protection Board.           In the present

24   case, there's no challenge to the application of a

25   statute.   There's no challenge to any decision that was

 2   decision made by Congress --

 4   rule --

 5               MR. SCHWARTZ:       -- in enacting the Civil --

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               That's the rule that

 7   you would apply across the board so long -- only in the

 8   case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the

 9   district court?   If it's an as-applied -- this law was

10   unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before

11   the MSPB?

12               MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.     And -- and --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could you tell me how --

14               MR. SCHWARTZ:       And --

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- how -- how this is

16   any different than the administrative system and review

17   system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois

18   Long-Term Care?   In both those statutes, the agencies

19   weren't permitted to consider facial challenges,

20   constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they

21   can't, but the reviewing court can.              So, how's that any

22   different from the situation you're proposing here?

23               MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.     There are several

24   significant differences.      I'd like to -- I'd like to go

25   through them.

 1                 First of all, in the Thunder Basin case,

 2   the -- the constitutional challenge was -- was to the

 3   procedures that were being applied.               The agency, the

 8                 In the present case, the challenge is to the

 9   Selective Service laws.       The Merit Systems Protection

10   Board --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But please deal with the

12   language of both cases.       Both cases said even if the

13   agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there's

14   still review within the Federal Circuit -- within the --

15   within the circuit courts, and that's okay.

16                 MR. SCHWARTZ:      Yes.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, why isn't that okay

18   here?    I think that was Justice Scalia's question to

19   you.    I know that you say, well, the Federal Circuit

20   won't have a record.     But the Government says if it

21   wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to

22   develop it.    So, what's wrong with that procedure?

23                 MR. SCHWARTZ:      The first thing that's

24   wrong -- that's wrong with that procedure as it would be

25   applied to this case is that it's -- it's a vast

 1   departure from the Civil Service Reform Act scheme as it

 2   was created by Congress; and -- and -- because that

 3   scheme involves the Merit Systems Protection Board

 4   acting as a trial court; and -- and giving the first

 5   level of review and in effect substituting for the --

 6   for a district court.     And then --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Isn't one of the

 8   challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was

 9   constructively discharged?        Isn't that an issue that the

10   board is better suited to determine in the first

11   instance, whether there was at all a constructive

12   discharge?

13                MR. SCHWARTZ:      Well, in fact, it's -- it's

14   just the reverse of that, where that one Petitioner

15   would be taking the position that he was not

16   constructively discharged.        If he was constructively

17   discharged, the Merit Systems Protection Board arguably

18   would have jurisdiction.      If he voluntarily resigned,

19   under the Government's theory, he would be among the

20   class of Federal employees -- constitutes about a third

21   of Federal employees -- who have no appellate rights to

22   the Merit Systems Protection Board.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought your position

24   was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we

25   have no authority to adjudicate constitutional

 2                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So, I thought that the

 4   court was saying this claim is dismissed because we

 5   don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of

 6   question.   And then your next -- the Federal Circuit --

 7   well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction

 8   over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said

 9   it didn't have authority to render the decision?

10                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought that that's

12   what your position was.

13                MR. SCHWARTZ:       That is what our position is,

14   and -- and it leaves open the question of just what the

15   Federal Circuit is going to do after the Merit Systems

16   Protection Board has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But that's not your

18   position, as I understood it, in your response to my

19   earlier question.    You said that the -- it is all right

20   to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented

21   to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the

22   Federal Circuit.

23                MR. SCHWARTZ:       My position is that if the

24   MSPB has jurisdiction to find a statute -- that since

25   the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to find a statute


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   unconstitutional, any claim in which the employee is

 2   asking for them to find a statute unconstitutional is

 3   one that is outside of the CSRA scheme.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Okay, but -- but

 5   within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim

 6   that this statute is, while not facially

 7   unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me --

 8   Where does that go?

 9                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

10   apologize for my confusion about --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I think it's

12   probably mine.

13                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Well, I would defer to you,

14   Your Honor.

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Where does -- where

17   does -- where does that claim go?

18                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       My confusion is about the use

19   of the term "as applied."         And I -- rather than using

20   terms such as "facial" or "as applied" where the

21   dividing line can be somewhat blurry, I propose drawing

22   the dividing line between a case where the employee is

23   saying this statute is unconstitutional; I'm saying

24   Congress made a mistake --

25                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, why wouldn't the

 1    dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent

 2    with your argument.    The dividing line should be where

 3    the MSPB itself could decide the claim.

 4                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       If the MSPB can decide the

 6   claim, then it goes to the MSPB.           If the MSPB can't

 7   decide the claim, I think is what you're saying, then

 8   it has to go to the district court.

 9                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       And you're saying that the

11    MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide,

12    cases where he says, you know, my -- my supervisor fired

13    me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the

14    scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which

15    is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional

16    full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's

17    authority.   Is that right?

18                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes, that's absolutely

19    correct.   And -- and the cases that would not be within

20    the MSPB's authority would include cases where the

21    employee says the statute is unconstitutional and would

22    also include the million or so Federal employees who, as

23    the Government says, have no appellate rights to the

24    MSPB, all -- all of those persons, career -- those

25    persons would include summer interns, FBI employees.

 2   summer interns and FBI employees?

 3                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.     The --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I assume that's for

 5   very different reasons -- one because they are summer

 6   interns, and, you know, if they are impermissibly

 7   treated, it's kind of -- they're summer interns.

 8   There's no reason to get --

 9                 (Laughter.)

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I don't -- I

11   don't mean that facetiously.            I mean, what they're

12   saying is that there's some level of de minimis

13   personnel actions when you're talking about the vast

14   Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give,

15   you know, the whole panoply of rights.              And FBI agents,

16   I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they

17   deal with.

18                 So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want

19   us to focus on the millions of employees who would now

20   be going to district court or do you want us to focus on

21   the small number that have facial constitutional

22   challenges?

23                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Well, actually, Your Honor,

24   it's the Government that is taking the position that the

 1   attorneys, Federal Government chaplains, who have no

 2   right to appeal to the MSPB -- all of those persons, the

 3   Government says.   Can bring their constitutional claims

 4   to the district court.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And why is that wrong?    It

 6   seems to me that's what the -- what the Administrative

 7   Procedure Act says, that if there is no other effective

 8   means of judicial review, you get judicial review under

 9   the APA.

10               MR. SCHWARTZ:        Well --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            These people have no

12   effective right because they can't go to the MSPB and

13   can't go to the Federal Circuit.              So, they have -- they

14   have rights in the district court.              That's not a

15   problem.

16               The problem is the people who do have rights

17   to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, who

18   have constitutional claims based on -- on the

19   unconstitutionality of a statute?

20               MR. SCHWARTZ:        Well, I -- I disagree with

21   that, Justice Scalia.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why?

23               MR. SCHWARTZ:        Because the -- the summer

 1   claim that they can take to the Merit Systems Protection

 2   Board, they're precluded from going to any other court.

 3   They're precluded under the Administrative Procedures

 4   Act.   That's this Court's Fausto decision.           And in this

 5   Court's Fausto decision, a Federal employee who could

 6   not bring a case -- his appeal to the Merit Systems

 7   Protection Board tried to bring a Back Pay Act claim in

 8   the Court of Claims and this court said, no, that is

 9   precluded.

10                 And what the Government is doing is saying

11   you got a right in Fausto, but for constitutional

12   claims, Mr. Fausto had it right.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but that's -- that's

14   entirely logical.    Fausto in effect said that the

15   statutory structure simply provides no cause of action

16   for these people, okay?

17                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           They're not entitled to

19   anything.    But I don't think that there's anything in

20   the -- in the civil service laws that say these people

21   are not entitled to constitutional protections.            So, I

22   don't think that -- that Fausto rules this out.

23                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Well, and I -- I agree with you

24   completely that -- that constitutional claims are

25   different from statutory claims --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And it's those that I say

 4   that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems

 5   Protection Board -- they can bring those constitutional

 6   claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims.

 7                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.      And that's -- that's

 8   the position I'm taking.       I'm taking it a step beyond

 9   the Government, however.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.     You're taking -- I'm

11   saying that's true only with respect to those people who

12   have no right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection

13   Board.   You're going further.

14                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you're saying even the

16   people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection

17   Board, right, can go directly to the district court?

18   That's a different question.

19                MR. SCHWARTZ:       But I -- I'm limiting that to

20   those people who can appeal to the Merit Systems

21   Protection Board, but the Merit Systems Protection Board

22   has no authority to grant them relief.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:       There are at least -- at

24   least three different kinds of constitutional claims,

25   and I'm not sure where you're drawing the line with

 1   respect to your argument.         There's a claim that -- that

 2   the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that

 3   any statute is unconstitutional --

 4               MR. SCHWARTZ:         Yes.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:         -- but there's

 6   unconstitutional executive action.               There's an as-

 7   applied claim.    Let's say that a plaintiff says that the

 8   registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied

 9   to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a

10   conscientious objector or I have religious objections to

11   military action that the United States is taking at this

12   particular time.   And then there's this -- there's a

13   claim that this statute is unconstitutional on its face.

14               Now, where do you -- which of those can the

15   Merit Systems Protection Review Board decide?               Just the

16   first category?

17               MR. SCHWARTZ:         Just the first category.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:         So, it's not a distinction

19   between as-applied and facial?

20               MR. SCHWARTZ:         No.    No, no.      And that's --

21   that's -- that's why -- that's why I'm specifically not

22   trying to say where the line is between as-applied and

23   facial.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought your position

25   was that whatever the MSPB cannot hear, then you can go

 1   to the district court.

 2               MR. SCHWARTZ:       That is absolutely correct.

 3   And --

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Now, in your original briefs,

 5   Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear

 6   a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit.            And as I

 7   understood the Government's brief, the Government comes

 8   back and said that's not the case.             Even when the MSPB

 9   can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it.

10   Now, then there's a question of, if there's a necessity

11   for a record, how does the record get developed?

12               But do you now concede that the Federal

13   Circuit could hear the claim as a matter -- you know, on

14   the -- at the -- at the first level?

15               MR. SCHWARTZ:       I agree that a system can be

16   proposed to get these claims to the Federal Circuit.

17   However, it's not the system of the -- that Congress

18   created in the Civil Service Reform Act.            And the

19   significance of the contortions that have to be gone

20   through to get these claims to the Federal Circuit

21   demonstrates that it's not fairly discernible from the

22   Civil Service Reform Act as written by Congress that --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Do you take the position

24   that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has

25   no jurisdiction, it can't adjudicate this matter, well,

 1   then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to -- to

 2   review?   There's nothing to review because the MSPB said

 3   we have no jurisdiction.

 4                MR. SCHWARTZ:        That's how it would work in

 5   the real world.   I mean, what is -- what is the Federal

 6   Circuit supposed to do?       It has an order from the MSPB

 7   that says we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.              The

 8   Federal Circuit -- and the Government doesn't say that

 9   that is wrong.    The Federal Circuit says we affirm your

10   dismissal, and now we'll move on to the merits.              That --

11   it's possible we could have a system like that, but that

12   isn't the system of the Civil Service Reform Act, and

13   that's not the way that appellate courts normally

14   function.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is it really a

16   question of jurisdiction of the MSPB?

17                MR. SCHWARTZ:        Well --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              "Jurisdiction" is a

19   word with many meanings.

20                MR. SCHWARTZ:        Yes.      And -- and -- and

21   there's a general rule with that -- there have been

22   exceptions to -- that administrative agencies do not

23   have authority to rule on constitutionality of statutes.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            So, what's the problem?     He

25   says -- the employee says I was dismissed.              MSPB says


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that's right, you were, and it's lawful.              The employee

 2   says but you didn't consider my argument that the

 3   relevant statute was unconstitutional.              MSPB says, no,

 4   we can't.    The Federal Circuit says but we can; so, make

 5   your argument.   What's the problem?             And then I'll

 6   decide it.   And if they decide it's unconstitutional,

 7   then the action of the MSPB is wrong.

 8                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       That's a system that -- that

 9   could come up.   It's not the system of the Civil Service

10   Reform Act in -- because --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I don't know -- I'm just

12   saying, is there any practical problem with that?

13                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Oh, it presents immense

14   practical problems.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Which is?

16                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Which is that the Merit

17   Systems Protection Board is not going to say we affirm

18   your dismissal or that -- it's not going to reach the

19   merits.   It's going to -- it's going to get the

20   paperwork.   The government is going to --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Fine, fine.   What they say

22   is you have one argument here, that the statute that led

23   to your dismissal was unconstitutional.

24                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           We do not have jurisdiction


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   over that; therefore, we say you were rightly dismissed.

 2                MR. SCHWARTZ:         Yes.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:             Now, they appeal that, and

 4   they say they're right that they didn't, but you do; so,

 5   will you please decide that this statute is

 6   unconstitutional?     What's the problem?

 7                MR. SCHWARTZ:         Well, that's -- that's an

 8   unusual form of --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:             Ah.    It may be unusual.     I

10   just want to know what's the problem.               I'm not saying

11   there isn't one.    I want to know what's the problem with

12   that.

13                MR. SCHWARTZ:         Okay.        The problem, if that

14   is the system that's going to be in place, is that it's

15   not quite that straightforward.                It's -- at first, the

16   employee has to file his claim in the MSPB with

17   everybody knowing it's going to be dismissed.               He then

18   appeals that dismissal to the Federal Circuit, which

19   affirms the dismissal, says, yes, MSPB has no

20   jurisdiction.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:             No, it doesn't affirm the

22   dismissal.   It says the dismissal was unconstitutional;

23   go reinstate him.

24                MR. SCHWARTZ:         And then, in a case such as

25   this one, where -- the raison d'être of this challenge


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to Rostker is that the facts have changed.           There was

 2   extensive factual discovery in Rostker.           So --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought that your point was

 4   and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no

 5   jurisdiction to decide we have no jurisdiction to

 6   review.

 7              MR. SCHWARTZ:         That's what the Federal

 8   Circuit had said.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And that an appellate

10   court is reviewing a court of first instance.             The

11   scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal

12   Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an

13   appellate court.

14              MR. SCHWARTZ:         And that is why what's

15   proposed by the Government is such a departure from the

16   CSRA scheme as written by Congress, in which MSPB has

17   first-instance jurisdiction; the Federal Circuit has

18   appellate jurisdiction.

19              JUSTICE KAGAN:          Well, isn't your basic

20   answer to Justice Breyer -- I mean, correct me if I'm

21   wrong -- you think that the problem is that there's no

22   record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this

23   constitutional claim?

24              MR. SCHWARTZ:         That is correct.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, every day of the week

 1   we get constitutional claims, and people submit all

 2   their arguments in the briefs.            Now, occasionally,

 3   there's one you have to have factual development, and I

 4   grant you on that one maybe they could appoint a special

 5   master or, if not, send it back.            But they have plenty

 6   of authority to get them to argue the facts.            But I

 7   doubt -- I don't know if there are such claims.            But I

 8   don't see why that would be a problem.            Now, I'm not --

 9   again, I'm not giving you an answer.             I'm giving you a

10   question.

11                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       The problem is that that's

12   not the scheme written by Congress --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's your conclusion, and

14   I want to know what -- what is the practical reason that

15   that wouldn't work or why is that such a big problem to

16   have it work that way?       I'm asking for your answer on

17   that.

18                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Okay.      I mean, that's -- that

19   system could work in some cases.            I agree with that.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Give me one where it

21   wouldn't.

22                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Excuse me?

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:           So, you have to be thinking

 3   about it if you want to respond.

 4                  MR. SCHWARTZ:       Okay.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought you said this

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          This one, because you

 9   want to make a record of all the changes that have

10   occurred in the service, and you need much more than

11   briefs.   You need to have maybe testimony from people

12   who have -- who have been working with the changes in

13   the -- in the opportunities for women in service.

14                  MR. SCHWARTZ:       Yes.     That's correct.

 1   and may it please the Court:

 2                 I'd like to begin if I could by addressing the

 3   question asked by Justice Kagan, which is why shouldn't

 4   the scope of the MSPB's authority be the test for

 5   determining whether a claim can be filed in district

 6   court?

 7                 And I think using that as the test would

 8   lead to unclear and easily manipulated jurisdictional

 9   rules.    Among other things, it often won't be clear up

10   front whether the MSPB can resolve an employee's claim

11   or not.   A claim that appears at first blush to

12   challenge a statute's constitutionality might be

13   resolved, for instance, by interpreting the statute to

14   avoid the constitutional question, which is something

15   that the MSPB could do.

16                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       We could just ask the

17   MSPB, Mr. Feigin.    If you bring the claim to the MSPB,

18   and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to

19   adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a

20   world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that

21   you can go to the district court.

22                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well, I don't think that's

23   consistent with the CSRA, Your Honor, because the way

24   the CSRA works is that you go to the MSPB first, and

25   then you go to the Federal Circuit.              And I think


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                         30
 1   everyone agrees that the Federal --

 2               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, but the CSRA is

 3   presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something.

 4               MR. FEIGIN:       I don't think it's presuming

 5   that any more than 42 U.S.C. 405(g) was presuming that

 6   in Illinois Council or the Mine Act was presuming that

 7   in Thunder Basin Coal.       That is, that it's often useful

 8   to have constitutional claims presented to an agency in

 9   the first instance, even if the agency can't resolve

10   those claims, because it allows the agency to figure

11   out -- for example, in the case that this Court was

12   discussing with Mr. Schwartz about circumstances where

13   there might be nonconstitutional claims and

14   constitutional claims, the agency might be able to moot

15   out the case on nonconstitutional grounds.          The

16   constitutional --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Feigin, those --

18   those statutes to which you refer said that no action on

19   the claim -- well, this was Social Security benefits --

20   no action shall be brought under 1331.           There is no such

21   provision here.

22               MR. FEIGIN:       That was true in Illinois

23   Council and some of the other cases we cite.          But in --

24   in Thunder Basin, the Court was very clear that the

25   statute was facially silent as to the preclusion of


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        31
 1   pre-enforcement claims like the sort that were at issue

 2   in Thunder Basin.    The Court nevertheless held that the

 3   claim in Thunder Basin was precluded, and it held that

 4   even though it acknowledged that it might be possible

 5   that the constitutional claim that was raised by the

 6   plaintiff in that case couldn't be addressed in first

 7   instance by the Mine Commission.

 8                Now, the MSPB here is very analogous to the

 9   Mine Commission.

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, could you help me with

11   something?   Because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a

12   very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong

13   case for Mr. Schwartz.       And I read those two opinions,

14   and, frankly, I have a tough time reconciling them.          So,

15   could you tell me how you do?

16                MR. FEIGIN:      We prefer Thunder Basin, Your

17   Honor.

18                (Laughter.)

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Yes, I imagine so.

20                MR. FEIGIN:      Your Honor, I think, as we

21   suggest in our brief, McNary actually presented a very

22   specialized circumstance in several respects.           First of

23   all, there was a special statutory provision in that

24   case that limited judicial review of -- in that case, to

25   the record that had already been developed, and that's


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                       32
 1   not true here.

 2                Second, the Court was very concerned in

 3   McNary that if the plaintiffs weren't allowed to bring

 4   their claims in district court, they wouldn't be able to

 5   receive any meaningful judicial review at all.

 6                Now, here, the plaintiffs in this case can

 7   get meaningful judicial review from the Federal Circuit,

 8   which everyone agrees has the authority to resolve a

 9   constitutional challenge to a statute.

10                Now, if I could, I'd like to address I think

11   some confusion, as the Chief Justice was noting, over

12   the meaning of the term "jurisdiction" and exactly what

13   would happen if the Petitioners had brought this case in

14   the first instance to the MSPB.

15                Now, before getting into this, I'd like to

16   acknowledge that when Petitioner Elgin did bring this

17   case to the MSPB, the government argued that the MSPB

18   had no jurisdiction.     We have conceded below and we

19   concede here that we were wrong about that.         We do not

20   think Elgin should be prejudiced by the government's

21   position.   If he were to file a motion now to reopen his

22   case with the MSPB, the Government would support that.

23                Here's how it should have worked if the

24   government --

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Is that your -- is that

 1   your answer for that's why it's an out for their failure

 2   to have gone to the Federal Circuit?

 3               MR. FEIGIN:     Our answer -- our answer --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Will they be able -- if

 5   the -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do

 6   they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit?

 7               MR. FEIGIN:     Well, they can appeal that

 8   decision to the Federal Circuit, and the Government will

 9   again support the fact that the case ought to be

10   reopened.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Please finish with your

12   answer.

13               MR. FEIGIN:     And let me now address what

14   should have happened when the case went to the MSPB.

15   The MSPB would have had jurisdiction over the case in

16   the sense that the challenge to the adverse action is

17   properly before the MSPB.       I think that's very clear

18   under 5 U.S.C. 7513(d) and 5 U.S.C. 7701(a), which grant

19   the MSPB jurisdiction over adverse actions under the

20   CSRA.

21               Now, the MSPB would not be able to

22   adjudicate the constitutionality, would not be able to

23   issue an order striking down a Federal statute.        And to

24   determine that that would be what would be necessary

25   here in order to grant the plaintiffs relief, what it

 1   would have done is, first of all, it could have accepted

 2   any evidence that the plaintiffs or the government

 3   wished to submit on the constitutional issue in order to

 4   build up the administrative record for review --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Could I ask you to

 6   pause --

 7                 MR. FEIGIN:     Yes.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             -- briefly on that

 9   question?    So, the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes

10   in before the MSPB and says we have three witnesses who

11   are going to testify only on the constitutional issue; I

12   have this volume of evidence about what's happening in

13   the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional

14   issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to

15   present this -- the government is going to say it's okay

16   with us, right?

17                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             They're not going to

19   object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency

20   to decide.

21                 MR. FEIGIN:     We will not object that it's

22   not beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I will object.   What

24   is the agency -- taking evidence on an issue that it has

25   no jurisdiction to decide?         That is absolutely weird.

 2                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor, I think this

 3   is fairly analogous, although not perfectly analogous,

 4   to the fairly common circumstance where, for example, a

 5   district court reserves to itself a decision on the

 6   merits of an action and then delegates to a magistrate

 7   judge decisions on discovery.           Now, the only

 8   limitation --

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But they're very different

10   because the magistrate can come back to the district

11   court judge and say we have a tough one, Your Honor; why

12   don't you decide it?

13                 I mean, here you're stipulating that the

14   board has no power to decide this question.             Call it

15   jurisdiction; call it something else.            The board cannot

16   decide the question, but the board is going to now

17   become the arbiter of discovery disputes?           The

18   factfinder?   I mean, "weird" is a good word for it.

19                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well, first of all, Your Honor,

20   the only thing that we think the MSPB lacks authority to

21   do, the only thing, is to issue an order on the merits

22   declaring a Federal statute unconstitutional.             It is

23   competent to resolve discovery disputes --

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:       How can it -- how can it

25   deal with discovery without knowing -- without going

                                                                       36
 1   into the merits of the constitutional claim?         In other

 2   words, the parties can just put in any evidence they

 3   want?

 4                MR. FEIGIN:      Well --

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:        Any evidence they think

 6   might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put

 7   that in.   It can be discovery of anything.

 8                MR. FEIGIN:      Well, there may be disputes as

 9   to the scope of discovery.         And those -- resolution of

10   those disputes may touch on the merits.          We think the

11   MSPB can do all of that.        The only thing the MSPB lacks

12   authority to do, according to the MSPB, is to issue an

13   order striking down a Federal statute as

14   unconstitutional.

15                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Do you think the MSPB should

16   find facts with regard to this claim?

17                MR. FEIGIN:      Well, first of all, Your Honor,

18   I think this case isn't going to require any factfinding

19   because I think it's worth noting that both judges that

20   have addressed Petitioners' arguments on the merits, the

21   district court judge and the concurring judge in the

22   court of appeals --

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, maybe it will and

24   maybe it won't.

25                MR. FEIGIN: -- were able to resolve the

 1   claim without factfinding.

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:         I would think, Mr. Feigin,

 3   it would depend on how it's litigated.                But in a case in

 4   which there is some factfinding to be made, would the

 5   MSPB have authority to find facts?

 6                MR. FEIGIN:       Yes, it would, Your Honor.

 7   Now, I'd like to add that in many cases --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Can you go back and tell

 9   me when the government changed its position?                It was my

10   understanding that up until, well, certainly this case

11   was litigated, the government was taking the position

12   MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the

13   constitutionality of a statute.

14                When did the government back away from that

15   position?   When did it say, no, we were wrong; they do

16   have jurisdiction?

17                MR. FEIGIN:       Well, Your Honor, I need to

18   separate out two things.         First, it is still our

19   position that the MSPB has no authority to declare a

20   Federal statute unconstitutional.                 Now, the government

21   was taking the position that in cases where an employee

22   had been removed pursuant to a statutory bar, that the

23   MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of -- of a

24   case like that.

25                And the reason the government argued was not


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                          38
 1   because the MSPB lacked authority to decide the

 2   constitutionality of a statute, although we believe

 3   that, too, but because the government was arguing

 4   erroneously that an employee who is removed based on a

 5   statutory bar that should have prevented his hiring in

 6   the first place wasn't an employee within the meaning of

 7   5 U.S.C. 7511.   Now the government no longer takes that

 8   5 U.S.C. 7511 position.       We've been consistent on that

 9   in the court of appeals and in this Court, and,

10   therefore, we believe that the MSPB did properly have

11   jurisdiction over the action in this case.

12                 Now, when it goes up to the MSPB, the MS --

13   and after -- the MSPB would then deny relief on the

14   merits because it would lack the authority to declare a

15   Federal statute unconstitutional.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I don't want to delay you;

17   so, don't pause too long.         But I've just been curious --

18   where did this rule -- is there a statute or something

19   that says an agency can't say that this action would be

20   unconstitutional?    Where does that idea come from?

21                 MR. FEIGIN:     So, there is not a statute,

22   Your Honor.   This Court has said in several cases that

23   administrative agencies generally lack the authority to

24   declare a statute unconstitutional.              It's clear from

25   Thunder Basin that that isn't a constitutional


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                  39
 1   limitation on the authority of Federal agencies.      That

 2   is to say, if Congress wanted to give an agency the

 3   authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of a

 4   statute, it could.      And the Court noted that the Mine

 5   Commission in Thunder Basin believed it did have the

 6   authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of

 7   statutes, although the Court didn't reach whether the

 8   Mine Commission was correct about that.

 9                  And in this case, the MSPB believes,

10   consistent with this Court's repeated statements, that

11   it lacks authority to adjudicate the constitutionality

12   of statutes.

13                  Now, if the Court decides that the best way

14   to reconcile this scheme would simply be to say that the

15   MSPB does have the authority to adjudicate the

16   constitutionality of statutes, I think that would make

17   much more sense than the position the Petitioners are

18   urging.   And here's an example, I think, that

19   illustrates why the position the Petitioners are urging

20   will lead to confusion of jurisdictional rules and

21   manipulation of jurisdictional rules.

22                  So, if you imagine two employees who were

23   fired by an employing agency for leaking information to

24   the press, confidential information to the press, they

25   both challenge their removals, but they raise slightly


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                        40
 1   different arguments.       The first one says, well, I don't

 2   think the employment statute should be construed to

 3   allow me to be fired for this reason because I think the

 4   employment statute should be construed with First

 5   Amendment principles in mind and shouldn't reach this

 6   case.

 7                  The second one says I concede that the

 8   employment statutes allow my firing for this reason, but

 9   I think those -- I think that statute is

10   unconstitutional as applied.

11                  Now, those are really the same claim and --

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Mr. Feigin, they might

13   well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the

14   one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant

15   distinction.    Now, you might be right in what you said.

16   Well, maybe one answer is that the MSPB can decide both.

17   But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other,

18   it seems -- I mean, that's -- it seems like a sensible

19   dividing line.

20                  MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor, even if the

21   MSPB lacks the authority to strike down a Federal

22   statute, I still think it might be able to adjudicate

23   the claim of the employee, the second employee, who

24   brings it as an as-applied challenge because the Court

25   would -- I'm sorry; not the Court -- the MSPB could

 1   decide that case on the same constitutional avoidance

 2   grounds that are -- that are urged by the first

 3   employee.

 4                 That is, they really are the same case.

 5   Before striking down a statute as constitutional, this

 6   Court all the time, it instructs lower courts, and this

 7   would be true of agencies, too, should interpret the

 8   statute to avoid any significant constitutional

 9   question.

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:       But they're not at all the

11   same claim.   They're related, but one says the statute

12   means something; and insofar as it's applied to a

13   particular situation, it's unconstitutional.        The other

14   one says it doesn't mean that.

15                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor, I think they

16   are the same in the respect that, as I was just saying

17   to Justice Kagan, if the MSPB --

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:       When we -- just let me rephrase

19   that.   If -- if this Court adopts a certain

20   interpretation based on the principle of constitutional

21   avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the

22   statute?

23                 MR. FEIGIN:     No, Your Honor, but there may

24   be ambiguity in a statute that the Court interprets to

25   avoid a significant constitutional question.        So, maybe


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                   42
 1   I can give another example that might flesh this out a

 2   little bit.

 3                 There's a statute, 5 U.S.C. 7311, that bars

 4   from Federal employment people who have participated in

 5   strikes.   Now, it's easy to think of an employee who

 6   raises a factual or statutory challenge to that claim.

 7   He says that what he did wasn't participating in a

 8   strike, either factually or shouldn't be considered

 9   participating in a strike within the scope of the

10   statute.   And he also challenges the statute on

11   constitutional grounds.

12                 And the most common case brought to the

13   MSPB, in our experience, that raises a constitutional

14   claim also raises the sort of factual and statutory

15   claims I was just suggesting.           Now, the MSPB might

16   resolve that first question -- those first set of

17   questions in such a way as to avoid the constitutional

18   question by saying that the statute doesn't reach the

19   conduct that the particular employee engaged in.

20                 And if we imagine instead that the employee

21   had only brought the constitutional claim, which would

22   be kind of a strange way to litigate because he'd be

23   giving up arguments on which he might win, I still think

24   that the MSPB could decide, look, before we send this

25   off to the Federal Circuit and decide that the only way


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                         43
 1   we can grant you relief is to say that a Federal statute

 2   is unconstitutional, which is something we don't think

 3   we can do, we should at least take a look at the statute

 4   to see whether these somewhat ambiguous terms,

 5   "participate" and "strike," actually do apply to your

 6   conduct.

 7                And by failing to give the MSPB the first

 8   crack at doing that, what --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is there any such

10   possibility in this case?        I mean, the statute says men

11   must register for the draft.           There's no way to avoid --

12   to reread that statute to say anything other than that.

13   So, I don't -- I don't see any constitutional avoidance.

14                MR. FEIGIN:     I agree with that, Justice

15   Ginsburg.   In this case, we don't think the

16   constitutional question can be avoided, and we don't

17   think the MSPB could have granted relief.          But I don't

18   think the Court should essentially throw everything out

19   just because of this case.        Their position is going to

20   make for unclear jurisdictional rules, and employees

21   aren't going to know where they're entitled to go or

22   where they're supposed to go, because --

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          To go back to your

24   interesting suggestion that the board should decide the

25   constitutional issue, I've just been spending a little

 1   bit of time going through the Act, and you're

 2   certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in

 3   the Act that precludes them from granting any

 4   appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful

 5   discharge.   Am I correct?

 6                  MR. FEIGIN:     That's correct, Your Honor.

 7   The statute does not, as we explain in our brief, draw

 8   any distinction between the types of arguments that

 9   would be made in seeking to set aside an unlawful

10   discharge --

11                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Although, that's weird in

12   another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, because, can we

13   really imagine in the real world the MSPB deciding that

14   the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional?                 I mean,

15   what do they know about that question?

16                  MR. FEIGIN:     Well, as everyone agrees and as

17   Mr. Schwartz was discussing with the Court, the MSPB

18   does have expertise on -- in constitutional claims.                The

19   MSPB are a set of -- a set of persons that are appointed

20   by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

21                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, but this is a

22   question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that

23   I'm just talking about this case.                 But this is a

24   question about whether women should have to register for

25   the draft in the same way as men should.                 That goes to

 1   defense policy.   It goes to equal protection law.                It

 2   doesn't seem to have anything to do with -- with

 3   workplace issues of the kind that the MSPB is expert on.

 4                MR. FEIGIN:      Well, I think that's right,

 5   Justice Kagan, but the CSRA doesn't draw distinctions

 6   between the types of arguments that are being made.                 It

 7   draws distinctions, as Justice Sotomayor was just

 8   suggesting, about what sorts of personnel actions it

 9   covers.   And I think --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:        Congress is -- Congress is

11   unhappy when this Court holds a statute

12   unconstitutional.

13                (Laughter.)

14                JUSTICE ALITO:        Do you think it's -- it's

15   really likely that they intended for the MS -- MSPRB to

16   have the authority to declare its acts unconstitutional?

17                MR. FEIGIN:      I don't, Your Honor.          And

18   that's why our primary position is that the MSPB does

19   not have that authority.        However --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?     I mean, it sounds --

21   really what the argument boils down to is -- is if we

22   accept your position, there's a kind of procedural

23   complexity and anomaly.       And your argument is that his

24   position's worse.    And, yours is also fairly bad.

 5   think a statute is unconstitutional.               I suppose

 6   millions.   I don't know how many.              So, is this coming

 7   that they can't do it from some kind of lore from

 8   Kenneth Davis or something or -- what's -- what's the

 9   basis of this?   And wouldn't it be simpler if you just

10   said it says they can take appropriate relief?                 They can

11   take appropriate relief, period.           End of the matter.

12                MR. FEIGIN:     It's coming from statements by

13   this Court and also statements by Kenneth Davis --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           Are there --

15                MR. FEIGIN:     -- in 1958 his administrative

16   law treatise.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           So, somebody quoted Kenneth

18   Davis in 1958 and wrote it into an opinion in a holding?

19                MR. FEIGIN:     No.        The Court usually just

20   sort of says this in passing.           And the Court made very

21   clear --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           So, Kenneth Davis said this

23   in 1958?

24                MR. FEIGIN:     The Court made very clear in

25   Thunder Basin this is just a general presumption --

 2                  MR. FEIGIN:     -- about the authority of

 3   administrative agencies.         It doesn't have to be --

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Johnson v. Robison is one

 5   such case.   I don't recall in that case anybody

 6   referring to any administrative law treatise.

 7                  MR. FEIGIN:     Well, that treatise is cited,

 8   for example, by -- the Court cites the Mine Commission

 9   cases that themselves cite the treatise.               But the point

10   is, Justice Breyer, even if our rule does have a couple

11   of hiccups with it, we do think it is much superior to

12   the rule that Petitioners are urging because there are

13   clear jurisdictional rules.

14                  If I could follow up --

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             If I could just

16   focus there.    In your brief, you're quite careful, and

17   you have been today, to talk to even if the MSPB lacked

18   this authority.    It's your position that the MSPB does

19   lack this authority in fact; right?               It's not just the

20   MSPB's position.

21                  MR. FEIGIN:     Yes, we agree with the MSPB's

22   position that it lacks the authority to strike down a

23   statute as constitutional.          However, if it is a

24   difference between adopting Petitioners' position or

25   holding that the MSPB has the authority to declare a

 1   statute unconstitutional, we think Congress would have

 2   greatly preferred the latter because that preserves

 3   the -- the basic idea of the CSRA, which was to

 4   consolidate and streamline judicial review.

 5                As this Court recognized in Fausto, Congress

 6   specifically did not want challenges to adverse actions

 7   to go through district court into the court of appeals

 8   and get a duplicative and wasteful two-layer judicial

 9   review.   Instead --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:          If anybody who drafted or

11   voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about

12   a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a

13   facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute,

14   do you think they would have said, well, the way we

15   think that this should be handled is this scheme that

16   you have proposed?

17                MR. FEIGIN:        I think they would have

18   preferred it to a scheme where, first of all, the claims

19   go to district court, which is precisely what the CSRA

20   was trying to eliminate; and, second of all, to a scheme

21   where it becomes confusing and dependent on precisely

22   how a plaintiff frames his argument which court winds up

23   entertaining the claim.

24                Now --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you know of any

 1   other -- any other case where an appellate court has

 2   authority to decide a question that the court of first

 3   instance lacked authority to decide?            I mean, you say

 4   MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that.

 5                I couldn't think of another case where a

 6   court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first

 7   view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of

 8   first instance.

 9                MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor, first of all,

10   we cite several examples of courts of appeals deciding

11   constitutional questions in the first instance, at pages

12   37 to 38 in our brief.      Another example would be this

13   Court's decision in INS v. Chadha, the legislative veto

14   case, which came up from the Board of Immigration

15   Appeals.   The Board of Immigration Appeals said it

16   didn't have authority to adjudicate the separation of

17   powers question.   It was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit

18   and then reviewed by this Court.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Feigin, could I go back

20   to the Chief Justice's question about what actually

21   would happen in the MSPB?        Presumably in this case, what

22   the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive

23   factual record showing how much has changed in the

24   military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women

25   play in the military.     And that it's almost impossible


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to litigate this kind of claim without having such a

 2   record.   That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that

 3   Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations.

 4   So, how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record

 5   that is needed to litigate this claim?

 6                MR. FEIGIN:       You would develop it in the

 7   MSPB, either in the first instance on the initial

 8   appeal, or the MSPB could let it go to the Federal

 9   Circuit without having developed an administrative

10   record.   And the Federal Circuit if, unlike either of

11   the judges to address the merits in this case, believed

12   that a factual record was necessary, it could remand to

13   the MSPB with instructions that the MSPB take evidence

14   and develop an administrative record.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't like that at all.

16   That's ridiculous.      Send it back to an agency that has

17   no jurisdiction over the question, you know, make

18   factfindings on this -- on this question over which you

19   have no jurisdiction.

20                Can you give any example where -- where that

21   occurs elsewhere?     Why wouldn't the -- the preferable

22   course be to appoint a master, have the Federal Circuit

23   appoint a master to do it?

24                MR. FEIGIN:       Your Honor, if the Court

25   believes that that is a better way to reconcile the

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, I don't like

 3   that.

 4                 (Laughter.)

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I mean, the idea

 6   of -- the special masters floating around freely every

 7   time you get one of these cases -- I mean, what --

 8   inevitably what's going to happen is that you're going

 9   to have a more or less permanent special master who gets

10   all these things.    You're not going to appoint 85

11   special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of

12   claims.    It seems to me you've got an agency there

13   that's expert in the interrelation between the different

14   provisions in the statute.         And, you know, why don't --

15   why don't -- they make factfindings all the time in

16   areas within their authority to decide.              It seems to me

17   it's ready-made for sending these things back.

18                 MR. FEIGIN:     That was our position, Your

19   Honor --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but -- but this is not

21   an area that's within their expertise to decide.              What

22   do they know about -- about the military?              And when is

23   that ever -- ever relevant to anything that they decide?

24   It's utterly irrelevant to their work.              And you're

25   telling them to take --

 1               MR. FEIGIN:        Well, first of all, Your Honor,

 2   I think it's actually going to be a fairly rare case in

 3   which a challenge to a legislative act of passing a

 4   statute is really going to turn on some sort of factual

 5   finding -- like a credibility --

 6               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Well, but this is that case.

 7               MR. FEIGIN:        -- like a credibility

 8   determination or something that's uniquely within the

 9   competence of a trial court or an agency with trial

10   court-like powers.

11               I think what might be more common, Justice

12   Kagan, is that you might need to develop some sort of

13   administrative record.        But once the evidence is

14   submitted, the conclusions one would draw from that

15   evidence will be fairly obvious.             For example, in

16   Rostker v. Goldberg, there was discovery, there was

17   evidence submitted, and then the parties were able to

18   stipulate to the facts that would set forth review.

19               So, in this case, for example, I don't think

20   there's really going to be a dispute that the MSPB is

21   going to have to resolve about what sorts of positions

22   women can serve in, in the military.              I think the

23   government is going to be willing to stipulate to that.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:          I suspect that if this were

25   litigated in district court, the government would move

 1   to dismiss and would take the position that it doesn't

 2   matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the --

 3   the things that are done in the military, the

 4   Registration Act is still constitutional.              Wouldn't you

 5   take that position?

 6                 MR. FEIGIN:     Your Honor, I don't --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Would you say that if -- if

 8   it can be proven that they've -- that women are now --

 9   that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may

10   be unconstitutional?

11                 Anyway, assuming that you might take that

12   position, then -- and you might win on that -- then what

13   would be the point of having all of this discovery that

14   you're talking about?

15                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well --

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:       All of this -- all of this

17   development of the factual record?               What -- what sense

18   does it make to develop a big factual record before you

19   know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any

20   difference?

21                 MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor, the way to

22   deal with that would be to just have a very quick stop

23   in the MSPB which assures itself, yes, this is a

24   constitutional challenge to a statute.              As the Court

25   recognized in Weinberger v. Salfi, for example, it is


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                            54
 1   useful to have -- at least exhaust the claim with the

 2   agency for that purpose.        Yes --

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Is there any rule of the

 4   board that stops a litigant from making a proffer -- an

 5   offer of proof?

 6               MR. FEIGIN:       There is not, Your Honor, and,

 7   in fact, it would be --

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Wouldn't that be the

 9   proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a

10   constitutional claim?      Make your offer of proof, and

11   then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more

12   evidence or not.

13               MR. FEIGIN:       That's where I was going with

14   this, Your Honor.    In fact, the MSPB has a special

15   rule -- I believe it's 5 C.S.R. 1201.61; it's cited in

16   our brief -- where even if the MSPB decided not to

17   accept evidence for some reason, a description of the

18   evidence would go in the record and, therefore, be

19   available for the Federal Circuit.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What if -- I guess

21   that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its

22   constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it?

23               MR. FEIGIN:       Well, the Federal --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I mean, it's pretty

25   odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you

 1   couldn't pursue.

 2                MR. FEIGIN:     Well, the Federal Circuit has

 3   in analogous cases decided constitutional claims that

 4   weren't raised in front of an agency when the agency

 5   couldn't decide them.     In the Government's view, it

 6   would make sense to exhaust, for the reasons I was

 7   explaining earlier and to Justice Ginsburg, which is

 8   that it may be that the MSPB finds that the statute

 9   doesn't really cover the situation.             Now, I acknowledge

10   that's not going to happen in this case; it is clear

11   that section 3328 required these people's removals.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Wait.    You're -- you're

13   actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions

14   that the agency has no authority to decide?

15                MR. FEIGIN:     Yes, Your Honor.          I think the

16   Court has recognized --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Curiouser and curiouser.

18                (Laughter.)

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           If you don't bring before

20   the agency a question that the agency says it has no

21   authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability?

22                MR. FEIGIN:     Well, Your Honor, I don't think

23   what should happen in this -- in a case like this is

24   that the employee appeals to the MSPB and says nothing

25   at all.   The employee should appeal to the MSPB and at

                                                                     56
 1   least say what his constitutional claim is.         And the

 2   benefit of that, as the Court has recognized in, for

 3   example, Weinberger v. Salfi, is that the agency can

 4   assure itself, yes, it's a constitutional claim that is

 5   beyond my authority to resolve, and there's no other way

 6   for me to resolve it.

 7               Another benefit of presenting these claims

 8   to the agency is the MSPB hasn't been crystal clear

 9   about exactly where its authority begins and ends; and

10   neither the Federal Circuit nor this Court has addressed

11   that question at all.     And allowing the agency in the

12   first instance to determine whether it has the authority

13   to grant the plaintiff the relief he is seeking has a

14   great benefit of clarifying what the scope of the MSPB's

15   authority is.   It makes a lot more sense for the MSPB

16   and the Federal Circuit to be deciding what the scope of

17   the MSPB's authority is than it is to file a claim in

18   the District of Massachusetts and have that district

19   court and then the First Circuit debating about what the

20   proper scope of the MSPB's authority is.

21               I think the CSRA expresses a clear

22   preference that appeals of adverse actions like this go

23   through the MSPB and to the Federal Circuit, so that

24   they can decide those kinds of questions.         Again --

 1   Salfi go?   The agency couldn't decide the constitutional

 2   question.   So, what's the next stop?             Was it a court of

 3   appeals or the district court?

 4                MR. FEIGIN:       In Salfi, Your Honor?

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes.

 6                MR. FEIGIN:       That would have been in

 7   district court.   However, under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), which

 8   was at issue in Salfi and Illinois Council, the district

 9   court is performing essentially appellate-style review

10   of the agency's findings.          That is, any -- the preferred

11   course is that any additional factfindings that would be

12   necessary would be made on remand and not taken by the

13   district court.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Not on the constitutional

15   question.

16                MR. FEIGIN:       I think it would still be the

17   preferred course that the agency would do any further

18   factfinding that would be necessary in the first

19   instance.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Why?     The district court

21   is -- that's what it's equipped to do.              That's what it

22   does all the time.      And --

23                MR. FEIGIN:       Well, under 405(g), rather than

24   1331, the preferred form of factfinding is in the agency

25   and remands to the agency for further factfinding,

 1   rather than development of the facts in the district

 2   court in the first instance.

 3                 In any event, the Court has recognized that

 4   in Thunder Basin, for example, where review in the first

 5   instance was in the court of appeals, that the court of

 6   appeals had adequate authority to give meaningful

 7   judicial review to a constitutional claim that an

 8   agency, in that case the Mine Commission, by hypothesis

 9   could not decide.

10                 Thank you.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you,

12   Mr. Feigin.

13                 Mr. Schwartz, you have 2 minutes remaining.

14            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ

15                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16                 MR. SCHWARTZ:       Thank you.        We're not here

17   for an exercise in which side can best rewrite the Civil

18   Service Reform Act so that the Petitioners' claims can

19   fit in it.    What we're here for is to determine whether

20   the background rule that Federal courts have Federal

21   question jurisdiction, under the common law and under

22   section 1331, to rule on claims challenging the

23   constitutionality of an act of Congress.

24                 Now, the fall-back position is that that

25   jurisdiction remains.      What this Court is -- is tasked

                                                                            59
 1   to do is to see whether it's fairly discernible from the

 2   Civil Service Reform Act as it was written by Congress,

 3   not as it's twisted or amended or bent to fit these

 4   claims in it, but whether the Civil Service Reform Act

 5   as written by Congress revokes that background Federal

 6   court jurisdiction.

 7               And I suggest that the gyrations that have

 8   been discussed about, well, we could do this, we could

 9   go up, we could go down, we could do these odd

10   procedures, show that it is not fairly discernible that

11   Congress intended to somehow try to shoehorn these

12   claims within the CSRA framework.               And for that reason,

13   not because the Government's system is better, not

14   because the system that I'm proposing works better or is

15   faster, but because there is no fairly discernible

16   evidence from the Civil Service Reform Act, as written

17   by Congress, that Congress intended to revoke this very

18   fundamental jurisdiction of the district courts.

19               This is a Marbury case, not a Bivens case.

20   This is fundamental jurisdiction, the power of the

21   Federal court to say that Congress, not some Federal

22   agency, but that Congress acted in violation of the

23   Constitution.   And I suggest that it -- the Court should

24   act carefully before deciding that Congress took that

25   fundamental jurisdiction away from the district courts,

 1   and that is not fairly discernible that Congress did

 2   that through the wording of the Civil Service Reform

 3   Act.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, counsel.

 5                MR. SCHWARTZ:       Thank you.
