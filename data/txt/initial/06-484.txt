 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 8                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 9              MR. PHILLIPS:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11              In 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb

12   abusive private securities litigation.                    It took the

13   extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the

14   traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that

15   are filed under the securities laws.                    Instead it

16   declared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition,

17   "The complaint shall state with particularity facts

18   giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant

19   acted with the required state of mind."

20              The fundamental error in the court of

21   appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the

22   statute the strong inference language that Congress

23   clearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but

24   obviously applied rigorously.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             At some point during your


                                        3

 1   argument -- and I know you only have 20 minutes -- will

 2   you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading

 3   standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is

 4   the same as the instruction that's given to the jury?

 5   Because if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument

 6   may have some more force.

 7              MR. PHILLIPS:          I think the answer to the

 8   question is that it does not have to be the same.           I

 9   think Congress actually has greater authority in dealing

10   with pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh

11   Amendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that

12   far in this particular case because I think the

13   inferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the

14   record in this case would avoid any --

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, in writing -- I take

16   it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more

17   likely than not, preponderance of the evidence.

18              MR. PHILLIPS:          That's what the Court held --

19   held in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor.

20              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So your submission is,

21   maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of

22   the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must

23   basically apply a standard of fact -- standard of proof

24   that's higher than that what the jury would.

25              MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, it's important as a


                                       4

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   standard of allegation, because what we're talking about

 2   here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers,

 3   and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the

 4   plaintiffs.    So I do think it's removed.                 I mean, this

 5   Court has really never addressed the issue of the extent

 6   to which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings.

 7   And I don't think this is the case in which to take up

 8   that issue because I think it is quite clear that what

 9   at least we're asking for as the appropriate

10   interpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to

11   apply -- that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto,

12   and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that

13   innocent explanations can be set aside.                   And if you take

14   that particular approach, which clearly is consistent

15   with the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you --

16   the Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is

17   eliminated.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Phillips, the Seventh

19   Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the

20   plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line

21   it's has the plaintiff proved a claim.                   But you're

22   stating two different claims.              The claim that must be

23   stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be

24   proved, and I don't know of any other instance where

25   that is so.

 1                 MR. PHILLIPS:          I don't know that there are

 2   any other instances in which that's true,

 3   Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a

 4   constitutional problem.          I think at the end of the day

 5   the question is, does Congress have the power to enforce

 6   its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter

 7   of policy at the pleadings stage, and I think the answer

 8   to that question is yes.           But again, you don't have to

 9   --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I wasn't asking it as a

11   matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do

12   you construe these words, what is it, "strong

13   inference?"     And the words come out of, as I understand

14   it, a Second Circuit decision.                So I would think the

15   most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second

16   Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those

17   words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should

18   pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied.

19                 But your definition of strong inference is

20   quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.

21                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I'm not sure that's 100

22   percent true.     I think the real problem with the Second

23   Circuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule

24   that's out there.     The Second Circuit applied a number

25   of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b)


                                          6

 1   prior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference

 2   standard.   Some of them -- I think we would be very

 3   comfortable with the analysis in Shields versus

 4   Citytrust Bank, for instance.             The way Judge Jacobs

 5   analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way

 6   we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case.              So

 7   if you --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:              Mr. Phillips, can I ask

 9   this question?

10               MR. PHILLIPS:          I'm sorry.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:            One of the amicus briefs

12   talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the

13   inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent,

14   30 percent, 60 percent.        Do you think the inference has

15   to be stronger or less strong than the inference of

16   probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to

17   get access to the privacy of a home and so forth?

18               MR. PHILLIPS:          I think it would have to be

19   stronger than that, although I don't know how to

20   translate that into percentages, Justice Stevens.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            A civil case would impose

22   a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case

23   than they would for getting access to a citizen's

24   private papers and the like?

25               MR. PHILLIPS:          I think the use of the


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   language "strong inference" carries with it a very

 2   significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the

 3   buyer.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             A burden of over 50

 5   percent?

 6               MR. PHILLIPS:          Oh, to be sure.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:             In a criminal case, the

 8   person seeking that action is a government officer who

 9   presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives,

10   whereas we're talking about private suits and some

11   private litigants are selfish.

12               MR. PHILLIPS:          Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

13   And if you read the Securities Industries amicus brief,

14   it ticks off all of the instances of harm that are

15   caused by allowing -- too much of the private litigation

16   is precisely that, which Congress was responding to.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I just have to make it

18   clear.   Is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is

19   greater than more likely than not?

20               MR. PHILLIPS:          Yes.      I believe Congress

21   would have intended it to be more --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          Doesn't the -- doesn't the

23   standard at the pleading stage have to be the same as

24   the standard at the summary judgment stage?              If --

25   suppose that a certain set of facts is sufficient to


                                        8

 1   defeat summary judgment.          If the plaintiff alleges all

 2   of those facts in the complaint, are you saying that

 3   that complaint could be dismissed even though supporting

 4   those facts at the summary judgment stage would be

 5   enough to defeat a summary judgment motion?

 6                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I think at the end of the day

 7   I would make that argument.              I don't have to make that

 8   argument here because it's clear to me that the same

 9   standards of Matushita and Monsanto that say you have to

10   exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary

11   judgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading

12   stage, so there is no disconnect.

13                 But if I were actually forced into that

14   position, I think I would take that view, although I

15   probably would argue first that the standard of

16   Huddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than

17   rejecting clearly what Congress had in mind in 1995 when

18   it acted to curb the abuses of private securities

19   litigation.

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But isn't the difference

21   between Matsushita and this particular case at least as

22   you are presenting this case, the -- the -- focused on

23   the strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct?

24                 As, as I recall Matsushita, there -- there

25   had to be at that stage, there had to be evidence from


                                         9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   which one could infer that the -- that the conduct was

 2   not innocent; but you're arguing for something stronger

 3   than that.   You're arguing for, in effect, an -- an

 4   ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct.              And

 5   aren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did

 6   at -- at that later stage?

 7                MR. PHILLIPS:          I think there may be a slight

 8   semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of

 9   the day all we're asking for the Court to do is to

10   evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the

11   negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities,

12   interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you

13   traditionally do, take into account whether there is an

14   allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day

15   whether or not that reaches a -- rises to the level of a

16   strong inference.

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But -- but Matsushita as I

18   recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a

19   plausible inference.       And I think you're arguing for

20   something stronger than that.              And I think the language

21   of Congress forces you to do it but I -- I'm just

22   finding it difficult to conclude -- to equate the

23   plausibility standard in, in Matsushita with the strong

24   inference standard here.          If you --

25                MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, if I'm going to err on


                                        10

 1   either side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries

 2   out Congress's intent.        We thing you needn't go any

 3   further than Matsushita did in order to reverse the

 4   court of appeals in this particular case.

 5                 Obviously there is probably some potential

 6   distance between the two, where you could certainly

 7   interpret the strong inference standard more in the line

 8   the way the United States interprets it, as creating a

 9   high likelihood of scienter.             And we don't -- we're

10   certainly not objecting to that.                We're just saying to

11   the Court that you needn't go that far in order to

12   decide this case, although obviously we would welcome a

13   ruling along those lines if the Court's inclined to go

14   that far.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is it fair to say at the

16   pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and

17   convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it

18   would only be more probable than not?

19                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, again, I think it -- I

20   think it puts an issue -- and we raised this in our

21   reply brief, whether or not Huddleston should be

22   reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in

23   the way Congress is approaching private securities

24   litigation.    But, so my --

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So you do --

 1                 MR. PHILLIPS:          There are a number of ways to

 2   go at it.     But if it turned out to be a disconnect, that

 3   would not offend at least my sense of what Congress was

 4   trying to achieve here.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah.       Well, I don't think

 6   Congress was trying to achieve an alteration in the

 7   ultimate standard, either, in the jury standard.                   What

 8   it was concerned with is the enormous expense of -- of

 9   discovery.     And, and tried to set a high wall to get to

10   the discovery stage.        I don't know why that should have

11   to affect or should logically affect the standard that

12   the jury is told to use.

13                 MR. PHILLIPS:          All I'm suggesting is that if

14   the Court were concerned that somehow there is a

15   disconnect between the pleading standard and the

16   ultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that

17   incongruity -- if it is one -- would to be reconsider

18   the ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the

19   clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that

20   bath water.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you tell me a little

22   bit of how -- how this should work in your view?                  Assume

23   the CEO makes misstatements as to the earnings report

24   and the acceptance of one of its new products.                  Just

25   assume that.

 1                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can we make a strong

 3   inference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports

 4   are?

 5                 MR. PHILLIPS:          You mean with a specific

 6   earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales

 7   projections and demand?

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can we make a strong

 9   inference that a CEO knows the status of current

10   earnings --

11                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, my guess is they --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- when he makes, when he

13   makes a statement.

14                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I think they would have

15   to make an allegation that the -- that the CEO routinely

16   is provided with that information rather than simply

17   assume it.    I think it's the same problem you have with

18   their -- with their allegation that it's common sense

19   that CEOs will act to protect their own personal self

20   interest and the overall welfare of the company by

21   misrepresenting the status of events.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How about just saying that

23   he knew it?

24                 MR. PHILLIPS:          I'm not --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just saying that he knew

 1   it.   Without saying why they knew that he knew it?

 2   You're saying they have to give a reason why they knew

 3   that he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports?

 4   Suppose they didn't say that.               They just said knowing

 5   that the -- that the figures were otherwise, he -- he

 6   set them forth.

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:            I don't think that's

 8   sufficient, because it requires for the facts that

 9   particularly show --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              But suppose it says, which

11   I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed

12   on top of the company's financial health by having

13   weekly conversations with other executives.                   He had his

14   hands on the pulse of the company.                   He saw weekly sales

15   reports and product -- projection -- production

16   projections.     Now it seems like an allegation that's

17   very specific.

18               MR. PHILLIPS:            But the -- but the problem

19   with that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500,

20   the Titan 6500 product specifically, in that context,

21   the report is, there's nothing in there that says what

22   those reports say about the 6500.                  And remember, this is

23   a case where the plaintiffs have 27 whistleblowers

24   inside the company who could provide you with all of the

25   detail in the world; and yet when it comes time to tell

 1   you what was in the 6500 report that would -- that would

 2   suggest that it's not available, there's not word one in

 3   the allegation.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I thought they

 5   alleged at least that for about a year previously in

 6   respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout

 7   the company that the 6500 had been delayed.             Don't they

 8   make an allegation like that?

 9               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right but that's -- that

10   being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim.

11   The question was is the, is the 6500 being sold; and

12   that was the allegation.         And the answer to that is he

13   -- I -- he had every reason to believe that, based on

14   what they've claimed because they've not produced a

15   report or said that there's anything inside the report

16   that says to the contrary about that.

17               Again, it seems to me --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            The 6500 has long been

19   delayed.   Everyone knows that in the company.           So he

20   knows it's long been delayed.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:          I think --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Then what he says is it is

23   being shipped and delivered.            Something like that.

24               MR. PHILLIPS:          But Justice Breyer, that --

25   that long been delayed period runs all the way back to


                                       15
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   1998.   And we're talking about events in 2000 and 2001.

 2   So the notion that it's been long delayed says nothing

 3   about what Mr. Notebaert was -- was revealing in March

 4   and April and June of 2001.

 5               It, it could potentially, but it equally, it

 6   couldn't.   It's the same problem you get with the 5500,

 7   where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite

 8   plausible that Mr. Notebaert never saw those reports.

 9               Now how you can make that concession and

10   nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he

11   acted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            April '01, he says

13   everything we can build we are building, and shipping.

14   The demand is very strong.          And then what they say is of

15   course nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and

16   they've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on

17   the pulse of the company.

18               MR. PHILLIPS:          But you -- you --

19   Justice Breyer, you make a leap there.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh.     Yeah.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:          Is that they all knew that.

22   The point is they knew that it was delayed back in 1999.

23   What they don't do is tie that in to what he knew in

24   2001; and that, to me, that's the central point in this

25   case, is do you require that kind of specificity?           And

 1   it seems to me there's no other way to read what

 2   Congress says in this statute than to that.                     I'd like to

 3   reserve the balance of my time.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAN,

 8        ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 9                     SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

10                MR. SHANMUGAM:          Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,

11   and may it please the Court:

12                While meritorious private actions are an

13   essential supplement to Government enforcement of the

14   securities laws, abusive action impose substantial costs

15   on companies and their shareholders.                     As a cornerstone

16   of its effort in the Reform Act to address the problem

17   of abusive actions, Congress adopted uniform and more

18   stringent pleading requirements including the strong

19   inference requirement at issue in this case.

20                The court of appeals erred by holding that a

21   plaintiff can satisfy that requirement simply by

22   alleging facts which an inference of state of mind could

23   be drawn.    The court of appeals thereby misinterpreted

24   the Reform Act.    And --

 1   position on Justice Alito's earlier question about

 2   whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is

 3   the same as the standard at the pleading stage?

 4              MR. SHANMUGAM:           First of all to be clear,

 5   Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that the Court needs

 6   to address that question in this case, because we don't

 7   believe that that sort of disparity would present any

 8   Seventh Amendment concerns.            However, if the Court does

 9   believe that any disparity in the degree of probability

10   required does present Seventh Amendment concerns, we

11   believe that it is more consistent with Congress's

12   intent to apply the strong inference requirement at the

13   proof stage as well as the pleading stage rather than to

14   water down the strong inference requirement that

15   Congress adopted at the pleading stage.

16              And we believe that that requirement does

17   impose a very high burden.          In our view, it requires a

18   plaintiff to allege facts that give rise to a high

19   likelihood that the conclusion that the defendant acted

20   with the necessary date of mind follows from those

21   allegations.

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And by the proof stage you

23   mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?

24              MR. SHANMUGAM:           I think that that is right,

25   Justice Kennedy.   I suppose that if the perceived


                                       18
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   constitutional concern is solely regarding the degree of

 2   likelihood that is required, it could be applied simply

 3   at the summary judgment stage; but to the extent that

 4   the Court believes that it is a matter for the jury to

 5   determine whether a given set of facts gives rise to an

 6   inference of the requisite strength then yes, the jury

 7   would need to be instructed in a manner consistent with

 8   the strong --

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What would you think about

10   the following --

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I just -- may I just,

12   very briefly. .    Putting aside the constitutional

13   problem, do you think the standards are the same or

14   different between the pleading stage and the

15   constitutional stage -- and the summary judgment stage?

16               MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well, again, we don't

17   believe that the Court needs to address that question.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:             I understand that.   That's

19   not my question.

20               MR. SHANMUGAN:           And the statute by its terms

21   only --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:             It is either a yes or no

23   question.

24               MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well, I think that the

25   answer is yes if the Court feels it needs to address

 1   that question.    And to be sure, the strong inference

 2   standard that Congress adopted was framed only in terms

 3   of the pleading stage.        And our view --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- there was a pleading

 5   stage, I would like your clear view on how much that

 6   changes.    It has been the understanding that when there

 7   is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the

 8   complaint and you construe the allegations in that

 9   complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.

10                Is that rule not applied under the

11   interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?

12                MR. SHANMUGAM:          I think that it is,

13   Justice Ginsburg, to this limited extent.                In an

14   ordinary civil case, the case is governed of course by

15   Rule 8.    And in some sense the rule that the allegations

16   in the complaint must be construed in the light most

17   favorable to the plaintiff is really derived from Rule 8

18   and its requirement that a plaintiff need only provide a

19   shortened claim statement of the relevant underlying

20   facts in order to survive a motion to dismiss.

21                What Congress did in the Reform Act was to

22   require first of all some degree of particularity in

23   allegation; but Congress went further than that; and to

24   the extent that Congress spoke in terms of the

25   inferences that can be drawn from those allegations, we


                                        20
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   do believe that Congress abrogated the background rule

 2   that the allegations must be read in the light most

 3   favorable to the plaintiff, or as some courts have put

 4   it, that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn

 5   from the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiff's

 6   favor.

 7                 That clearly is a change on the preexisting

 8   law; and it is a change with regard to the law that

 9   circuits were applying before the enactment of the

10   Reform Act.

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why don't we simply assume

12   that the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is

13   still in place, but that reading it most favorably to

14   the plaintiff, it must rise to the level of supporting

15   the strong inference?

16                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         I guess, Justice Souter,

17   that I would wonder what it would mean to say that you

18   read the allegations in the light most favorable to the

19   plaintiff.    If what it means is that a plaintiff can

20   simply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in

21   order to create the strong inference of state of mind

22   that is ultimately required, then I think I would

23   disagree that that rule remains in effect.               Precisely

24   because our view is that in applying the strong

25   inference standard, a court should consider other


                                        21

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   possible explanations for the defendant's conduct that

 2   are not foreclosed by the allegations --

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, but I was using the

 4   word inference to -- to refer to some reasoning process

 5   based upon what is stated.            Not on assumptions favorable

 6   to the plaintiff.

 7               And if inference is to tie -- is, is a term

 8   that is tied to what is alleged, then I don't see any --

 9   any contradiction between reading those allegations most

10   favorably, but saying the statute in each statute

11   requires that the -- that the total force of the

12   inference rise to the level of strength that you speak

13   of.

14               MR. SHANMUGAM:            I think our only concern,

15   Justice Souter, would be that where a plaintiff includes

16   ambiguous allegations in the complaint, a court should

17   consider the possibility that those ambiguities work to

18   the defendant's favor as well as working to the

19   plaintiff's favor.      And one concrete example of that in

20   this case are the allegations that concern the Titan

21   5500.   There are allegations in this case that there was

22   a study and there were various internal reports that

23   indicated that demand for that product was declining.

24               But the complaint does not specifically

25   allege that that study and those internal reports were

 1   even available at the time the CEO made the alleged --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. Shanmugam, could --

 3   could I get you back to -- to your, your assertion of we

 4   don't have to reach in this case the question of whether

 5   the same standard applies at trial as, as at the

 6   pleading stage?

 7              It seems to me a Seventh Amendment claim has

 8   been raised.   It's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary

 9   constitutional adjudication.              If indeed the two

10   standards are the same, there's certainly no Seventh

11   Amendment problem.      So why don't we have to first of all

12   decide, in resolving the Seventh Amendment claim,

13   whether the two standards are the same?

14              MR. SHANMUGAM:             Well, that is certainly

15   correct, Justice Scalia, but in our view, there is no

16   constitutional problem here.              And the reason that there

17   is no constitutional problem here is in making the

18   probabilistic determination that is required by the

19   Reform Act, a court is taking the allegations in the

20   complaint as true.      It is not engaging in any weighing

21   of the evidence.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:               But you're getting to the

23   merits of the constitutional problem.                     And we usually

24   run away from constitutional problems.                     We don't even

25   want to consider the merits of it.                   And we don't have

 1   to, if indeed the two standards are the same.

 2               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, to the extent that the

 3   Court views the constitutional issue in this case as

 4   sufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of

 5   constitutional avoidance, then we do believe that the

 6   better view, the view that is more consistent with

 7   Congress's intent, is that if the Court is choosing

 8   between raising the standard at the pre stage and

 9   watering down the standard at the pleadings stage, we

10   believe that the former is more consistent with

11   Congress's --

12               JUSTICE ALITO:          Even if there is no Seventh

13   Amendment problem, what sense would it make to have a

14   regime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the

15   plaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at

16   trial.

17               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, Congress was

18   concerned, Justice Alito, with the problem of abusive

19   pleading.   That much is crystal clear.                 And as part of

20   that concern, Congress was concerned that plaintiffs

21   could readily allege fraud by hindsight, and Congress

22   may have been concerned that the plaintiff could do so

23   not only by making a conclusory allegation of state of

24   mind, but also making a slightly less conclusory

25   allegation of state of mind by alleging facts that


                                       24
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   merely give rise to a reasonable inference of state of

 2   mind.

 3                If Congress hadn't had that concern, it

 4   obviously could have codified the reasonable inference

 5   standard that was then in use by a number of other

 6   courts.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            What do you think in

 8   writing this opinion?       There are a couple of ways.                 One,

 9   you can find strong inference in terms of some other

10   words.    Two, you could look to history.                  Or three, you

11   could just try an example.           Say strong inference means

12   strong inference.    Here's an example.                  This is a

13   complaint.    It meets it, or it doesn't meet it.                    Which

14   way, in your opinion, will work best in this case?

15                MR. SHANMUGAM:          Justice Breyer, our primary

16   concern in this case is with the way that the Court of

17   Appeals articulated the applicable standard, which we

18   believe may have pernicious effects in future cases.

19   And so we certainly believe that it would be appropriate

20   for the Court to vacate and remand for the Court of

21   Appeals to apply the correct standard.                    But just to be

22   clear --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You said the Court of

24   Appeals to apply it.       Could the Court of Appeals

25   applying the standard that you say is correct come to


                                        25

 1   the same decision that it came to using a different

 2   verbal formula.

 3                MR. SHANMUGAM:          In our view,

 4   Justice Ginsburg, applying the correct standard, the

 5   decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be

 6   reversed.    And if the case were remanded to the Court of

 7   Appeals for application of the standard, we certainly

 8   think that the Court of Appeals should come out the

 9   other way.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            You had something else to

11   say in answer to my question, which I would like to

12   hear.

13                MR. SHANMUGAM:          I think it was just that

14   point, Justice Breyer, namely, that if the Court

15   believes that it would be useful to provide guidance to

16   the lower courts by applying the standard itself in this

17   case, we do believe that the decision of the Court of

18   Appeals should be reversed rather than vacated.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is the requisite standard,

20   knowledge of falsity.

21                MR. SHANMUGAM:          The requisite scienter is

22   either intent or recklessness, with regard to the

23   underlying conduct at issue, in effect --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Intent to make a false

25   statement?

 1              MR. SHANMUGAM:            Yes, that's right.           And in

 2   fact, in misstatement cases, that is knowledge of

 3   falsity.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR R.                    MILLER

 8                    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 9              MR. MILLER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court?

11              We believe the Seventh Circuit had it right.

12   We believe that what the Seventh Circuit, and this is in

13   partial response to you, Justice Breyer, is take more or

14   less a holistic view of the entirety of the complaint.

15   The business about the 5500, the business about the 6500

16   not being available when on December 11, 2000, Notebaert

17   says it's available, the fact that they weren't shipping

18   it, they weren't selling it, it didn't work, and the

19   extensive information from confidential sources that

20   there were, as one judge once referred to it, accounting

21   shenanigans going on, designed to shift income into the

22   fourth quarter of 2000.

23              We think that when the court looked at that,

24   it said, looks to us as if there's --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Do we take judicial notice

 1   that a CEO knows these things and that's the strong

 2   inference.

 3                MR. MILLER:        Again, you have confidential

 4   sources in this case, and in the case, Notebaert is

 5   hands on, he's talking to people, he's on the phone all

 6   the time.    We're talking about the 5500 --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you agree you have to

 8   have that?    You have to have some specific allegation to

 9   show of his knowledge?        We can't just infer that?

10                MR. MILLER:        I would think you should be

11   able to infer it with the CEO.               I think the confidential

12   sources demonstrate in this case, he must have had it,

13   given his nature, the status of these products, his

14   day-to-day --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            The most suspicious thing

16   in the complaint that I could find was where you say

17   there's an internal market report, and it revealed

18   demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would

19   decline by 400,000,000.         Then you date that with in or

20   about early '01.   Now, I think if you knew or had reason

21   to believe that it was prior to March or April of '01,

22   you would have said so.

23                MR. MILLER:        If we knew.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yeah, and therefore,

25   there's quite a good chance here that this report was

 1   written after he made the statements.

 2                 What am I supposed to do with that?                  I mean,

 3   I know what you said.        And you said your best.              And

 4   that's your best.

 5                 MR. MILLER:        Yes.       This notion of strategic

 6   ambiguity is in a sense humorous, given the obstacles

 7   that a plaintiff has to get the goods, so to speak.

 8   Just think about the investigation efforts that went

 9   into this case.     What you do, Justice Breyer, is -- and

10   I think this is what the Seventh Circuit did -- look at

11   everything, look at the fact that you have got

12   confidential sources saying 5500 demand is drying up,

13   perhaps as early as middle 2000.                 Parts are not being

14   ordered.   People are going home early.                   Verizon dropped

15   25 percent, fourth quarter.              Verizon dropped 50 percent

16   in January.

17                 You're the CEO.            You don't know that your

18   flagship product is drying up?                That there's inventory,

19   that people are going home?              That your best customer

20   doesn't know you anymore?

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You're arguing the

22   facts and the inferences.            You said the Seventh Circuit

23   got it right.    As I read their articulation of the

24   standard on page 20A of the petition appendix, it's the

25   normal standard that would have been applied prior to

 1   the passage of the PSLRA.         Could a reasonable person

 2   infer -- Congress passes a law saying they've got to

 3   give rise to a strong inference.              Shouldn't that have

 4   changed the standard?

 5              MR. MILLER:        We believe two propositions.

 6   Number one, you can't exceed the Seventh Amendment, and

 7   the Seventh Circuit --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't understand

 9   the Seventh Amendment argument here.                   Congress can

10   surely articulate the standard that's going to be

11   applied as a matter of substantive law.                  If Congress

12   says, you have to prove by clear and convincing

13   evidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh

14   Amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to

15   that standard.

16              MR. MILLER:        That is correct, Chief Justice.

17   But that is not what Congress did.                Congress did not

18   elevate the burden of proof.           That is why Mr. Phillips

19   has asked you to, in effect, to overrule Huddleston.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, but Congress just

21   established an entry qualification for getting into

22   court.

23              And there are a lot of entry qualifications.

24   In diversity cases, you -- if you allege diversity, and

25   it existed at the outset, that's fine.                  That doesn't


                                      30

 1   have to be proved at the end of the case.                Indeed even

 2   if you prove the contrary, the case is still validly

 3   there.   Congress can establish entry requirements even

 4   when they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with

 5   the merits that the jury is supposed to decide.

 6               MR. MILLER:         I think that is absolutely

 7   correct, and indeed rule 9(b) has been an entry

 8   qualification since 1938.           But there are entry

 9   qualifications, and there are entry qualifications.

10               In this case, in effect, the motion to

11   dismiss operates as a dispositive motion.                It cuts off

12   the ability to proceed at all, and it does it, if you

13   listen to the standards being proposed by Petitioner,

14   and by the United States --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             What's the difference

16   between what Justice Scalia was just saying?                You can't

17   come into Federal court unless you have at least

18   $200,000 damages.    Now, you might have been just as much

19   hurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional.

20   So here you can't get into Federal court unless you have

21   a really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you

22   have to demonstrate at the beginning.

23               Now, you might have a good claim, but we're

24   not going to let you come into Federal court.                We only

25   want those people who are really strong, just as we only

 1   want those people who are really suffering.

 2               MR. MILLER:          And did Congress raise the

 3   burden --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:              No.     No, not the burden

 5   of -- it's the entry.

 6               MR. MILLER:          The entry points you referred

 7   to, the so-called pleas in abatement, to put on my

 8   common law hat, a jurisdiction venue, et cetera, they

 9   may raise issues of fact and Congress, in control of the

10   Federal courts, can calibrate it any way they want.

11               But when you are dealing with the core

12   function of the jury -- and matters of abatement were

13   never considered to be core functions of the jury -- I

14   think a whole range of cases starting with Slocum versus

15   New York Life --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I thought you told

17   me that Congress could set a high level of burden on

18   factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the

19   Seventh Amendment.

20               MR. MILLER:          I'm distinguishing, Mr. Chief

21   Justice, between the merits and the entry point.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Are you saying that

23   Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is

24   different than preponderance of the evidence.

25               MR. MILLER:          No.      No.      No.    No.   If Congress

 1   wants to change preponderance to clear and convincing,

 2   it can.

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               So you would say that you

 4   could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must

 5   be met at the pleading level, but more likely than not

 6   at the jury level?

 7              MR. MILLER:           No.      That is something I

 8   disagree with.   If the substance of the law --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               We want to know what the

10   rule is.

11              MR. MILLER:           I'm not sure it's the rule.

12   It's what I would advocate.              If the substance says

13   predominance, then to raise the pleading bar on what in

14   effect is a dispositive motion -- and I don't think it

15   makes any difference whether it's a JNOV, a directed

16   verdict, a summary judgment, motion for judgment on the

17   opening statement -- and you decided all of those cases.

18   And you protected what Justice Souter referred to in

19   Markman as the core function of the jury.                 You have

20   always said these procedures are okay, as long as it

21   does not call for the resolution of fact issues, because

22   that's the core function of the jury.

23              Now this Court is faced with, in effect,

24   coming back down that time line to the motion to

25   dismiss.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  If I'm with you so

 2   far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a

 3   different standard on the motion to dismiss than they

 4   meant to apply at the merits standard?

 5               MR. MILLER:         I don't think Congress would.

 6   I do not believe Congress ever intended -- it's not in

 7   the statute, it is not in the legislative history, it is

 8   not in any case, Matsushita, Monsanto are unique

 9   antitrust cases, and in both cases, the Court, if you

10   read the opinions fully, protected the jury function.

11   They said there was simply nothing beyond the assertions

12   standing alone when you have competitive and

13   anticompetitive conduct to protect substantive antitrust

14   law.   That doesn't do it.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, then what was

16   Congress trying to do when they said strong inference?

17   It seems to me that if you think the standards have to

18   be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says

19   strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show

20   a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no

21   Seventh Amendment problem.

22               MR. MILLER:         What you have to show at proof

23   is preponderance.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Then it seems to me that

25   you have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable

 1   inference.

 2                 MR. MILLER:       Our standard, as proposed, and

 3   we think --

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You don't want to answer

 5   yes or no there?

 6                 MR. MILLER:       -- is reasonable jurors, who

 7   are finders of fact, could find by a preponderance of

 8   the evidence that the defendants acted with scienter.

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So you're saying those

10   words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing

11   as reasonable inference.

12                 MR. MILLER:       No.      You can have lots of

13   reasonable inferences that don't meet a preponderance

14   notion.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's true, but imagine a

16   case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets

17   forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on

18   both sides.

19                 And then you read that document and you

20   conclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I

21   do think a reasonable juror could find for the

22   plaintiff.

23                 And that would be the weak evidence

24   standard.

25                 And lo and behold, that could be -- you

 1   know, what do we do about that?                Because using your do

 2   you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine

 3   cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the

 4   weak inference and not the strong inference.                   And what

 5   I'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this

 6   Seventh Amendment problem.

 7                 MR. MILLER:        If --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Because they certainly

 9   didn't intend the weak inference standard.

10                 MR. MILLER:        If you follow petitioners in

11   their attempt to deconstruct not simply Rule 8's

12   construction, but hundreds of years of what this Court

13   in Jones versus Bock referred to as usual procedural

14   practices which are not to be lightly departed from, the

15   historic notion is you look at the complaint and in a

16   curious way, you have blinders on.                   You look at the

17   complaint.     You read it in the light favorable to the

18   pleader.     You do not weigh.           That is a jury function.

19   You do not look for exculpatory explanations.

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:          How can you assess the

21   strength of the inference that can be drawn from the

22   facts alleged in the complaint without considering all

23   the inferences that could be drawn from those facts?                   I

24   just don't understand that argument.

 2   the direction of Capitol Hill.                Now you -- there's --

 3   you could draw an inference that the person is coming to

 4   the Supreme Court.      And if there were no other building

 5   in Washington, that would be a very strong inference.

 6   But don't you also have to consider the inference that

 7   the person is going to the Capitol, the person is going

 8   to the Library of Congress, the person is going to some

 9   other location up here?          You have to consider all the

10   inferences that you can draw from the facts.

11                MR. MILLER:         As the Seventh Circuit did, we

12   agree, you look at the totality of the complaint.

13   That's a given.

14                But there are contrary inferences that

15   undermine the strength of the plaintiff's inferences.

16   They weaken it.   And they're -- they emanate from the

17   complaint.

18                There are other kinds of inferences, let's

19   call it nonculpability, that don't denigrate the strong

20   inference which let's assume hypothetically has been

21   established.   They're just side-bar possibilities.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, let's take one

23   specific example that the petitioners did, and that is

24   this matter of the channel stuffing.                      They say here's a

25   notion, channel stuffing.            It could mean goods were

 1   shipped that nobody ever ordered, or it could mean

 2   something different.      It could mean discounting and

 3   other incentives to get people to buy.                  So there's good

 4   channel stuffing and bad channel stuffing, and it sounds

 5   like good cholesterol, bad cholesterol; you can't tell

 6   from the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's

 7   at issue.

 8               MR. MILLER:        The Seventh Circuit reached

 9   that conclusion, I think, by looking at some of the

10   confidential sources which sort of indicated that there

11   was channel stuffing in the sense of pushing product out

12   which was coming back.       The head of Verizon complained

13   about the channel stuffing, so there's reason to believe

14   that at least some of it is bad.               Just enough.

15               Now, is that in and of itself determinative?

16   No.   Again, I come back to the notion that what the

17   Seventh Circuit did is look at the 5500, look at the

18   6500, look at the earnings projections which proved

19   false, looked at back-dating, channel stuffing.                  Looked

20   at all of that and said okay, even if I treat channel

21   stuffing as weak, I have these other things.                  And as

22   Judge Lynch of the First Circuit said, each fact of

23   scienter is like a brush stroke.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Are you entitled to

25   consider the brush strokes that are not there as well as


                                       38

 1   the subsidiary brush strokes that are?                      In

 2   Justice Alito's example, if the pleadings don't point

 3   out that the Library of Congress and the Capitol are

 4   also up on this hill, is the judge at the motions stage

 5   entitled to consider that?

 6                 MR. MILLER:        Obviously, if it's something

 7   you can take judicial notice of, then yes.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       Then that is

 9   engaging in something more than construing the pleadings

10   most favorably to the plaintiff.

11                 MR. MILLER:        But it's within the realm of

12   what courts have done for the longest of the time.                   They

13   look at documents attached.              They look at judicial

14   notice.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What do you think about

16   that?     There are at least some circumstances, then, in

17   which there this is kind of critical assessment function

18   that you concede must go on, rather than simply a piling

19   favorable inference onto favorable inference to see if

20   it gets to the strong points.

21                 MR. MILLER:        I repeat what I said a couple

22   of minutes ago, Justice Souter.                If the negative

23   depletes the affirmative, if there's a correlation

24   between them, I can understand that.                      Maybe it

25   eliminates that fact.        Maybe it reduces that fact.

 1               But when we hear about motive, what does

 2   motive and guidance reduction months after the false

 3   statements have to do with whether the statements were

 4   false, whether the 5500 was --

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That is -- that is an

 6   argument for the weight of considering motive rather

 7   than the relevance of the motive consideration per se.

 8               MR. MILLER:        I think it is a tough line.             I

 9   think this is the kind of line district judges have to

10   draw.   I think if you look at your own precedents like

11   Anderson versus Liberty Lobby and all of those jury

12   trial cases, you see the repetition of the notion that

13   judges do not balance inference chains on a matter going

14   to the core function of a jury.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But all of those

16   cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to

17   me, established a very different standard.                 They said

18   they have to support a strong inference.

19               MR. MILLER:        A strong inference.           Not a

20   conclusive inference.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Strong inference was

22   not the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty

23   Lobby, in any of those cases.

24               MR. MILLER:        But can't -- but strong

25   inference, as Justice Ginsburg said much earlier, was


                                       40
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the standard not only in the Second Circuit but in the

 2   First Circuit and in the Third Circuit.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            What do you think about the

 4   approach -- because I have had some of these cases.                      And

 5   I see -- I think words, words, words.

 6                And what Congress said was strong inference,

 7   and we're not going to get any further by looking for

 8   some other words.    So therefore, take strong inference.

 9   The most helpful thing is take it, look at the

10   complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong

11   inference.   Or maybe we'd say it isn't.                     We read it, and

12   avoid all the other issues.             What do you think about

13   that?

14                MR. MILLER:        Live to fight another day?

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.           And then on appeal,

16   we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes,

17   it is a strong inference.

18                I mean, I hope we're going to establish some

19   standards for how you go about determining whether

20   there's a strong inference or not.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And I hope we're going to

22   recognize that Congress thought it was doing something.

23   Your argument so far, Professor, doesn't indicate

24   that Congress --

25                MR. MILLER:        Excuse me.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              You indicated that the --

 2   you know, the plaintiff had to do all this

 3   investigation.   The whole point of this was that the

 4   defendants were being disadvantaged.

 5               MR. MILLER:          Look at the statute in its

 6   entirety.   This isn't a statute that just deals with

 7   pleading scienter.      Look at the provisions dealing with

 8   the selection of lead representative, which has produced

 9   this incredible shift from '95 to public institutions,

10   pensions and labor unions.            They don't bring frivolous

11   cases.   Look at the control that statute gives over

12   selection of them with notice provisions to make sure

13   you've got the --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   How does that change

15   how we should read strong inference in the statute?                    Are

16   you saying don't worry whether it's a strong inference

17   or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and

18   they're not going to bring a frivolous case?                   No.

19   Congress said there has to be a strong inference.                    And

20   what concerns me is that the very standard that the

21   Seventh Circuit articulated said simply could a

22   reasonable person infer.           The notion of strong inference

23   isn't in that standard at all.

24               MR. MILLER:          The notion of strong inference

25   starting with the Second Circuit doctrine, as used in


                                         42

 1   many other circuits, was actually a much lower standard

 2   than what we are recommending.

 3                 If I believe -- if I think back at

 4   Greenstone, it was reason to believe, or tends to

 5   believe, or circumstantial evidence in Greenstone and in

 6   Burlington Coat.

 7                 Under our standard of preponderance, the

 8   ability to find preponderance, you are elevated.                  You

 9   are also elevated by the preceding subdivision which

10   requires a level of particularization, never known in

11   Federal Rule --

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Miller, going back

13   just to the word strong, forgetting the

14   particularization from it, do you think you can

15   categorize the strength in percentage terms?             They have

16   to be more than 50 percent?             More than probable cause?

17                 We're talking all abstractly here and I find

18   it easier to think when I think about numbers.

19                 MR. MILLER:       I have -- forgive me.         I

20   haven't seen a judicial opinion that says at the 33 and

21   one-third percentage of probability, I've got to give it

22   to the jury, because that jury might file for my --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think it's 66 and

24   two-thirds.    I think that is --

25                 (Laughter.)

 1                 MR. MILLER:        Is that because you never met a

 2   plaintiff you really liked?

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            At least we know that in

 5   the probable world --

 6                 MR. MILLER:        I took a liberty there with the

 7   Justice.    I don't think you can ascribe a percentage to

 8   it.   I think --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I think more likely

10   than not, most people think of 49, 50 percent.              Can you

11   tell us whether strong inference is stronger than more

12   likely than not?

13                 MR. MILLER:        I do not believe it is.         I

14   think --

15                 I think strong inference -- if we're doing

16   the numbers game -- may actually be 40 percent.                 If a

17   district judge is looking, again, I say at the entirety

18   of discounts --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me just reclaim the

20   question.     Is it stronger or weaker than probable cause

21   in a criminal context?

22                 MR. MILLER:        Oh, I would hope it's stronger.

23   I would hope it's higher than probable cause.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about clear and

25   convincing?     Is it below clear -- I mean, they are the

 1   only two standards I actually understand.                 Without

 2   picking a number out of air, is preponderance, I think I

 3   can figure that out.      And I guess I can figure out

 4   beyond a reasonable doubt.          But other than those, when

 5   you talking about strong, when you talk about clear and

 6   convincing, I have no idea what those things mean.

 7               Do you?

 8               MR. MILLER:        And --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't think they mean

10   anything?

11               MR. MILLER:        No, I think they mean what a

12   district judge honoring his Article III commission

13   concludes after an intensive evaluation of the entirety

14   of the complaint, looking for that strong inference,

15   putting on his sort of motion to dismiss 12(b)(6) hat,

16   says okay --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Just okay?

18               MR. MILLER:        No, I did not mean that.             Don't

19   take me literally on that.          For heavens sakes, I'm from

20   Brooklyn.   I'm very colloquial.             I'm very sorry about

21   that.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Let me write that down.         We

23   should not take you literally.              All right.

24               (Laughter.)

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay, you two are

 1   even now.

 2               (Laughter.)

 3               MR. MILLER:        Understand, you keep asking,

 4   quite properly obviously, how does strong inference

 5   change anything?

 6               The test we have proposed and the test I

 7   believe the Seventh Circuit applied is not the classic

 8   12(b)(6) have you stated a claim, because we all know at

 9   least traditionally, under notice pleading, you can

10   march through that.

11               This test, if you follow that time line

12   backward, is in effect asking that district judge to

13   make a decision on looking at the totality of this

14   complaint, is this case trial worthy?                   It's a curious

15   thing.   I don't envy district judges who have to do

16   this.

17               Is it trial worthy?              Why would Congress say,

18   if a district judge is willing to say under the classic

19   test, I think it's trial worthy, there's no reason to

20   believe that Congress wanted to cut that case off.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Trial worthy under

22   preponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong

23   inference standard?

24               MR. MILLER:        Oh, I think he is becoming

25   slightly schizoid, he is saying, I'm looking at strong

 1   inference.   I'm looking at the motion to dismiss

 2   structure as it's been, the usual procedure, 200 years,

 3   and I have to make a judgment because Congress was

 4   pushing here.    There's no doubt about it.

 5                I have to make a decision on the basis of

 6   what I've got, which is virtually nothing -- let's face

 7   that -- I think -- I think if these allegations are

 8   proven, it is certainly trial worthy.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It sounds to me like --

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's not trial worthy, but

11   rather discovery worthy.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry.

13   Justice Stevens, say it again.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I think the question is

15   not whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy

16   for discovery.   That's really what's at issue in this.

17                MR. MILLER:        Well, the realities out there

18   are they built a wall.        They put in all of these

19   procedural protections and they said no discovery until

20   you climb the wall.      Now what kind of a wall was it?

21   Was it a Dutch dike or the Berlin Wall?                  If you look at

22   that statute, contrary to what Mr. Phillips urges, there

23   are multiple policies expressed in that statute, one of

24   which is, private cases are good.                 Let's just get the

25   right people to run those private cases.                  Let's control

 1   them.   Let's, let's have a greater threshold, but let's

 2   not throw the baby out with the bath water.              Because

 3   everybody seems to agree private cases help.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I want, I want to be fair.

 5   I interpreted your argument -- and please tell me if

 6   this is incorrect -- as indicating that if I think

 7   strong inference is greater, more onerous than more

 8   likely than not, at the pleading stage, I then also have

 9   to say this is the instruction that must be given to the

10   jury?   In order to avoid the, the discontinuity between

11   the pleading stage and what --

12                MR. MILLER:        The way you state it, Justice,

13   is something very hard for me to respond to.             Congress

14   did not change the persuasiveness, the proof burden.               If

15   you go through the statute, you will see spots where

16   they did.   Congress knew how to change proof standards.

17   Congress knew how to change Federal rules.

18                Congress did not change the proof in private

19   actions.    Congress did not change all of the background

20   procedure like the background procedure in Jones and --

21   it is just not there yet.           Congress did change a couple

22   of Federal rules explicitly.

23                So I, I cannot comprehend how, if the case

24   reached the jury, you would have to charge above

25   predominance.    And I, I think we've got a stone rolling

 1   downhill to the dismissal point, which is why we have

 2   urged in the brief and why the Seventh Circuit was

 3   concerned as was the Sixth about this jury trial

 4   implication --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yeah, and so I think we

 6   have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would

 7   instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it

 8   couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if

 9   imported into the pleading would always mean a strong

10   inference.   You see, that's -- that's the dilemma.            And

11   I don't see how to remain true to the words of the

12   statute which are strong inference, without actually

13   producing a dichotomy.         And so either Congress can do it

14   or it can't, and -- and -- and that's -- and we could

15   fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment.

16   But I don't --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Miller, suppose

18   Congress set up a entirely separate cause of action.

19   It's caused -- it's called a discovery cause of action,

20   okay?   And it sets forth as the condition for pursuing

21   that cause of action a standard that your, your

22   allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing.

23                Okay?

24                And then if you win that, you can take

25   whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a

 1   lawsuit.     Would that be unconstitutional?

 2                 MR. MILLER:        Why do I feel wind whipping

 3   past my ears as I go through a trap door?

 4                 (Laughter.)

 5                 MR. MILLER:        Ironically, ironically, I think

 6   I have to say if Congress, leaving to one side

 7   justiciability problems with the discovery cause of

 8   action, if Congress created a discovery cause of action

 9   it could ascribe to it whatever incidents it wanted

10   to --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Surely it could prohibit

12   discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in

13   1938.

14                 MR. MILLER:        That is correct.         And I don't

15   think anybody seriously argues that discovery is a

16   constitutional right.

17                 The jury trial implications of this new

18   cause of action are interesting.                 This Court has

19   protected post-1791 statutory claims and their right to

20   jury trial, but you're positing one that wasn't known in

21   1791, and maybe it could be done without a jury.                  That's

22   really a hypothetical.

23                 THE COURT:       Thank you, Mr. Miller.

24                 Mr. Phillips, you have four minutes

25   remaining.

 1           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS,

 2                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 3               MR. PHILLIPS:            Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 4               I have to confess I'm -- I'm slightly

 5   perplexed by exactly what the Respondent's position is

 6   in this case so I'm inclined to kind of go back to the

 7   core points that have been raised by the questions from

 8   -- from the Court.      And in the first instance, it seems

 9   to me quite clear that the Seventh Circuit did not apply

10   the strong inference standard.                If --       you can compare

11   the language from the First Circuit circuit that

12   specifically says it has to be reasonable and strong,

13   strong has completely fallen out here.                    I don't see any

14   way to read it the other way.

15               I think in response to Justice Breyer's

16   question, which is how do, how should you write the

17   opinion, I think the meaningful way to write the opinion

18   is to be respectful of Justice Scalia's desire to

19   provide guidance.     So I do think you should say, you

20   have to, as Justice Alito said, review the entirety of

21   the document and -- and infer both positively and

22   negatively as you go forward.               We know that has to be

23   true.   Almost every court that's dealt with these issues

24   --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But then you're doing

 1   away with reading the allegations in the light most

 2   favorable to the plaintiff.

 3                MR. PHILLIPS:           Absolutely.          Absolutely,

 4   Justice Ginsburg.     There's no question that that's --

 5   that that's what Congress had to have meant under these

 6   circumstances.     And the best example of that is the CEO

 7   who sells securities during the time period of the class

 8   action.    There are dozens of cases in which that

 9   happens.    Does it create an inference of scienter?                    It

10   might, because it's quite possible that he sold and --

11   he lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to

12   sell.   It is also possible that he sells only about 1

13   percent of the stock --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But Mr. Phillips, you

15   don't look at these things one at a time.                   You look at

16   them altogether.

17                MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, that is --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is the statute all you

19   had?

20                MR. PHILLIPS:           Justice Ginsburg, I couldn't

21   disagree with you more about that.                   That is precisely

22   what Congress says when -- when it says with

23   particularity.     And when Congress says you have to look

24   at each defendant.      You cannot do --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It says you must plead

 1   the facts with particularity.

 2                MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But when one judges the

 4   adequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts

 5   pleaded with particularity, not just one.

 6                MR. PHILLIPS:         But the strong inference of

 7   scienter is not pled on a group basis.                     It has to be

 8   pled with respect to each individual defendant.                        So it's

 9   quite convenient --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, I think that this

11   case was a good example.         There were two defendants and

12   the court of appeals --

13                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, there were a lot more

14   than that.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, to take the two

16   that were at issue in this opinion.                     The court of

17   appeals said the CEO, yeah, there's enough there to get

18   over that threshold.      The other guy, no, there wasn't.

19                So it's not that she's saying what you find

20   for one, you find for all.          She is going at it defendant

21   by defendant.

22                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I -- I -- I mean, I was

23   commenting primarily on Professor Miller's decision to

24   just sort of sweep everything in and say look, back in

25   1999 and 2000 when the Seventh Circuit itself


                                       53

 1   specifically said that the knowledge, for instance, of

 2   the 5500 decline didn't happen until March of 2001.                 So

 3   I was just saying you can't start sweeping everything

 4   in.

 5                 But -- and it is true, the court

 6   distinguished between those two individuals; but the

 7   bottom line remains the same.               You have to analyze them,

 8   each.   And you have to take into account contending

 9   inferences.     You have to construe ambiguity contrary

10   to the plaintiff sometimes --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What do you do with a

12   report that you know exists because you had one of these

13   26 confidential people tell you?                 But you haven't seen

14   the report, so you don't have the date on it?                 And you

15   won't know that date unless you have access to

16   discovery.     Do you have to assume the date is later

17   rather than sooner?

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:          I think you better make an

19   allegation with particularity that that date was at a

20   time when the individual would know that the -- that the

21   information that he was conveying was -- was wrong.                 I

22   don't see how you can infer strongly --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you -- if the

24   plaintiff --

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:          -- scienter otherwise.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                The plaintiff can't know

 2   for sure without seeing the document with a date on it.

 3              MR. PHILLIPS:             Well, the plaintiff can ask

 4   the confidential informant as much as, as he wants about

 5   the information; and if he can't come up with it, that's

 6   the price you pay.      That was exactly what Congress said,

 7   is if you cannot make those particular allegations, then

 8   you're out of luck.       And it's not as though they give

 9   you one shot for this.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Congress -- Congress used

11   words, "strong inference."            Those words are not

12   self-defining.   One can think of several ways, in fact

13   the courts of appeals did think of several ways.                  Why

14   should we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one

15   might define them?

16              MR. PHILLIPS:             I could be flip to say it's

17   the right way.   But I think the -- I mean the answer to

18   the, the answer to why to choose our approach is because

19   it is consistent with Matsushita and Monsanto and it

20   will allow, Justice Breyer, to apply it in an

21   individualized way, in a fashion that will give guidance

22   to the lower courts.        Thank you.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you,
