 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Osborn v. Haley.

 5              Mr. Grant.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT

 7                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8              MR. GRANT:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The court of appeals misinterpreted the

11   Westfall Act in a way that unfairly deprives tort

12   plaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections

13   routinely afforded in both Federal and State courts.

14   That misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the

15   text and history of the statute, the nature and

16   operation of official immunity or the jurisdictional

17   limitations of article III.          Accordingly, the judgment

18   of the court of appeals should be reversed and this

19   State law case should be remanded to the State courts

20   where it rightfully belongs.            In the alternative, the

21   court of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of

22   appellate jurisdiction.

23              Prior to the Westfall Act, courts considered

24   whether, assuming the alleged acts occurred, the Federal

25   employee was acting within the scope of his employment.


                                     3

 1   In Westfall v. Erwin, this Court added the additional

 2   requirement that the acts be undertaken with a

 3   discretionary function, but invited Congress to address

 4   the issue.   In responding with the Westfall Act,

 5   Congress did not change the basic rule that scope of

 6   employment sets the line for immunity.                 Indeed, Congress

 7   confirmed that rule.      In particular, Congress gave no

 8   hint that it was radically rewriting the rules to direct

 9   Federal district courts to determine the merits of

10   wholly State law claims in some sort of unprecedented

11   summary proceeding.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why is it a wholly State

13   law claim if the principal matter is whether this

14   Federal employee is immune from suit?                That's the

15   threshold question that has to be answered.                 It's

16   determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get

17   through that Federal law gateway before you can go any

18   place else in the suit.

19                MR. GRANT:      Your Honor, that is true in

20   perhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases

21   like this and a significant and recurring subset of

22   cases there is no Federal law question because scope of

23   employment simply is not at issue.                 What the Government

24   does in those subset of cases is merely to assert the

25   defense of he didn't do it or it never happened.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But that -- it's not it

 2   never happened as though the Federal employee was off in

 3   Hong Kong.   He was there on the premises.           He is

 4   claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of

 5   his authority.   It seems like it's a question of

 6   phraseology that you're dealing with.

 7                MR. GRANT:    With respect, Your Honor, that

 8   is not the case, certainly in this case and in others.

 9   The Government has conceded that if Respondent Barry

10   Haley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting

11   outside the course and scope of his Federal employment.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I think Justice

13   Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that

14   the Government is entitled to say that during the time

15   the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and

16   he refrained from committing any unlawful act.

17                MR. GRANT:    Your Honor, there may be cases

18   where even if the acts occurred, they were within the

19   course and scope of the Federal employment.            But in the

20   case like this, as in Wood versus United States, as in

21   Melo v. Hafer in the Third Circuit, the Government

22   concedes, because the law and the facts require the

23   Government and the employee to concede, that if the

24   alleged acts took place they were necessarily outside

25   the scope of employment.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But the actual

 2   statutory language refers to acting within the scope of

 3   employment at the time of the incident, and so a

 4   certification based on the view that at the time of the

 5   alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his

 6   scope would seem to be within the language of the

 7   statute.

 8              MR. GRANT:        Your Honor, on its face the

 9   certification in this case, as in others, tracks the

10   statutory language.     But when the Government's position

11   was examined in the district court, it became apparent

12   that the Government's essential defense, in fact

13   supported by two declarations, including the declaration

14   of Respondent Haley, was that he simply did not do the

15   acts alleged.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, but the question is

17   what the district court should examine, and the statute

18   talks about the incident out of which the claim arose.

19   So that necessarily requires the Government to look at

20   the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim

21   arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify

22   it.

23              MR. GRANT:        Your Honor --

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               "Out of which the claim

25   arose" it seems to me is of some importance.                But the

 1   dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood,

 2   didn't think it was important.           I'm not sure they were

 3   right about that.

 4                 MR. GRANT:    Your Honor, this Court has

 5   consistently made a distinction between immunity and the

 6   merits.   Starting in cases like Mitchell versus Forsyth

 7   in 1985 and continuing through cases like Richardson

 8   versus McKnight in 1997, the Court has consistently

 9   recognized that immunity is different from a defense on

10   the merits.    It's different from a defense of he didn't

11   do it or it never happened.           And I would say that,

12   although the time of the incident is important, that is

13   only one of several factors certainly under Kentucky law

14   in determining whether something happened within the

15   course and scope of employment.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well how is it -- I

17   mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw.                You assert

18   he didn't do it versus something else.               But it's easy,

19   let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you

20   hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an

21   accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't,

22   wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort.                Now,

23   are they denying the incident in that case?

24                 MR. GRANT:    Your Honor, the Court in Wood v.

25   United States took account of the possibilities of


                                      7

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   artful pleading and would allow the Government to

 2   challenge the characterization of the incident.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But it's not just a

 4   characterization.    If it's something that has, for

 5   example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you

 6   did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can

 7   say, no, I didn't.    Now, is that a characterization or

 8   is that a denial of the incident?

 9                 MR. GRANT:    I believe that's a

10   characterization, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:         Why isn't it the denial of

12   an element of the claim?       There's no recovery for

13   assault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice

14   just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an

15   element of the claim how do you draw a distinction

16   between that and the existence or nonexistence of any

17   act at all.

18                 MR. GRANT:    There are, Your Honor, certain

19   cases in which --

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:         Well, I'm not asking about

21   certain cases.    I just want to know analytically how you

22   do it or how you think we're supposed to do it.

23                 MR. GRANT:    There are cases in which the

24   merits and the immunity defense overlap and in those

25   cases the district courts are fully empowered to make

 1   factual findings.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, in this case the

 3   immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the

 4   Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in

 5   terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope

 6   of his employment.    Secondarily, as you said, the

 7   Government in effect elaborated on that and said the

 8   reason he was not acting outside the scope of his

 9   employment is that these acts which would have been

10   outside scope didn't happen.             Why is that any

11   different from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo

12   that there was no intent to harm?

13              MR. GRANT:       Your Honor, because a claim of,

14   that the alleged act did not occur, that he didn't do

15   it, is not a claim of immunity.             Again, this --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:            It's a claim upon which the

17   immunity depends.    The immunity is claimed -- the

18   immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he

19   was not acting outside the scope of his employment.            The

20   reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he

21   didn't do what they say he did.

22              MR. GRANT:       Your Honor, I'm sorry if I have

23   the same answer to the question, but again, this Court's

24   jurisprudence has consistently distinguished between

25   defenses, so to speak, on the merits, a claim that the


                                      9

 1   alleged act did not occur, that one of the elements of

 2   the State law claim is not met.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:       In this case, if Mr. Haley

 4   had said, I had some conversations with the private

 5   employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during

 6   the conversations, but I never told them to discharge

 7   her, would this, would that be something -- would your

 8   argument apply there?

 9              MR. GRANT:     It would apply, Your Honor, if,

10   if that factual determination were relevant to scope of

11   employment under the applicable law, namely the agency

12   law of Kentucky.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, is it?   I mean,

14   that's -- the problem that I have with your argument,

15   Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it

16   happened or it didn't happen.          There is a middle

17   ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at

18   the relevant time or place and when I was there

19   everything that I did was within the scope of my

20   employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the

21   scope of my employment.

22              MR. GRANT:     There are cases in which there

23   is a middle ground, Your Honor.          But this case is not

24   one of them, and there is certainly a distinct and

25   recurring subset of cases, like Wood and Melo and

 1   Kimbro, where it is conceded on the facts and the law

 2   that if the actions occurred, they occurred outside the

 3   scope of employment.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't understand why

 5   anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to

 6   come out.   Why would it make any sense to give a Federal

 7   employee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he

 8   committed the act, and then you debate about whether it

 9   was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive

10   him of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies

11   that he did anything at all?            Why would you want one set

12   of cases to remain in the State court and the other set

13   of cases to go to Federal court?

14               MR. GRANT:     Your Honor, it's Congress that

15   set the line at scope of employment.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, I mean, that's what

17   we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as

18   you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some

19   ambiguity in it.   There being ambiguity, why should we

20   find a line that doesn't make any sense?

21               MR. GRANT:     Well, Your Honor, I believe that

22   line does make sense because if the Government's view is

23   adopted and the view of the majority of the court of

24   appeals, the merits of the wholly State law claim will

25   be resolved in Federal court and resolved in a

 1   procedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the

 2   right to discovery, that denies the tort plaintiff a

 3   right to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion

 4   to dismiss or motion for summary judgment, and denies

 5   that tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:          But that can happen when in

 7   fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out

 8   to be wrong and there isn't any immunity.            Still, the

 9   whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.

10              MR. GRANT:      Your Honor, in that situation,

11   the merits will at least be tried under the normal

12   provisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions,

13   even if it does ultimately proceed against the United

14   States.

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But Mr. Grant, I'm a

16   little puzzled.   Why is the discovery in the Federal

17   system any less valuable in the State system?

18              MR. GRANT:      Because what the Government

19   advocates here, as I think most starkly illustrated by

20   the Third Circuit's decision in Melo v. Hafer is some

21   sort of summary proceeding that takes place before the

22   normal processes of Federal litigation.            After all, it's

23   the Government's position that this employee is immune.

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Isn't that only summary

25   for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was

 1   proper?

 2              MR. GRANT:      It's for the purpose of deciding

 3   scope of employment, but the Government's interpretation

 4   of that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the

 5   case.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's not for

 7   deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says

 8   that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive

 9   with respect to removal.

10              MR. GRANT:      It is conclusive, Your Honor, in

11   those cases that truly do implicate scope of employment.

12   In this case, by contrast, the certification was

13   essentially to raise the he didn't do it or it never

14   happened defense.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what does it

16   mean to say that the certification is conclusive with

17   respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal

18   if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going

19   to have judicial review that is going to address the

20   question of removal as opposed to the validity of the

21   certification on the merits?

22              MR. GRANT:      Your Honor, it's conclusive

23   where it satisfies the definition in the statute.               What

24   is conclusive in the final sentence of paragraph (d)(2)

 2   in that paragraph.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you're saying

 4   it's only conclusive if it's right?

 5              MR. GRANT:       No, Your Honor.            It's only, it

 6   can be conclusive right or wrong, but it's only

 7   conclusive if it satisfies the statutory definition,

 8   being about scope of employment, not about the merits.

 9   In this case, for example, there never will be, never

10   could be a true scope of employment determination, the

11   Government having conceded it.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Suppose, Mr. Grant, that

13   the district court had said, I'm going to deny the

14   substitution of the United States as the defendant, but

15   I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not

16   going to order a remand until the defendant and the United

17   States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling

18   that I deny the substitution of the United States.

19   Suppose that it had happened that way?               Would you have any

20   right to get back in the State court?               Wouldn't that

21   properly go to a court of appeals?

22              MR. GRANT:       Your Honor, that, that could

23   certainly go to the court of appeals under the

24   discretionary appeal procedure in section 1292(b), or

25   perhaps by mandamus.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, suppose that

 2   happened, and then the court of appeals said the United

 3   States should have been substituted?

 4                MR. GRANT:     That would -- that would on its

 5   merits restrict the district court from remanding, but

 6   of course in this case, the district court did enter an

 7   order of remand based on its interpretation of section

 8   2679.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:       But your position is that

10   the Attorney General's certification is conclusive --

11   is not conclusive in those situations in which the

12   Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between

13   an event denying answer and an event characterizing

14   answer?    Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that

15   very nuanced decision in some instances, then the

16   Attorney General's certification is not conclusive?

17                MR. GRANT:     The short answer is yes, Your

18   Honor.    The Attorney General's certification is not

19   conclusive where it does not satisfy the statutory

20   definition, where it is not a certification that truly

21   implicates scope of employment.           We have tried to draw

22   the distinction between an unauthorized or improper

23   certification, one that doesn't meet the statutory

24   definition, and a certification as, as the Court in

25   Aliota versus Graham said was wrong or erroneous on its

 1   merits, so to speak, on the facts, on the law, of State

 2   agency law.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Grant, these items

 4   we've been discussing are perhaps the more important

 5   features of the case.      But your argument in your brief

 6   didn't begin with those.       It began with the assertion

 7   that there is no jurisdiction to review the district

 8   court's remand order at all.             I take it you're not

 9   abandoning that, are you?

10                 MR. GRANT:    Absolutely not, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Then why was it first in

12   your brief and not first in your argument?

13                 MR. GRANT:    It was first in my brief because

14   this Court ordered me to brief and address it, and I was

15   happy to do so.    The court of appeals in fact did lack

16   jurisdiction in this case.        This Court has made clear as

17   recently as the Kircher opinion last term that section

18   1447(d) means what it says.          And in this case, the

19   district court entered an order remanding the case to

20   the State court from which it was removed, and 1447(d),

21   of course, bars review of that order by appeal or

22   otherwise.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              There is at least

24   considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and

25   2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for


                                     16

 1   purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification

 2   is conclusive.   And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it

 3   suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal

 4   court rather than be immediately remanded without the

 5   availability of review.

 6               MR. GRANT:     Your Honor, on the merits of the

 7   interpretation of 2679(d)(2), we tried to explain why

 8   conclusive does not operate in a case like this, but I

 9   think the important point for jurisdiction is that this

10   Court has consistently said that even if a district

11   court misinterprets a jurisdictional statute, that

12   review is nonetheless barred by section 1447(d).

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               This is a different

14   type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern

15   on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for

16   the adjudication of whether something is within the

17   scope of a Federal employee's duty.              It's not

18   inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to

19   specifically provide for review of that determination

20   but then have that review take place in State court

21   rather than Federal court.

22               MR. GRANT:     Well, Your Honor, Congress

23   obviously knows how to make exceptions to section

24   1447(d).   I believe it was footnote eight of this

25   Court's opinion in Kircher that cited a number of


                                    17

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   examples.   The Government in its brief relied on 12

 2   U.S.C. section 1441(a), and that statute which involved

 3   the Resolution Trust Corporation specifically refers to

 4   appeal and remand.    And so what this Court has said is,

 5   the bar of section 1447(d), which has been around for

 6   more than a century, is not to be ignored unless there

 7   is a clear statutory command that makes an exception.

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:        But here not only, not only

 9   does it say that the Attorney General's certification is

10   conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no

11   mention about remand in relation to a case that is

12   removed after the Attorney General's certification.

13   Whereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't

14   certify and the case is removed, the statute does

15   address the issue of remand.             So if you put those two

16   things together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress

17   did not want these cases that are removed on the

18   Attorney General's certification to be remanded?

19               MR. GRANT:      No, Your Honor.         The authority

20   to remand in this case proceeds from subsection C of

21   section 1447.   As this Court has said in various cases,

22   including the International Primate Protection League

23   case in 1991, when a Federal district court lacks

24   subject matter jurisdiction because a case, a party

25   attempting to remove has done so without authority to do

                                   Official


 1   so, section 1447(c) obliges a remand.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I would have thought your

 3   answer would have been even if, even if the remand was

 4   improper, even if it is the case that, what is it,

 5   (d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal

 6   court.    Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it

 7   is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of

 8   review.   I mean, we said in other cases that even when

 9   the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.

10                MR. GRANT:     That is my answer, Your Honor.

11   Section (d)(2) goes, gives direction to district courts,

12   but section 1447(d) gives direction to appellate courts.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:         If that's your answer, can

14   I go back to the other main issue for a second?              I would

15   have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my

16   mind, is the classic case where there should be

17   jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I

18   don't think anything happened, okay?              So he was doing

19   his job all day.   But if something did happen, I'll tell

20   you what, it was within the scope of his employment.

21   And apparently, that's just what they did say here.                 And

22   then it got mixed up in the courts below.              In other

23   words, if he made some phone calls and even if he

24   mentioned the employee, even if he said something

25   improper, it was within the scope of his employment,


                                     19
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   which is just what they said.            So because of that, it

 2   seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of

 3   nothing.    Now you explain what your answer is.

 4                MR. GRANT:     Your Honor, with respect, I

 5   believe the Attorney General said just the opposite,

 6   that --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:         In the district court he

 8   didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the

 9   scope of his employment?       I thought he had.       Maybe he

10   hadn't.    I thought he had, but I'll ask him that.

11                MR. GRANT:     Your Honor --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:         In the district court I

13   thought he said that.

14                MR. GRANT:     The Attorney General's

15   submission, the Government's submission in the district

16   court was that nothing happened.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, it was there first,

18   but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think

19   nothing happened.    But if the plaintiff can convince a

20   jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince

21   him of is within the scope of his employment.           Now did

22   that happen in the district court, that they said

23   something like that or not?

24                MR. GRANT:     Your Honor, the Government did

25   make what it called an alternative argument.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, why can't they do

 2   that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if

 3   anybody, you know, thinks that's valid?           But the --

 4   what's the problem then?       Because I would have thought

 5   that the reason this case appears difficult is because

 6   yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in

 7   and remove it.

 8               MR. GRANT:      The district court, the very

 9   same district court that the Government so, so

10   desperately wants to review the facts of this case, said

11   that given Mr. Haley's declaration under penalty of

12   perjury, it would not accept that alternative.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:           But it's wrong in that,

14   isn't it?

15               MR. GRANT:      Well, the Government did not

16   appeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean, the Wood issue was

18   the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's

19   outside the scope.    It's like one employee shoots

20   another, you know.    There is nothing to do with scope of

21   employment there, it's plainly outside.           And of course,

22   this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an

23   act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing.

24   But if it's arguable at least that something happened,

25   if it happened at all it was within the scope of


                                     21

 1   employment, the AG can defend it.

 2                 MR. GRANT:    Your Honor, the Government --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:        What's the problem with --

 4   there should be a problem with what I say from your

 5   point of view, so --

 6                 MR. GRANT:    I think the problem is in the

 7   record, Your Honor, and the Government's brief at the,

 8   at the petition stage on page 14 in note five quotes its

 9   own appellate brief in the court of appeals, and that

10   brief says the memorandum of understanding between the

11   Forest Service and the private respondent showed that if

12   Haley did cause the contractor to fire Osborn, he acted

13   outside the scope of his employment.                And the court of

14   appeals quite logically took that --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:         So you're saying they have

16   abandoned the argument?

17                MR. GRANT:     They have Your Honor and the

18   court of appeals recognized that on page 3a of the

19   petition appendix.    If the Court has no further

20   questions I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 1   and may it please the Court:

 2                 In the Westfall Act Congress provided an

 3   absolute immunity for Federal employees for acts

 4   taken within the scope of their employment and it

 5   went further and provided that when the Attorney

 6   General certifies that the employee was acting

 7   within the scope of his employment at the time of

 8   the incident out of which the claim arose, that that

 9   issue of Federal immunity is to be decided by the

10   Federal court.    It is the Attorney General's assertion

11   of this Federal defense of immunity that satisfies

12   article III just as the employee's own assertion of

13   immunity satisfies article III under the Federal Officer

14   Removal statute and just as a, in other circumstances a

15   plaintiff's assertion of a claim under Federal law

16   satisfies article III.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So what if the

18   Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a

19   criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute?

20   What happens then?

21                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Well, I think that

22   the, the -- that would probably be a defect in removal

23   procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even

24   if it is --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, no, on the


                                     23

 1   procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's

 2   just wrong.    It's a criminal case.              The statute says he

 3   can do it in a civil case.        On the other hand the statute

 4   also says that his certification is conclusive.

 5                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Well, Your Honor

 6   even if that is a case that would be removed without

 7   jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this

 8   case because this case --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Yes, this one is a

10   civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just

11   trying to understand how broad your argument that this

12   is not subject to further review goes.

13                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             Well, the issue

14   that is not subject to further review for purposes of

15   jurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification

16   that the employee was acting within scope.               The

17   statute doesn't provide that the Attorney General's

18   certification that it is a civil action is conclusive

19   but only the Attorney General's certification that the

20   employee was acting within scope is conclusive for

21   purposes of removal.     That's the essential element of

22   the Federal defense and that's what satisfies article

23   III jurisdiction.    And in fact, this Court in the

24   Willingham case recognized that an employee could assert

25   a claim of Federal immunity even though he was also at


                                     24

 1   the same time denying that he caused any harm to the

 2   plaintiff.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well I thought your

 4   analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back

 5   and read the statute.     Willingham is a very different

 6   statutory predicate.     It's acting under color of law.

 7   This is much more specific.          At the time of the

 8   incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not

 9   sure the analogy holds up.

10                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Well if anything

11   the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as

12   Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall

13   act provides that the Attorney General is to certify

14   that at the time of the incident out of which the claim

15   arose the employee was acting within the scope.                So

16   arguably the necessary question is what was the employee

17   doing at the time.    The Federal Officer Removal statute

18   is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim

19   arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But yet that would

21   be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney

22   General can certify that the employee did not do

23   anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's

24   phrased in the affirmative.          He has to certify that he

25   was acting within the scope of his employment.

 1                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:               That's right.     And

 2   that's what the Attorney General did here, certified

 3   that Mr. Haley was acting within the scope of his

 4   employment at the time of the incident out of which the

 5   claim arose.     And as several --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So that's the issue then.

 7   And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's

 8   imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too

 9   complicated and probably is one that the Government

10   should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault

11   like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no

12   doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of

13   employment, everybody concedes it but Government.                   And

14   the Government's position is, nothing happened.                 All

15   right?     Nothing happened.      You say Government, would you

16   like to argue that if something happened, and they may

17   be able to prove something, something like a movement?

18   No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree

19   nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend

20   on any scope of employment ground.                 All we are arguing

21   is that ordinary work went on and that was within the

22   scope of employment.      Now, does this act cover it or

23   not?     Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought

24   it was a close question but you read what I thought the

25   other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close

 1   question.    So what is your basic response to that?

 2                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              You are correct

 3   that our view is that yes, the Attorney General can

 4   certify in that case.     The issue is really one along a

 5   continuum as I think Your Honor has recognized.                  Of on,

 6   on the one extreme, one might say that the Attorney

 7   General must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations

 8   as true.    And, and I don't think that anybody here is

 9   arguing that.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That was the position of

11   the district court, though, wasn't it?

12                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              That was the

13   position of the district court, although I don't think

14   the Petitioner is now advocating that view.               And that

15   view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create

16   the anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to

17   certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of

18   the employee would be narrower than the employee's own

19   authority to assert the immunity, because again going back

20   to the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it

21   would be within the scope of employment for the prison

22   officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner;

23   rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but

24   anything that happened between us and the prisoner

25   happened within the scope of our employment.               And so the


                                     27

 1   Attorney General's authority to certify has to be at

 2   least as broad as that in our view.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            The basic point I think in

 4   Wood is this.     I'm the district judge.             And the

 5   Government, you come in and argue in the alternative.

 6   Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the

 7   scope of employment and they say there is no

 8   possibility.     You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here

 9   if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that

10   a jury could find that something went on here that was

11   within the scope of employment that shouldn't have.                  And

12   if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins

13   either because of summary judgment or because -- no,

14   sorry.   I've gotten lost in what I said.               Do you follow

15   it?

16               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                The -- I think I do.

17   In our view --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.      Good, I'm glad

19   that someone did.

20               [Laughter.]

21               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                In our view, it

22   would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent

23   employee would be deprived of the benefits of the

24   Westfall Act, and if I could use a more simple --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            I was talking really about

 1   practicality of it.     I don't think you can give me a

 2   case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge

 3   to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government,

 4   to tell me if anything went on here that might have been

 5   within the scope of employment.            And I look at what

 6   you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't

 7   defend it.   If you say yes, you can defend it and that's

 8   going to be the end of it as long as your view is based

 9   on a reasonable reading of the record.

10                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:               Well, I don't think

11   that that could be the end of it.             As Justice Ginsburg

12   pointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or

13   white and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor

14   poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses,

15   the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence

16   that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee

17   was acting within the scope or not.

18                If I could use a simple example of assault.

19   If the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee

20   for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the

21   supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her

22   fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her.

23   Even if that would be outside the scope of employment,

24   the employee might say -- the supervisor rather might

25   say, I never raised my hand at all.                I raised my voice


                                      29

 1   certainly but I never raised my hand.                A third party

 2   witness may say well I saw the supervisor wag her finger

 3   at the employee but not in a threatening fashion.                 Now --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:          And as long as a jury could

 5   find that there is a view of the record such that the

 6   plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within

 7   the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that

 8   hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it.

 9   What's the problem?

10                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Well, if the

11   employee --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:          The only problem is if you

13   admit that you can't prove anything like that.

14                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              If the employee was

15   acting within the scope of the employment when she

16   wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within

17   the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her

18   hand at all.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:          No, not a fortiori, for the

20   reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the

21   defendant the right to call in the Government to defend

22   him no matter what he did.         The reason that Congress

23   wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which

24   was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the

25   question of the scope of Government responsibility to


                                      30

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   take away that limited determination in Westfall.                   That

 2   was the only point.     Congress could have written a

 3   statute the way.    What's your response to that?

 4              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                  But Congress made,

 5   established an absolute immunity where the employee was

 6   acting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner

 7   agrees that scope of employment is the essential

 8   question for immunity.       So if in my hypothetical the

 9   supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment

10   when she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising

11   her fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by

12   the Westfall Act from a claim arising out of the context

13   of that employment.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But what happens in a

15   case where the certification is clearly wrong?                   I mean,

16   you get into a fight with your neighbor.                It's got

17   nothing to do with your employment at all but the

18   Attorney General certifies that it does.                You know:

19   "They are always thinking about your cases.                You must

20   have been thinking about it at the time."                That

21   certification goes into the district court.                The

22   district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous,

23   throws it out, then that State law assault case proceeds

24   in Federal court?

25              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                 Your Honor, the


                                      31

 1   Congress enacted the Westfall Act against the

 2   presumption of regularity of Federal officials and that

 3   is of course what this Court has often said as well, and

 4   so I don't think we should construe the statute on the

 5   presumption that the Attorney General would, would

 6   certify ridiculous cases.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well what about the,

 8   Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee

 9   working within the scope of his employment or was he off

10   on a frolic of his own?     I think that's the kind of

11   question that the Chief Justice put to you.             The

12   certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General

13   said what he was doing was within the scope of

14   employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with

15   his friends and they got in his car and killed someone.

16   If that certification within the scope was wrong and

17   instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United

18   States isn't substituted.

19              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              That's right.   That

20   would mean that the district court did not on the merits

21   ultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the

22   Court said in Mesa, the merits of the immunity defense

23   have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of

24   jurisdiction.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought that that case


                                   32
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was about, was the certification reviewable?

 2                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              That's right.

 3   Lamagno was about whether the certification was

 4   reviewable.     Your Honor is also correct about the facts

 5   of that case.     One of the points of dispute between the

 6   Government and the plaintiffs there was whether

 7   Mr. Lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident, and,

 8   and the Attorney General certified on his understanding

 9   that Mr. Lamagno was not drunk.             And that was upheld by

10   the district court on remand after some discovery and

11   summary judgment type litigation.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But the Court said that

13   that could be reviewed.

14                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              That's right.   It

15   can be reviewed and the Attorney General's certification

16   is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Right.

18                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              It is conclusive

19   for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         What does that mean?         Does

21   that mean that if the district court finds that in fact

22   the defendant was not acting within the scope of his

23   employment, the United States is eliminated as the

24   defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?

25                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Yes, Your Honor.

                                  Official


 1   That's what happened.    But, and in that --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where, where does that come

 3   from?

 4              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:               Well, the procedure

 5   for what happens upon the district court's review is not

 6   spelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review

 7   itself in particular.    But the, the employee --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Maybe the United States

 9   should remain the party defendant and the United States

10   should pay which would be the, you know, the price of

11   the Attorney General's certification.             He should be

12   careful what he certifies.

13              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:               Well, the uniform

14   view of the lower courts is that when the certification is

15   overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee

16   as the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a

17   pendent claim.   The Attorney General's assertion of the

18   defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable

19   because we presume regularity by the Attorney General,

20   confers article III jurisdiction on the courts, even

21   though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected.

22   This Court held in the Carnegie-Mellon case that the

23   district courts have discretion whether to exercise

24   jurisdiction over pendent claims once the Federal

25   question has been resolved.          If the courts have


                                    34

                                   Official


 1   discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then

 2   certainly Congress can instruct them to exercise that --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, they wouldn't

 4   have discretion in that case, though, because the

 5   statute says the Attorney General's certification is

 6   conclusive for purposes of removal.

 7               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                That's right.

 8   Congress has removed the discretion in this class of

 9   cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought maybe your

11   answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you

12   can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.

13               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                Well, the, perhaps,

14   perhaps that's so.    Certainly Carnegie-Mellon --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It would still be

16   conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean

17   it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter

18   jurisdiction.

19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                By its text, the

20   statute speaks to removal and that the Attorney

21   General's certification is conclusive for purposes of

22   removal.   But I think --

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:          Couldn't it be conclusive

24   for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave

25   the district court with discretion to remand on the

 1   grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in

 2   fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong,

 3   and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the

 4   only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a

 5   pendent claim.

 6                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              But the -- as the

 7   Court held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims

 8   after the Federal issue has been resolved is not a

 9   remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within

10   the meaning of 1447(c).        Rather, it is a discretionary

11   remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and

12   so --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:          In that case it would be

14   reviewable.

15                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              And it would be

16   reviewable.     That's why -- that's one of the reasons why

17   the district court's order here is reviewable, because

18   it is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c)

19   because, first of all, Congress has instructed the

20   courts that they are not to remand.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's, that's what the

22   district court said it was, though, isn't it?                Didn't it

23   -- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of

24   jurisdiction?

25                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              It is certainly

 1   true that the district court --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:         So you want us to review

 3   the, the assertion of the district court that it was

 4   remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would,

 5   would be reviewable.

 6               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              No, Your Honor,

 7   because here the Court need not go beyond the face of

 8   the district court's order to understand what it was

 9   doing.   The court exercised jurisdiction over the

10   Federal question that was properly brought before it by

11   the Attorney General's certification and this Court's

12   decision in Lamagno.    After resolving that, the district

13   court said, having concluded that the United States is

14   not a proper party to this case, the court must now

15   determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it

16   also said that the absence of the U.S. as a party to the

17   case destroys the court's jurisdiction.              So it's evident

18   that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and

19   that it was a subsequent event that deprived it.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me go back to the

21   Chief Justice's hypo a little earlier.             Could the

22   district judge at that point dismiss the case without

23   prejudice to refiling in the State court?

24               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              I don't think that

25   that would be consistent with Congress's intent.               The --

 1   in all of the Government --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It would be consistent

 3   with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the

 4   case.

 5               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              That is true.     But

 6   I think that the intent of Congress was the same as this

 7   Court, all the members of this Court, recognized in

 8   Lamagno.   In Lamagno, even the dissenters, the

 9   plurality, all acknowledged what Congress intended by

10   the "conclusive for purposes of removal" language was to

11   prevent the shuttling back and forth of the case.                 Once

12   it was removed, it was to stay in Federal court.                 That

13   was what Congress intended.         And one reason --

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Then it's more than

15   pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction

16   leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the

17   State claim or send it back.            So this is -- what you're

18   suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction.

19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              That's right.     By

20   pendent jurisdiction what, what I meant to convey was

21   that it is within the Court's article III jurisdiction

22   to exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims that

23   were pendent to a Federal claim.            Under this Court's

24   judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction,

25   that is discretionary with the court.              But if it is


                                    38

 1   discretionary with the court, then certainly Congress

 2   can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction

 3   and that it would be consistent with article III.

 4                 But another reason why Congress would have

 5   wanted the case to remain in Federal court even if the

 6   certification is overturned is, as we've alluded to

 7   before, the development of the case subsequent to the

 8   certification substitution decision may, may illustrate

 9   that the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that

10   were within the scope of employment.                The court would at

11   the very --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, the

13   jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that.                Justice Ginsburg's

14   point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I

15   take it is because these are not separate State claims

16   appended to what you thought was a Federal claim.                   This

17   is the same claim that you initially thought was a

18   Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law

19   claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for

20   purposes of jurisdiction.

21                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              No.   The case is I

22   think not distinguishable from removals under the

23   Federal Officer Removal statute, where Congress has

24   indicated that it is the Federal defense that confers

25   jurisdiction rather than the Federal claim.                   Then, the


                                     39

 1   ultimate merits of the Federal defense are irrelevant to

 2   the jurisdictional issue.       And the Court --

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:         So you're saying there are

 4   two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if

 5   you look at that claim which is by definition Federal,

 6   then it's fair to look at the original State claim by

 7   analogy as a pendent claim?

 8               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Yes.

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:         Is that fair?

10               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Yes, Your Honor.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What happens if the

12   Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State

13   court?   I take it one of the concerns we have here is

14   that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the

15   certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court.

16   Suppose that there is a denial of certification.              Then

17   under (d)(3) --

18               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              (D)(3).

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- the employee can ask

20   for a certification decision.            I take it that's a

21   Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law

22   point, that the State court must hear and so now we're

23   back in State court?

24               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Yes.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And we still don't have a

 1   jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps

 2   you or helps the Petitioner.

 3                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Well, I think that

 4   Your Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal

 5   law is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the

 6   outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for

 7   certification over the Attorney General's objection the

 8   statute allows the Attorney General to remove the

 9   petition to Federal court and the statute states that

10   the district court shall find and certify whether the

11   employee was acting within the scope.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But in my case I guess I

13   don't think it ever gets to district court because

14   there's no certification, but then the employee can ask

15   the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of

16   employment.     Am I right about that?

17                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              He can, you are

18   correct.     It is at the option of the Attorney General

19   under (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that

20   the review of his noncertification happens in Federal

21   court.     (D)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides

22   that if the district court holds that the Attorney

23   General was correct that the employee was not acting

24   within the scope the case is to be remanded to State

25   court.     So the presence of the remand --


                                      41

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But my point is I suppose

 2   the Government can just say, we're not going to make the

 3   certification and we're not going to remove.

 4                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             Yes.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So then the State court

 6   still has to have the bench trial on the scope of

 7   employment.

 8                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             That's right.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure if that helps.

10   It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting

11   the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench

12   trials in almost every case.

13                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             The -- I think what

14   that illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of

15   immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the

16   court.   And one reason that that is so essential under

17   the Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity --

18   if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of

19   the employee, that has many, many consequences,

20   including that the United States is the proper

21   defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal

22   court, the case must be dismissed until an

23   administrative claim is filed and that avenue is

24   exhausted.

25                 All of these procedural and substantive


                                     42

 1   defenses come into play depending on how the scope of

 2   employment issue is resolved.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:         Right, but that's the

 4   strongest argument I thought the other way initially,

 5   that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of

 6   his own.    That you resolve in a bench trial.              If the

 7   answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court

 8   anyway.    I understand that.

 9                But if you're going to take your position

10   whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood

11   and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or

12   not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope

13   of employment, well, then you're going to have all these

14   things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's

15   supposed to normally be before a jury, for example.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Is that so?      If the

17   employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United

18   States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but

19   it's staying in Federal court under this pendent

20   jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be

21   entitled to a jury trial?

22                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:              Yes.   Yes, Your

23   Honor.    I think Justice Breyer's question, though, had

24   to do with the procedure at the certification review

25   stage.    That is to be done by the district court sitting

 1   without jury and that's because under the statute the

 2   Attorney General's certification has the legal effect of

 3   making the United States the defendant.             The United

 4   States -- the action shall be deemed an action against

 5   the United States and the United States shall be

 6   substituted, and that is true unless and until the

 7   certification is overturned.           And there is of course no

 8   Seventh Amendment right to jury trial against the United

 9   States.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Grant, could I come

11   back for -- I'm sorry.    I have the wrong counsel.           Mr.

12   Hallward-Driemeier --

13               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             I'll respond to

14   anything, Your Honor.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:        What is your response to

16   the application of 1447(d)?        You say that it does not

17   apply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is

18   improper?

19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             That the remand was

20   not one of the remands authorized by 1447(c) --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Right, right.

22               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             Not just that it

23   was erroneous.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Wouldn't somebody always be

25   able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case --

 1                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             No, Your Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        And wouldn't that destroy

 3   the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this

 4   ping-pong?

 5                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             No, Your Honor, I

 6   think not.    And we have two arguments that both the

 7   issues, substitution and remand, are appealable.                One is

 8   a very specific one and that is that Congress has

 9   categorically taken this kind of remand outside the

10   court's authority under 1447(c) by specifically

11   prohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that

12   argument of course would not have relevance, I don't

13   think, much beyond this case.            And this Court has

14   recognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of

15   orders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without

16   cross-referencing those provisions.               In the Rice case,

17   the Court said that that specific removal provision did

18   not purport to impair or restrict the application of the

19   then equivalents of 747(c) and (d).               But clearly

20   2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to

21   remand by making the certification conclusive for

22   purposes of removal.     So with that as our narrowest

23   argument --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        But the response to that is

25   that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is


                                     45

 1   nonetheless governed by 1447(d).            There are a lot of

 2   erroneous remands and this would just be, just be

 3   another one.

 4                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:             But when Congress

 5   specifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case

 6   under 2679(d)(2) it certainly did not mean to protect a

 7   court that ignored that mandate from review.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:        Isn't the problem, and

 9   maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here,

10   but isn't the problem with your argument is that the

11   statute didn't come out and say you can't remand.              The

12   statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification

13   is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy

14   that you and I were talking with before.              A court can

15   say look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction

16   here, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because

17   what you and I are calling here the pendent claim does

18   not support any of the Government's theory.              If that's

19   the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of

20   it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling.              But if

21   on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge

22   said here, I am remanding because based on this

23   analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge

24   went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is

25   conclusive.    That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling,

 1   and as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over

 2   again, however erroneous it may be, it is not

 3   reviewable.

 4                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:               If I may, Your

 5   Honor?     I think, two things:           One, that there is a

 6   difference between Congress categorically prohibiting a

 7   certain kind of remand, and saying that a remand was

 8   simply erroneous.     And secondly, that that argument

 9   would not go to our argument that under Waco, at the

10   very least, the order on substitution is appealable,

11   because it is separate and independent from remand.

 1   where the district court did not even purport to be

 2   relying on one of the grounds enumerated in section

 3   1447(c), namely lack of subject matter jurisdiction.                In

 4   this case, of course, the district court explicitly

 5   cited both that statute and used the term subject matter

 6   jurisdiction, and the Government itself is, is not

 7   willing to go behind that.       On the merits, the

 8   Government has argued this morning that the Westfall Act

 9   provides a Federal forum to assert a Federal defense of

10   immunity.    The Government has analogized this statute

11   to section 1442(a), which allows the assertion of a

12   colorable Federal defense, but the defense of, he didn't

13   do it, it never happened, is not a Federal defense.                It

14   is not a defense of immunity.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How about the defense of,

16   I was on the job and everything I did on the job was

17   within the scope of my employment?

18                MR. GRANT:    In certain cases, Your Honor,

19   that could be a defense of immunity, but in a class of

20   cases identified by Justice Breyer, there will be an

21   admission.   There has to be an admission under the facts

22   and the law, that even if the alleged acts occurred, it

23   was outside the scope of employment.              In that case, the

24   defense is purely a merits defense.              And I think for

25   this Court to say otherwise in this case would require


                                    48

 1   overruling, or being contradictory to over 20 years of

 2   official immunity jurisprudence, where the Court has

 3   consistently distinguished between immunity defenses and

 4   defenses on the merits, where certainly the lower courts

 5   have taken that conceptual distinction and said a

 6   defense that the alleged acts did not occur do not raise

 7   an immunity defense.      And so, the assertion of a defense

 8   in that case on the merits is not the assertion of a

 9   Federal defense.     It is not sufficient to confer Federal

10   jurisdiction under article III.            It does not meet the

11   definition of a statute, of the statute, which uses the

12   phrase "scope of employment" no fewer than seven times.

13   There is no indication that Congress in the Westfall Act

14   intended to change the normal rules that purely State

15   law defenses such as he didn't do it were to be decided

16   in a Federal forum.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But then you're left with

18   this question Justice Scalia raised.               If it's ambiguous,

19   an employee says I did everything within the scope of my

20   employment, I did nothing improper.                They allege I did

21   something improper.     I didn't.         I was a faithful

22   servant.     The negligent employee will be allowed the

23   Federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful

24   employee has to be in the State court.               Does that make

25   any sense?

 1                MR. GRANT:      Your Honor, I think that's, with

 2   respect, a misunderstanding of how the statute works.

 3   The employee who acts within the scope of his

 4   employment, whether or not he did the acts alleged, gets

 5   immunity.    The employee who acts outside of the scope of

 6   employment --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This is an employee who

 8   said I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my

 9   Federal employment.

10                MR. GRANT:      That's an employee who should

11   win on the merits and will win on the merits.                   As

12   Justice Kennedy recognized, there are certain

13   applications that allow the State court to resolve even

14   a Federal defense.     We should trust that State courts

15   will resolve State law defenses in a manner fair to

16   their own citizens as well.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

18   Mr. Grant.   The case is submitted.

19                (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the

20   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
