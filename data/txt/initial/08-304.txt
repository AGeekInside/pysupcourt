 5   and Water Conservation District v. The United States, ex

 6   rel. Wilson.

 8        ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10              MR. BROWNING:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12              The issue in this case is whether the word

13   "administrative" as used in the public disclosure bar of

14   the False Claims Act includes State audits and reports

15   or is limited to Federal sources.

16              If this Court were to hold that a relator

17   can simply copy a State report or a State criminal

18   indictment and then proceed with a qui tam action, there

19   will be a proliferation of opportunistic qui tam actions

20   brought under this statute.

21              Such construction of the statute would have

22   a devastating effect upon States, local governments, and

23   the Federal fisc.

24              Much of the work of State government

25   involves cooperative Federal and State programs.                 States


                                         3

 1   have been an effective partner in fighting against fraud

 2   and abuse with respect to those programs.                For example,

 3   many States have turned to computerized software to

 4   identify irregularities in connection with Medicaid

 5   billings.     California has implemented a process of

 6   analyzing both its Medicare and its Medicaid databases

 7   in order to identify doctors who bill in excess of

 8   24 hours in a given day.

 9                 Under the decision below, that investigatory

10   work can simply be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an

11   action brought based upon that public report.               The

12   result is --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But under your proposal a

14   State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect,

15   immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the

16   information unusable by conducting a hearing.

17                 MR. BROWNING:         Well, Your Honor, the

18   government certainly argues that it would result in

19   State and local governments immunizing themselves from

20   qui tam liability.

21                 With respect to States, the Fourth Circuit's

22   decision expressly includes reports of the State

23   government.    States, of course, are not liable under the

24   qui tam provisions, as a result of this Court's decision

25   in Vermont Department of Natural Resources v. United

 1   States ex rel. Stevens.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And it's also the

 3   original source, if -- if the relator is the original

 4   source of the information.

 5                 MR. BROWNING:        Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg,

 6   that -- even if there is a State report that a -- that

 7   a -- is in the public domain, a local government could

 8   still be sued under that document, if -- in spite of

 9   that document, by either the United States or a qui tam

10   plaintiff that stands as an original source.             So --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But what about the

12   argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent

13   provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and

14   this would -- if you would -- if you include State and

15   local reports, that will shrink the availability?

16                 MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, there is no

17   question that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public

18   disclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 1943

19   and 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui

20   tam action, would be barred if it was based upon

21   information that was available to the -- the Federal

22   Government.

23                 Congress decided that that cut off too many

24   qui tam actions, and as a result it reached a

25   compromise.    Many members of Congress wanted to totally

 1   eliminate the government knowledge bar.                  On the other

 2   hand, the United States Department of Justice at the

 3   time was arguing that the existing bar should remain in

 4   effect as a result of abusive and frivolous qui tam

 5   actions and their concern with respect to that.                  So a

 6   compromise was reached in which the bar was completely

 7   changed.   It was changed to allow for a -- for an

 8   original source to bring the qui tam action, essentially

 9   a relief valve that addressed Congress's concerns with

10   respect to cases such as United States ex rel.

11   Wisconsin v. Dean.

12               It also in the 1986 amendments set out

13   specific sources of information and directly identified

14   the type of public information that a qui tam action can

15   be based upon.   That list, of course, includes many

16   sources that might or might not be readily available to

17   the United States Government.              For example, it includes

18   reports by a news media.          A -- an obscure article in a

19   weekly publication of limited circulation does not

20   realistically put the government on notice of a

21   particular fraud.

22               The same can be true -- said with regard to

23   an action filed in Federal court, a private action

24   between civil litigants based upon diversity

25   jurisdiction.    If that -- if there is a summary judgment


                                         6

 1   motion filed in that case and there are a number of

 2   depositions, one of which might indicate fraud, that are

 3   filed in that summary judgment motion and the case

 4   settles, that -- there will never be -- that summary

 5   judgment motion wouldn't be reviewed by the Federal

 6   district court judge.        But still, there is no question

 7   that the filing of that document with the Federal court

 8   would constitute a public disclosure under the first

 9   clause of the public disclosure bar.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It would be a -- would it

11   be a civil hearing?      A deposition -- you would consider

12   a deposition to be a civil hearing?

13              MR. BROWNING:            Your Honor, I am referring to

14   a deposition that is actually filed with the court in

15   connection with the summary judgment motion and the case

16   then settles.   Generally, the -- the courts have --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:               What -- what provision

18   would it come under?

19              MR. BROWNING:            Justice Scalia, the phrase

20   "criminal, civil, or administrative hearing."              The

21   courts have consistently read that word "hearing" as --

22   as including all courts' proceedings, not simply the

23   hearing itself, documents that are filed with the

24   clerk's office --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Documents are -- documents

 1   are a hearing?

 2               MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, the -- if

 3   Congress had meant to limit that word "hearing" to

 4   literally in-person oral arguments or in-person

 5   testimony, it -- the result would be that a criminal

 6   indictment could be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an

 7   action brought based upon that.

 8               That, of course, was this Court's decision

 9   in United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess.              The -- it is

10   clear from the congressional history that Congress

11   wanted to change that result by -- so Congress used the

12   word "hearing" that obviously meant more than -- than

13   simply --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Meant more than hearing?

15               MR. BROWNING:        Yes, Your Honor, and that's

16   the part of the problem, is --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's an argument that

18   doesn't go very far with me.           I mean, "hearing" means

19   hearing.

20               MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, the -- the

21   problem is -- is that Congress really did not speak very

22   clearly at all with respect to the False Claims Act, and

23   so we're -- we're left with this mess of trying to

24   figure out exactly what Congress intended.

25               The phrase --

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          In your view, must an

 2   administrative report be a report that is generated by

 3   some government unit?      Could it be a report by the

 4   administration of a university, for example?

 5               MR. BROWNING:         Justice Alito, the

 6   Petitioners would not read that phrase as -- that

 7   broadly.   When the Congress has used the word

 8   "administrative hearing," that would appear to indicate

 9   action by the government.

10               And, under any of the dictionary definitions

11   of "administration," clearly a State administrative

12   proceeding, a State administrative report, would fall

13   within the scope of the dictionary definition.          We don't

14   believe the Court needs to read that language as

15   including private hospitals, private universities.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          But I'm not sure why.

17   You -- if -- unless "administrative" is informed by the

18   other adjectives in that prepositional phrase, "in a

19   congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting

20   Office," presumably GAO, "report," it -- unless that is

21   the -- you know, unless it's informed by those other

22   references, and that's why it has to be governmental,

23   I'm not sure how you limit "administrative" to

24   governmental reports.

25               MR. BROWNING:         Well, Your Honor, the public


                                       9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   disclosure bar uses the phrase "administrative hearing"

 2   twice, and it's referring to Black's Law Dictionary.                  It

 3   defines "administrative hearing" as, essentially, a

 4   hearing conducted by an administrative agency.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            When you say "twice," you

 6   mean in the first clause that says "in a criminal,

 7   civil, or administrative hearing"?

 8                MR. BROWNING:         Yes, Your Honor.       And then in

 9   the second clause it proceeds to use the phrase

10   "congressional, administrative, Government Accounting

11   Office hearing, audit, investigation, or report."

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But there is a redundancy

13   there if the statute means what you say it does; it says

14   "administrative hearing" in both the first clause and

15   the second clause.

16                MR. BROWNING:         Yes, Your Honor, there is a

17   redundancy based upon Petitioner's construction of the

18   statute.    But Congress was not particularly concerned

19   about redundancy in the False Claims Act.               For example,

20   again it uses the phrase "congressional, administrative,

21   or GAO."

22                GAO, of course, is a body that reports to

23   Congress.    Its head is appointed by the President.             So

24   under any definition GAO would either be congressional

25   or administrative, so there is a redundancy there.

 1   There's also --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I think there would

 3   be a good lawsuit as to whether "congressional report"

 4   includes a GAO report.        I think that's a lawsuit.        I

 5   don't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.

 6               MR. BROWNING:          Well, Justice Scalia, let me

 7   also point out that there is a redundancy in connection

 8   with the use of "audit, report, or investigation."

 9   Essentially, Congress is using the same word to mean

10   essentially the same thing in that clause as well.

11               But yes, our reading does result in a

12   redundancy in the statute.           Of course, the government

13   reads this entire clause as being limited to Federal

14   proceedings.   They would urge a redundancy in the

15   statute as well.   But what's more important is this

16   Court has consistently said that it will not read the

17   same phrase as having a different meaning in the same

18   sentence.

19               Yes, Congress has created a redundancy, but

20   that is no more egregious than the fact that it used the

21   phrase "Government Accounting Office" to refer to what

22   was clearly the General Accounting Office.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, well, that argument

24   does not scare the government.              I think the government

25   would like to read "administrative hearing" in the


                                       11

 1   first -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federal

 2   administrative hearing as well.

 3                MR. BROWNING:        Yes, Justice Scalia.          That is

 4   their argument today.      Of course, just 11 months ago in

 5   United States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic, the

 6   government argued in the Sixth Circuit that a qui tam

 7   action should be dismissed based upon a State court

 8   complaint.   They convinced the Sixth Circuit to accept

 9   that position and dismissed that complaint on January 14

10   of this year.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:          And that was on -- on the

12   basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the

13   second?

14                MR. BROWNING:        Yes, Your Honor, based upon

15   the first clause of the statute.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Is this particular audit

17   report we are talking about, this is the audit report

18   was done by an independent accountant?                 Is that --

19                MR. BROWNING:        Yes, Your Honor.          There are

20   two audit reports -- I'm sorry, there are two reports.

21   The key one is the report that identifies or asserts

22   that this work at issue should have been sent out by

23   bid.   That was prepared by an accounting firm for Graham

24   County, North Carolina, the same auditor that was

25   engaged by the county to comply with the Single Audit

 1   Act --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that -- is that audit

 3   on file with the Department of Agriculture?

 4                MR. BROWNING:          Your Honor, I would have to

 5   go beyond the record, but yes, we have conducted a --

 6   submitted a Public Information Act request, and

 7   essentially a week after the document was transmitted to

 8   Graham County it was transmitted to the United States

 9   Department of Agriculture.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            The arguments in this case,

11   my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I

12   can remember, really.         For each one, there is a

13   counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air.

14                So if -- since we have to decide it, it

15   should -- should I take this into account:              That if the

16   Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that

17   there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards

18   at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have

19   them.    No question.      They front-run the government.

20   They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in

21   the newspaper.

22                But if you are right, then they are going to

23   have to assign people to look at these obscure

24   administrative reports that didn't even get in the

25   newspaper.    So they want to do that, they don't have

 1   people to do it, and they say these people are

 2   performing a service of sorts by reading them, the

 3   reports, for them and telling them about it.            And there

 4   it is, balanced.

 5                 But they are the ones who suffer.          You see,

 6   they suffer both ways.        They suffer if people don't tell

 7   them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting

 8   unjustified rewards because the money comes from the

 9   Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent.            So if

10   they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special

11   attention to their views as to how the balance works

12   out?

13                 MR. BROWNING:        Well, Your Honor, Justice

14   Breyer, first of all, the government hasn't been

15   consistent.    As we pointed out in United States ex rel.

16   Poteet, they have taken the exact opposite position with

17   regard to clause 1 in the first circuit.

18                 But the real issue here and what should

19   concern the Court is the fact that there will be a

20   tremendous number of opportunistic qui tam plaintiffs

21   that arise.    If someone can simply go to an ongoing

22   State or local government investigation, copy it, and

23   bring it --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:          As you can tell, I have

25   taken that point in.

 1              MR. BROWNING:         Yes.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:           So my question wasn't that.

 3   My question was, Should I or should I not give them a

 4   little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the

 5   ones who know it best, that they are the victims?

 6              MR. BROWNING:         Well, I would suggest that

 7   the weight that should be given is to the partners of

 8   the Federal government, States and local governments

 9   that are in the trenches administering these programs,

10   that will have tremendous difficulty if there is a rash

11   of qui tam actions that are brought that disrupt ongoing

12   Medicaid and other investigations.

13              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How will that happen?

14   Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation

15   is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal

16   or State law to require the disclose of ongoing

17   investigative materials?

18              I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied

19   them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never

20   permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information

21   Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of

22   ongoing investigative material.             So I am a little bit

23   confused by how that would happen.

24              MR. BROWNING:         Justice Sotomayor, there are

25   going to be some exceptions to many States' Public

 1   Information Act requests, things such as attorney-client

 2   communications, in some cases criminal investigations.

 3   But for most States there will not be any sort of

 4   prohibition against a plaintiff's attorney filing a

 5   Public Information Act request saying, print out -- give

 6   us a copy of all printouts that show disparities and

 7   irregularities with regard to Medicaid billings.

 8               Moreover, most States are -- by law are

 9   required to receive complaints concerning the State's

10   Medicaid program.     Those are generally processed by the

11   State's system integrity program.                  And those reports are

12   going to be readily available to Public Information Act

13   requests.

14               Essentially, what this Court should be

15   worried about are State employees who know where the

16   documents can be located.           You can simply copy the

17   document, bring a qui tam action, and produce a windfall

18   for yourself, potentially disrupting the State

19   investigation.   And if Congress really wanted to do

20   that, if they wanted to create this rash of ill-advised

21   qui tam actions, this flood that's about to fall upon

22   the States, Congress should have written a little bit

23   more clearly before doing so.              It isn't consistent with

24   the language of the statute or with congressional

25   intent.

 1              Throughout the legislative history it is

 2   clear that what Congress was intending to do was to have

 3   access to true insiders, the whistleblowers, to obtain

 4   information that would be confidential, that would not

 5   otherwise be available to the Federal Government.

 6              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But Congress obviously

 7   wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was

 8   the one that you are announcing then it should have just

 9   permitted original sources to sue.                But that's not the

10   choice it made.   It broadened the scope of qui tam

11   actions to include more sources or more reward for

12   individuals who don't have original information.

13              MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Your Honor, it -- it

14   added the original source provision, and it identified

15   certainly sources of information and said, you cannot

16   bring an action based upon those specific sources.

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I --

18              MR. BROWNING:          Those include --

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this question:

20   Is the fact that they've included the news media

21   consistent with your view?

22              MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Your Honor.

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             That seems to be a much

24   more open source of information than you're raising.

25              MR. BROWNING:          Exactly.             The government

 1   argues that the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal,

 2   the public disclosure bar should therefore be read as

 3   exclusively Federal.     But the existence of this category

 4   of news media indicates that Congress did not intend the

 5   public disclosure bar to be exclusively Federal sources.

 6              There -- there -- under the government's

 7   theory that all of this fall -- the entire public

 8   disclosure bar should be read as limited to Federal

 9   sources, the only news media that would be able to -- to

10   fall within the scope of the public disclosure bar would

11   be the Voice of America, which is the only Federal news

12   media currently in existence, to my knowledge.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Stars and Stripes, maybe.

14              MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Your Honor.         Thank you,

15   Justice Scalia.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but that's not

17   terribly persuasive.     In the statute there are separate

18   provisions, they talk about disclosures "in criminal,

19   civil or administrative hearings," "in a congressional

20   administrative or Government Accounting Office report,

21   or from the news media."        Simply because you want to

22   limit "administrative" or not limit "administrative"

23   does not mean that the other side's view requires news

24   media to be modified by "Federal."

25              MR. BROWNING:          Mr. Chief Justice, two points


                                      18
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   I would like to make in response is:                   First, these

 2   clauses -- and there are three clauses, the first one

 3   beginning with "in" and the third one beginning with

 4   "from" -- they do not serve different purposes.                   Rather,

 5   they serve to identify the sources that Congress did not

 6   want to give rise to a qui tam action.                   So this list has

 7   to be read as a whole.

 8               The second point I would like to make is

 9   throughout --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:           We should stop calling them

11   clauses.   They are really phrases.

12               MR. BROWNING:         Yes, Your Honor.

13               With respect to these three phrases, the --

14   throughout the legislative history, the year and a half

15   that the False Claims Act was being debated, there were

16   only two clauses that began with --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Phrases.

18               MR. BROWNING:         -- the preposition "in" --

19   phrases.

20               (Laughter.)

21               MR. BROWNING:         -- that began with the

22   preposition "in" and then "from" in connection with

23   "news media."   It was only on October 3, 1986, that

24   the -- when it was -- the provision was finally enacted

25   by the Senate, that this second "in" was added before


                                      19

 1   the second clause.

 2                So, Congress undoubtedly did not intend to

 3   make this 11th-hour change and have some substantive

 4   change to the statute.       Rather, it should best be read

 5   as a last-minute insert to make the clause, the three

 6   clauses as a whole, read and flow much better than they

 7   did prior to that time.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you tell me just as a

 9   practical matter, suppose -- suppose the county says,

10   you know, we found out that we were defrauded by this

11   contractor, and it sues the contractor.                But its suit

12   doesn't cover really all of the damages, only half of

13   it.   Can a qui tam action then be commenced for the

14   portion that the county isn't seeking?                 I mean, how does

15   that work?

16                MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, if there has been

17   a public disclosure --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Which there would be if

19   there's a complaint filed by the county --

20                MR. BROWNING:        Yes.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- against the contractor.

22                MR. BROWNING:        Essentially what the lower

23   courts have done is they would allowed a qui tam action

24   to go with regard to a completely different claim.                But

25   if it were simply the fact that the public disclosure


                                      20
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   covered a portion of the time period but not all of

 2   it --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Depends on the identity of

 4   the claim?

 5                 MR. BROWNING:        Yes.       Yes.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And -- and suppose in

 7   their race to the courthouse, the qui tam plaintiff

 8   files on Monday and the county files on Tuesday?

 9                 MR. BROWNING:        Under -- under that scenario,

10   if the qui tam action is filed before the public

11   disclosure, then the qui tam action would not be bourne.

12   -

13                 If there are no further questions, I'd

14   like --

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I, just one -- one

16   quick question.    I -- I -- I just want to be sure I

17   understood.    Do you draw any distinction between the

18   preposition "in" and the preposition "from"?

19                 MR. BROWNING:        No, Your Honor.      I think it

20   is -- as Justice Alito pointed out when he served on the

21   Third Circuit, that some of these prepositions are very

22   awkward indeed.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Part of the random nature

24   of the whole provision, right?

25                 MR. BROWNING:        Yes, Justice Scalia.

 5                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. HURT

 6                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 7              MR. HURT:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9              The decision of the Fourth Circuit is

10   correct because the text of the False Claims Act compels

11   the result, and the purpose -- and also the purposes of

12   the 1986 amendments to the Act.                As the Fourth Circuit

13   noted, Congress grouped the disclosure sources in

14   paragraph (a) of the public disclosure bar into three

15   distinct categories.       In CATEGORY 2, the term

16   "administrative" which is at issue here is sandwiched

17   between the terms "congressional" --

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Let's begin at the

19   beginning, and that is with the first phrase with the,

20   what is it, "civil, criminal, administrative hearing."

21   Do you as the government -- do you agree with the

22   government that you have to insert "Federal" there, too?

23   Or does that phrase --

24              MR. HURT:         No.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- include States?

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MR. HURT:      No, the -- the text of category 2

 2   compels the result here, although we do believe that the

 3   better view of category 1 is that it is also Federal as

 4   well, and the context -- the overall context --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Suppose -- suppose it

 6   isn't?    Suppose the general "civil, criminal,

 7   administrative" is read to mean -- include State.                 Why

 8   shouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin

 9   phrases, be read in pari materia?

10                 MR. HURT:      Because each of those categories

11   is distinct, not only grammatically, but as far as

12   function.     The first category is clearly adjudicative in

13   nature.     The second is non-adjudicative.              And the third

14   category is -- is news media and stands on its own.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why -- why should we read

16   the second category back to alter the meaning of the

17   first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to

18   alter the meaning of the second?                 It -- it is absolutely

19   clear when you read this, "in a criminal, civil, or

20   administrative hearing"; there is no limitation to

21   Federal on that.     And you acknowledge that the criminal

22   and civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal

23   proceedings, right?       So when you read that phrase,

24   "administrative" simply means, obviously means State

25   administrative.


                                        23
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               Now, why shouldn't I read that forward and

 2   say, well, since it means State there, it must mean

 3   State in the next one, in a congressional,

 4   administrative, or GAO report.

 5               MR. HURT:      The argument for category 2 is

 6   less compelling, we agree.          The argument for category 1

 7   is most compelling because these categories are distinct

 8   and should be looked at as separate units for that

 9   purpose.   You have category 2 as non-adjudicative, and

10   category 1 is adjudicative.           And so you have -- you have

11   distinction there.

12               If you were looking at the three categories

13   and, for instance, you don't say category 3 and say

14   category 3 is nongovernmental, so therefore we should

15   construe category 2 to include private administrative

16   reports.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           The question is, what sense

18   does that make?   I mean -- and I thought you said that

19   the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil

20   or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does

21   not apply to State proceedings in your view.           You said

22   that was the better view.

23               MR. HURT:      Yes.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:           What's the state of the law

25   on that?   I thought it was virtually -- what is the

 1   state of the law?

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You say that just as to

 3   administrative.     Don't you acknowledge that the criminal

 4   and civil apply to State criminal and civil?

 5               MR. HURT:        No.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You want the whole thing to

 7   be just Federal?

 8               MR. HURT:        No, we think the better view is

 9   that the whole category is --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             The whole category?

11               MR. HURT:        -- exclusively Federal.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:             I think you'd have to say

13   that.   But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?

14               MR. HURT:        The -- the court of appeals have

15   basically gone the other way, but they have looked at it

16   in a very superficial matter and have not really

17   directly addressed the issue.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:             What are we supposed to do?

19   I mean, to me it makes no sense.                 We are only talking

20   about things that don't get into the newspapers.                 So --

21   and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of

22   this would be, look, we don't have people to go send

23   around to every -- read every State report.                 We just

24   don't have that personnel.            So we rely on these

25   whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified.                   I

 1   would think the same thing would be absolutely true of

 2   State criminal proceedings that don't get into the

 3   newspaper.   There are probably 50 -- several

 4   thousands -- thousands and thousands.

 5                So how to read these differently is a

 6   problem for me.   And I think that's on your side of it.

 7   But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to

 8   me is the -- is the question here.

 9                MR. HURT:      Well, the False Claims Act in

10   sections, the pertinent sections 3729 and 3730, refers

11   to the Federal Government many times but never with the

12   modifier "Federal."      They do it through context.       And in

13   fact --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:          Is there any history, which

15   I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history

16   or anything else that you can point to, to me that's

17   important, showing that that first criminal hearing

18   means just Federal?

19                MR. HURT:      Yes, the -- the legislative

20   history shows throughout -- beginning with the House and

21   Senate bills and going forward that these -- the earlier

22   version shows these were exclusively Federal.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:          And they meant criminal

24   hearing.   Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal

25   hearing, not State.

 1              MR. HURT:        Exactly, and you have references

 2   --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            You say "exactly."     I was

 4   looking for the backup for that.

 5              MR. HURT:        Yes.      The legislative history is

 6   clear on that point, and in fact if you look at the

 7   Senate bill that was passed August 11, you have the

 8   final version of paragraph (A), and then you -- which

 9   was enacted in law, and paragraph (B) was somewhat

10   different, but it had the phrase "government or news

11   media," "disclosures to government or news media."              It's

12   clearly referencing back to paragraph (A) and

13   categorizing those sources as either sources of capital

14   "G" government, the Federal Government, or the news

15   media.

16              And the changes -- the subsequent changes to

17   paragraph (B) give no indication that Congress's

18   background understanding of that changed.              There is no

19   indication of that.      And of course you have the Senate

20   sponsors of the bill making the same statements that

21   this was clearly Federal.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why -- what was the

23   reason for that be, given that there are so many joint

24   Federal-State grant programs, like the one that's

25   involved here?   Why wouldn't a State report be as much

 1   of a public disclosure as a Federal report?              I mean, we

 2   are told that this particular report was filed with the

 3   U.S. Department of Agriculture.

 4              MR. HURT:      Because it gives no -- a report

 5   produced by a State or a local government -- and again,

 6   their argument is not just State but every little local

 7   entity producing these reports fall under the

 8   category 2, according to them.            Simply the fact that a

 9   local or State official might be producing this report

10   gives no indication that the Federal Government is

11   focusing on it or looking at it.              And in fact --

12              JUSTICE ALITO:          You think the Federal

13   Government is focusing on everything that is disclosed

14   in every civil proceeding that occurs in Federal court?

15              MR. HURT:      No, but Congress was selecting

16   general categories and as a general category the Federal

17   proceedings they thought were more likely to put the

18   government on notice --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:           News media, they are likely

20   to be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?

21              MR. HURT:      Well, I think that as a general

22   category it was reasonable for Congress to assume that

23   the news media disclosures would be disseminated in

24   general to the general public and would put pressure on

25   the government to take action, and the government would

 1   pay attention to that in general.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, they could have

 3   said "national news media."             It didn't say "national

 4   news media."   It said "news media."

 5               MR. HURT:        It said "news media."

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It includes a local radio

 7   station, a local community newspaper, right?             All of

 8   that is included.

 9               MR. HURT:        Congress was drawing the lines --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And yet, State proceedings,

11   which are excluded, right?

12               MR. HURT:        Yes.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Even state supreme court

14   cases and so forth.      It seems strange to me.

15               MR. HURT:        Well, under, under -- this Court

16   recognized in Cook County that the 1986 amendments

17   abolished the government knowledge rule and allowed the

18   qui tam relators to bring cases even where the

19   government, Federal Government, had possession of

20   information about the fraud.

21               What we are doing here is not even -- we are

22   not even sure the government has possession of these

23   reports.   A lot of these reports are just sitting in

24   file cabinets all around the country in these little

25   administrative office buildings.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Hurt, let me just give

 2   you what's really troubling me about this case.                      You

 3   have two citizens of a small town.                  One of them goes to

 4   the hearing and gets all this information, the other one

 5   doesn't go to the hearing and reads about it in the

 6   newspaper.     The latter is a permissible plaintiff, the

 7   former is not; is that correct?

 8                MR. HURT:       Correct.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Does that make any sense?

10                MR. HURT:       It does, because Congress drew

11   it -- picked it as a general category.                   They were

12   thinking probably most likely The New York Times or

13   newspapers that have actual investigative reporting

14   resources, and that was what they had in mind.

15                Here you have a whole --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That doesn't show that it

17   makes sense.    It just shows that Congress wasn't

18   thinking clearly.     There's as difference between the

19   two.

20                MR. HURT:       One of the huge problems with

21   Petitioners' position is it's going to sweep into

22   category 2 an enormous number of reports and audits that

23   the Federal Government is likely to never see, never

24   come across, and you need these concerned citizens to

25   go -- you want the citizens to go and look at these.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, are you

 2   sure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched

 3   between two Federal descriptions?                Are you sure

 4   "congressional" is limited to Federal Congress?                   The

 5   first definition in Black's Dictionary is "a formal

 6   meeting of delegates."       And I don't know -- maybe I

 7   should -- I don't know if all 50 States refer to their

 8   legislature by some term other than "Congress."

 9              MR. HURT:       The Petitioners have not pointed

10   to an example of a State congress.                I think it's

11   generally conceded that that would be Federal.                   And

12   also, when you look at GAO, that's clearly a Federal

13   entity there as well.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'd like to go back to

15   Justice Ginsburg's very first question.                   I want you to

16   assume that in category 1 it means State or Federal.

17   Maybe you disagree, maybe you don't.                   I want you to

18   assume that.   If we assume that, does it make any sense

19   to confine category 2 to Federal only?

20              MR. HURT:       Yes --

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And what's the

22   practical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I

23   want to know the practical rationale for that, the

24   practical reasons why that should make sense.

25              MR. HURT:       Because reports and audits are


                                      31
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   just a totally -- a category that is much -- many

 2   magnitudes greater than the number of criminal, civil,

 3   and administrative hearings.            You are going to have

 4   millions of documents all over this country in file

 5   cabinets that are generated by local and State

 6   governments that there is no possibility the vast

 7   majority of those would ever come across the attention

 8   of the Federal Government.          And so you want concerned

 9   citizens to be looking through, monitoring their local

10   governments, digging up these reports and bringing

11   lawsuits based on those.        The Federal Government's

12   simply not going to do it.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Which decision of ours do

14   you think would prompt Congress to go back and do this

15   right?   I mean, do you think that finding the way the

16   government wants us to find will produce a revision of

17   this really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do

18   you think that finding for the other side, giving the

19   government some incentive to get this fixed, would

20   likely produce a proper amendment?                What do you think?

21   I think the latter, to tell you the truth.

22               MR. HURT:      Well, unfortunately we have to

23   deal with the statute as it is.              And, you know, the --

24   our position uses all the clues in the statute to

25   construe it.   The other side construes it in a crude


                                      32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   manner and says, let's treat it like a laundry list,

 2   let's not use any of the grammatical clues in construing

 3   this language, and also let's construe it in a way that

 4   ignores what Congress did in 1986, which was to abolish

 5   the government knowledge part.             This is a reimposition

 6   of that bar.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          Suppose that the second

 8   phrase said "in a congressional, news media, or GAO

 9   report."   Would you read "news media" to be

10   governmental?

11               MR. HURT:      No, I would not.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:          What's the difference

13   between that and the way it's phrased now?

14               MR. HURT:      Because it is -- Congress did put

15   it in a separate category, so --

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          No, no.            Right now we have

17   "in a congressional, administrative, or Government

18   Accounting Office report."          And you say you have to read

19   "administrative" in light of "congressional" and "GAO."

20   But what if it said "in a congressional, news media, or

21   Government Accounting Office report"?

22               MR. HURT:      I think that --

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          Why wouldn't you make the

24   same argument with relation to "news media"?

25               MR. HURT:      I think the contextual clues


                                      33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would be less compelling there in that situation, and

 2   you would have --

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Why is that?

 4                 MR. HURT:      Because you would have a category

 5   that would have a mixture of exclusively Federal and

 6   nonfederal.    Here you have a category that you can't

 7   construe consistently as exclusively Federal, given the

 8   contextual clues in there.            So as it is drafted now, if

 9   you look at all the clues you do have distinct

10   categories that can be construed each on its own merits.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This audit report is

12   required by Federal law, isn't it?

13                 MR. HURT:      Yes, as are many reports,

14   Medicaid reports by private recipients, today.                     This

15   report was only done because the local government was a

16   recipient of Federal money, no different from any

17   private recipient, a not-for-profit.                     So there was no

18   real distinction there.         It was not really a

19   governmental report, in the truest sense of the word, as

20   it should be construed or regarded for purposes of the

21   public disclosure bar.

22                 And that's -- that shows the real -- one of

23   the real problems of going down to the -- to the local

24   and State level.    You get all of these problems where

25   the recipient is generating the reports rather than the


                                        34
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   -- the administrator versus the recipient.                     You get all

 2   those problems going down to this level, the local and

 3   State governments, and it shows the real problem with

 4   that.

 5                Again, this is the -- the overall statute is

 6   Federal, it's to recover the Federal Government's money.

 7   The statute has a strict dichotomy between the Federal

 8   Government and everyone else.             If the States or local

 9   governments are going to be qui tam relators, they bring

10   it as a private person.        Thank you.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

13           ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,

14           ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15                    SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

16                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Mr. Chief Justice,

17   and may it please the Court:

18                As I think the discussion this morning

19   illustrates, the Federal nature of the second category,

20   the phrase that is directly at issue in this case, is

21   self-evident from the text.            The terms congressional and

22   GAO are Federal and under the doctrine or canon of

23   construction noscitur a sociis --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let me go back to the

25   other Latin phrase.      If you begin at the beginning and


                                       35

 1   you begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say

 2   is modified by Federal, "civil, criminal or

 3   administrative proceeding," why shouldn't that drive the

 4   statute, what's in the first phrase?

 5               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Well, Your Honor, I

 6   -- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that

 7   that's a better interpretation of the first clause, but

 8   I will take it as the premise.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, it's a lot hard to

10   say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi --

11   means Federal civil, criminal and administrative

12   hearings.

13               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      It -- it may indeed

14   be harder to do that.        We think that it is warranted in

15   light of the policy that motivated Congress and in light

16   of other references to Federal administrative, civil and

17   criminal hearings in the statute.                  But even if those

18   reasons which we think justify limiting the first

19   category to Federal proceedings -- the Court were to

20   disagree with that, that would not justify disregarding

21   the clear indications of the Federal limitations on the

22   second clause.     And there is no policy --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well -- I didn't

24   mean to interrupt.     Clear limitations, you really have

25   only one, right?     I mean you have no argument construing

 3              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       Well, Your Honor, I

 4   think that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at

 5   the very beginning of the argument illustrated, the

 6   literal language of the word administrative would

 7   encompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or

 8   universities as well.        Now Petitioner es hewed that

 9   interpretation --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, we would just

11   -- we would just take the sections from your brief today

12   and say well no, you have got to read it in the context

13   in which it appears and this is all Federal, which means

14   it's all governmental.

15              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       That's -- that's

16   right, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular

17   nature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government.

18   As is the Court's decision in Cook County made clear,

19   municipal governmental entities are with respect to the

20   False Claims Act the same as private corporations.                      The

21   -- the Court recognized that municipalities are the

22   recipients of many Federal dollars.                      In that case the

23   local governmental entity whose conduct is at issue was

24   a county hospital.     And -- and county hospitals receive

25   funds under the same programs that private hospitals --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:           I just want to get your

 2   expertise on this, because you have probably read the

 3   legislative history of the 1986 amendment.                   All right,

 4   am I right in thinking this?           If I go back and read

 5   it -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this

 6   entire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or

 7   conference, does the word State appear in any relevant

 8   context?

 9              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No.

10              JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm not right.           Okay.   So

11   when it appears --

12              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, I guess it

13   depends on what you mean by the relevant context.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:           What I'm -- the relevant

15   context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in

16   respect to the first clause, "criminal, civil, or

17   administrative proceeding."          Is there any indication

18   that those were meant to apply -- any indication that

19   those were meant to apply to State as opposed to

20   uniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative

21   proceedings?

22              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No, Your Honor, it

 6                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                   Well, as we note,

 7   Your Honor, the statute uses the term "Government" with

 8   a capital G throughout to refer to the Federal

 9   Government.

14   congressional?

15                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                   Well, congressional

16   -- the -- the term congressional is frequently used

17   without a capital, but State legislatures are not

18   referred to as congresses.           And that is one of the

19   anomalies that petitioners simply cannot explain:                     why

20   Congress would have thought that an administrative

21   report issued by a local school board should give rise

22   to the bar, but a report or a hearing conducted by a

23   State legislature would not.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           There was an explanation

25   for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what

 1   was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was

 2   generating reports, audits, as distinguished from

 3   administrative agencies.

 4                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                   Well -- well, Your

 5   Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that

 6   programs are administered by the executive branch more

 7   than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to

 8   think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if

 9   those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with

10   respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public

11   disclosure.    The reason that Congress didn't include

12   State legislative reports is because it didn't include

13   State reports at all.       It was --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well that -- that doesn't

15   follow like the night the day.              It could be, as it was

16   explained, they didn't include State legislatures

17   because they didn't think they would be generating

18   relevant material.

19                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                   Well, Your Honor, I

20   -- I think that it is more likely as -- as the

21   development and progress of the clause reflects, that

22   Congress was focused on what does the government know

23   and what does the disclosure show about the whether the

24   government is already or is likely to focus on the

25   fraud.

 2   seeking to get this -- this piece of -- of statutory

 3   text clarified?    I mean, you do have some operation over

 4   there that proposes to Congress amendments of those

 5   provisions that are not working out well.                     Is there --

 6   is there any effort to get this clarified?

 7               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     There -- I -- there

 8   are currently under consideration bills or, and as I

 9   understand it, they are not, there are other bills that

10   are in contemplation that would revise the language of

11   the statute, but -- but would not necessarily focus on

12   this.   There are a number of other issues connected --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Could it make it worse?

14               (Laughter.)

16   But of course --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I think the question was

18   has the Department of Justice, recognizing that there's

19   a circuit split this very question recommended that

20   Congress amend the statute in this particular --

21               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     I -- I don't

22   believe that as of yet the department has taken a

23   specific position on -- on the legislation that is

24   contemplated in this particular ambiguity.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            There is one ambiguity

 1   whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and

 2   second refers to State as well as Federal.                      If the

 3   debate took place in a context where everyone's just

 4   thinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put

 5   in the word Federal.       They don't think of everything.

 6   All right.    Now, that's my question.

 7                 You started with the House.                    The House to me

 8   does think just of Federal.             The Senate's ambiguous on

 9   that point --

10                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    The Senate --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- and the conference is

12   yet more ambiguous on that point.                  So is there

13   anything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate

14   versions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they

15   did actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's

16   sort of mixed up?     Or am I going to see that that

17   context there is Federal?

18                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    The context is --

19   is Federal.    References to States in connection with the

20   act that Congress has thought about it are treating

21   States like other private qui tam relators.

22                 They Petitioner referred to the Dean case,

23   and, in fact, that was something that the -- the

24   legislative history refers to, but what was offensive

25   about the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin


                                        43

 1   had been the original source of the information, but had

 2   been barred because it had provided that information to

 3   the government.

 4              And, under the government knowledge bar,

 5   they had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have

 6   been taken care of under the original source provision,

 7   but it doesn't reflect a view that States have a

 8   particular distinctive role.

 9              In fact, as this Court's decision in Cook

10   County reflects, municipalities are treated just like

11   any private corporation for purposes of the act.                    They

12   can be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam

13   relators, but there is no reason to construe the statute

14   in a way that would allow a local government,

15   technically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by

16   disclosing the facts that would be the underlying

17   information support of the fraud claim in, perhaps, a

18   report that was intended to -- to whitewash the

19   situation --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do you think that the --

21   when a -- when State employees want to immunize

22   themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we

23   will disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick

24   it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.

25              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Well, Your Honor, I

 1   think it's important to note that, in order to be a

 2   public disclosure -- the second category at the very

 3   least -- all that needs to have happened is that

 4   information be disclosed to -- to one additional person.

 5                 That -- and that makes a lot of sense when

 6   we are talking about disclosures of the government --

 7   Federal government's own reports because, if the Federal

 8   government is already investigating and pursuing the

 9   fraud, one other person that finds out about it and then

10   files a qui tam action on the basis of the government's

11   own effort is precisely the situation that Congress

12   sought to preclude.

13                 But it doesn't make any senses when we are

14   talking about a disclosure to an individual by a State

15   or local --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But there's lots of

17   disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal

18   reports that the government isn't pursuing.

19                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                   Well, we think that

20   the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types

21   of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced

22   in the clause are the type that would evidence that the

23   government is pursuing them.

24                 And -- but where a State -- perhaps a local

25   school board discloses facts that might give rise to an


                                       45

 1   allegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only

 2   one or two members of the public in attendance, there is

 3   no reason to think that that information is going to be

 4   brought to the Federal government's attention.

 5                 The purpose of the bar is to balance --

 6   Congress was seeking to balance two rules.                     One is to

 7   encourage qui tam relators to bring information and

 8   bring suit where the information was unlikely to be

 9   something that the government -- Federal government was

10   focusing on.

11                 Where the Federal government was able to

12   protect itself and bring this suit on its own, then

13   there's no reason for the Federal government to have to

14   share its recovery.

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But why can't it -- why

16   can't it protect itself if these reports are in its

17   possession?    How are they any more in the -- or less in

18   the government's possession than articles in the news

19   media, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative

20   hearings?

21                 You, yourself, make it very clear that the

22   government -- it isn't keeping track of all of those

23   other sources.

24                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                   Well, Your Honor,

25   Petitioners' reference to this audit being in the


                                       46
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   possession of the government -- it's happenstance that

 2   this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was

 3   sent to the Federal government official.

 4              But the vast majority of State and local

 5   governmental investigations, audits, and reports, are

 6   not going to be given to the Federal government, and

 7   even though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act,

 8   which is only a very narrow subset of audits that States

 9   or local governments perform -- do not actually disclose

10   the allegations of the fraud.

11              In order to get to the actual information of

12   the fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be

13   brought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency.

14   Usually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the

15   most money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a

16   different Federal program, so it has to be brought to

17   the attention of the program whose interests are

18   actually at stake.

19              They have to go beyond the report that is --

20   that is publicly available in the clearinghouse website,

21   which tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying

22   report which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all

23   Petitioners say is that the working papers of the

24   auditor are available to the government, not even in the

25   government's possession, they are available to the


                                     47

 1   government if it requests it.

 2              The government has to drill down many levels

 3   before it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.

 4              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Isn't that argument

 5   suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this

 6   issue, even assuming that the State administrative

 7   reports are included in the bar?

 8              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     No -- no, Your

 9   Honor, I don't think so.

10              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Well, aren't you arguing

11   that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to

12   show the fraud?   That's not your argument?

13              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     No -- again, this

14   report here did have information that was indicative of

15   fraud, and this report --

16              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              In which way?

17              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Excuse me?

18              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Which way?         All it said

19   was that this person wasn't chosen by bidding.                      But

20   aren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?

21              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     There -- there were

22   multiple allegations.      One of the allegations underlying

23   the relator's claim is that the government -- the county

24   certified that certain procedures were followed that

25   would have included a requirement that it be bid out,

 1   and that it was not.

 2              Another was that certain work was paid for

 3   or billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed

 4   well, so there were -- there were different allegations,

 5   and where that would be disclosed to a single person,

 6   that would constitute a public disclosure, at least with

 7   respect to Federal --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course, the Attorney

 9   General can always bring suit, right?                     I mean, all we

10   are arguing about is whether this information that is in

11   the in the State and local thing could be the basis of a

12   qui tam suit.

13              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      But only if we --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             If the government finds out

15   about it, the Attorney General could always bring suit,

16   right?

17              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      And what is at

18   issue here is whether the Federal government is ever

19   going to learn of the fraud.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

21              Mr. Browning, you have six minutes.

 1   your comments or your questions about legislative

 2   history; here, I think the legislative history tells us

 3   very little because of the many changes in the Senate

 4   version and the House version, and unfortunately, there

 5   was not a conference committee report, so we won't know

 6   the nature of the compromise.

 7               At most, the legislative history helps us to

 8   show what Congress was generally concerned about, and

 9   throughout the original committee, the Senate and House

10   report, there is a concern about qui tam actions based

11   upon public information.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, I agree with you about

13   that.   I think it's the silence, though, that might cut

14   against you.

15               MR. BROWNING:         Well --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:           And the reason that it's --

17   it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that

18   cuts against you is because of this sorting of the

19   context where they are focusing on Federal.

20               And, if everybody is working in that

21   context, then nothing said about State means they are

22   just assuming it's all applying to Federal.

23               Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able

24   to put your finger on, is something that shows that my

25   last statement is not right.

 1                MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Justice Breyer, that the

 2   government assumes and repeats throughout its brief that

 3   the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal in nature;

 4   therefore, you read all of its terms as essentially

 5   being -- being Federal.

 6                That, of course, does not answer what

 7   Congress intended with the public disclosure bar --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            When we say everybody's

 9   working in a certain context, how -- how many people is

10   everybody?     What percentage of the House and of the

11   Senate were involved in these committees that were

12   drafting these bills and that issued the committee

13   report?

14                MR. BROWNING:          Yes, Justice Scalia, your

15   point is well-taken, that this would only be --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:            I think in the -- it was --

17   it probably came out in governmental affairs in the

18   Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time.

19                MR. BROWNING:          Yes.

20                Continuing with your -- your question, if I

21   could, Justice Breyer, that there is nothing to indicate

22   that the public disclosure bar should be exclusively

23   Federal.

24                It, of course, includes news media, which is

25   not Federal.     It also includes criminal, civil, or


                                        51
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   administrative hearings.        But moreover, there are many

 2   aspects of the False Claims Act that are not exclusively

 3   Federal in nature.

 4               The very change that we are talking about --

 5   the -- the change to the public disclosure bar was a

 6   result of a push by the National Association of Attorney

 7   Generals to actually change the public disclosure bar to

 8   make sure that States could bring qui tam actions.

 9               That is why the public disclosure bar

10   includes an original source provision.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 To -- to follow up,

12   I think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked

13   earlier.   Do you have any tie-breaker on your side?

14               I mean, if we do decide the arguments are

15   pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the

16   Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser

17   in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a

18   percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them

19   strike the balance.

20               What argument do you have on your side?

21               MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, again, that our

22   concern from the perspective of the States -- and it's a

23   concern shared by local governments -- is the reading

24   that Respondents advocate will produce a flood of qui

25   tam --


                                      52

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's the same --

 2   that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced

 3   on the other side.     For example, is -- do -- have we

 4   ever said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course,

 5   with a private Attorney General and all that.

 6                Have we -- does -- is there any authority

 7   for the idea that we should read it restrictively

 8   because of that?

 9                MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, it does give rise

10   to a -- a false claim will, of course, give rise to

11   criminal liability.      Moreover, it is a case dealing

12   with --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Have we ever -- have

14   we ever said that that's a basis for reading the act

15   restrictively?

16                MR. BROWNING:         Your Honor, there is some

17   older authority to that affect.               The specific case -- I

18   apologize.   The name escapes me.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But what your claim is --

20   is that the government -- the Federal government is not

21   the only person harmed?

22                MR. BROWNING:         Yes.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And, therefore -- you know,

24   we should listen to them, so long as they don't -- they

25   want to come out this way, you are saying the State and


                                       53
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   local governments --

 2              MR. BROWNING:         Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- are significantly

 4   harmed.

 5              MR. BROWNING:         We are -- we are partners --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Which the Federal

 7   government doesn't care about, right?

 8              MR. BROWNING:         The Federal government has, I

 9   think, taken a very short-sighted view because these

10   sort of qui tam actions will be very disruptive to what

11   the Federal government's partners are actually doing in

12   the trenches in administering these programs.

13              Moreover, the Federal False Claims Act -- it

14   is clear that it is not exclusively Federal.          When it

15   was amended in 1986, Congress changed Section 3732(b),

16   which allowed pendent State claims to be brought, so a

17   State, if there is a Federal false claims action, could

18   intervene to protect the State's portions of the -- the

19   monies that are at issue.

20              Moreover, in Section 3733(l)(7)(A), the

21   civil investigative demand provisions, Congress

22   expressly viewed the word "administrative" to include,

23   not only Federal administrative proceedings, but State

24   administrative proceedings as well.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:           So your point here is -- I


                                     54
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   will put it in cash terms, is the Federal government,

 2   who will pay a lot of qui tam lawyers some percent to go

 3   and look through all these State criminal hearings and

 4   State reports and all these things that didn't get into

 5   the newspaper and to bring cases, so it may be cheaper

 6   to pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that.

 7              Now, your point is that they get a little

 8   over-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions

 9   that maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the

10   Federal government is going to have to hire people to

11   sort those out anyway, and so would the States in that

12   kind of mess.

13              Is that your point?

14              MR. BROWNING:         Yes.       They will be very

15   enthusiastic if they can simply take a State report

16   showing Medicaid fraud and bring a qui tam action.               That

17   will be very disruptive to states and to local

18   governments.

19              Thank you, Your Honor.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.
