 7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. RHODES:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 The single issue presented in this case is

12   whether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to

13   a district court's discretionary decision to decline the

14   exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.                   In this case,

15   after the district court dismissed Respondent's federal

16   RICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining

17   state law claims under 1367(c).               That was not a remand

18   based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because

19   jurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court

20   by 1367(a).

21                 It's been the rule for some 30 years that

22   the bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds

23   set forth in 1447(c).       And for reference the statutes

24   are on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief.

25                 Those two grounds are a remand that's based


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand

 2   that is based upon any defect other than a lack of

 3   subject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely

 4   motion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of

 5   removal.   The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in

 6   this case is whether this remand is one that's based

 7   upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

 8               Now, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction

 9   on the district courts in 1367(a), where the case

10   contains a Federal claim and related State law claims,

11   and a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline

12   to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand

13   that's based upon the court's lack of subject matter

14   jurisdiction.

15               Jurisdiction either exists or it does not.

16   A district court's power to hear a case and its power to

17   decline to exercise jurisdiction are part and parcel of

18   the same thing.   Absent the power to hear a case, a

19   district court cannot decline to exercise that -- or

20   cannot exercise discretion to decline to exercise that

21   jurisdiction.

22               Now, in this Court's Osborn v. Haley case,

23   it made reference back to Carnegie-Mellon and also

24   United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that even if only State

25   law claims are remaining in the case after the Federal


                                        4

 1   claim has been resolved, the district court has

 2   discretion consistent with Article III to retain

 3   jurisdiction over that cause of action.

 4              Now, this is inconsistent with the Federal

 5   Circuit's analysis in this case that a remand based upon

 6   1367(c) is a remand based upon a lack of subject matter

 7   jurisdiction because in its view an independent basis

 8   for that jurisdiction is lacking.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Isn't there something odd

10   about saying if it's really fundamental like the

11   presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that

12   is not reviewable?      It's not disputed, right?            That if

13   the district court says, I lack subject matter

14   jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong

15   as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?

16              MR. RHODES:           Justice Ginsburg, I agree with

17   that, because if the court does say that I am remanding

18   this because, either rightly or wrongly, I lack subject

19   matter jurisdiction, then that would fall squarely

20   within 1447(c) and (d).

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Though that could be a

22   very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion,

23   that that would be reviewable.                And I appreciate your

24   statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that

25   Congress would want to be firm that if the remand is for


                                          5

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no

 2   review, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could

 3   keep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable.

 4              That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to

 5   say the judge could keep it or remand it, that that

 6   action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't

 7   have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have

 8   jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.

 9              MR. RHODES:        I agree with you, Justice

10   Ginsburg, that that seems rather confusing.               I would

11   address my answer in this way:             The review ban of

12   1447(d) arose in the situations where apparently

13   Congress wanted to -- to inhibit the abuse by those

14   seeking only to delay the case by filing a motion for

15   remand.

16              For example, a case that is filed in State

17   court that clearly expresses no Federal question or

18   diversity issue, yet the defendant, in order to delay

19   the case, will then remove it to Federal court.                In

20   those situations Congress wants to prevent those kinds

21   of frivolous removals to Federal court.

22              But here in, our particular case -- and

23   maybe -- let me back up a minute.               Maybe we should look

24   at that in a different way, because even though you may

25   have a legitimate basis for removing the case to Federal


                                       6

 1   court and the district court disagrees with you, perhaps

 2   the better policy is that those types of remands should

 3   not be reviewable, even though sometimes a district

 4   court is going to get them wrong.

 5              But in this particular case, there was a

 6   Federal RICO claim asserted against us in state court,

 7   and as a defendant we were not removing that case on

 8   some frivolous basis.     We were removing it because we

 9   were entitled to be in Federal court.

10              It was only after the district judge

11   dismissed the Federal RICO count --                    and there was no

12   motion for remand on this case filed by Respondents --

13   the district court sua sponte decided that he was not

14   going to exercise his power to hear this case because he

15   thought there were legitimate State law claims and he

16   remanded on that basis.       Now, that's a discretionary

17   remand and normally we would be arguing that where

18   discretion is exercised by a district court it should be

19   reviewable for an abuse of discretion.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But wouldn't it be --

21   here the district judge said:            I got rid of the RICO

22   claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's

23   no Federal interest in this case any more.                    They're all

24   State law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye.

25   I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a

 1   sound use of the resources of the Federal court.

 2               Now, even if you're right that this is a

 3   discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction

 4   because the discretion implies that there is power,

 5   isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals,

 6   assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the

 7   district judge about questions of this nature, the

 8   district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time

 9   of the Federal court?

10               MR. RHODES:        I'm not sure about the number

11   of percentage of cases that -- that there is going to be

12   a decision by the appellate court to say we shouldn't

13   interfere in that, Justice Ginsburg.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But wouldn't you -- as a

15   practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is

16   pending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction

17   over the State claim, but the district court is told by

18   Congress:   It's your call; it's a matter of discretion.

19   And the judge gives one of the reasons that's

20   enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are

21   overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed,

22   thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.

23               Why would a court of appeals overturn such a

24   judgment?

25               MR. RHODES:        I think, Justice Ginsburg, I

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   can give you an answer to that because there is a recent

 2   case that's in our brief, the Brookshire case from the

 3   Fifth Circuit, where the district court exercised

 4   jurisdiction over Federal and supplemental claims, and

 5   did that for quite a while and ruled on a number of

 6   dispositive motions; and then basically on the eve of

 7   trial, after resolving the Federal claim, remanded it

 8   back to the State court.

 9                The Fifth Circuit, because it had the

10   ability to review that, under the statutory

11   construction, was able to review that on the basis of an

12   abuse of discretion and said that the district court had

13   definitely abused its discretion.                After retaining

14   jurisdiction for that length of time and then returning

15   it to State court, that was a waste of judicial

16   resources.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that was because we

18   would have to retread the same ground in the State court

19   that had already been covered in the Federal court, but

20   that's not the kind of case that was presented here.                I

21   know the case has lingered for a long time, but there

22   was no processing of those State law claims.                The judge

23   concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said "the rest

24   of the claims I'm not interested in."

25                So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit


                                        9

 1   where there was a large investment of Federal court

 2   energy and time and sending it back would mean going

 3   over once again what had already transpired in the

 4   Federal court.

 5               MR. RHODES:       That is true.               This case is

 6   different because what the -- what the district court

 7   had labeled as legitimate State law claims as to, for

 8   example, inventorship, we argued are within the

 9   exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court, and that is

10   why we appealed to the Federal Circuit in order to have

11   that issue resolved.

12               Here, if we went back to State court we

13   would be in the position of having to argue that the

14   State court -- that the State court lacked jurisdiction

15   to hear that claim because it was something that was

16   within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.

17   It seems that in this particular situation it would be

18   better to have the Federal Circuit to pass upon the

19   exclusivity of the inventorship issue under the patent

20   laws rather than to have to go back to State court and

21   work back up through the State court system to have that

22   resolved.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could you explain why

24   that is a Federal question?           It's a dispute over the

25   ownership of this invention, right?                    So it's not a


                                      10
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question of the validity of a patent or infringement of

 2   a patent?   It's just the invention is like any res, and

 3   two parties are disputing about ownership.              Why is --

 4   why does that become a Federal case?

 5               MR. RHODES:        It became a Federal question

 6   because in our view it arose under the patent laws

 7   because when they filed their complaint, even though

 8   they couched it in terms of purely State law claims,

 9   they did allege that we had falsely claimed to be the

10   inventors; and the basis for that claim that we falsely

11   claimed to be the inventors was the oath and declaration

12   that was filed in connection with our patent

13   applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

14               So what they were raising was an issue with

15   respect to our ability to claim to be the inventors of

16   what we claimed in our U.S. patent application.

17   Therefore, since that falls squarely under our

18   entitlement to -- to inventorship, of what we claim to

19   be the inventors, under Article I, section 8, it seemed

20   to us that that clearly fell within the exclusive

21   jurisdiction of the Federal court.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I just ask one sort of

23   a preliminary question?        If we just applied the plain

24   language of 1447(d), then this case was properly

25   remanded; the remand order is not subject to review.                Is


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that correct?

 2              MR. RHODES:        Yes.       If we just read 1447(d)

 3   on its face, that's --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:            What really prevents us

 5   from reaching that decision in this case?              Because

 6   actually it's an open question because you were both

 7   arguing about it here and you certainly disagree.                Why

 8   couldn't we just simply say for this particular category

 9   of remand orders, we'll just apply the plain language of

10   1447(d)?

11              MR. RHODES:        That would be going against the

12   rule that was set out in Thermtron that 1447(d) was

13   limited to only the specified grounds of 1447(c), which

14   are lack of --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I understand it would be a

16   modification of the dicta in Thermtron, but why wouldn't

17   that be a simple solution to this case?

18              MR. RHODES:        I'm not sure that would be a

19   simple solution to this case, Justice Stevens, and the

20   reason for that is that if we -- if the Court decides to

21   do that, then we return to those areas where total chaos

22   could really break out, and the reason for that is that

23   we would be in a situation where district courts can --

24   can dress up in language that is lack of subject matter

25   jurisdiction and remand cases, knowing that there is not


                                      12

 1   going to be any review.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, no, that wouldn't

 3   avoid the plain language of the statute.                 Pretextual

 4   district court orders wouldn't avoid the plain language

 5   of the statute.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I think there's no

 8   need to dress up anything.         I mean, as Justice Stevens

 9   point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you

10   send it back, it's not reviewable.

11              MR. RHODES:         If we were to read 1447(d) just

12   plainly on its face without --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How could we do that in

14   light of Thermtron?     Thermtron went against the clear

15   text of the statute that says remands are not

16   reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes

17   they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a

18   district judge to say:       Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over

19   this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a --

20   this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court.

21   The court, I think, was outraged by a district court

22   thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was

23   too busy with more important things.

24              That was the setting of Thermtron, and to

25   reach the result that the court reached, the court had

 1   to go against the language of the statute when read in

 2   absolute terms.     But anyway, the court did that, and

 3   then they gave a rationale for what the new test was

 4   going to be.     It was no longer going to be remands are

 5   no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to

 6   be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was

 7   it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447?                      The -- it -- the

 8   court read the statute to say less than it in fact did.

 9   That's what Thermtron did.

10                 MR. RHODES:        That is the exact holding of

11   Thermtron, that they were not going to construe that so

12   woodenly to allow a district court to abdicate its

13   mandatory jurisdiction.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, "woodenly" is

15   a bit much.     I mean, they're going to read it not to say

16   what it says.     And Thermtron involved the court saying:

17   I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with

18   other things.     I mean, it could be limited to that

19   unusual situation, couldn't it?

20                 MR. RHODES:        Mr. Chief Justice, it could,

21   but --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And it would solve

23   the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that

24   this way you don't get to appeal big things like no

25   subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal

 1   picayune things.

 2                 MR. RHODES:        Again, I'm not sure how we

 3   would divide those up between big things and picayune

 4   things.     But I think, to answer your question, we have

 5   30 years of this particular rule under Thermtron being

 6   uniformly applied by all the circuit courts of appeal,

 7   and they have found this to be a workable, statutory

 8   interpretation to give them a framework to handle these

 9   kinds of cases.     And it's not a situation where the

10   circuit courts of appeal have run away from situations

11   like this, where remands have been based upon declining

12   to exercise discretionary power to send it back to State

13   court.    They have seemed to want to work within the

14   statutory framework to review those kinds of cases.

15                 And I think it would be a large departure to

16   go back and try to modify what all the circuit courts of

17   appeal, except for maybe the Federal Circuit, had

18   adopted as a workable framework in order to solve these

19   kinds of problems.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, one clear way to do

21   it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has

22   asked for that.    You haven't asked for it and the other

23   side hasn't asked for it.

24                 MR. RHODES:        That's correct, Justice

25   Ginsburg.

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:               You just have to

 2   distinguish Thermtron.         You don't have to overrule it.

 3   You'd still apply it on its facts.

 4              That's a very different problem.                    When the

 5   judge says, I'm too busy to hear this, I'm going to send

 6   it back to State court, that's what Thermtron resolved.

 7   Here --

 8              MR. RHODES:           And yet --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:               That's not involved here.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But your concern is what

11   was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the

12   Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:               You have to get rid of

14   Quackenbush, too, don't you?

15              MR. RHODES:           Yes, Quackenbush is a --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Throw that overboard, too?

17              MR. RHODES:           We would have to overthrow that

18   as well, and the reason for that is because Quackenbush

19   was a remand based upon -- an abstention-based remand

20   under Burford, and in that case, this Court found that

21   abstention-based remands did not fall within either

22   prong of 1447(c).     So -- in fact, this Court gave that

23   very little attention in Quackenbush before it moved on

24   to the 1291 issue.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You thought the

 1   Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron.                On page 22,

 2   you say, "Respondents' implicit request for this Court

 3   to overrule Thermtron should be rejected."

 4              MR. RHODES:        Yes, we did say that, and I'm

 5   not sure that they -- they expressly said you should

 6   overrule Thermtron, but the strong suggestion in their

 7   brief was perhaps you should.

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, isn't it -- isn't it

 9   also the case that Congress has amended the relevant

10   provisions of 1447 since Thermtron and they have not

11   seen fit to overrule or change those provisions?

12              MR. RHODES:        Given the fact that Congress

13   has twice amended 1447(c) after Thermtron, it seems that

14   they have actually ratified this Court's statutory

15   construction under Thermtron, and --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So this gets a lot

17   of attention across the street?             The reviewability of

18   remand orders gets --

19              (Laughter.)

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I mean, in one of

21   those provisions they said this was only technical

22   amendments, and if they're just doing technical

23   amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and

24   approve the whole thing.

25              MR. RHODES:        No, Mr. Chief Justice, if they

 1   wanted to get rid of Thermtron they could have done it

 2   in a very direct way.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, that's right, but

 4   what if we want to get rid of it?

 5              (Laughter.)

 6              MR. RHODES:         I can't suggest what the Court

 7   might finally decide other than to say that -- that,

 8   again, the circuit courts of appeal have uniformly

 9   applied this.   They seem to be --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, they don't

11   have a choice, right?      They can't say, I don't like the

12   Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other

13   than the Federal Circuit.

14              (Laughter.)

15              MR. RHODES:         Actually, Mr. Chief Justice,

16   that was going to be my next point.                     Not the Federal

17   Circuit -- but it does, again, provide a workable

18   framework for dealing with these issues, and it seems to

19   be a very large departure to go back and wipe out the

20   last 30 years of case law that has been developed to

21   handle these issues.      It would be a large departure.

22              If there's no other questions, I'll reserve

23   the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Let me just make one

25   comment on the large departure:              Would it be a large

 1   departure if we just said, in the very narrow category

 2   of cases where there has been a remand on the basis of

 3   -- the district judge doesn't want to exercise

 4   supplementary jurisdiction over State law claims, that's

 5   not appealable, period?        Just say that's a slight

 6   exception from Thermtron?

 7                MR. RHODES:       Well, Mr. Chief Justice --

 8   sorry -- Justice Stevens, that would be an exception

 9   under Thermtron that doesn't seem to be called for

10   because the way it's been interpreted, it has to be --

11   and the way even the amendments in '88 and again in '96

12   -- it's only barred if it's for a lack of subject matter

13   jurisdiction, and plainly here a discretionary remand --

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- not for that basis?

15   They're not amendments of subsection (d), and subsection

16   (d) is what has the language that really reads right on

17   this case.

18                MR. RHODES:       Well, I think the other -- the

19   other problem with that is the whole doctrine of -- of

20   supplemental jurisdiction that was first laid out in

21   Carnegie-Mellon and United Mine Workers, where the

22   difference between remands under 1367(c) seem not to

23   overlap with the remands under 1447(d) and 1441.            So if

24   we made that an exception and we pulled this into

25   1447(d), it -- I'm not sure what the consequences would

 4             ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE S. ALLISON

 5                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 6                 MR. ALLISON:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8                 Let me begin with Petitioner's counsel's

 9   last remark, and that is that we don't know what the

10   consequences would be, except that we do know that by

11   applying the review bar to supplemental jurisdiction

12   remands, it would bring us closer to achieving the

13   purpose that has been expressed in the statutes of

14   Congress since 1887.

15                 I know that the Court is familiar with the

16   late Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion when

17   he was an Associate Justice in the Thermtron case and

18   Justice Rehnquist at that time wrote that there had been

19   no cases since the review bar was put into place in

20   1887, no cases where exceptions to review had been

21   recognized.    He believed that it was a plenary bar on

22   review.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that was a dissenting

24   opinion, and that was how many years ago?                 How many

25   years?

 1               MR. ALLISON:         Justice Ginsburg, it -- it was

 2   a dissenting opinion, and it was in 1976, and we

 3   certainly would not cite it as authoritative except for

 4   our confidence in Justice Rehnquist's review of the law

 5   as it existed at that time.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you have a majority

 7   rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute

 8   terms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those

 9   based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject

10   matter jurisdiction.      So you can't say, well, Thermtron

11   had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own

12   unusual facts because the court gave a rationale.             I

13   mean, courts give reasons for what they do.             And the

14   court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d)

15   has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals

16   with only two kinds of remands, one for defective

17   removal and the other for lack of subject matter

18   jurisdiction.

19               MR. ALLISON:         That is correct, Justice

20   Ginsburg.   And, in fact, to harken to your earlier

21   question, to Your Honor's earlier question, we are not

22   asking for Thermtron to be overruled, but I think, in

23   effect, to be updated.

24               The Court in Thermtron did give a rationale,

25   and the rationale that it gave was that it viewed, the


                                       21
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   opinion for the Court by Justice White viewed 1447(c) as

 2   being the sole source of Federal remand power.                And as

 3   the Court noticed in the ensuing 30, 40 -- excuse me --

 4   yes, 40-odd years, there have been a number of other

 5   sources of remand power recognized.

 6              And we see no reason why the holding in

 7   Thermtron should not be overruled but be updated to

 8   recognize that the spirit of what the Court held in that

 9   case would be served and would be harmonized with the

10   review bar as it has existed lo these 120 odd-years,

11   would be served by expanding the -- excuse me,

12   contracting the reach of Thermtron so that it is not

13   simply 1447(c) remands, but any remand authorized by

14   statute.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       But no matter -- no

16   matter what adjective or what verb you use, that's

17   overruling a very clear rule of Thermtron.                And we

18   normally operate on a theory that when a conventional

19   statute is construed by this Court, it stays construed

20   until Congress changes it.

21              And I don't -- I don't see how you can

22   follow the line of reasoning that you're proposing, even

23   though you talk about updating and harmonizing, without

24   violating that basic stare decisis rule.

25              MR. ALLISON:         It's an essential question,


                                      22
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Justice Souter.   And I think the way we harmonize it is

 2   to say that Thermtron has indeed been pared back by the

 3   Court's subsequent decisions.               And, of course, it is our

 4   second argument that the Court do something with the

 5   rule in Thermtron.

 6                Our primary argument gets to the question of

 7   the statutory language and whether a Cohill remand falls

 8   within it.   But our secondary argument is to say,

 9   certainly, it's well recognized that Cohill disapproved

10   and pared down that portion of Thermtron that held that

11   the only remand power is the remand power expressed in

12   1447(c).

13                And a later case, in Quackenbush, the

14   question of whether mandamus or appeal was the

15   appropriate vehicle for challenging remand orders.              And

16   in that case, again, the Court said that we are

17   disavowing Thermtron's sweeping statement that mandamus

18   is the only vehicle for challenging a remand order.

19                JUSTICE SOUTER:             We did -- we did not

20   disavow the relationship between (c) and (d).

21                MR. ALLISON:          Indeed, the Court did not.

22   And we suggest again only -- it is only a suggestion in

23   our brief that the Court might wish to look at the

24   ensuing history since Thermtron and make a similar

25   limiting statement that recognizes that a lot of remand


                                         23

 1   authority has been established since Thermtron, and a

 2   number of statutes by the Court's -- by the Court's

 3   holding in Cohill.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What in addition to the

 5   civil rights provision?

 6                 MR. ALLISON:         Well, indeed in Things

 7   Remembered, the Court was considering whether a 1447's,

 8   comma -- whether 1447's review bar applied to a remand

 9   under 1452.    1452 is another statute that deals with

10   remands in the context of cases associated with

11   bankruptcy issues.      And in that case, there was a remand

12   for failing to follow a removal procedure, and the Court

13   held, citing Rice, United States versus Rice, based on

14   Congress's awareness of the universality of the review

15   ban.   That when another statute comes in place that

16   provides for remand, for the review bar applies whether

17   or not, of course --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Then that's a specific

19   statute that would prevail over the general provision.

20                 MR. ALLISON:         It's a little bit -- Justice

21   Ginsburg, it's a little bit different than the Court's

22   decision in Osborn, in which the much more specific

23   Westfall Act Provision was held to prevail over 1447.

24                 In Things Remembered, it was simply the fact

25   that the review bar was held to apply to a remand, even


                                         24
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   according -- under another statute, and, of course,

 2   recognizing that there are now other statutory bases for

 3   remand.   The interesting thing about 1452 -- and Justice

 4   Ginsburg, I believe you wrote the concurrence on this --

 5   is that 1452 provides for remand on any equitable

 6   ground, and that such remands are not subject to review

 7   by appeal or otherwise.

 8                So 1452, again, expresses, I think, a trend

 9   in the thinking of Congress, if there is such a thing as

10   the thinking of Congress, that the review bar will be

11   expanded and will even include such discretionary

12   decisions by a district court as any equitable ground.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But Things Remembered, I

14   think, was raised very carefully, such to say that the

15   question that's before the Court now has not been

16   decided before, the precise question here --

17                MR. ALLISON:        Yes.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- discretionary remand?

19                MR. ALLISON:        That is --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So -- and I think, I

21   looked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to

22   be just as I remembered it --

23                (Laughter.)

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- that it was neutral,

25   colorless.   It just said we haven't been confronted with

 1   this issue.    And I think Powerex said the same thing,

 2   although it said it in more definite terms, it is far

 3   from clear.

 4                 MR. ALLISON:        That is true, and that is what

 5   the federal circuit said -- meant when it said that

 6   Powerex made the question precedential.                      Because,

 7   certainly, if Things Remembered had decided the issue

 8   that's before the Court today, I think the issue

 9   wouldn't be before the Court today.                      And that is, of

10   course, why we're here.

11                 But the Thermtron -- the Thermtron issue

12   really is our second argument, and the it is a very

13   gentle argument that the Court -- and if the Court

14   certainly wishes to continue discussing that, that is --

15   that is very profitable for what we're doing here today.

16                 But the first argument is that, harkening

17   back to your original questions, Justice Ginsburg, why

18   shouldn't a remand when only state law claims remain in

19   a case, and -- Cohill 1367(c)3 why should that not come

20   within the language of 1447(c), what I'll call the

21   jurisdictional clause, because it clearly is a matter

22   that is only of concern to state courts -- and I think

23   that the Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs made

24   clear that when all State -- all the federal claims have

25   left the case and only State law claims remain, that


                                        26

 1   it's almost presumptive that those should be sent back.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but your opponent's

 3   argument is that the claims that remain do include a

 4   federal claim.

 5              MR. ALLISON:         That is true, Justice Stevens.

 6   That is his argument.      And I think what's important

 7   about that argument is the inconsistency it sets up.               It

 8   essentially casts a net that draws in these supplemental

 9   jurisdiction cases.     And what the net does is it allows

10   the courts of appeals to review some artful pleading

11   issues, which is essentially what we have here.               We have

12   state law claims, and our opponents are suggesting that

13   these are, in fact, disguised federal claims that must

14   be heard in federal --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            What about the ruling on

16   the RICO claim itself?       That was clearly a federal

17   issue.

18              MR. ALLISON:         Yes.       The RICO claim was

19   what -- was what gave the district court jurisdiction

20   over the case in the first place.               And it's interesting

21   that in the district court's decision, it made me

22   think -- it made me think a little bit of the Waco case,

23   because in the district court's decision, the district

24   court very clearly said, first, I have no jurisdiction

25   over these State law claims, and I'm going to remand

 1   them, and now I will turn to the RICO claim which

 2   creates a conundrum that I'm not sure --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Maybe the district judge

 4   didn't say that.    Maybe you can point me to the place

 5   where it did.    But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong,

 6   because there is -- that's what supplemental

 7   jurisdiction is.    It's says you have jurisdiction, it's

 8   a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you

 9   are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to

10   exercise it or not.

11              MR. ALLISON:           Justice Ginsburg, that's why

12   we didn't -- we didn't press that point because I think

13   -- I think that even we can see that the court exercised

14   its jurisdiction to decide and dismiss the RICO claim,

15   although it's reminiscent of -- of -- of the decision

16   in Kircher --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It wasn't a discretionary

18   decision about RICO.       RICO -- there was no Federal

19   claims stated.   That's out of it.

20              MR. ALLISON:           Right.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What the district court

22   has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which

23   it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, "I don't

24   have jurisdiction," because Congress has given

25   supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court


                                        28

 1   to remand on stated conditions.

 2              But you -- you seem to conflate the absence

 3   of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary

 4   decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction

 5   that the court undoubtedly has.

 6              MR. ALLISON:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have

 7   made every effort not to conflate those two -- those two

 8   concepts, and in fact we did say that when -- when a

 9   court acquires supplemental jurisdiction in a case, that

10   that is a species of subject matter jurisdiction at that

11   point, as the Court held in City of Chicago v

12   International College of Surgeons.

13              At that point the court does have a

14   mandatory discretion -- or mandatory jurisdiction to

15   exercise power over the entire Article III case; but we

16   then argue when the Federal claims leave the case that

17   jurisdiction changes.     That jurisdiction changes from a

18   mandatory one that the court, as in Thermtron, would

19   certainly be concerned if the district court had -- if

20   jurisdiction that's mandatory.             But it changes by

21   operation of 1367 from mandatory to discretionary; and

22   when Congress passed 1367 in 1990, Congress intended to

23   codify the existing law right up through Cohill on the

24   subject of supplemental jurisdiction, combining

25   ancillary and intended in those --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So your idea is

 2   there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall

 3   out then there is no jurisdiction?

 4              MR. ALLISON:          Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Okay, but that seems

 6   to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you

 7   have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event --

 8   let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that

 9   gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal

10   jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't

11   dumping chemicals with it.          You don't then say "there is

12   no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once

13   the finding is made that the facts didn't support it,

14   then there was no jurisdiction."               You say, "there was

15   jurisdiction all the time and you lose."

16              MR. ALLISON:          There was -- there was indeed

17   jurisdiction.   And what we argue is that the nature of

18   the change, when it goes from mandatory, the concern of

19   Thermtron, to discretionary, which gives -- virtually

20   pushes out of the Federal Court to the State courts

21   anytime up until trial -- the nature of that

22   jurisdiction changes; and we believe that that is not

23   what Congress intended by the words "subject matter

24   jurisdiction" in 1447(c).

25              So if we come back to the words of the


                                       30

 1   statute, the words of the statute should be construed

 2   broadly in order to serve the purposes of -- of remand.

 3   The Court has made clear that concerns of comity and

 4   federalism say that we should construe 1447 in favor of

 5   remand and I believe that that should extend to the

 6   concept of the whole delay of concept and shuttling.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Then -- when what you are

 8   doing is that you are using the label "subject manager

 9   jurisdiction" in a way that seems to me, that -- there

10   are many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the

11   edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction.                    Subject

12   matter jurisdiction means court, you have no power,

13   period.   There's no diversity, there's no Federal

14   question, there's no other basis for the Federal Court

15   to exercise jurisdiction; and to say, "Well, we can

16   extend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include

17   a case where the district court chooses not to hear

18   several claims, even though it has jurisdiction over

19   them."    I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the

20   notion subject matter jurisdiction.

21                MR. ALLISON:         It is -- it is a difficult, a

22   difficult conundrum.       I think maybe all conundra are

23   difficult, but this one particularly.                    And, Justice

24   Ginsburg, in the opinion that you wrote for the Court in

25   the RBOC case, you very clearly pointed out that the

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   word "jurisdiction" is used in a variety of ways by

 2   legal scholars --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes, but not subject

 4   matter jurisdiction.       Jurisdiction -- personal

 5   jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.                   When I did

 6   in -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all

 7   kinds of things like time limits on when you can sue,

 8   have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when

 9   they are not.   They are simply statutes of limitation.

10              MR. ALLISON:           That -- that is correct, but

11   that is -- that is the nature of the problem -- that is

12   the nature of the problems that this Court confronted in

13   Kircher and Powerex -- again this is by analogy only.

14   We are not concerned about labels like that, if the

15   district court believes that it was remanding the case

16   because it lacked jurisdiction.

17              But I'm coming back to subject matter

18   jurisdiction, and I have found no case in this Court

19   that has given a definition -- Chicago with its

20   mandatory language was the closest I was able to find.

21              The Koffski case out of the Seventh Circuit

22   is the one case I was able to find from a higher court

23   that said that supplemental jurisdiction is technically

24   a form of subject matter jurisdiction.                   What we argue --

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Why is it only technical?


                                        32

 1   It says court, you can exercise power.                  Subject matter

 2   jurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given

 3   controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there

 4   is undoubted power in the district court to hear those

 5   claims.

 6               MR. ALLISON:         In a -- certainly I think in a

 7   textbook sense, that is what subject matter -- when the

 8   world is divided between subject matter and personal and

 9   third, territorial, which I think is a relation -- has

10   relation to personal -- when the world is divided along

11   those lines, then subject matter takes on the broadest

12   possible meaning, but we have conflicting broad

13   policies.   On the one hand, we have a broad definition

14   of subject matter definition; on the other hand we have

15   a statute which should be construed to favor remand at

16   almost all lawful cost.

17               And -- and subject matter, if we step back

18   from our -- our dichotomy, personal and subject matter,

19   subject matter also means, as -- as Your Honor said at

20   the beginning of this argument, something that is --

21   that is a subject with which the Federal courts should

22   be concerned, and on which they should expend their

23   resources; and we now have the circuit courts hearing

24   appeals from decisions, discretionary decisions because

25   they are technically within the realm of subject matter


                                       33

 1   jurisdiction.   But clearly, State law claims are not the

 2   subject matter with which the Federal courts should

 3   routinely be concerned, and that's why United Mine

 4   Workers -- and Cohill echoed it -- says, these claims

 5   should be sent back, and Cohill even -- both cases even

 6   said that the propriety of remanding the claims should

 7   be reviewed at every stage in the litigation.              That --

 8   that I think presents us a pretty strong policy by this

 9   Court that remand is to be indulged at almost any lawful

10   cost.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You put it in terms in

12   your brief, if I understood your position correctly,

13   yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over

14   supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses

15   not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were

16   the words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.

17              MR. ALLISON:          Yes.       The -- the argument --

18   and I was attempting to make a technical argument in the

19   brief, and I think today I'm speaking in slightly more

20   global terms -- but the technical argument is that when

21   a district court makes a decision, in the words of

22   Gibbs, that it would be inappropriate to exercise

23   jurisdiction over those claims, then the claims are to

24   be remanded.

25              JUSTICE ALITO:           What about if it changes its


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mind?

 2               MR. ALLISON:         Justice Alito, the question of

 3   whether a -- question of reviewability because the cases

 4   that we found that -- that talked about reconsideration

 5   talked about reconsideration only because there was the

 6   potential for review of these orders.

 7               I think the norm for a remanded case is that

 8   the order of remand is entered, and the order of remand

 9   is certified and mailed to the State court, and the

10   district court no longer has jurisdiction at that point.

11               Now, certainly it could reconsider as it's

12   engaged in its decision process.               It could go back and

13   forth and reconsider it before it signs the order.                But

14   that's no different than -- than many other cases in

15   which the court can make a discretionary decision that

16   it has no jurisdiction.        The only --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The discretionary

18   decision is that it chooses not to hear the case.                 It's

19   not that -- there is no discretion there.               There's

20   nothing discretionary about saying we have no

21   jurisdiction.   "We have no jurisdiction" means we have

22   no power.   So the -- the two are just at odds with each

23   other.   No power, yes power, but we choose not to

24   exercise it.

25               MR. ALLISON:         And I think -- I think that


                                       35
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the -- again, the purpose of the review bar as it's been

 2   expressed for over a hundred years has been to trust

 3   district judges to make these decisions and then get the

 4   case where it needs to be to be resolved on its merits.

 5   So to say that the court chooses not to hear the case,

 6   it -- it suggests something a little bit less gray than

 7   the decision that I believe the court would make when it

 8   decides that it's inappropriate to hear the case, in the

 9   words of Gibbs.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:              You -- you think that

11   choosing not to hear is distinguishable from a decision

12   that it is inappropriate to hear?

13              MR. ALLISON:           I -- I meant only to suggest

14   that it is not a -- it is not a choice.                  It is a -- not

15   a -- an ill-considered choice.               Certainly, there's a

16   choice involved in the decision that it would be

17   inappropriate.    But I don't see -- and I -- I wanted to

18   resist a rhetorical question, but then I don't see how

19   anyone could say when a court is faced with -- with only

20   State-law claims that it could either decide or not and

21   it decides it would be inappropriate to retain

22   jurisdiction over those claims, that somehow it should

23   retain jurisdiction over those claims.

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, that would argue

25   for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting


                                        36
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the district judge's determination that it's not what --

 2   it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it

 3   shouldn't because they are purely state-law questions.

 4   That's -- but that's something quite different from --

 5   from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is

 6   troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest

 7   itself of jurisdiction.

 8              If Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has

 9   it, and the Court can't divest itself of that.              It can,

10   if Congress permits it, decline to exercise

11   jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting

12   itself of jurisdiction.

13              MR. ALLISON:          I believe -- well -- and --

14   and this is a mechanical argument, but I believe that

15   when the court makes the decision and then -- and then

16   anticipates the remand, that that is divesting itself of

17   jurisdiction.   And perhaps it was -- perhaps it was a

18   poor -- a poor word choice.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But even -- even on your

20   analysis it seems to me that the -- the cart is before

21   the horse, because it is -- it is not remanding because

22   it does not have jurisdiction.              What you are saying is

23   that after it remands, it loses jurisdiction, and those

24   are two very distinct categories.

25              The -- the premise for the declaration that


                                       37
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it does not have jurisdiction is a premise that even on

 2   your argument does not arise until a following

 3   agreement.    So there's no way you can fit it, it seems

 4   to me, into the category of -- of remanding because at

 5   the point of deciding to remand it has no jurisdiction.

 6   That, in fact, is false.

 7                 MR. ALLISON:        It is simply a question, I

 8   think, of -- of the choice of the word "divest" and what

 9   that means.    I would -- I would analogize in order to

10   perhaps make it seem more -- more accurate -- I would

11   analogize it to what a district court now can do under

12   section 1447(e) where it makes a decision in applying

13   the law and using its discretion to allow joinder of a

14   nondiverse party.    That would then destroy diversity and

15   require the case to be remanded.

16                 And I would say in that case that the court

17   makes a decision that divests it of jurisdiction, and it

18   is very technical to say that -- - that, yes, it lacks

19   jurisdiction as soon as it enters the order admitting

20   that party to the case.         But that may very well be the

21   same order that remands the case to the State court.

22                 But I -- I do -- I do see that there is

23   power.   And if the case is going to turn on power, as

24   the Court -- or some of the language in Powerex

25   suggested that it might, then I don't know that we -- I

 1   don't know that we make much headway.                     But I -- I -- I

 2   see 1447(c) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction as being

 3   broad enough to comfortably take in the situation where

 4   the State law claims not really within the subject

 5   matter of the district court's power are determined

 6   inappropriate for that court to hear and sent back.

 7                 And it would bring us that much closer to

 8   realizing the purpose of the review bar that has existed

 9   since 1887, taking a category of cases out of the

10   jurisdiction of the circuit courts.

11                 I -- I had wanted to offer the Court some

12   statistics, as maybe proof-of-law professors might,

13   about the number of cases that are heard on this type of

14   appeal.     I can say that the cases that we found in our

15   footnotes 18 through 20 represent something close to the

16   universe of cases in which discretion was found to be

17   abused.     And that abuse of discretion is nowhere near as

18   egregious as the legal errors that a district court

19   might commit in making erroneous judgments that it has

20   no jurisdiction which were nonetheless subjected to the

21   review bar in Kircher and Powerex.

22                 If there are no further questions, I will

23   stop now.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

25   Thank you.     Mr. Rhodes, you have four minutes remaining.

 1              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES

 2                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 3               MR. RHODES:        I just had a few quick points I

 4   would like to bring up.

 5               First, I would just like to reiterate that

 6   when Congress enacted 1367, that gave it Article III

 7   jurisdiction in those matters, just as 1331 and 1332 do.

 8   I would also like to reiterate that -- that stare

 9   decisis should be maintained over this statutory

10   interpretation because it has proved to be workable

11   rather than not workable.

12               Again, the circuit courts -- even though as

13   Mr. Chief Justice has iterated that they have to follow

14   this, they have found it to be a workable framework.

15   And, again, as the Court expressed in Powerex, they

16   agreed that in Quackenbush that Thermtron was not

17   altered.   And Congress has -- has seemingly ratified

18   this Court's interpretation in Thermtron, and it has

19   been applied in Quackenbush.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I suppose, though,

21   if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district

22   court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is --

23   there never was jurisdiction, right?                    You said they have

24   discretion to exercise or not.              If it turns out they

25   don't have discretion to exercise, you know, because


                                       40

 1   it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why

 2   wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of

 3   jurisdiction?

 4              MR. RHODES:        My response to that, Mr. Chief

 5   Justice, is that until a court decides that it was an

 6   abuse of discretion, the district court had jurisdiction

 7   under 1367(c) to either exercise that power or not

 8   exercise that power.

 9              And unless there's any further questions for

10   me, I ask that the brief -- this be remanded to the

11   Federal circuit to decide on the merits of the appeal.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

13   The case is submitted.

14              (Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the

15   above-entitle matter was submitted.)
