 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. STARR:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                Illegal drugs and the glorification of the

12   drug culture are profoundly serious problems for our

13   nation.   Congress has so recognized, as has this Court,

14   time and again.     The magnitude of the problem is

15   captured in the amicus brief, the Court has a number of

16   amicus briefs before it, but the amicus brief of General

17   McCaffrey, Secretary Bennett, and a number of

18   organizations.    And particularly, pages 5 to 9 of that

19   brief, the nature and the scope of the problem are

20   well-captured.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, is this case limited

22   to signs about drugs?        What is the rule that you want us

23   to adopt for deciding this case?

24                MR. STARR:        The rule the Court -- that it

25   articulated in Tinker.         The rule of the Court as


                                          3

 1   articulated in Tinker is that there is, in fact, a right

 2   to political speech subject to disruption, requirements

 3   that the speech not be disruptive.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Disruptive of what?

 5   Disruptive of the classroom order?                There was no

 6   classroom here.

 7              MR. STARR:       Including but not limited to.

 8   This was a school authorized event, this was education

 9   outside of the classroom.         It was essentially a school

10   simply out of doors.     It was essentially --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, I can understand if

12   they unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be

13   disruptive, but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk?

14              MR. STARR:       The educational mission of the

15   school.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but I mean, that's at a

17   level of generality that doesn't get us very far.                I

18   mean, what specifically did it disrupt?                Did it disrupt

19   the parade, did it disrupt teaching, what was it?

20              MR. STARR:       5520, a school policy of the

21   board that says emphatically that political speech is

22   protected, embracing Tinker.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Then if that's the rule,

24   the school can make any rule that it wants on any

25   subject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates


                                       4

 1   it, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive

 2   under Tinker.

 3               MR. STARR:       Not at all.                I think that in

 4   form --

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Then I'm missing the

 6   argument.

 7               MR. STARR:       The argument is that this Court

 8   in Tinker articulated a rule that allows the school

 9   boards considerable discretion both in identifying the

10   educational mission and to prevent disruption of that

11   mission, and this is disruptive of the mission --

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, suppose you have --

13   suppose you have a mission to have a global school.                       Can

14   they ban American flags on lapel pins?

15               MR. STARR:       Absolutely not, because under

16   Tinker that is political expression.                    Let me be very

17   specific.   This case is ultimately about drugs and other

18   illegal substances.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So if the sign had been

20   "Bong Stinks for Jesus," that would be, and Morse had

21   the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the

22   Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be

23   a protected right under Tinker because the message was

24   not promoting drugs?

25               MR. STARR:       She stated in her answers to


                                        5

 1   interrogatories that she may very well not have

 2   interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize

 3   marijuana.     Under our theory, we think she could have

 4   interfered with that because it was disruptive to the

 5   event, it was disorderly to the event itself, but the --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:              What would be disorderly?

 7   I don't understand this disorder.                  If somebody holds up

 8   a sign and says change the marijuana laws, why is it

 9   disruptive of anything, simply because the school quite

10   naturally has said we support the enforcement of the

11   law, and the law right now does forbid the use of

12   marijuana.

13                MR. STARR:        I --

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:              It's political speech, it

15   seems to me.    I don't see what it disrupts, unless

16   disruption simply means any statement of disagreement

17   with a position officially adopted by the school.                   Is

18   that what you mean by disruption?

19                MR. STARR:        No.        Your Honor, first of all,

20   this is, I think, an unusual characterization, namely

21   for this to be called political speech.                   We would --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:              If it's calling -- I mean

23   --

24                MR. STARR:        We think it's a First -- I'm

25   sorry.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            A call for a change in the

 2   law, I would have supposed, was political speech.

 3                 MR. STARR:      That wasn't the interpretation.

 4   Your Honor, let's back up, if I may.                     Someone has to

 5   interpret the message and the front line message

 6   interpreter is the school official.                      The school official

 7   --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, that may be, but

 9   that's not the hypo.       The -- the hypothetical is, what

10   if there is a sign or a statement in the school calling

11   for a change in, you know, the prohibition against

12   marijuana use?    As a call for change in the law, I would

13   suppose it was political speech.                But as I understood

14   the argument you were making, it would still be regarded

15   as an exception, as it were, to Tinker, because it was

16   disruptive.    And it was disruptive in the sense that it

17   disagreed with official school policy, which was to

18   enforce the law or support the law as it was.                     Is that

19   your position on what disruption means under Tinker?

20                 MR. STARR:      But our -- the answer is no.

21   Because what we are also urging the Court to consider is

22   its gloss on Tinker and Frazier, and also what this

23   Court said in Kuhlmeier.          And in Frazier, the Court was

24   very clear, the first three paragraphs in part three of

25   the opinion, in talking about the habits and manners of


                                         7

 1   civility, and inculcating the values of citizenship.

 2   That, in fact, is what is happening here.               There is an

 3   effort of the -- to prevent a message that is

 4   inconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools,

 5   which is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten,

 6   and we believe that is permitted under Tinker --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So you want to get away

 8   from a hypothetical then.          I don't know why you try to

 9   defend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says

10   amend the marijuana laws.          That's not this case as you

11   see it, is it?

12               MR. STARR:       Well, it's certainly not this

13   case, but --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             This banner was interpreted

15   as meaning smoke pot, no?

16               MR. STARR:       It was interpreted -- exactly,

17   yes.   It was interpreted as an encouragement of the drug

18   culture and --

19               JUSTICE ALITO:          Are you arguing that there

20   should be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates

21   illegal drug use, or this broader argument that the

22   school can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with

23   its educational mission as the school --

24               MR. STARR:       I think that --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          -- defines it?

 1              MR. STARR:         I apologize.               The Court can

 2   certainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there

 3   are certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include

 4   alcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy,

 5   because those are illegal substances which are very

 6   injurious to health.       And this Court has noted that in

 7   Bernonia and in Earls, time and again, it is that these

 8   are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy

 9   sanctioned by Congress, and also noted by courts across

10   the country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that

11   schools are entitled to have a message going --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But the problem --

13   the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days

14   take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well

15   beyond education or protection from illegal substances,

16   and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards

17   have adopted policies taking on the whole range of

18   political issues.    Now, do they get to dictate the

19   content of speech on all of those issues simply because

20   they have adopted that as the part of their educational

21   mission?

22              MR. STARR:         No, because that may very well

23   be inconsistent with Tinker.             Tinker articulates a

24   baseline of political speech is, in fact, protected,

25   subject to --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, I think that

 2   -- I think you're right about that, and I guess my

 3   question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker.                  I

 4   mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum

 5   for political debate simply because the students want to

 6   put that on their agenda?           Presumably the teacher's

 7   agenda is a little bit different and includes things

 8   like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem,

 9   and just because political speech is on the student's

10   agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker

11   so broadly as to include protection of those, that

12   speech.

13              MR. STARR:         This Court has not read Tinker

14   quite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and

15   there are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are

16   worthy of note.    One, that there was no written policy

17   there, so there was an issue of standardless discretion

18   being exercised.   And also --

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But it may have made a

20   difference in Tinker.       If the school had a policy,

21   defend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought

22   this into the category that you are now carving out?

23   You said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the

24   school did have a policy, patriotism, we support our

25   troops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam.                 Should

 1   Tinker have come out the other way?

 2               MR. STARR:         No, it should not, because there

 3   -- I think there are concerns with respect to what this

 4   Court has identified it is trying to, even in the public

 5   school setting, quite apart from the university setting,

 6   to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of

 7   ideas.   What is happening here of course in this case,

 8   it can be decided very narrowly, that drugs, alcohol and

 9   tobacco just have no place in the schools.                   And --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Yes, but the rule you

11   proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that

12   the school has wide discretion to define its educational

13   mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent

14   with that mission.

15               MR. STARR:         And that's what this Court in --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And it seems to me that's

17   much broader than Tinker.            Now you said, well, there is

18   an exception for political speech.                   Well, but then

19   you're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's

20   suppose that they have a particular view on a political

21   issue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and

22   so forth.

23               MR. STARR:         Justice Kennedy, the words that

24   you articulated are essentially quotes of Frazier and

25   Kuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a

 1   restoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in

 2   those two cases than one might see in Tinker.                   They of

 3   course drew, as you well know, from Justice Black's

 4   warning in dissent of Tinker that the Federal courts,

 5   Federal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly

 6   into the work of the school boards' --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why do we have to get into

 8   the question of what the school board's policy is and

 9   what things they can make its policy?                   Surely it can be

10   the -- it must be the policy of any school to discourage

11   breaking of the law.      I mean, suppose this banner had

12   said kill somebody, and there was no explicit regulation

13   of the school that said you should not, you should not

14   foster murder.   Wouldn't that be suppressible?

15              MR. STARR:        Of course.            That is not --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course it would, so --

17              MR. STARR:        The answer is yes.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why can't we decide this

19   case on that narrow enough ground, that any school

20   whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress

21   speech that advocates violation of the law?

22              MR. STARR:        I think it can, but it raises

 1   think the Court needs to stray into those areas because

 2   here we have a written policy which does in fact respond

 3   to concerns about the exercise of standardless

 4   discretion.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Does it have --

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me just clear up one

 7   thing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position.

 8   It does -- the message is the critical part of this

 9   case.     If it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot

10   sign, that would be okay.            You're not saying 15-foot

11   signs are disruptive?

12                 MR. STARR:       Not inherently disruptive, but

13   in fact -- the answer is yes.               We're not saying that

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And so we're focusing on

15   the message and that's the whole crux of the case.

16                 MR. STARR:       That's why this case is here

17   because of the message.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why is that?   Why?

19   Why?     I mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the

20   teacher says on the school trip, I don't want people

21   unfurling 15 foot banners.            I don't care what they are

22   about.

23                 MR. STARR:       It may very well be.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            We are going to visit the

25   state capital and we are not marching down the street

 1   with 15 foot banners.       I mean, does the First Amendment

 2   say the teacher can't say that?

 3                MR. STARR:       It does not.               But the Juneau

 4   school board and 5520, Justice Breyer, allows -- in fact

 5   it has a Tinker statement in the first paragraph of

 6   5520, which is also, you will not be advocating drugs.

 7   And so there is essentially a culture of liberty in

 8   Juneau.    You don't have to --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:            You just said suppose --

10   why should I not say that?           I mean I'm not going to do

11   it, necessarily.   But why could I not say, would it be

12   wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a

13   school trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot

14   banners?   Is that a correct statement of the law or not?

15   In your opinion.

16                MR. STARR:       In my opinion it is a correct

17   statement of the law.       But in response to Justice

18   Stevens' question, the message here is in fact critical

19   because what we know about this case is that, and you're

20   here of course to respond to this case, which has to do

21   with a message that the message interpreter, Deborah

22   Morse, who by the way --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's also critical here to

24   your case that it was a school event.                    If it, if this

25   had have been two blocks down the street there would

 1   have been no objection.

 2              MR. STARR:         If Mr. Frederick had seen fit to

 3   go down Glacier Avenue to J and J's, a popular hangout,

 4   there would have been no high school jurisdiction.

 5   There may have been elementary school -- but yes.               He

 6   could have gone, Justice Stevens, to the State capital

 7   or anywhere along the ten mile route.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Suppose it were Saturday

 9   instead of a weekday.

10              MR. STARR:         I beg your pardon.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Suppose it were Saturday,

12   not a school day.     And the school children were not

13   required to show up at the Olympic event but were

14   encouraged to and the same thing happened.               Would it

15   make a difference that it wasn't in the course of a

16   regular school day?

17              MR. STARR:         No.       I think it still, under

18   your hypothetical would be school sponsored.               But there

19   might be a more difficult showing of disruption or

20   inconsistency with the educational mission.               That is

21   what this Court articulated in Frazier and again in

22   Kuhlmeier that the school is able under our policies of

23   federalism and value of federalism and democratic theory

24   to fashion its educational mission subject to

25   constitutional safeguards.           And that mission of

 1   preventing the schools from being infected with pro-drug

 2   messages continues wherever there is school

 3   jurisdiction, and that would include on a Saturday field

 4   trip or other kind of activity and I think that --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Starr, you -- you

 6   responded to Justice Breyer that you think the school

 7   could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on

 8   a trip.   Could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands

 9   on a trip?

10                MR. STARR:      I don't believe so.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And if not -- if not,

12   what's the difference?

13                MR. STARR:      Because of the potential for

14   disruption, disorderliness in the event and the judgment

15   that is entrusted to --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But don't we have to be

17   more specific about the context in determining whether

18   there's disruption?     If it's a school trip to an art

19   museum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the

20   pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object

21   of the trip.   Unfurling a banner in a classroom is going

22   to be disruptive to the teaching of Shakespeare or

23   whatever is supposed to be going on in there.

24                What we have here is the unfurling of a

25   banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing

 1   snowballs waiting for some -- somebody to run by with a

 2   TV camera nearby.    And there is a real question as to

 3   whether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind

 4   of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything.

 5   And if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer

 6   favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to

 7   favor the right to suppress it?

 8               MR. STARR:        Your Honor, the answer is no.

 9               We do think that if the test that this Court

10   has articulated which we embrace, looks not simply to

11   "disruption" but inconsistency with what this Court has

12   focused -- this Court's language, the basic educational

13   mission, then surely --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:             All right.       Let me, let me

15   follow, actually ask you the same question on -- on

16   that.   Because in response to Justice Scalia's question

17   you said certainly that the school has got the right to

18   have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling

19   for violations of the law.

20               Accepting that as a premise, don't we need,

21   before the school may suppress the speech, don't we need

22   at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with

23   that policy?   And if that is so, is Bong Hits 4 Jesus

24   inconsistent with it?       It sounds like just a kid's

25   provocative statement to me.

 1                 MR. STARR:      Your Honor, with all due

 2   respect, the key is to allow the school official to

 3   interpret the message as long as that interpretation is

 4   reasonable.    You might disagree with that just as

 5   Justice Brennan disagreed with whether Matt Frazier's

 6   speech was all that terrible.              But he said even though

 7   it wasn't all that terrible I nonetheless defer to the

 8   interpretation of school officials.                      That's what our

 9   educational system is about.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But those were the words

11   and characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could

12   look at these words and say it's just nonsense.                      Or one

13   could say it's like mares-eat-oats.                      It isn't clear that

14   this is "smoke pot."

15                 MR. STARR:      Your Honor, again, Deborah

16   Morse, a conscientious principal, interpreted the

17   message in light of the subculture of the school where

18   drug use is a serious problem.               And it was on the spot

19   judgment.   We believe that judgment was reasonable as

20   opposed to a judgment reached in judicial chambers, but

21   we know that that was also the judgment of the

22   superintendent and district judge --

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is that a judgment clear

24   enough as a matter of law, or is there possible debate

25   as to whether that's a reasonable interpretation of the


                                        18

 1   message?     Let's assume it was an ambiguous message.

 2   Would we have to accept her interpretation on summary

 3   judgment?

 4                 MR. STARR:         Yes, I believe you do.             And --

 5   well, that's of course a question for the district

 6   judge.     And here the judge analyzed the facts in terms

 7   of what the individual was trying to say and determined

 8   that that is a reasonable interpretation and that is all

 9   that is required under this Court's law.

10                 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my

11   time.     Thank you.

18   please the Court.

19                 The First Amendment does not require public

20   school officials to stand aside and permit students who

21   are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote

22   or encourage the use of illegal drugs.                      As this Court

23   observed in Earls, the nationwide drug - drug epidemic

24   makes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every

25   school.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And is that the rationale

 2   on which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more

 3   broad?

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:          The Court need not decide

 5   anything more broadly than that.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm asking what your

 7   recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.

 8              MR. KNEEDLER:          Well, I think this is a

 9   manifestation of the principle articulated in Earls and

10   repeated in Hazelwood that a, school does not have to

11   tolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic

12   educational --

13              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, that's a very -- I

14   find that a very, a very disturbing argument, because

15   schools have and they can defined their educational

16   mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of

17   political speech and speech expressing fundamental

18   values of the students, under the banner of, of -- of

19   getting rid of speech that's inconsistent with

20   educational missions.

21              MR. KNEEDLER:          That's why I think there

22   would, there would be, it would make a lot of sense for

23   the Court to articulate a rule that had to do with

24   encouraging illegal conduct and particularly --

25              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why go into this?   I


                                      20

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mean, that's what I actually, seriously don't

 2   understand.     Suppose the rule has the following rule:

 3   by the way, on our field trips you can carry around 15

 4   foot banners.     They can say anything.                  Except they can't

 5   talk about drugs and they can't talk about sex and they

 6   can't talk about -- I don't know.                  Or I'd say three

 7   things.   Would that be constitutional?

 8                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Well -- I think, I think a

 9   school could certainly prohibit the display of banners

10   on a school trip or in a school assembly.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose that this

12   particular person had whispered to his next door

13   neighbor, "Bong Hits 4 Jesus, heh heh heh," you know.

14   Supposed that's what had happened?

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 MR. KNEEDLER:          And that may well -- that may

17   well be different.      And that's why I --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No.     What would be

19   different -- that's what I -- what a principal that has

20   to act quickly sees across the street at a school

21   meeting, a big banner go up making a joke out of drug

22   use.   So the principal acts.

23                 Now, are we supposed to divide that into

24   little bitsy parts?       Because as soon as we do we are

25   going to get a rather interesting, complicated and very

 1   difficult set of constitutional rules.                    But you want us

 2   to do that.

 3                 MR. KNEEDLER:         No.      I do not.       I think -- I

 4   think the point that you make that a principal sees the

 5   banner across the street and sees the word bong hits,

 6   and -- and at the very moment when the Olympic torch was

 7   about to arrive, I think it was.                She made a quick

 8   judgment and an entirely reasonable one that the display

 9   of the slang words bong hits --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, then you're not

11   arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what

12   you said at the first.

13                 MR. STARR:      Well, there are several

14   gradations that the Court could take:                    Advocacy of

15   illegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of

16   illegal drugs.    But I believe -- I think it's important

17   to recognize that this Court's precedents recognize --

18   recognize several different justifications for

19   restricting student speech.             In Tinker itself which

20   dealt with political speech, the Court was careful to

21   point out that even then, if the speech could be shown

22   to present a threat of a material disruption to the

23   class work, and I think this would answer your question,

24   Mr. Chief Justice, if the teacher wants to teach

25   Shakespeare, the teacher doesn't have to turn over the


                                        22

 1   class to political speech.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:           But that's a

 3   viewpoint-neutral regulation.               This isn't, the principal

 4   didn't say this was a viewpoint-neutral regulation, did

 5   she?

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:           No.      No.         And -- and, and

 7   just to finish, in Tinker even with a viewpoint concern,

 8   the Court said if you could show material disruption,

 9   and --- and the Court made that clear in Tinker, by, by

10   its comparison to several lower court decisions where

11   wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had

12   caused disruption.      And the third category in Tinker

13   itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the

14   rights of other students to be secure and be let alone.

15   That's Tinker dealing with political speech.

16                But in Frazier and Hazelwood the Court

17   identified additional categories of speech that could be

18   governed by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of

19   Hazelwood.   The Court made clear that the ability to

20   regulate those categories of speech goes beyond the

21   question of whether there would be disruption or whether

22   there would be --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So -- so you think

24   that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete

25   button that says "legalize marijuana," although it might


                                         23
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it

 2   could be inconsistent with the school's mission and

 3   prohibited on that basis?

 4               MR. KNEEDLER:         Well, I think -- I think if,

 5   if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum

 6   in the State, then that, that might be the category of

 7   political speech that could not be regulated.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And at -- at this very

 9   rally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay

10   to work for change in existing law which such a sign

11   would be, but it is not okay to violate the law.                And no

12   one was smoking pot in that crowd.

13               MR. KNEEDLER:         But -- but the, what was

14   happening was a sign that was reasonably construed to

15   encourage the use of illegal drugs.

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:           All right.       Given the fact

17   that this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court

18   forced into the position if it's going to be consistent

19   with what else we have said, even at the final appellate

20   level, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the

21   statement itself in determining whether it may be

22   suppressed or punished?

23               And if we do that, is it such a reasonable

24   construction that this is an -- an incitement to illegal

25   drug use?

 1                I mean it's a statement which makes, makes

 2   the drug law look a little ridiculous, I think, but I'm

 3   not sure that that is very distinguishable from a

 4   statement saying "you ought to change the drug law."

 5                MR. KNEEDLER:         Well, I -- I -- I think in,

 6   in this Court's decisions dealing with public schools,

 7   this Court has, has a consistent theme as to give

 8   deference to the judgments by the educators.               Public

 9   schools --

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Do we have to give -- let

11   me ask you this.   And maybe this is the, as far as we

12   can go with it here.

13                Is that the answer to the question here

14   about what the statement means?

15                MR. KNEEDLER:         Yes.

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           In other words, if we give

17   deference your argument wins.             But if we don't give

18   deference, then does anybody really know what the

19   statement means?

20                MR. KNEEDLER:         I don't think the question is

21   what Mr. Frederick intended.            The question is what a

22   reasonable observer would think.               And the words "bong

23   hits" are slang that would be particularly, have a

24   particular characteristic of getting across to other

25   student, and they suggest a casual tolerance and

 1   encouragement of --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:             What if the sign said

 3   "bong hits should be legal?"

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:           I, I think that would be a

 5   judgment call.   I think the, I think the casual use --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Under your view wouldn't

 7   the principal's judgment always prevail?

 8              MR. KNEEDLER:           Well it has to be a

 9   reasonable judgment and this is, this is reflected in

10   Frazier.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Is that a question of fact

12   or a question of law?

13              MR. KNEEDLER:           Pardon me?

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Is whether it's a

15   reasonable judgment --

16              MR. KNEEDLER:           I think ultimately it's a

17   question of law, whether it's a reasonable judgment.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             This, this -- this parade

19   had a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with -- the high

20   school kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it.

21   And suppose the banner said vote for, vote Republican,

22   vote Democrat.   And he wants to be on the TV with that.

23   Could this, the principal make him take that sign out of

24   the ground in that it's inconsistent with the whole

25   theme of, of, of the parade?            Something like our Kurle

 1   case?

 2               MR. KNEEDLER:            Yes.      I -- I mean, I think

 3   for this reason.     This was essentially an outdoor

 4   assembly, where the -- whether the students were

 5   assembled to watch a particular different, just as in an

 6   indoor assembly.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Is that different from the

 8   rationale you've put.

 9               MR. KNEEDLER:            Yes.      Again, that's why I

10   don't think there's any one single rule that governs all

11   cases.   This, this I think falls under the Frazier

12   standard, where the Court said that, that schools have a

13   duty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare

14   students for citizenship, and not violating the law is

15   an important part of that and teachers' act in loco

16   parentis.   They act as guardians and they should be able

17   to do, as this Court says in Earls, what a reasonable

18   guardian would do.      That would mean don't allow people

19   to encourage lawbreaking.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But it wasn't, it wasn't

21   like an assembly, was it?            As I understand it, the

22   children were released from school, but they were not

23   required to attend this event and they were not required

24   to stand in front of the school on the opposite side.

25   They weren't monitored by their teachers, so they -- and

 1   there were nonstudents in the crowd.                      So it's not like a

 2   school assembly.

 3                 MR. KNEEDLER:          The students' present at the

 4   event, presence as the event, was like an assembly.

 5   Students may go into an assembly hall and not have to

 6   sit with their class.        They were released from class,

 7   but they were not released from school or school

 8   supervision.     There were teachers around there and the

 9   school could define what is the nature of our assembly

10   at this public event and, just as in, in the auditorium

11   a school could say there will be no political banners

12   or, frankly, no banners about anything other than what

13   the event is --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Were they required to go to

15   this event and could they have skipped off and gone home

16   without violating --

17                 MR. KNEEDLER:          They were not allowed to go

18   home.     They were required, they were required --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They were required to

20   attend.

21                 MR. KNEEDLER:          They were required to be

22   there if the classroom teacher decided to let them go

23   out there, but they were under school supervision at

24   that time.

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Were they ever told what

 1   they were supposed to do in the sense did the school

 2   ever say, we are letting you out on the street to

 3   celebrate the Olympics and to do only that?                  Was, was

 4   there an object to this release from the school building

 5   that was ever conveyed?

 6               MR. KNEEDLER:           If I may, I don't think

 7   there's any question that he knew in advance that this

 8   was about the Olympics.         That's why he made the sign.

 9   And they were released to go out and watch the torch go

10   by.   He hasn't raised any question of notice or due

11   process concerns.

16            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS K. MERTZ, ESQ.

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18               MR. MERTZ:        Mr. Chief Justice and may it

19   please the Court:    This is a case about free speech.                  It

20   is not a case about drugs.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's a case about

22   money.   Your client wants money from the principal

23   personally for her actions in this case.

24               MR. MERTZ:        He does have a damages claim

25   against the school district and the principal, but

 1   that's by no means his chief object here.                 The

 2   overwhelming object is to assert his free speech --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, would you waive

 4   damages against this principal who has devoted her life

 5   to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for

 6   this sophomoric sign that was held up?

 7              MR. MERTZ:        We are certainly willing to

 8   negotiate a minimum settlement of damages.                 That is not

 9   the object here.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But there's a

11   broader issue of whether principals and teachers around

12   the country have to fear that they're going to have to

13   pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take

14   actions pursuant to established board policies that they

15   think are necessary to promote the school's educational

16   mission.

17              MR. MERTZ:        That is indeed a legitimate

18   fear, Your Honor, and we believe the existing law takes

19   care of it by requiring before qualified immunity can be

20   breached that there be a demonstration that under the

21   existing law at the time available to her --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And you think it was

23   clearly established that she had to allow a student at a

24   school- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner

25   saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus"?

 1               MR. MERTZ:         I think it was clearly

 2   established at the time, Your Honor, that a principal

 3   could not engage in viewpoint censorship of a

 4   nondisruptive expression, under both Ninth Circuit law

 5   and this Court's law.        The case had --

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Does that, does that

 7   general statement that you just made apply to all

 8   circumstances in which a student-teacher relationship

 9   might be involved?      For example, in the course of

10   teaching a class in Shakespeare would your rule prevail?

11               MR. MERTZ:         The rule on qualified immunity?

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Yes, the general rule which

13   the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here.                For

14   example, in the Shakespeare class, kid doesn't, doesn't

15   say anything.    He doesn't yell or scream or even raise

16   his hand.   He just holds a little sign in the

17   Shakespeare class that says "Bong Hits 4 Jesus."                As I

18   understood the general rule that you said the teacher

19   was bound to know here, the teacher I suppose would be

20   required or the school would be required to tolerate

21   that sign in the Shakespeare class; is that correct?

22               MR. MERTZ:         I believe the analysis would be

23   the Tinker analysis in terms of substantial disruption

24   of the lesson.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, would there be a

 1   substantial disruption?

 2              MR. MERTZ:          It would all depend on the

 3   circumstances.     My guess is that if it were simply

 4   passively --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:               If the kids look around and

 6   they say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again --

 7              (Laughter.)

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:               -- they then return, they

 9   then return to MacBeth.          Does the -- does the, does the

10   teacher have to, does the school have to tolerate that

11   sign in the Shakespeare class?

12              MR. MERTZ:          I believe that in circumstances

13   where it is a substantial distraction --

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Can't it just say no

15   signs when you're supposed to be learning?

16              MR. MERTZ:          Your Honor, I think the answer

17   is yes if they had a content-neutral rule prohibiting

18   signs in school.    I believe that would be --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But can't the school

20   decide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent

21   its student from engaging in drug use and so that it's

22   going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint

23   is going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it

24   takes a particular view with respect to signs that in

25   their view seem to encourage drug use?

 1                MR. MERTZ:      Certainly it is within the

 2   school's mission to discourage drug use.                 Certainly it

 3   has many tools to allow it to get its own viewpoint --

 4   certainly it can -- it does not need to provide a forum

 5   in the school itself for students with a contrary

 6   viewpoint.   But when a student is basically on his own

 7   time, whether it's outside of school --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So your position

 9   would be different if this were in the student gym and

10   they were having a discussion.              There was a program to

11   discourage drug use and he held up his sign; you would

12   say it would be all right to take down the sign inside

13   the school gym?

14                MR. MERTZ:      No, I'm not so sure.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it doesn't matter

16   that this is outside.      It matters on the content of the

17   sign, not the location?

18                MR. MERTZ:      Well, what matters is whether

19   there is a substantial disruption of what the school is

20   trying to achieve legitimately, whether it's a classroom

21   lesson or a lesson on drug use.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, but the school has --

23   the school has a program, an anti -drug program that

24   shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers

25   to preach against drug use and you're saying that --


                                       33

 1   never mind unfurling a banner.              You're saying that it

 2   has to let students contradict this message it's trying

 3   to teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that

 4   says "Smoke Pot, It's Fun."

 5               MR. MERTZ:       I believe, Your Honor --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Does the school have to do

 7   that?

 8               MR. MERTZ:       I believe, Your Honor, that a

 9   nondisruptive pin, badge, whatever you want to call it,

10   would have to be tolerated.            However, they would not

11   have to tolerate a student who interrupts a anti-drug

12   presentation.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But the school, even though

14   it is trying to teach one point of view, can allow

15   students to come in and undermine that point of view,

16   assuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of

17   view?   It can allow students to come in and undermine

18   what it's trying to teach?

19               MR. MERTZ:       I think that --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that is not disruption

21   in your view?

22               MR. MERTZ:       I think they cannot prevent

23   presentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is

24   done in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the

25   school's own presentation of its viewpoint.

 1   the time, where there was an active public debate on

 2   marijuana policy, on marijuana for medical use,

 3   marijuana for personal use, so it's --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it's a political

 5   -- even assuming it's a political issue, the question is

 6   whether the school has to say our classrooms, our field

 7   trips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a

 8   forum for that debate?

 9              MR. MERTZ:       I believe it does not have to if

10   being a forum would disrupt the school's own educational

11   program and --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And disruption does

13   not include undermining the message they want to send?

14   It has to be some type of physical disruption.                But

15   undermining the message they want to send, they can't

16   make the judgment that that's not allowed?

17              MR. MERTZ:       Preventing a contrary viewpoint

18   from being expressed, that we --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, but you rephrased it

20   that way, but what actually happened is the principal

21   looks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at

22   what's supposed to be a school event with everybody

23   together in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes

24   a joke out of drug use.       The principal thinks of course

25   adolescents and post-adolescents sometimes like to test


                                      36

 1   limits, and if the kids go around having 15-foot banners

 2   making a joke out of drug use that really does make it a

 3   little tougher for me to convince the students at this

 4   school not to use drugs, and particularly putting up

 5   15-foot banners.     I don't know why everybody wants to

 6   get away from that because I think you would have had a

 7   very different case if in fact it had been a whisper or

 8   if it had been a serious effort to contest the drug

 9   laws.   It wasn't either.          It was a joke.         It was a

10   15-foot banner.     We have the message plus the means plus

11   the school event.

12               Now, what's your response?

13               MR. MERTZ:         My response, Your Honor, is

14   that, first of all, a 14-foot banner.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:              That's an excellent

16   response, I think.

17               (Laughter.)

18               MR. MERTZ:         That was just a preliminary.          In

19   fact, what it was was a person displaying this banner in

20   a quiet, passive manner that didn't interfere with

21   anybody's observation.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:              I conceive that

23   interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a

24   school where kids go around at public events publicly

25   making a joke out of drugs.              That's what his thought is.

 1   Now, I don't think he has to be able to read content

 2   discrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place.

 3   He doesn't know the law, the principal.                  His job is to

 4   run the school.    And so I guess what I'm worried about

 5   is a rule that would -- is on your side, a rule that

 6   takes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing

 7   limits all over the place in the high schools.                  But a

 8   rule that against your side may really limit people's

 9   rights on free speech.        That's what I'm struggling with.

10   Now, I want some help there and I'm worried about the

11   principal.

12                 MR. MERTZ:      I believe the answer is that the

13   Tinker case as we understand it struck a very wise

14   compromise between allowing school officials to have

15   complete discretion to suppress student speech in order

16   to maintain what they conceive of as their individual

17   mission and the student's right to speak in a

18   nondisruptive manner.       The speaker -- the Tinker case

19   has stood the test of time for 40, almost 30 years and,

20   although --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you can say that, but

22   the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on

23   it.   I mean, it stood the test of time in the sense that

24   it hasn't been overruled, but --

25                 MR. MERTZ:      There have been some narrow


                                        38

 1   exceptions to it in subsequent cases, of course, the

 2   Frazier and the Kuhlmeier cases.                But the basic, the

 3   heart of it, the requirement that the school demonstrate

 4   that substantial disruption before it can engage in

 5   suppression of --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think we're using

 7   disruption in two different senses here and we should

 8   probably separate the two.           One sense is disrupting the

 9   class so that whatever is being taught can't be taught.

10   But you're also using it in the sense of undermining a

11   general message that the school is trying to get across:

12   Obey the law, don't use drugs, whatever.                 Maybe we

13   should have a different word for -- the first is

14   disruption.    Disruption is a, is a funny word for the

15   second.   Let's called it undermining instead.

16                 Now, you think both of them, however, are

17   bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the

18   speech?

19                 MR. MERTZ:      If I understand your question

20   correctly, the second of them might better be called

21   allowing competing viewpoints.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So you think undermining is

23   perfectly okay?    You would never consider undermining to

24   be disruption and therefore bad?

25                 MR. MERTZ:      I think undermining in the sense

 1   of preventing impeding the school from delivering its

 2   own message --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay, but only that.

 4                 MR. MERTZ:      -- would be substantial

 5   disruption.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right after a class on

 7   drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say:

 8   This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use

 9   them all the time, I urge all of you.                    That's perfectly

10   okay?   That's not undermining?

11                 MR. MERTZ:      I believe that is the kind of

12   speech --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's not disruption?

14                 MR. MERTZ:      -- that we must tolerate no

15   matter how unwise it is.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But couldn't the school,

17   couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner

18   regulation that says you're not going to use the halls

19   to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?

20                 MR. MERTZ:      I believe that's correct.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You could have reasonable

22   rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school

23   building.

24                 MR. MERTZ:      Right.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does the school have

 1   to be completely neutral in that respect?                  Does it have

 2   to punish who says that was a good program, I'm not

 3   going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because

 4   he's taking position on a public issue?

 5                MR. MERTZ:       I think a content neutral,

 6   content neutrality is critical here, and if the school

 7   wants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has

 8   an outside of the official forum --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Where does that

10   notion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I

11   thought we wanted our schools to teach something,

12   including something besides just basic elements,

13   including the character formation and not to use drugs.

14   They have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs

15   or not?

16                MR. MERTZ:       Content neutrality goes to what

17   speech is suppressed or punished.                 As far as the school

18   delivering its own message, there is no requirement of

19   equal time or that it be neutral.                 It's got its own

20   viewpoint in the case of drugs, a viewpoint that almost

21   all of us agree with, and it should be able to espouse

22   --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            A school isn't an open

24   forum.    A school isn't there for everybody to teach the

25   students whatever he wants.             It's there for the teachers

 1   to instruct.   And you're turning it into an open forum.

 2   If the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else

 3   has to be able to address that issue.

 4               MR. MERTZ:        I don't believe that's the case

 5   at all, Your Honor.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's not my vision of

 7   what a school is.

 8               MR. MERTZ:        In the classroom delivering the

 9   prescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the

10   school wishes to present a particular message, that's

11   one case.   However, in the lunchroom, outside in recess,

12   across the street, that is a quintessentially open forum

13   where it would not be proper, I think, to tell students

14   you may not mention this subject, you may not take this

15   position.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But do you concede that

17   there was some right of school control for what was

18   going on across the street?

19               MR. MERTZ:        No.       Actually our primary

20   position on that is that he was in a public place at a

21   public event among public people --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If kids were throwing

23   bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no

24   right or duty to go over there and stop it?

25               MR. MERTZ:        Oh, I think if they were

 1   engaging in an act of hooliganism --

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, that's because the

 3   school has a right of control.

 4              MR. MERTZ:        There is a distinction here.

 5   This young man had not been in school today, had not

 6   been an campus, was not in any class that was released

 7   to --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why did he go where

 9   he went?

10              MR. MERTZ:        Pardon?

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why did he choose

12   that location to unfurl his banner?

13              MR. MERTZ:        He explained because it was the

14   only place where he actually knew the route of the

15   relay.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:             But I mean, that's -- I

17   have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the

18   teacher said.   The entire class went to view the relay.

19   Individual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning.

20   They were not given the option of remaining in class,

21   nor were they released to do as they pleased.                 They were

22   to watch the relay with the rest of the student body,

23   either just in front of the school or just across the

24   street -- that's me, not them -- and then return

25   directly to their classrooms, which I guess the school

 1   did.   So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand

 2   together, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the

 3   teachers will be there and take you back to class.                          Now

 4   is there something else in the record that suggests

 5   something different?

 6               MR. MERTZ:         There is a major dispute on that

 7   point, Your Honor.      We presented several affidavits that

 8   showed individual teachers --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:              Just tell me where to look.

10   Where are the conflicting affidavits?                      I'm just reading

11   from page 51 of the joint appendix.                       I didn't know there

12   was a dispute.

13               MR. MERTZ:         It would be on pages 32, 34, 36.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay, I'll look at those.

15   Another somewhat minor point.               Can I ask you another

16   point about the record?          I'll read those.

17               MR. MERTZ:         Okay.        Can I finish the

18   description of what actually happened?                      According to the

19   students, for those who were released from class, there

20   was no requirement for staying on campus, and many of

21   them did not stay on campus.              No requirement for --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:              No, they went across the

23   street.

24               MR. MERTZ:         Some of them did.                Some went

25   down --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           Was there any -- there was

 2   no requirement, they didn't have to go across the street

 3   or stay on campus, they could wander off distantly.

 4                MR. MERTZ:      They could, and many of them

 5   did.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.

 7                MR. MERTZ:      And there was no requirement

 8   that they stay together, no requirement that they do

 9   anything in particular.        They --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I had to watch -- not even

11   watch the parade, no requirement they watch the parade?

12   They were released in order to watch the parade.

13                MR. MERTZ:      That was the intent, obviously,

14   for those released.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The intent, it was the

16   direction.

17                MR. MERTZ:      But --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It was not only the intent,

19   it was the direction.

20                MR. MERTZ:      Actually it was not.        According

21   to these student affidavits, they were simply released

22   and said, you can go watch --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Was there any fact

24   finding on that?   You referred to affidavits.

25                MR. MERTZ:      No.       It was decided on cross

 1   motions for summary judgment in the district court, and

 2   there were no findings, actually no factual findings at

 3   all, and certainly nothing on that particular point.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            Can I ask you another

 5   record point, just so I know where to look?

 6               MR. MERTZ:       Yes.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            You've also asked for an

 8   injunction that would require expunging his 5-day

 9   suspension from his record.

10               MR. MERTZ:       Correct.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            10 days.         Well, 10 or 5,

12   unclear.   I noticed the superintendent of schools on

13   page 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is,

14   "Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable

15   because he was exercising his free of speech right.

16   Even if I were to concede his speech across from the

17   high school is protected, which I do not, the rest of

18   his behavior warranted the suspension."                   And then he

19   says, "And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.                   So given

20   that, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you --

21   that it is protected and so forth -- then would you

22   concede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's

23   over, it still stands, I don't care about the

24   expungement or not?

25               MR. MERTZ:       The -- whether it remains on the

 1   record, anything that remains on his record is obviously

 2   much more --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, but I'm asking that you

 4   think about it.   I'm putting you on the spot.

 5                MR. MERTZ:      In that case, I missed the point

 6   of your --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           I want to know what the

 8   superintendent said.      As I read it is, he says, look, I

 9   don't care if this was protected or not.                 I'll give you

10   that.   It's protected.      But the rest of his behavior,

11   the way he treated the principal, what he did, the

12   reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a

13   suspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.

14   So it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is

15   saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5

16   days.   That's what the superintendent says.

17                Now suppose you win your point that you're

18   interested in winning, which you may not or you may.

19   Are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5

20   days, that that should be erased?

21                MR. MERTZ:      If the only thing left were

22   discipline because he was tardy that day, was -- didn't

23   divulge the names of the other people holding the

24   banner, that sort of thing, we couldn't --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I think it's --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            You couldn't what?       I

 2   didn't hear the last part of what you said.                  You just

 3   got to the point of --

 4                MR. MERTZ:       Of answering the question.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      What's the answer?

 6                MR. MERTZ:       Those things wouldn't manner

 7   anymore.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            So you would not pursue it?

 9                MR. MERTZ:       Correct.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Can we get back --

11   I'm sorry.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Go ahead.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Can we get back to

14   what the case is about.         You think the law was so

15   clearly established when this happened that the

16   principal, that the instant that the banner was

17   unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is

18   coming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I

19   can only take the sign down if it's disruptive.                  But

20   then under Frazier I can do something if it interferes

21   with the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got

22   this other thing.    So she should have known at that

23   point that she could not take the banner down, and it

24   was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own

25   pocket because of it.

 1              MR. MERTZ:         Mr. Chief Justice, there are two

 2   different time points we have to talk about.                      There's

 3   the heat of the moment out there on the street, but then

 4   later back in the office when she actually decided to

 5   levy the punishment after she had talked to him, after

 6   she heard why he did it and why he didn't do it, after

 7   she had had a chance to consult with the school

 8   district's counsel.      At that point in the calmness of

 9   her office, then she should indeed have known it.                      And

10   she did testify that she had taken a master's degree

11   course in school law in which she studied Kuhlmeier and

12   Frazier and Tinker.      So --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And so it should be

14   perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and

15   couldn't do.

16              MR. MERTZ:         Yes.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              As it is to us, right?

18              (Laughter.)

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:              I mean, we have had a

20   debate here for going on 50 minutes about what Tinker

21   means, about the proper characterization of the

22   behavior, the nonspeech behavior.                 The school's terms in

23   dealing with the kids that morning.                      The meaning of the,

24   of the statement.     We've been debating this in this

25   courtroom for going on an hour, and it seems to me

 1   however you come out, there is reasonable debate.

 2   Should the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm

 3   deliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the

 4   correct answer is?

 5                 MR. MERTZ:       We believe at the very least she

 6   should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive

 7   holding of a sign because it said something you

 8   disagreed with.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Of course I disagree with

10   the characterization on disruptive.                       It was completely

11   disruptive of the message, of the theme that the school

12   wanted to promote.      Completely disruptive of the reason

13   for letting the students out to begin with.                       Completely

14   disruptive of the school's image that they wanted to

15   portray in sponsoring the Olympics.

16                 MR. MERTZ:       Well, they weren't sponsoring

17   the Olympics, they weren't even sponsoring this event

18   actually.   They simply let the students out to watch it.

19   That was --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Some of the students were

21   carrying the torch and the band was playing in the

22   parade.

23                 MR. MERTZ:       A few of the student -- a few of

24   the relay runners were from the school and had been

25   allowed to skip school because of that, and the pep band

 1   played as it went by.     I do not believe that made the

 2   torch relay a school event.           The best that can be said

 3   for them is that they let the students watch it with the

 4   concurrence of individual teachers, and that that

 5   attendance was a school sanctioned attendance.             Now

 6   whether that allows them to then engage in this kind of

 7   punishment for speech by a student who was not even

 8   among those released, who is standing --

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Now you said that in your

10   brief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got

11   mileage out of his being truant that morning.             Would the

12   case have come out differently, would you be making any

13   different argument if he got to school on time and was

14   released with the rest of them?             Does the case turn on

15   the fact that he was late to school that day?

16              MR. MERTZ:       We believe it would be a closer

17   question, but the fact that he was not there in school

18   today, and intentionally was not there today, turns this

19   into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in

20   a public place in a public event who was not acting as a

21   student.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So he's not a school

23   child, he would be playing hooky?

24              MR. MERTZ:       Because he was playing hooky

25   because he chose not to be there, because he was not

 1   part of the class.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Even though the law

 3   required him to be there?

 4               MR. MERTZ:         That's right.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:              He wasn't playing hooky.

 6   He showed up late, that's all, right?                     I mean, he

 7   actually came and joined his classmates at an event that

 8   he knew was an event that the school told the classes to

 9   go to.

10               MR. MERTZ:         He joined --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              As far as I'm concerned, he

12   just showed up late.

13               MR. MERTZ:         He joined a public crowd on a

14   private side -- public sidewalk in front of private

15   homes.   The crowd happened to have some other students

16   in that school there.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Where did he go

18   immediately after?      He went to the school building for

19   whatever it was, the third period of the day.

20               MR. MERTZ:         Yes.       The principal instructed

21   him to do so and he did.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So under your view, if the

23   principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the

24   street, had to come up and say now, how many here are

25   truants and how many here are -- I can't discipline you

 1   because you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the

 2   bottle.

 3              (Laughter.)

 4              MR. MERTZ:       No, I don't think she needs to

 5   do that in the heat of the moment.                But later on once

 6   she's discovered the true facts, then at that point I

 7   think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student

 8   if he was not there as a student.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Because you're both a

10   truant and disrupter, you get off.

11              (Laughter.)

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Had you been just a

13   disrupter, tough luck.

14              MR. MERTZ:       Well, it may well be that he

15   could have been punished for being truant, but of course

16   that's not why we're here.         He was punished for

17   displaying, for the content of the sign he was

18   displaying in a public place as a private citizen.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Who were the people that

20   helped him hold up his flag?           Were they not classmates

21   of his?

22              MR. MERTZ:       Most of them were classmates; at

23   least one was not a student.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did he not know that these

25   classmates were there at a public event that was

 1   sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had

 2   directed the students to go?

 3               MR. MERTZ:        I'm sure he did know.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So it seems to me it's like

 5   joining a school trip at the zoo, you know.                  You -- you

 6   don't make it to the -- to the school, but you drive

 7   there yourself and then join the class as it's going

 8   through the zoo.    It seems to me he's in school.

 9               MR. MERTZ:        A better analogy might be if he

10   had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in

11   some expressive act, and there happened to be a school

12   group there at the same time, could the teacher with

13   that group then have disciplined him for what he was

14   doing?

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That gets back to

16   the point I was trying to make earlier.                  He came here

17   because it was the school event, the school sponsored

18   activity.   He could have gone anywhere along the route.

19   He knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that

20   they were going to be, the students were going to be

21   released to see it.      He went to join up with the school

22   even if he were truant that day.

23               MR. MERTZ:        No, Your Honor.            I believe

24   that's incorrect.     There is nothing in the record that

25   even suggests that he went there in order to join up

 1   with schoolmates or in order to be near the school.               He

 2   says, in fact, he intentionally tried to avoid the

 3   school because he thought that that way he could avoid

 4   the school jurisdiction for his --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You think he could have

 6   been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't

 7   intend to be part of the school group afterwards?             I

 8   mean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a

 9   day truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy.

10   And he shows up and he says, oh, you can't -- you have

11   to hold me for a whole day's truancy because I didn't

12   intend to be in school.         I was in school but I didn't

13   intend to be there.

14                MR. MERTZ:       I think it would all depend on

15   whether he --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That doesn't make any sense

17   to me.    Does it depend on his intent, whether or not he

18   intended to be a truant that afternoon?

19                MR. MERTZ:       I think that would depend on the

20   fact of whether he was a truant that afternoon.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            He was either in school or

22   he wasn't in school.

23                MR. MERTZ:       In the morning he wasn't in

24   school.

 1   was or he wasn't.

 2                 MR. MERTZ:      In the afternoon he was.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the question is whether

 4   joining the school group, intentionally joining the

 5   school group, going there because the school group was

 6   there, whether that places him in school.

 7                 MR. MERTZ:      As a hypothetical, if he were

 8   intentionally joining a school group, I would have to

 9   say that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the

10   school has.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why does it matter?   That

12   is, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the

13   principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that

14   principal really reasonably thought the situation was?

15   I mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of

16   the school group, if the principal reasonably thought

17   that this was a school outing, if the principal

18   reasonably thought that students are staying together,

19   why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take

20   the case, we should take it that way, because the

21   principal reasonably thinks?

22                 MR. MERTZ:      As far as qualified immunity, I

23   think that's correct, if she had a reasonable belief.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But even on the merits?

25                 MR. MERTZ:      On the merits I don't think so,

 1   because if he was not in fact there as part of a school

 2   group --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            Even if the principal

 4   couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she

 5   thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if

 6   he really wasn't?

 7                MR. MERTZ:       I do not believe there's

 8   anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a

 9   pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because

10   it's --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought you were going to

12   appeal to the calm of her office the next day.                 I

13   thought that was going to be your answer to my question.

14   Whatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it

15   later.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I ask to you clarify

17   one thing.   I initiated this line of questioning when I

18   said I was surprised that your brief made such a big

19   deal that he was late to school.                You would still be

20   making the argument about the free speech right if he

21   had diligently showed up for his math class first period

22   in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his

23   banner to unfurl when the torch came by?

24                MR. MERTZ:       That is correct.           We have two

25   independent bases for defending him here.                 One is the

 1   pure free speech in a public place argument.                      That's the

 2   one that hinges on the fact that he was not among the

 3   released students.      The other argument, which we believe

 4   in equally, is that even if it were a on-campus or on an

 5   extension of campus like a field trip, then under Tinker

 6   because it was not disruptive they cannot punish it.

 7                My time is up.           I thank the Court.

16   possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages.

17                A very brief factual point.                   In light of the

18   richness of the discussion with respect to the facts, I

19   would guide the Court to page 109 of the joint appendix.

20   This is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there

21   she sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law.

22                To promote drugs -- and this is our

23   fundamental suggestion and submission.                    To promote drugs

24   is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational

25   mission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to

 1   the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with

 2   much of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls.                   The

 3   opinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially

 4   powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their

 5   dangers.

 6              More broadly, the Court does not need to go

 7   more broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with

 8   respect to the need to defer to school officials in

 9   identifying the educational mission.                   But we know that

10   there are in fact constitutional limits.                  Those limits

11   are captured in Tinker.        A passive pure political speech

12   that reflects on the part of the school board a

13   standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of

14   controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy

15   over the classroom.     We are light years away from that.

16              I thank the Court.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you counsel,

18   the case is submitted.

19              (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the

20   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
