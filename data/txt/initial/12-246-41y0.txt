 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We'll hear argument

 4   next in Case 12-246, Salinas v. Texas.

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                MR. FISHER:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                The Fifth Amendment prohibits using a

11   person's silence during a noncustodial police interview

12   against him at trial, and nothing about the specific

13   facts of this case give this Court cause to refrain from

14   applying that rule here.

15                To the contrary, the State's closing

16   argument in this case urging the jury to find

17   Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote, "an innocent person

18   would have denied law enforcement's accusations,"

19   strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule and,

20   indeed, the Fifth Amendment is designed to prohibit.

21                It evokes an inquisitorial system of

22   justice.   It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto

23   the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by

24   conscripting the defendant as a product of his own

25   demise.

                                       3

 1               Now, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

 2   resisted this logic and held the Fifth Amendment didn't

 3   apply because there was supposedly no compulsion in this

 4   case in the sense that there was no physical or

 5   psychological coercion of the kind that's inherent in

 6   custody.

 7               But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

 8   simply misunderstood the nature of a Griffin claim and

 9   the nature of the compulsion.              The compulsion that

10   Mr. Salinas faced was when the police asked him the

11   question about ballistics evidence, there was nothing he

12   could do to avoid supplying the State with incriminating

13   evidence that it could use against him.

14               If he answered the question -

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why isn't it -- why isn't

16   it like the -- is it Berghuis case?                   There was a case of

17   someone who was given Miranda warnings, and, even so,

18   the Court said he was silent.              He didn't invoke the

19   Fifth Amendment; therefore, his silence can be commented

20   on.

21               MR. FISHER:        No, that's not the holding of

22   the Berghuis case, with all due respect.                   The Berghuis

23   case was about whether his subsequent statements could

24   be used against him.     This Court didn't hold that his

25   silence that preceded those statements could be used

                                      4

 1   against him, and, indeed, that would be contrary to

 2   Miranda itself in footnote 37, where the Court said, if

 3   somebody stands mute in a custodial setting in the face

 4   of law enforcement accusations, they may not be -

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Then what's the law?              What

 6   is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of

 7   his tax return.     The IRS gets it.                     Later, it turns out

 8   to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he

 9   left this blank.     Okay?

10                  Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right.

11                  MR. FISHER:        If the -

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean, isn't it -- you're

13   not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell

14   the government anything and, later on, it turns out to

15   be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken

16   as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.                        I mean, do you

17   want to go that far?

18                  MR. FISHER:        No, I don't need to.

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.           Then you need a

20   line.

21                  MR. FISHER:        This case is -

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Then what is -- then you

23   need a line.     So where is -- there's the tax case; then

24   we have a case they're selling tickets to the

25   policeman's ball, and somebody comes to the door, and

                                         5

 1   the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around

 2   before, and he doesn't answer.               Okay?    Now, that's

 3   probably not an invocation.

 4               And then we have the clear line, which, in

 5   custody, and, now, you want to extend that line.                    And so

 6   what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend

 7   it, what line do I draw?

 8               MR. FISHER:        Well, it's sufficient to decide

 9   this case to say that a noncustodial police interview

10   during the investigation of a crime, where they're

11   interviewing somebody about -

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            So then -

13               MR. FISHER:        -- who is -- who is, as the

14   State concedes, a suspect in a crime.                 Now, it may well

15   be that Griffin extends a little bit further, and,

16   remember, the Solicitor General at least agrees that

17   Griffin applies in a noncustodial setting.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but it's -- it's

19   well settled that, when you're -- wherein you're

20   examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly

21   says, I don't want any more questions, that

22   that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're

23   examining a witness on the stand.

24               So, against that background, suppose, in

25   this case, the facts were just about the same, and he

                                      6

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   said what -- the police said, what would you do if we

 2   matched the shotgun shells?             And he said -- he said,

 3   "Well" -- and then he starts to cry.                      He said one word,

 4   "Well," and he started to cry.                Admissible?

 5                MR. FISHER:        I think that would be

 6   admissible, but it would be forbidden for the -

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Because he said, "Well"?

 8                MR. FISHER:        Yes.        That word would be

 9   admissible if the State had -

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But -- but could the

11   police officer also testify that and then he started to

12   cry?

13                MR. FISHER:        Perhaps.               But the State -- what

14   the State would not be able to do would be to argue that

15   his silence and refusal to answer the question

16   demonstrated his guilt.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Or the prosecution could

18   say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he

19   never told us anything else.              That -- that final

20   sentence that I used is impermissible?

21                MR. FISHER:        I think that may well cross the

22   line.   You have the exact issue that arises already in

23   custodial settings, where, under Doyle and footnote 37

24   of Miranda, you've held that silence can't be used

25   against a criminal defendant.

                                       7

 1               So, Justice Kennedy, you're right, that

 2   questions will arise in two ways:                     One is whether words

 3   that the defendant uses are tantamount to refusing to

 4   answer the question, and then there is a second question

 5   about physical demeanor evidence.

 6               The law is already sorted out on this in the

 7   lower courts, and I think it's a very workable test.

 8   The Solicitor General agrees with what it is, and the

 9   reason why this Court hasn't seen a case or -- itself,

10   seen a case like that is because, once the rule is

11   established that the prosecution can't use silence

12   against the defendant, the temptation drops away to try

13   to introduce that evidence for some, supposedly,

14   different purpose.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Fisher, but then -

16   do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying

17   demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible

18   to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked

19   down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he

20   was shuffling his feet.

21               MR. FISHER:         Insofar as demeanor evidence

22   that the State offers has communicative values and the

23   State argues that it has communicative value,

24   independent of, simply, what the defendant looked like

25   when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be

                                      8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   able to introduce that evidence.

 2               Now, as I said, as I was just finishing up

 3   telling Justice Kennedy, you're not going to have hard

 4   cases in this respect because, once the temptation -

 5   once it's clear that silence can't be used, then the

 6   prosecution, I think, has little motivation to try to

 7   walk that line.

 8               And, indeed, I think it would be appropriate

 9   in a case, if the prosecution said, look, the fact that

10   the defendant started crying, we think, is relevant for

11   some reason independent of what he -- of failing to

12   answer the question.      The jury could be instructed, as

13   they are in Griffin -- Griffin settings already, that

14   you aren't to consider the defendant's refusal to answer

15   the question against him, but -

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Fisher, I -- I have

17   a number of problems.       The first is your rule would be

18   seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights

19   than those defendants in custody because you're arguing

20   that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression,

21   other than silence, would be needed to show the

22   invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.

23               MR. FISHER:         No.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Or are you trying to

25   equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and

                                       9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   noncustodial, with respect to invocation?

 2                MR. FISHER:        No.       And I -- and this is where

 3   Justice Ginsburg's question came from, so I think it's

 4   very important for me to be clear on this.

 5                A person in a noncustodial setting still has

 6   fewer rights than a person in a custodial setting.                    What

 7   the Court held in Berghuis is that, if the defendant

 8   wants to exercise his prophylactic right under Miranda

 9   to cut off police questioning -- those are the words

10   this Court used -- that has to be expressly invoked in

11   some manner during the interrogation.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               The problem -- I have an

13   easier problem understanding this argument with

14   respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with

15   respect to the situation in which someone is approached

16   by the police and said, come in and talk to us.                    I have

17   a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk

18   to them could be held against them.                    There, I understand

19   it.

20                But, here, your defendant went in and

21   talked.   So, once he chose to do that, why does he get

22   more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for

23   2-and-a-half hours?     The Court wasn't willing to find

24   that that was an invocation of the privilege against

25   self-incrimination.     Why would it find the refusal to

                                      10

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ask one -- answer one question indicative of the

 2   privilege against silence -- or the privilege for

 3   silence?

 4               MR. FISHER:         Let me -- if I may, let me

 5   focus on the Berghuis question.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I know -

 7               MR. FISHER:         And then turn to the selective

 8   silence point.   The reason why he doesn't have --

 9   Mr. Salinas doesn't have the right that Mr. Berghuis had

10   to cut off questioning.         That's the right that has to be

11   expressly invoked, and it, indeed, can only be

12   effectuated in this setting.

13               There was no issue in Berghuis, I don't

14   think, that his silence could be used against him.                   The

15   State never argued in the Berghuis case that, because he

16   failed to answer for 2 hours, that shows he's guilty.

17   What the State argued in Berghuis was the fact that he

18   later confessed is what shows that he is guilty.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Is -- I don't want -- are

20   you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required,

21   you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment?

22               MR. FISHER:         No.       You can.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I mean -- that's my -

24   that's how I understood that.

25               MR. FISHER:         You can.               There's two

                                      11

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   different rights -

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I know you're not arguing

 3   that, but that's why I'm -

 4               MR. FISHER:         Let me separate two rights.

 5   One is the prophylactic right under Miranda to have

 6   police cease asking you questions.                    That's one right,

 7   and that right has to be expressly invoked in some

 8   manner during the interrogation, after you've been

 9   warned, in order to effectuate it.

10               There is a separate right, which is the

11   genuine Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.                    And

12   this Court said, in Miranda itself and it's never

13   questioned since, that that right doesn't have to be

14   expressly invoked.     So the question is -

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but it can be

16   invoked, and that might make a big difference.                    In

17   your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most

18   citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right.

19               MR. FISHER:         Right.         So, I think, Justice

20   Kennedy -

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And so if there's -- if

22   questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking

23   my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in

24   custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply.

25               MR. FISHER:         Right.

 1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And your client didn't do

 2   that here.

 3                  MR. FISHER:        He didn't.              And so the

 4   question -- I think, unless the Court's prepared to hold

 5   that even an expressed invocation could be used against

 6   him, then it reduces the question you framed, Justice

 7   Kennedy.     And so ask yourself whether there's any good

 8   reason to require an express invocation in that setting.

 9                  Mr. Salinas, remember, did expressly invoke

10   his right to -- Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,

11   at trial, in a timely manner, asking for the evidence to

12   be excluded.     So the question is whether there's a

13   reason to ask him to do it sooner.                       And our argument is

14   it's unnecessary, unfair, and a rule like that would be

15   unadministrable.     So let me walk through those, if I

16   can.

17                  It's unnecessary because all the cases the

18   Solicitor General cites for an express invocation

19   principle involve a scenario where the government has no

20   good reason to know that it's seeking incriminatory

21   information.

22                  And, Justice Breyer, this is the limiting

23   principle that you were searching for in the tax cases

24   and the like.     If the government doesn't know or have

25   good reason to know that the defendant who is silent is

                                        13

 1   likely to be exercising his right, then the government

 2   needs to be put on notice because the government may -

 3   may well challenge, may well go seek a court order.                     It

 4   may well decide to grant immunity.                     It may do a number

 5   of things.

 6                But, here, the government would do

 7   absolutely nothing different.               Police would have done

 8   absolutely nothing different.               Indeed, look at the

 9   record in this case.      What the Solicitor General says is

10   that Mr. Salinas should have said, "I refuse to answer

11   that question," and, if he had said that, everything

12   would be different.

13                But look at what the State argued at trial

14   and what the officer testified.                 The officer testified,

15   when we asked him that question, he wouldn't answer.

16   The prosecution argued to the jury, he refused to answer

17   that question.   So there is no ambiguity in the setting,

18   whether he was remaining silent.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, yes, there's no doubt

20   he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was

21   trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right.

22                Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the

23   situation, where either the individual expressly raises

24   his right or, at the least, it's a fair implication from

25   the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right,

                                      14

 1   would that be a sensible rule?

 2               And, if so, how would your case stack up?

 3               MR. FISHER:        Yes.        I think, as long as the

 4   latter part of that test, Justice Breyer -- can be

 5   satisfied by exercising the right, that is remaining

 6   silent -

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            It depends on the

 8   circumstance.

 9               MR. FISHER:        -- in a setting in which -- in

10   a setting in which the government has every good reason

11   to know that the person is most likely to be relying on

12   the Fifth Amendment.     And, here, where they are

13   investigating a murder and bringing in somebody as a

14   suspect and asking him, basically, did you commit the

15   crime, I think it's a fair assumption -- at least absent

16   any clarification by the police -- remember, when he was

17   silent, the police would have had every right to say,

18   Mr. Salinas, why aren't you answering the question?

19               And so the police could clarify.               But,

20   absent any clarification from either the police or the

21   suspect, the more likely than not scenario -- and that's

22   the test the Solicitor General agrees should be used -

23   the more likely than not conclusion there is that he is

24   exercising the right.      Now -

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How would you deal with

                                     15

 1   another common situation where a defendant meets up with

 2   the police, gives a story, and then, later, changes the

 3   story.     And the question is asked at trial, you never

 4   volunteered that story to the -- to the police when they

 5   questioned you.

 6                  Would that be silence, to you?                 Would that

 7   be an invocation of his right not to incriminate

 8   himself?     Or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred

 9   from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to

10   say this, but not that, so this is a made-up story.

11                  MR. FISHER:        No, Justice Sotomayor, for two

12   reasons:     One is, if I understood your hypothetical, it

13   sounded like the defendant may have been on the stand,

14   and that would be an impeachment scenario that's

15   entirely different.       But even -

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Now, sometimes, they

17   come back and later do a different confession.

18                  MR. FISHER:        Right.          So but -- but even if

19   that were the case, then that would be basically using

20   his statement against him.               And so a material omission

21   from a statement is not the same as silence.                    Here,

22   Mr. Salinas was silent.

23                  Now, it's also not just that there's no good

24   reason to require some sort of magic words to be spoken

25   by the suspect, but it's unfair.                    Remember, the States

 1   tell you, in their amicus brief, that, if you affirm in

 2   this case and adopt the rule they're asking you for,

 3   police officers are going to tell people in its custody,

 4   which would be nothing more than an accurate statement

 5   of the law, sir, if you are silent in response to any of

 6   our questions, the prosecution is going to argue that

 7   that -- that shows that you're guilty.

 8                They're also going to have every good reason

 9   to bring people in.       I think this goes a little bit to

10   Justice Kennedy's question and -- and perhaps just yours

11   as well, the fact that Mr. Salinas did agree to commence

12   this interview.     Remember, he agreed -

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Well, he's not in

14   custody.   So let's say he's answering the questions.

15   All of a sudden, he gets a particular question, and he

16   says, you know, it's getting late, I think I'm done, and

17   going to go home.     Is that an invocation of the Fifth

18   Amendment right?

19                MR. FISHER:          I think you'd have to ask that

20   to the Solicitor General.             I don't -- I'm not the one

21   requiring an invocation.            And that is part of the

22   administrability problem that the rule raises.                       I have

23   no idea of all the permutations, one of which you've

24   raised -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Well, is that

                                        17

 1   something -

 2                 MR. FISHER:        -- but you can imagine many

 3   more.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Is that something

 5   that could be used against him at trial?

 6                 MR. FISHER:        It can be introduced.              It's

 7   hard to understand how that is probative, the fact that

 8   he said, I have to leave now, it's time to go.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, it's probative

10   if that he says that -- he's answering all the

11   questions, they're fine.           All of a sudden, they say,

12   well, is your shotgun going to match the shell?

13                 MR. FISHER:        Yeah.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Then he goes, gosh,

15   it's late, I'm going to go home.                   That seems as -

16                 (Laughter.)

17                 MR. FISHER:        Well -

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    That seems as

19   probative as the silence.

20                 MR. FISHER:        Well -- and so -- what the

21   State cannot do is what it did in this case and sort of

22   transform that into he refused to answer, and,

23   therefore, it shows he's guilty.

24                 And, if I could go back to the part of the

25   unfairness and the difficulty here, it's not -- it's

                                       18

 1   just that -- yes, Mr. Salinas did come to the police

 2   station, but remember why he came to the police station,

 3   because they said, we want to bring you in to clear you

 4   as a suspect, to get elimination prints.

 5               So he was effectively told to come in, so

 6   that we can clear you as a suspect, asked perfectly

 7   innocuous questions at the beginning of the interview,

 8   and then everything shifted on a dime to this one

 9   "gotcha" question.

10               And I think it's perfectly reasonable and

11   customary in out-of-court settings, where the defendant

12   isn't on the stand and so telling some story, now,

13   trying to backtrack it, but out of court, to be able to

14   selectively exercise your right to silence, when you

15   feel, now, law enforcement is turning against me.

16               And, remember -- this is the other part

17   about, Justice Kennedy, your question.                  Of course,

18   people know they have a right to remain silent, so why

19   not -- why not ask them to invoke it?

20               Remember, people in this setting generally

21   don't have lawyers.      They don't have a right to lawyers.

22   What does the layperson know?                The layperson knows, I

23   have a right to remain silent.                 That's what the

24   layperson knows.     The layperson doesn't know I have to

25   say some sort of magic words.

 1                 And the police, believe me, aren't going to

 2   tell him that he does, in order to -

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Would you draw a distinction

 4   between Mr. Salinas's situation and someone who's

 5   questioned in the home -- in the person's home or on the

 6   street?

 7                 MR. FISHER:        No, I don't think there is a

 8   relevant distinction there, Justice Alito, as long as an

 9   investigatory interview -- and this Court has said, time

10   and again, whether it's Berkemer in a traffic stop or -

11   or Royer, that the police can try to initiate consensual

12   encounters.    And the Court has said, time and again,

13   that people don't have to participate in them, and they

14   can cut them off at any time.

15                 And it would be odd -

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:            And what if -- what if the

17   person -- what if the person was totally unknown to the

18   police, but called up the police and said they want -

19   and wants to talk to them for some purpose.              You

20   wouldn't draw a distinction between that situation?

21                 MR. FISHER:        In -- well, if he wants to talk

22   to them -

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:            He wants to talk to them

24   and -

25                 MR. FISHER:        -- I'm not sure he has the

 1   right to remain silent, no.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:            He wants to talk to them,

 3   and then, in the course of this conversation, the same

 4   thing happens that happened here.

 5                MR. FISHER:        I think that might, depending

 6   on the precision of the hypothetical, be a little bit of

 7   a difficult -- different case.                But, if the person said,

 8   I want to talk to you about criminal activity, started

 9   giving statements about a -- about a past crime, so it

10   was an investigatory interview, I think it may well

11   apply.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You're -- you're giving us

13   Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area.

14   That -- that's what you're arguing.                    You want a gray

15   area opinion to be written?

16                MR. FISHER:        No, I don't want a gray area

17   opinion.   Remember, Justice Kennedy, at least the

18   Solicitor General -- and I'll let the State speak for

19   itself -- but the Solicitor General agrees that Griffin

20   rule applies in a noncustodial setting.

21                I -- I totally understand there's a bright

22   line between custody and noncustody, and so a custodial

23   suspect is in a different situation than a noncustodial

24   suspect.

25                But all I'm saying is, again, in agreement

                                      21

 1   with the Solicitor General, whereas all we disagree on

 2   is whether the magic words need to be spoken, that a

 3   person who is at least in a police investigatory

 4   setting, and so the police would reasonably expect that

 5   a failure to speak or answer your question was relying

 6   on a Fifth Amendment -

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I -- I'm assuming, now

 8   that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue

 9   that, even in a custodial setting, a prosecutor couldn't

10   say, I asked him, did he shoot his wife, and the

11   prosecutor can't argue that, because he refused to

12   answer, that makes him guilty.

13                 MR. FISHER:        That's precisely what the Court

14   said already in Footnote 37 in Miranda, what the lower

15   courts have depended on for a generation now, and I

16   don't think my opponents are even arguing to the

17   contrary.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, in fact, at most

19   trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence

20   is not the unanswered question.                  It's the question plus

21   the answer.

22                 MR. FISHER:        Right.          Right.   Fair enough.    I

23   think that's perfectly well-established law.                   And so the

24   reason is, is there any reason to distinguish for

25   purposes of the Griffin rule -- I understand there's

                                       22

 1   reasons to distinguish in the -- in the settings that

 2   Berghuis raises, but, for purposes of the Griffin rule,

 3   is there any reason to distinguish between a custodial

 4   and a noncustodial setting?

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.           Well, but, yes.   The

 6   answer is going to be yes because we're going to hear it

 7   in one minute because, as you say, it follows a fortiori

 8   for Berghuis, you know, it's -- if you're going to have

 9   to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth

10   Amendment right, when you're not in an inherently

11   coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the

12   argument.

13                 MR. FISHER:        No, but -- but -

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You're not in an inherently

15   coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation,

16   you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations,

17   you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth

18   Amendment -

19                 MR. FISHER:        No.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            -- or tap on the

21   Constitution or something in order to indicate -

22                 MR. FISHER:        No.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            -- that's what's at issue

24   and that's what -

 1   crucial.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.

 3                MR. FISHER:         If Mr. Salinas had been in a -

 4   if everything about the case was identical, but he'd

 5   been in custody, there would be no argument that his

 6   silence could be used against him.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:             Right.         And that's saying

 8   because, there, we have a line.                  It's called the

 9   in-custody line.   Once you get outside of custody -

10                MR. FISHER:         But it's not because of the

11   physical or inherent pressures of custody because what

12   the Court has said, time and again, is that, after

13   somebody receives their Miranda warnings, they have a

14   free and deliberate choice whether to talk.                     And so -

15                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, I don't want to make

16   the government's argument for them.                     They'll make it

17   very well.

18                MR. FISHER:         Well, no, but I do want -- I do

19   want to make sure that the Court understands the

20   critical difference between the express invocation

21   requirement that this Court established in Berghuis and

22   what I'm asking for today.

23                And the express invocation requirement in

24   Berghuis is the -- is -- is to administer the Miranda

25   prophylactic rule, that the police have to stop asking

                                       24

 1   somebody questions when they invoke their rights, the

 2   rights they've just been advised of, remember.

 3                  It didn't hold in Berghuis and it -- and

 4   it's never held that, if somebody is Mirandized -- and

 5   let's say Mr. Berghuis was Mirandized and just remained

 6   silent for two hours, and then the police said to

 7   themselves, oh, this guy is never going to talk, we end

 8   the interview, there would have been no argument the

 9   State could have made in that case, that his silence

10   could be used against him.

11                  And so I understand that -- that -- you

12   know, I'm -- that custody is different, but, in terms of

13   the express invocation requirement, there's no express

14   invocation requirement in custody, and there's no reason

15   for it here.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:            So I think the argument

17   will be, I think -- it is, at least in my mind, that if,

18   after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an

19   hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm -

20   I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but, if -- when

21   he answers -- doesn't answer over that long period of

22   time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that

23   long period of behavior is insufficient without the

24   express statement to show that he wanted to remain

25   silent, so, outside custodial setting, should it be

                                        25

 1   insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you

 2   see, it's argument by analogy, I think -

 3               MR. FISHER:           I understand, but his silence

 4   wasn't able to be used against him in Berghuis; his

 5   state -- his later statements were.                      And so, yes, you

 6   could have a scenario -

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:               Isn't the -- isn't the

 8   point, Mr. Fisher -

 9               MR. FISHER:           Pardon?

10               JUSTICE KAGAN:               The question is:         What is it

11   insufficient for?     In Berghuis, it was insufficient for

12   the purpose of cutting off police questions.

13               MR. FISHER:           Exactly.

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:               That's not the case here.

15   The question here is whether it's sufficient or

16   insufficient for the purpose of allowing his -- his

17   silence to be used against him at trial.

18               MR. FISHER:           Precisely.

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:               That's an entirely different

20   question, isn't it?

21               MR. FISHER:           That's exactly my point.             And

22   remember, again, the layperson in this setting who

23   knows -- if there's one thing the layperson knows and

24   most every American knows, is that they have a right to

25   remain silent.   So somebody nervous in this setting,

 1   without a lawyer, the one sanctuary they have is simply

 2   not to talk.

 3                  If you issue an opinion that says, as the

 4   Solicitor General would like, you have to pronounce some

 5   sort of magic words, it's terribly unfair and terribly

 6   misleading and, again, for no good reason.                       And it

 7   raises all kinds of administrability problems.                       The

 8   Court is going to have an absolute, I think, flood of

 9   cases of all the permutations of somebody under

10   different kind of police warnings or the other that may

11   be given ahead of time and different kind of verbal

12   formulations.

13                  Maybe he says, I'd like to talk about

14   something else.     Maybe he says, as the Chief Justice

15   explained, I'm going to leave now.                       Maybe he actually

16   just doesn't show up for the interview.                       There is

17   innumerable permutations.             The easy rule -

18                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Unless you're going to argue

19   that -- that silence cannot be -- can never be commented

20   on in any noncustodial situation -- and I didn't think

21   you were willing to go that far when I was questioning

22   you previously -- you're going to have the same kind of

23   line-drawing questions, aren't you?

24                  MR. FISHER:        No.

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Where was it held?          What was

                                        27

 1   the nature?     Who initiated it?               Was the person really

 2   under suspicion?     What was the purpose of the -- of the

 3   questioning?

 4                  MR. FISHER:        So as to where -- as to where

 5   you draw the line, if I understand your question, as to

 6   where an express invocation before trial would be

 7   required, you are going to have to draw a line.                  I think

 8   it's very easy to draw the line and just say a police

 9   investigatory interview because that's the setting where

10   the police have every reason to believe that silence is

11   an exercise of the right.

12                  All the other settings, whether they be tax

13   settings, whether they be immigration cases, all the

14   totally disparate settings the Solicitor General cites

15   cases involving, it's perfectly reasonable to require an

16   advance invocation there.

17                  But, remember, the Court said in Chavez that

18   the Fifth Amendment is a trial right, and so invoking it

19   at trial is perfectly timely in the ordinary setting.

20   The only question is whether you should have some sort

21   of special requirement for special reason.                  We think

22   there is no good reason, and it would be very unfair.

23                  I'd like to -

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I guess, as I understand

25   your rule -- I'm sorry.           I'll ask it on rebuttal.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Thank you, counsel.

 3                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN K. CURRY

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5                MR. CURRY:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7                Absent an invocation, a defendant's failure

 8   to answer a question during a noncustodial, voluntary

 9   interview should not be protected by the Fifth

10   Amendment.   It should be -

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 But why, counsel?       I

12   mean, really, what you're saying is, merely because I

13   asked you the question and you choose not to answer, it

14   makes you guilty.

15                MR. CURRY:         Well -

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 It -- no problem.       Here,

17   you're asking about the crime of investigation.                       But you

18   could have asked him, did you kill Joe Blow on another

19   street, and, if he had remained silent, you would be

20   arguing that proves he is guilty, I could introduce that

21   at trial.

22                And you would be arguing it would be

23   sufficient to convict him, that you merely asked the

24   question and he remained silent about it shows his

25   guilt.

 1               MR. CURRY:        Yeah, I don't know that that

 2   would be sufficient to convict him.                   And that -- that

 3   hypothetical might suggest that the probative value of

 4   that particular failure to answer a question was less -

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               It's a little scary to

 6   me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt.

 7               MR. CURRY:        Well -

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               He is not arguing that

 9   the physical response is not admissible.                   He is just

10   arguing that the mere asking of a question and a failure

11   to answer it, you can't argue, as a prosecutor, that

12   that shows someone is guilty.

13               MR. CURRY:        I think one of the things we are

14   asking the Court to do, Justice Sotomayor, is to

15   recognize that silence, certainly, as occurred in this

16   case, doesn't always occur in a vacuum.                   And the

17   defendant's failure to answer this question, accompanied

18   by things that he did, along with or contemporaneously

19   with -- you know, the shuffling of the feet, the biting

20   of the bottom lip -- revealed a guilty conscience on his

21   part.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it would be up to the

23   jury, wouldn't it?     The jury might well agree with

24   Justice Sotomayor, that it doesn't prove anything that

25   he answered a question, right?

 1                MR. CURRY:       Right.          I mean -

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The question is whether you

 3   can ask the jury to consider that.

 4                MR. CURRY:       Correct.            And I think that's --

 5   I think that's the import of our argument.                  And we've

 6   referenced this Court's language in Baxter, to that

 7   extent, that a jury can give what weight they wish to

 8   give it, but the -

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Your -- my hypothetical

10   that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say,

11   come in for questioning, and you ignore them, is that an

12   invocation of the right to silence or not?

13                MR. CURRY:       I don't know that that's an

14   invocation, Your Honor, but I don't know -

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Why -- why could you

16   argue that that's -

17                MR. CURRY:       Number one, I don't think a

18   prosecutor ever would argue that because that's

19   ambiguous and not probative, and I think -- not

20   probative for someone just to not come in when police

21   offer them a chance to come in.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               They -- then they're

23   arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that

24   situation.

25                MR. CURRY:       Right.          The legal theory of

                                      31

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   guilt in that situation would be lessened than it is in

 2   this case because there is no -- there is nothing to

 3   suggest that that defendant was guilty, necessarily,

 4   because he decided not to show up to the police.

 5                 But, here, in this situation, the

 6   defendant's failure to answer the question, accompanied

 7   by the other things that he did, did reveal a guilty

 8   conscience on his part.          And it was nothing to reflect

 9   that he was trying -

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.      So why is

11   it -- would it be admissible that someone decides -

12   someone comes in, and they say -- police say to him or

13   her, we are investigating this crime, help us.                     They

14   start asking questions, and it's clear from the first

15   question -- there is a waiver of Miranda, and, from the

16   first question, the first question is, did you kill this

17   person?

18                 The guy remains silent.                   They ask a whole

19   bunch of other questions, and he remains silent.                     Had -

20   has he invoked his right?

21                 MR. CURRY:       I don't believe he has, Your

22   Honor.    I mean, if he -- you said he was provided

23   Miranda rights, so maybe they feel he is in custody or

24   not, but -

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So a prosecutor could go

                                       32

 1   into the jury and say, he waived his Miranda rights, and

 2   he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions?

 3                  MR. CURRY:       He is guilty if he revealed a

 4   guilty conscience, Your Honor.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            He wouldn't say that.         He

 6   would say one of the indications of his guilt is that he

 7   refused to answer the question.                   No prosecutor would

 8   argue that, that alone, would support a conviction,

 9   right?

10                  MR. CURRY:       Correct, Your Honor.           And that's

11   not what we're -- that's not what we are asking the

12   Court to do here.     We're not asking the Court to say

13   that, every time silence occurs, that's necessarily

14   going to be probative, and every time silence occurs,

15   that's necessarily going to be something that we

16   utilize.

17                  We're merely saying that, in this particular

18   situation, the defendant needs to tell something to the

19   police in order to reveal that he is relying on a

20   constitutional right and not merely having -

21                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'm sorry.      Just to nail

22   that down because your first three words were "absent an

23   invocation."

24                  MR. CURRY:       Yes, Your Honor.

25                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Are you -- are you, now,

 1   adopting the Solicitor General's argument?             Because your

 2   brief goes further.     So are you, now, saying that the

 3   crucial thing is the invocation?

 4                MR. CURRY:       I believe that has been our

 5   position, Your Honor.       I believe -- we do have some

 6   alternative argues, as well, based upon this Court's

 7   jurisprudence.   But I think the government and we both

 8   agree that the defendant in this particular situation

 9   would need to invoke.

10                And that is the basis upon which we proceed.

11   And we are not proceeding just upon Berghuis v.

12   Thompkins.

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:            And so you would agree with

14   the government that, if he had invoked, that the Fifth

15   Amendment right would come into play?

16                MR. CURRY:       We would not attempt to -- we

17   would not attempt to introduce anything, for example "I

18   plead the Fifth," "I don't want to talk any more,"

19   something like that, No, we would not be introducing

20   that.   I do believe that would be a rule -- you know, a

21   violation of the rule -

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's the line you're

23   drawing, between his -- his just not answering and his

24   saying, I don't want to answer?

25                MR. CURRY:       Correct, if I understand your

 1   question.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:               The latter can't be

 3   introduce to the jury, but the former can?

 4               MR. CURRY:          Correct.            That's the rule -

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Why would you -- why would

 6   you draw that -- that line?

 7               MR. CURRY:          I think, Your Honor, I would not

 8   want to -- I would not want to introduce a statement

 9   that a defendant was relying on a constitutional right

10   by saying, "I don't want to talk any more," as opposed

11   to the mere silence, which might be probative, in

12   conjunction with other evidence.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Doesn't the mere silence

14   suggest, "I don't want to talk anymore"?

15               MR. CURRY:          It might, but it also might

16   suggest that he's having difficulty coming up with an

17   exculpatory response.         It might suggest that he can't

18   think of a good answer.           It might suggest that he is

19   worried about the question and he is thinking more about

20   how worried he is about the question than how he wants

21   to respond to it.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Particularly since

23   he did want to talk some more, right?

24               MR. CURRY:          Correct.            He continued to

25   respond -- you know, several questions thereafter,

 1   continuing to provide exculpatory responses.

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But isn't the most

 3   logical inference from the silence not that he isn't

 4   quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but

 5   that it would incriminate him if he answered?

 6                  MR. CURRY:       Yes, Your Honor.         That may be -

 7   that may be a permissible inference, but I do not

 8   believe that that necessarily means that he was invoking

 9   his -- his Fifth Amendment right because he did continue

10   to talk.     He already knew what the police were

11   investigating.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But he could -- he could

13   invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to one set of

14   questions and not another, and what's disturbing me

15   about your position, if it's -- if you have -- someone

16   being interrogated, who is savvy, will say, "I plead the

17   Fifth."     And somebody who is not that smart is just

18   silent.     To make a difference between those two people

19   on whether comment can be made on the failure to respond

20   is troublesome.

21                  MR. CURRY:       Your Honor, I think that would

22   be consistent with this Court's jurisprudence to -- to

23   allow the use of evidence, if there was no invocation

24   involved.     In Jenkins v. Anderson, Justice Stevens

25   recognized the importance of an invocation, even in -

                                        36

 1   even in that type of situation.

 2                 This Court -- it's not just Berghuis v.

 3   Thompkins that we're relying upon, where the Court has

 4   recognized the necessity of an invocation.                   Garner v.

 5   United States says the same thing, that -- that an

 6   invocation is necessary for Fifth Amendment rights.

 7                 And I know that we don't have a case that is

 8   squarely on -- on four with this one.                   But all the

 9   defendant would have to say is, I don't want to talk

10   anymore, or I don't want to answer that question, and

11   then we would be in a completely different posture at

12   this point.

13                 But, here, the -- the defendant failed to

14   answer a question and did other things that revealed a

15   guilty conscience on his part.                 And that is precisely

16   the type of evidence that we believe that we can

17   introduce.

18                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            But, Mr. Curry, in a case

19   like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the

20   defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone

21   through the entire interview and, really, never said a

22   word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but

23   he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not

24   go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him

25   questions, and he didn't talk.

                                       37

 1               That would be off limits.                  And the question

 2   is, if that's off limits, why shouldn't this be off

 3   limits as well?   If there's no invocation necessary

 4   there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was

 5   saying, why should there be an invocation requirement

 6   here?

 7               MR. CURRY:        Well, number one, because the

 8   hypotheticals are different.              In -- in our particular

 9   situation, the defendant did answer questions and only

10   did -- you know, fail to answer one particular question.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Yes.       I -- I understand

12   that, in your case, there happens to be a kind of

13   selective answering sort of question, but let's say -

14   let's take that out of the picture, all right?                  And just

15   say -- you know, he just didn't want to answer

16   questions, all right?       So then the question is, why

17   would that case be any different from the case that I

18   posited?

19               MR. CURRY:        Okay.         In -- in Berghuis v.

20   Thompkins, this Court looked at the ambiguous nature of

21   whether or not the invocation had occurred.                  If, in your

22   hypothetical, the defendant failed to answer any

23   questions whatsoever -

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:             He -- he didn't invoke.        He

25   just didn't answer.

                                      38

 1                 MR. CURRY:       But it could be a suggestion

 2   where he was attempting to exercise the -- the right

 3   because he never answered anything.                       But, in our

 4   situation, the defendant can't be said to have been

 5   doing that.    He can't be said to have been exercising

 6   the right because he failed to answer a question, but

 7   answered several other questions.

 8                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Okay.           So you're pinning

 9   your argument really, on the fact that he did a lot of

10   answering.

11                 MR. CURRY:       That's one of the reasons, Your

12   Honor.

13                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            On this -- on this, you

14   know, you can't pick and choose kind of argument.

15                 MR. CURRY:       Well, we're saying that you

16   cannot infer an assertion of a Fifth Amendment right

17   based upon this.    We cannot infer that he was

18   necessarily asserting his Fifth Amendment right, whether

19   to cut off questioning or stop talking altogether,

20   or -- you know -

21                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            So would it be fair to say

22   that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep

23   talking and talking and talking and -- and, at that

24   point, you have to invoke?              If -- if you've been doing a

25   lot of talking and then decide you want to stay silent,

                                       39

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   at that point, you have to invoke.                       But that's not to

 2   say that you have to invoke in every noncustodial

 3   encounter.     Is that your argument?

 4                  MR. CURRY:       No.       I think you need to invoke

 5   in every -- every noncustodial encounter if -- if you do

 6   not want the things that you say to be utilized against

 7   you.     If you -- if you want to -- you know, if you want

 8   to be prevented from that evidence being utilized, you

 9   have to say, I don't want to talk anymore, or I plead

10   the Fifth, or whatever the words -

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            But I thought you said he

12   didn't have to do that, if he didn't answer any

13   questions, didn't you?          Isn't that what you said?

14                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            You took the words out of my

15   mouth.

16                  MR. CURRY:       No, no.           If he didn't answer any

17   questions, then -- then it would be drawn closer

18   to -- to Berghuis v. Thompkins, in which this -

19                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but, in Berghuis, we

20   found no implication.

21                  MR. CURRY:       Correct.            Correct.     But if -

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So -- so Justice Kagan's

23   question stands.

24                  MR. CURRY:       But -- but the defendant in

25   Berghuis did answer some questions, Your Honor, and

                                        40

 1   that's what makes it different from Berghuis.                        In -- in

 2   that -- in that case, the defendant did ultimately -

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, a few, as I recall.

 4                 MR. CURRY:        Correct.            He -

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Mr. Curry, Berghuis is

 6   different for a different reason.                        Berghuis is different

 7   because the question in Berghuis is what do you have to

 8   do to make the police go away.                  Here, the police were

 9   not going away.     There was no -- there's no question of

10   that.   But the question is what do you have to do in

11   order to bar the prosecutor from introducing your

12   silence at trial.

13                 So that's a really different question, isn't

14   it?

15                 MR. CURRY:        Well, it is a different

16   question, but, here, I think the police were,

17   quote-unquote, "going away."                I mean, they -- they

18   finished their questioning at some point.                        And -

19                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Exactly.           That's why

20   Berghuis is irrelevant here because Berghuis said at a

21   certain point -- you know, you need to invoke in order

22   to stop questioning.        But -- but that's not what's at

23   issue here.

24                 MR. CURRY:        But this Court's case law still

25   requires an invocation.           And the rule we're asking this

 1   Court to adopt would, essentially, settle the split that

 2   largely exists in -

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:             What is that?           That is what

 4   I'm -- I'm uncertain about this.                    And they cite page

 5   468, note 37, of Miranda.

 6                 All right.        What is the law, in your opinion

 7   now, in respect to -- and what case would support this?

 8   A defendant comes in, he is warned and given his Miranda

 9   rights.    He says, fine, and then he proceeds to answer a

10   whole bunch of questions.

11                 Then they ask question number 432.                      He says

12   nothing.    You then go on to 433, 434, et cetera, and he

13   answers them all.     Okay?         At the trial, the lawyer -

14   the prosecutor wants to comment on the fact that, in the

15   face of that single question -- though answering many,

16   many more -- he remained silent.

17                 Does Griffin say he can -- the prosecutor

18   can make that comment, yes or no?                        And I'd appreciate

19   the government answering this question, too, because

20   they're -- if they -- are they speaking here?                        Or are

21   you doing the whole argument?

22                 MR. CURRY:        No, the government is also

23   arguing as well, Your Honor.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, that's -- I'd like to

25   get the same answer.

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                MR. CURRY:        Yes.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             Because I -- well, now,

 3   they cite for the proposition, I think, that it -- that

 4   the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note

 5   37 of Miranda.    Okay.      I just read it.

 6                MR. CURRY:        Correct.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:             And I -- may be ambiguous

 8   on the point.    It says you have the right to maintain

 9   immunity in the face of an accusation.

10                MR. CURRY:        Right.          I think the reliance of

11   on the footnote is -- is -

12                JUSTICE BREYER:             No, fine.      But what's your

13   opinion?   I mean, what is the law in respect to that

14   single point?    And at least to me, I'd -- I'd like to

15   know your opinion on that.

16                MR. CURRY:        Your Honor, I do not believe

17   that this Court has extended Griffin to this particular

18   type of fact situation, and Griffin wouldn't apply to

19   that.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:             Is there any authority, or

21   is it just your opinion that we have to go on?

22                MR. CURRY:        Well, I believe this Court would

23   have had the opportunity to extend Griffin, for example,

24   Doyle v. Ohio.    Basically, the Court did not do that.

25   This Court had the -- the opportunity to extend Griffin

                                       43

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in Fletcher v. Weir and did not do that.

 2               So I do not believe this Court has

 3   necessarily -- you know, sought to always attempt to

 4   extend Griffin in that situation.                     Now, we -- I see some

 5   ambiguity in the standing mute phrase from footnote 37.

 6   Does that mean not talking at all?                     Does that mean not

 7   answering one particular question?

 8               In your hypothetical, if it was as probative

 9   as it was in our case -- you know, that might be

10   something the prosecution would want to use without

11   violating the Fifth Amendment right because there's no

12   clear indication that the defendant did, in fact, rely

13   upon his Fifth Amendment right.

14               Now, I don't want to -- you know, misread

15   footnote 37, but that's how we read footnote 37 because

16   in the absence of -- there's many, many cases cited

17   there, and it's not clear that it's attempted to apply

18   an -- an extension of Griffin in that situation.

19               The rule we're -- we're offering here would

20   not -- would not change the law with regard to how it

21   exists in much of the Federal Circuits.                     In much of the

22   Federal Circuits, these defendants where -- where the

23   courts have held that we cannot utilize this evidence,

24   those defendants have, in fact, done something to

25   invoke.

                                     44

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  So I think the -- the rule that we're asking

 2   the Court to adopt would allow for these -- that case

 3   law to stand; i.e., if a defendant says, I don't want to

 4   talk anymore, I plead the Fifth -- you know, we're not

 5   asking this Court to issue a rule that says that we can

 6   introduce that.

 7                  All we're asking this Court to -- to

 8   introduce is consistent with this Court's case law that

 9   would require an invocation -- or some invocation that

10   the Fifth Amendment right was being relied upon and not

11   just a difficulty with the question or I can't think up

12   an exculpatory answer for that particular question, so I

13   don't know what to say.

14                  I mean, there, the defendant is not relying

15   upon a constitutional right.                And I think we're asking

16   this Court to -- to look at whether an inference has to

17   be made that the Fifth Amendment right is being done, or

18   perhaps another inference can be -- can be provided.

19   And Baxter v. Palmigiano allows for acquiescence -- you

20   know, to -- to be something that we can utilize against

21   a defendant.

22                  Here, the jury -

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Where does the

24   compulsion line come in?            Your adversary points out

25   that, under this scenario, the police can ask you

                                        45

 1   questions and say to you -- you know, if you stay quiet

 2   in this question, I'm going to use it against you at

 3   trial, that police will actually to that, that they'll

 4   actually come in and tell defendants who are telling the

 5   story -- you know, either answer or it'll be used

 6   against you.

 7                  MR. CURRY:       I could perceive then, Your

 8   Honor, the -- the trial court upholding a claim by the

 9   defendant that he was coerced at that point, that, at

10   that point, the officer -

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So why can't you say

12   that a call from a police officer to someone who says,

13   come in and talk, that that can't be used against them

14   at trial as -- you gave me a different answer.                  You said

15   it wasn't probative, but you didn't say Griffin would

16   protect that.

17                  MR. CURRY:       No, if -- no, if -- I don't know

18   that I would say Griffin is protecting it, but what I

19   would say is this Court's penalty jurisprudence would

20   say that, when a penalty flows directly from something

21   the defendant is -- you know, either saying or not

22   saying -- you know, that could be a problem.

23                  So when an officer says -- you know, I'm

 1   court might utilize as -- as -- for some sort of

 2   penalties flown.

 3               Justice -- Justice Stevens said, in his

 4   dissenting opinion, in McKune v. Lile, that there is an

 5   appreciable difference between some sort of sanction -

 6   official sanction being placed upon a -- you know, of

 7   essentially disobeying of an order, as opposed to a

 8   voluntary choice arising from -- from just a possible

 9   adverse consequence.

10               And, here, I think, the fact situation that

11   confronts this Court in this case is just the risk of an

12   adverse consequence and not something that necessarily

13   is going to occur.

14               However, if an officer says, I'm necessarily

15   going to use this against you, the adverse consequence

16   may become more -- more tangible at that point.          That

17   isn't the facts of this particular case.

18               I also want to disagree with Mr. Fisher with

19   regard to his suggestion that the police essentially

20   manipulated this.     If you look on the Joint Appendix,

21   page 14, lines 9 and 10, the officer clearly says that

22   he wants Mr. Salinas to come down to the police station

23   and talk, as well as do elimination fingerprints.

24               The officer had already been questioned.

25   These people knew we were investigating a double murder.

 1   These people knew that they were looking for a shotgun.

 2   They now have a shotgun that they got from the

 3   defendant.     So this defendant was not -- you know, all

 4   of a sudden, sprung on him the idea that they

 5   were -- you know, looking for him as a possible suspect

 6   at that point when they asked a ballistics question.

 9                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS,

10                FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

11                      SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

12                  MS. ANDERS:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13   please the Court:

14                  In Minnesota v. Murphy, this Court applied

15   the general rule that the Fifth Amendment privilege is

16   not self-executing and that a suspect must invoke it in

17   order to claim its protection to a noncustodial

18   interview in which the -- the probation officer doing

19   the questioning was aware that the questions that she

20   asked could be incriminating.

21                  The Court there held that because the

22   suspect had not invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, his

23   statements could be used against him as evidence at

24   trial.   A suspect's silence should similarly be

25   admissible against him when he fails to expressly invoke

                                        48

 1   the privilege.   Requiring invocation -

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  That is such a radical

 3   position, that silence is an admission of guilt.                  That's

 4   really what the argument is.                I certainly understand

 5   that speaking can implicate you, and, if you choose to

 6   speak, clearly, whatever you say can be used against

 7   you, unless you're in custody and unless you've invoked

 8   the right before.

 9               But this is radically different.                  We are -

10   we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and

11   omission are the same, but statements are different than

12   silence because, then, you're making the person who is

13   asking this question your -- your admission.                  You are

14   saying you're adopting their statement as true.

15               MS. ANDERS:           Well, I think the Court has

16   repeatedly recognized that, when a citizen is

17   voluntarily interacting with the police and there -

18   there is no coercion because it's not a custodial

19   situation, we expect that person to be treated as fully

20   capable of deciding whether or not to assert his rights.

21               This is what the Court said in United States

22   v. Drayton in an analogous context, which is whether

23   someone has voluntarily consented to a search.                  The

24   person, even if he is not told that -- that he can

25   refuse to -- to consent, we still assume that he knew

                                        49

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that he could refuse to consent, and, therefore, it was

 2   a voluntary choice.

 3               And I think you can draw the same inference

 4   here, that, when someone -- we -- I think we all agree

 5   that most people know -- people know what their Fifth

 6   Amendment rights are, and, therefore, they can assert

 7   them when they don't face any coercive pressure.

 8               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Ms. Anders -

 9               MS. ANDERS:        And so when the person does not

10   do that -

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'm sorry.      We don't require

12   invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in

13   a custodial setting.     And you might think, well,

14   custodial, that's very different because, after all,

15   custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole

16   point of Miranda warnings, is that, once we give Miranda

17   warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial

18   setting, essentially, becomes like a noncustodial

19   setting.

20               So, if we don't require invocation, even

21   after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting,

22   why should we require invocation here?

23               MS. ANDERS:        Well, I think the reason that

24   we don't require invocation in the Miranda setting, I

25   think, highlights the fundamental difference between

                                     50

 1   custodial interrogation and noncustodial interrogation.

 2   So, in the custodial setting, the Court has said

 3   that -- that the suspect faces inherent coercive

 4   pressures to confess -

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Yes, but then -

 6                  MS. ANDERS:        -- and, therefore -

 7                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- you're given the

 8   warnings, and then that's gone.

 9                  MS. ANDERS:        Exactly.               That's why we give

10   the warnings.     And, in the warnings, we promise the

11   suspect that his silence will not be used against him.

12   And so this is what the Court said in Doyle v. Ohio,

13   that, because of that promise, the suspect does not have

14   to expressly invoked, and his silence can't be used

15   against him.

16                  But, in the voluntary situation, we presume

17   that the suspect knows his rights, and, because he is

18   not facing any pressure, he can simply say, I don't want

19   to answer that question.            And so when he doesn't say

20   that -

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You've -- you've said in

22   your brief that there might be a whole other -- many

23   other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested

24   that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most

25   likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he

                                        51

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   fears incrimination.

 2               But what -- what obvious other reasons

 3   unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, why a defendant might

 4   remain silent?   I mean, the Griffin rule is he doesn't

 5   have to say, I plead the Fifth, because we assume that,

 6   when he doesn't take the stand, he is doing so because

 7   he doesn't want to incriminate himself.

 8               MS. ANDERS:         That's right.          The -- the

 9   Griffin rule says -- or it's premised on the idea that,

10   when you fail to testify at trial, you're inherently

11   exercising your Fifth Amendment right.

12               But I think, when you're looking at a -- a

13   noncustodial interrogation, the question whether the

14   person is trying to exercise his Fifth Amendment right,

15   I think the operative question is not whether he wants

16   to avoid inculpating himself, it's whether he wants to

17   refuse to answer as a matter of right.

18               And I think we know that because, if you

19   look at the interview as a whole, presumably, his

20   overarching motivation is not to inculpate himself.

21   That's why his statement -- his statements can be used

22   against him at trial because those statements we -

23   we've -- the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, those

24   statements are inconsistent with a desire to refuse to

25   answer as a matter of right.

                                      52

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Are you -- are you

 2   conceding the -- the point that they make?                   I -- that -

 3   that even if in the custodial setting he waives his

 4   Miranda right, he answers 500 questions, but doesn't

 5   answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot

 6   comment on that fact that he didn't answer that one?

 7                 MS. ANDERS:        I think that raises a

 8   different -

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Does it?       What do you

10   think?    He says, no, you can't, and he quotes Miranda.

11   Okay?    What do you think?

12                 MS. ANDERS:        Well, there is -- there is a

13   circuit split on that, and -- and I think the circuit

14   split shows that it raises a different analytical

15   question that the Court doesn't have to get into here.

16   The circuit split is that some courts say, as I

17   understand it, that, even after the person waives his

18   Miranda rights, Doyle still applies, and so you can't

19   use his silence against him.

20                 And some of those other courts say, no, once

21   he has waived his Miranda rights, he is essentially in

22   the same situation as he would be, if he weren't in

23   custody -

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And do you have a view

25   on it?

                                       53

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                MS. ANDERS:        I -- I think we think that the

 2   better view is that Doyle probably does not apply, but I

 3   think there is a serious question there.                 And I think

 4   the Court doesn't have to resolve it here because,

 5   again, that highlights a distinction between custodial

 6   and noncustodial interrogation, that, once the suspect

 7   has been promised, that -

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, what is your answer

 9   to Justice Kagan's earlier question to -- of the

10   hypothetical of the defendant that says nothing for 20

11   questions?

12                MS. ANDERS:        Well, I -- I think the

13   standard -

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Then there's no -- and

15   there's no Miranda warning and no custody.

16                MS. ANDERS:        Right.          So like this case,

17   except 20 questions.

18                Well, I think the standard is whether the -

19   the suspect has done something that reasonably can be

20   construed as invocation.          This is the standard that the

21   Court announced in United States v. Quinn a long time

22   ago, but it's also the same formulation that the Court

23   used in Davis and Berghuis.

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:            What -- what does that mean?

25   Does he just -- how about if he just says, you know, I

                                      54

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   don't really want to answer that question?

 2               MS. ANDERS:         I think, if he expresses the

 3   desire not to answer the question, that is sufficient

 4   because he is saying, I'm not going to answer that, and,

 5   implicitly, he has a right not to do that.                    I think the

 6   20 questions hypothetical that Justice Kennedy proposed,

 7   probably that would not be sufficient by -- by analogy

 8   to Thompkins, where the suspect sat silent for two

 9   hours.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Okay.       But -- but I don't

11   think you -- you were going to tell me this great deal

12   of conduct, what silence could mean other than, I fear

13   incrimination.   What else is -

14               MS. ANDERS:         Absolutely.             I think -- I think

15   there are several types -- there are several mental

16   states that silence can reflect that are both probative

17   of guilt and not consistent with the desire to refuse to

18   answer the question as a matter of right.                    So, for

19   instance, the suspect could want to answer the question,

20   but have trouble coming up with an exculpatory answer.

21               He could strategically decide that he is

22   just going to sit silent for a bit, to see what else the

23   prosecution -- or, I'm sorry -- the police say, in order

24   to spin it out, see what they know.                    He could be

25   dismayed or shocked, momentarily, because the question

                                      55

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reveals that the police have more evidence than he

 2   thought they did.

 3               So I think, in all of those situations,

 4   those -- those mental states are not consistent with the

 5   desire to invoke the privilege, and that's why

 6   Petitioner's rule is, essentially, a prophylactic rule

 7   that would protect a great deal of conduct that has

 8   nothing to do with the desire to exercise the Fifth

 9   Amendment right.

10               I think -- you know, this case is a good

11   example of that, where you have a -- a suspect who

12   speaks for -- you know, several minutes -- you know,

13   half an hour, whatever, and he's answering questions in

14   an exculpatory manner.          He's suddenly silent in response

15   to one question, and so I think the inference that could

16   be drawn there is that he was surprised by the question

17   and didn't know how to answer it in the most exculpatory

18   manner.

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:               Well, Ms. Anders, suppose -

20   you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be

21   one thing, and then it turns out that the interview was

22   something else.     He realizes, it dawns on him, that the

23   police really do see him as a suspect.                   And he says to

24   himself, I better stop answering, right?

25               So he says, okay -- he's answered a bunch of

                                        56

 1   questions already, but -- but, now, he's -- you know, I

 2   don't want to answer any more questions.                Is that an

 3   invocation?

 4                 MS. ANDERS:        I think that would be

 5   sufficient, yes, to say, I don't want to answer any more

 6   questions.    And I think -

 7                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Or, if he says, I don't want

 8   to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an

 9   invocation?

10                 MS. ANDERS:        I think that would be

11   sufficient to invoke with respect to questions on that

12   topic.   And I think, as -- as in Thompkins, I think it's

13   important to have a clear rule here because invocation

14   does affect -

15                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            That doesn't sound like a

16   clear rule.    I mean -- you know, as -- as between -- you

17   know, I don't want to answer those questions on a

18   particular topic, I don't want to answer that question,

19   or just like could we go on to a different question

20   or -- or I don't know.         Why is that different?

21                 MS. ANDERS:        Well, I think it's -- it's an

22   objective standard, and it's the same formulation that

23   the Court has already adopted in Berghuis and in

24   Thompkins and in Davis.          So, in the Miranda context, the

25   Court has already faced this problem, how do we know

                                       57

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   when the defendant has invoked his rights and what

 2   should the standard be?

 3               And it has said that it is an objective

 4   standard, it's what's reasonably perceived as an

 5   invocation, and so -- you know, the lower courts are

 6   very used to applying that.             I think it's very

 7   administrable because -

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                What's not administrable

 9   about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury

10   that merely not asking a question is guilt?                     What -

11   what lacks administrable?

12               MS. ANDERS:         Well, I -- I think there are a

13   variety of circumstances in which, as I said before,

14   silence is probative of guilt.                And so the question is

15   whether you want a broad, prophylactic rule that will

16   protect a great deal of conduct that -- that has nothing

17   to do with the exercise of the right.

 1   432, In our reply brief, at page 4, we cite cases that

 2   are all Fifth Amendment cases, and Canterbury, also,

 3   which is a Tenth Circuit case cited elsewhere in our

 4   brief, uniformly holding that the Fifth Amendment

 5   applies.

 6                  The Solicitor General, when they speak about

 7   a circuit split with relation to Doyle, they're talking

 8   about impeachment cases.            Remember, Doyle and Jenkins,

 9   which are the cases the State cited to you in response

10   to your question are impeachment cases that are entirely

11   different.

12                  Second, if I -- we can look at the

13   transcript this afternoon, but I believe both the State

14   and the Solicitor General said to you, today, if

15   Mr. Salinas would have said, I don't want to answer that

16   question, then he would win, then Griffin would apply.

17   But, because it was somehow ambiguous, that it

18   shouldn't, that is ridiculous.                  If you look at the

19   transcript in this case, what did the officer testify

20   when he said -- he asked him the question, he said he

21   did not answer.

22                  What did the prosecutor argue to the jury in

23   closing?     Verbatim of what the State is telling you

24   today is all Mr. Salinas had to say.                     At closing, the

25   State said, the police officer testified that he

                                        59

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   wouldn't answer that question.               He didn't want to answer

 2   that.

 3               So the whole principle behind express

 4   invocation jurisprudence is to put the State and the

 5   police on fair notice that somebody is exercising the

 6   right to remain silent.        There was zero ambiguity in

 7   this case that was going on.

 8               So it explains why the rule that the State

 9   and the Solicitor General have fallen back on in court

10   today is formalism of the absolute worst kind, and the

11   only thing that this formal requirement of saying some

12   sort of magic words -- and I agree with Justice Kagan, I

13   don't know what they are -- but whatever they are,

14   what -- exactly what the State argued to the jury

15   apparently would have been enough, is just nothing more

16   than a trap for the unwary, who is told, through culture

17   and learning, that he has a right to remain silent.

18               And he does the one thing that is consistent

19   with his right, which is exercising it, and, somehow,

20   the State is telling you that it can walk into court and

21   say, because he remains silent, he's guilty of a crime;

22   jury, you should conclude he's guilty of a crime.

23               And, Justice Sotomayor, when you asked the

24   State, well, what about an officer that tells the

25   defendant, as he will have every incentive to do, in

                                     60

 1   South Carolina v. Neville, in a roughly comparable

 2   situation, that law enforcement actually admitted they

 3   were already doing it, but the States tell you they'll

 4   do it here, when the officer says, if you don't answer,

 5   we're going to use that against you, the State said that

 6   would be coercion.     But the officer would be doing

 7   nothing more than stating the rule the Court is asking

 8   you to announce today.

 9               So wouldn't the defendant know the law?

10   Don't we assume that the suspect knows the law?         And the

11   State's telling you, well, if the officer tells the

12   person what the law is, it's coercion.

13               So, really, what we're asking today is

14   nothing radical.     It's nothing of a departure of our

15   deepest traditions, which require the government to

16   shoulder the load itself, to prove the case itself, and

17   not to enlist the defendant as an instrument in his own

18   demise.

19               People's silence -- it is the time-honored

20   concept of the Fifth Amendment, which, remember, was

21   created for out-of-court questioning by law enforcement

22   authorities, that people who remain silent could not

23   have that used against them at trial.

24               And, finally, I hope the -- the confusion

25   with respect to the Berghuis, as related to this case,

                                       61

 1   has been dispelled.     I think Justice Kagan got it

 2   exactly right.   But, remember, another way to make it

 3   clear is that, if Mr. Salinas had said, in response to

 4   the question, I'd like for you to stop asking me

 5   questions, the police wouldn't have had to honor that.

 6               Somebody not in custody doesn't have a right

 7   to have questioning cut off, so the police could have

 8   kept asking him questions.             That's the only right that a

 9   custodial suspect has and needs to expressly invoke.

10   The right to remain silent is not something that's ever

11   had to be expressly invoked by somebody in custody or

12   not in custody, and there's no good reason to require it

13   to be invoked here.

14               If the Court has any further questions, I'd

15   be happy to entertain them.             Otherwise, I'll submit the

16   case.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I'll like to go back to

18   what Justice Ginsburg argued because there is an

19   argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the

20   right, that, by physical conduct, there was a statement.

21   Would you have had a problem if the prosecutor had

22   argued at trial -- you know, when he was asked about

23   this testing, he didn't remain silent, he got nervous?

24               MR. FISHER:         No, that would be -

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                And that shows his

                                      62

 1   guilt.

 2               MR. FISHER:         That would be an entirely

 3   different case.   And we wouldn't have a problem with the

 4   State making legitimate arguments based on demeanor

 5   evidence that is, itself, communicative, as opposed to

 6   what it did in this case, which is argue that his

 7   silence demonstrated his guilt.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Thank you, counsel.

 9               The case is submitted.

10               (Whereupon, at 12:16 p.m., the case in the

11   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
