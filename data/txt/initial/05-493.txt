 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON

 7                    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8            MR. JOHNSON:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10            This case concerns the constitutional

11   sufficiency of California's catchall factor (k)

12   instruction, which was given in the penalty-phase portion

13   of California capital cases, and which directed the jurors

14   to consider any other circumstance that extenuates the

15   gravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse

16   for the crime.

17            In this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

18   held that this instruction violates the Eighth Amendment

19   because it allegedly misled the jurors to believe they

20   could not consider so-called forward-looking evidence that

21   did not relate directly to the defendant's actual

22   culpability for the crime itself.

23            In the State's view, the Ninth Circuit's

24   conclusion is fundamentally flawed, because it rests on an

25   illusory distinction between different forms of character


                                         3

 1   evidence in a way that is inconsistent with this Court's

 2   prior decisions in California -- or Boyde versus

 3   California and Brown versus Payton.

 4            In Boyde, this Court addressed, and rejected, a

 5   virtually identical challenge to the factor (k), and

 6   concluded that this instruction did, in fact, allow jurors

 7   to consider non-crime-related evidence; specifically, it

 8   allowed the jurors to consider evidence of the defendant's

 9   background and character.         There was nothing in the Boyde

10   decision to support the Ninth Circuit's distinction

11   between different forms of character evidence.               In fact,

12   Boyde implicitly acknowledged that the factor (k) would,

13   in fact, be understood to encompass Belmontes' good

14   character evidence, in this case, because, for all

15   practical purposes, there is no meaningful distinction

16   between the nature of the background and character offered

17   in Boyde and the nature of the background --

18            JUSTICE STEVENS:          Mr. Johnson, would you comment

19   on the footnote on the -- on the -- drawing the

20   distinction with regard to the dance contest that the

21   defendant won in that case, between -- it's over here; I'm

22   asking the question -- between facts that occurred before

23   the crime and facts that might have occurred after.

24            MR. JOHNSON:       Yes, Your Honor.           In footnote 5,

25   this Court addressed a contention, raised for the first


                                       4

 1   time in argument, that Boyde's evidence might be

 2   admissible under Skipper versus South Carolina, and this

 3   Court distinguished Boyde from Skipper, for a couple of

 4   reasons.   First, as the -- as Your Honor pointed out, the

 5   evidence in this case related to good-character evidence,

 6   events that occurred before the crime itself, unlike in

 7   Skipper, which dealt with post-crime events.                     The Court

 8   also pointed out that the evidence in Boyde -- his dancing

 9   achievement, his good character evidence in that case --

10   was not offered for the specific inference that the

11   evidence in Skipper was offered.                The Court, in footnote 5

12   -- and in the opinion, in general, in Boyde -- nonetheless

13   found that this evidence did, in fact, constitute good-

14   character evidence of the -- of the defendant's present

15   good character, because it showed that his crime was an

16   aberration from otherwise good character.                     Or, as Justice

17   Marshall put it in his dissenting opinion, that Boyde had

18   redeeming qualities, which is a decidedly forward-looking

19   consideration.

20              And, as I was saying, the evidence in this case,

21   and in Boyde --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:          It doesn't have to be forward-

23   looking, does it?    I mean, I thought we've said "so long

24   as it can be taken into account in any manner," whether

25   backward-looking or forward-looking.                     Haven't we said


                                         5

 1   that, explicitly?

 2            MR. JOHNSON:          Yes Your Honor.            The -- and, in

 3   fact, the Court has, in Franklin versus Linite, said that

 4   they have not distinguished between different forms of

 5   character evidence.       And I understand that, in the past,

 6   we've always discussed background and character evidence

 7   as sort of the same thing.            In this case, however, the

 8   Ninth Circuit's conclusion does, in fact, rest on a

 9   distinction between different forms of backward-looking

10   and forward-looking character --

11            JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well it was --

12            MR. JOHNSON:          -- evidence.

13            JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- it was addressing itself to

14   the fact -- to the words of the factor (k) instruction.

15   How does post-crime prison conduct reduce the seriousness

16   of a previous crime?

17            MR. JOHNSON:          It does not -- it does not relate

18   to the seriousness of the -- of the crime at all.                  The --

19   Boyde's dancing --

20            JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it has to relate

21   to the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor

22   (k), doesn't it?

23            MR. JOHNSON:          It would relate to the gravity --

24   to circumstances that extenuate the gravity of the crime,

25   for purposes of a jury's sentencing determination.                  And


                                          6

 1   the point I'd like to make on that point is this, Your

 2   Honor.   In California, jurors are well aware what their

 3   task is at a sentencing determination.                  In California, the

 4   guilt and the death eligibility determinations are made

 5   during the guilt-phase trial and the jurors are expressly

 6   told, during the penalty-phase trial, that their lone

 7   determination, their one concern, is to decide between a

 8   sentence of death or a sentence of life without the

 9   possibility of parole.       And, in that light, the jurors are

10   very well aware that their only determination in a

11   California case is to make a moral, normative

12   determination, a single normal -- moral normative

13   determination, as to whether this man, this defendant

14   standing before them in this Court today, deserves death

15   or life without possibility --

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, now, do you --

17             MR. JOHNSON:       -- of parole.

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          -- do you have an instruction

19   that supports what you've just told us, that the jury is

20   told they have to make a single moral determination?                 Is

21   that what the court instructed the jury?                 Or was --

22             MR. JOHNSON:       No, that's --

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          -- instructed in items of

24   factor (k)?

25             MR. JOHNSON:       The --


                                        7

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1            JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And I think you have to rest

 2   on your argument, that what we are talking about is the

 3   gravity of his crime "for purposes of sentencing."                   I

 4   understand that argument.           But then, when you go on to

 5   make the argument you just made, the jury understands it

 6   is a single moral judgment, what -- is there some specific

 7   instruction you can point to, other than the factor (k)

 8   instruction itself?

 9            MR. JOHNSON:         No, they are -- and I may have

10   been misleading.    The jurors are expressly instructed that

11   is -- that it is their duty to determine, and their only

12   duty to determine, whether the defendant should receive

13   life or death and parole, and -- or life without the

14   possibility of parole -- and in --

15            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well --

16            MR. JOHNSON:         -- light of that determination,

17   jurors, naturally, would understand that they could take

18   into account anything that extenuated the gravity of the

19   crime.

20            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's what they

21   were told, right?    They're instructed that the mitigating

22   circumstances, including factor (k), are merely examples,

23   right?

24            MR. JOHNSON:         Yes.       In this -- yes.     In --

25            JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you about that?


                                         8

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   This case is unusual, because it has that separate

 2   instruction that, "The mitigating circumstances are merely

 3   examples, and you should pay careful attention to those,

 4   but you may -- but you may rely on other mitigating

 5   circumstances."

 6            May I ask you, would it have been constitutional

 7   if the judge had added a sentence at the end of that

 8   instruction which said, "However, you may not consider

 9   anything mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of

10   the crime"?

11            MR. JOHNSON:         It would have been constitutional,

12   to the extent that it would have allowed the jurors to

13   give some use whatsoever to Belmontes' proffered evidence

14   in mitigation, and that's what this Court's prior cases

15   has -- and, particularly, the various Texas cases have

16   said that jurors must be given an avenue to make use of

17   the evidence.    In California --

18            JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm not sure you've answered

19   my question.    Would it have been a constitutional addition

20   to that instruction to say, "But I want to -- you to

21   clearly understand that it is not to be considered

22   mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime"?

23   Would that have been permissible?

24            MR. JOHNSON:         It would appear to -- no.     It

25   would appear not to be, because --


                                         9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:         Because that would have

 2   foreclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence,

 3   right?

 4               MR. JOHNSON:      It would have -- well, it would

 5   foreclose consideration of all present good-character

 6   evidence, I believe.       It would -- it would have foreclosed

 7   the consideration of Boyde's evidence, of Payton's

 8   evidence.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:         So, then the question in this

10   case is whether the jury might have understood factor (k)

11   to limit them to the consideration of factors that

12   extenuate the gravity of the crime.

13               MR. JOHNSON:      Well, the -- yes, the question is

14   whether the jurors would reasonably understand the

15   instruction to preclude the consideration of

16   constitutionally -- of relevant evidence.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              This Court, in Payton,

18   said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that

19   evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime.

20   So, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the

21   lines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been

22   perfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the

23   crime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?

24               MR. JOHNSON:      Well, to the -- to the extent --

25   the jurors would have likely understood that, it -- that


                                        10

 1   instruction in Belmontes and in Payton, to extenuate the

 2   gravity of the crime for purposes of their sentencing

 3   determination --

 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's what I thought

 5   your position was.      And --

 6             MR. JOHNSON:         Yes --

 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- then you back off of it, and

 8   you say, "extenuate the gravity" of the crime doesn't

 9   relate to anything that's after the crime.                  I would have

10   -- I would have interpreted the phrase to mean "anything

11   that justifies you in giving a lesser punishment for the

12   crime."

13             MR. JOHNSON:         That's precisely my argument.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then your answer to

15   Justice Stevens should have been different.

16             MR. JOHNSON:         Well, if -- and I apologize if I

17   was misunderstood.      My --

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Do you think --

19             MR. JOHNSON:         -- question --

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- that the jury in this very

21   case understood that, given the questions that were asked?

22             MR. JOHNSON:         Oh, yes, Your Honor.          In this --

23   in this case, I -- there is certainly no reasonable

24   likelihood that the jurors felt precluded, because, as was

25   previously discussed, first there was this additional


                                         11

 1   instruction that supplemented the other instructions in

 2   this case that made it very clear that the aggravating

 3   factors, the various factors listed in the standard

 4   instruction A through G, that those were the -- they could

 5   only rely on those two for aggravating factors, but their

 6   understanding of mitigating factors was not limited.                 In

 7   fact, they were expressly told that the previous factors

 8   were merely examples.

 9            JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What about the -- what

10   actually went on?    I mean, the jury first came in and

11   said, "What if we can't decide?               Can we decide by

12   majority?"   And then the question was asked, that seemed

13   to indicate the jurors' understanding, that we take all

14   those factors that you told us about, and we just take

15   those factors into account.              And there were clarifying

16   instructions asked by the defense that were not given.

17            MR. JOHNSON:         Well, there -- to answer your

18   questions, Your Honor, first, there was no indication at

19   this conference that the jurors were, in fact, confused

20   about whether they could consider any particular evidence

21   as being mitigating.       The conference itself was called to

22   address, as you mentioned, the jurors' concern -- or the

23   jurors' inquiry about the result -- what would happen if

24   they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict in this case.

25            JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, that may be why they had


                                        12

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the conference, but they got into the colloquy that

 2   Justice Ginsburg described.            And the last -- as I recall,

 3   the last reference to "factors," whether aggravating or

 4   mitigating, was simply in terms of the list, or "the

 5   listing," I guess the term was, so that the -- it seems to

 6   me at least, there's a fair argument on the other side of

 7   this case, that the last reference that the -- that the

 8   judge made to the jurors with respect to aggravation or

 9   mitigation was to refer to a listing.                  The listing itself

10   didn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the

11   instruction that you are not limited to the listed

12   mitigating factors.

13            So, the concern is that, because the last

14   reference was to the list, that the list included factor

15   (k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give

16   -- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest

17   emphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions

18   in response to questions.         Isn't it a pretty good argument

19   that, in this case, there is -- there's a reasonable

20   likelihood that the jurors went back to their task

21   thinking that they were limited to the list?

22            MR. JOHNSON:        Respectfully, no, Your Honor.            And

23   the reason why is --

24            JUSTICE SOUTER:          Well, I -- I'm not necessarily

25   saying that's my position, so you don't have to be

 1   respectful to me about it.           Just --

 2               MR. JOHNSON:      I'll be respectful anyhow, Your

 3   Honor.

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:         -- knock it down if you can.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Be respectful anyway.

 6               MR. JOHNSON:      Yes.        The point is, with this

 7   instruction conference, there -- the -- an argument that

 8   this reference to "the listing" reflected some

 9   unconstitutional -- or constitutionally restrictive view

10   presupposes that the jurors reasonably would have

11   misinterpreted the meaning of the factor (k); and there is

12   nothing in there -- in any of these questions to put

13   anybody on notice that that -- that they had any such

14   concerns.    And first --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:         Well, except for the language

16   of factor (k) itself.       And if -- without some

17   embellishment, isn't it a bit of a stretch to think that

18   factor (k) goes as far as Skipper evidence?

19               MR. JOHNSON:      No, Your Honor, it's not a stretch

20   at all, because any evidence relating to the defendant's

21   background and character, his present character in court,

22   could be seen as extenuating the gravity of the crime for

23   sentencing purposes.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well --

25               MR. JOHNSON:      And the jurors --

 1            JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- California itself

 2   recognized that there was a problem here of jury

 3   confusion.   And now they have amended the provision so

 4   that it would be clear to any juror.

 5            MR. JOHNSON:        That's correct, Your Honor, in

 6   People v. Easley the California --

 7            JUSTICE SCALIA:           Or maybe they thought that was

 8   a problem of Ninth Circuit confusion rather than jury

 9   confusion.

10            [Laughter.]

11            JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, having that opinion in

12   front of them, you would think they would amend it, of

13   course, to prevent that kind of decision again.

14            MR. JOHNSON:        Well, they -- what they were doing

15   was certainly a prophylactic measure here, to -- they

16   recognized that perhaps there might be some concern of

17   confusion, and so they wanted to forestall any chance of

18   that happening.   But notably, this case and -- this case,

19   and no other California Supreme Court case, has found that

20   the factor (k) instruction, the pre-Easley version of it,

21   by itself, did mislead the jurors.                 In fact, the Supreme

22   Court, in this case, came down 7-0 in support of the

23   conclusion that the jurors were properly told about the --

24            JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Where does this factor (k)

25   come from?   What was the source of it?


                                       15

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. JOHNSON:      The factor (k), as the entire

 2   standard instruction given in these cases, recites

 3   verbatim the language of the California statute, which is

 4   California penal code section 190.3.                    And, interestingly

 5   enough, the -- not only the California Supreme Court, but

 6   this Court, implicitly has -- have both said that not only

 7   the California statute, but the instruction -- this

 8   standard instruction, upon -- which is based on the

 9   statute, do allow consideration of all relevant mitigating

10   factors.   In fact, as far back as 1983, in this Court's

11   California v. Ramos decision, this Court stated, albeit in

12   dicta, that the factor (k) -- or that the standard

13   instruction would allow consideration of background and

14   character evidence; and, in fact, the Court stated, in

15   footnote 20 --

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:         General Johnson, I don't mean

17   to interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your

18   -- you stick to your answer on -- to my question, earlier,

19   --

20              MR. JOHNSON:      Okay.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- because you -- I think you

22   changed your answer after Justice -- the Chief Justice and

23   Justice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake.

24              Are you -- is it your position that it would be

25   constitutional to instruct the jury that, "You may not

 1   consider any evidence mitigating, unless it extenuates the

 2   gravity of the crime"?

 3            MR. JOHNSON:        Yes, Your Honor, because the

 4   jurors would -- even if that instruction were given, the

 5   jurors would understand that an instruction that

 6   extenuates the gravity of the crime would encompass any

 7   relevant character evidence.            And this Court has made

 8   these determinations all the time.

 9            JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is --

10            MR. JOHNSON:        That --

11            JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- that answer consistent with

12   the position of defense counsel, who said he would not

13   insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them

14   that the religious conversion of the defendant did not

15   extenuate the gravity of the crime?

16            MR. JOHNSON:        No, Your Honor.            What the -- what

17   the counsel actually said was that the defendant's

18   religious conversion did not provide an excuse for the

19   crime itself.   And, in fact, that argument was, itself,

20   echoing the language of the factor (k) instruction, which

21   of course --

22            JUSTICE STEVENS:           That's right.

23            MR. JOHNSON:        -- directs the jurors to consider

24   any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the

25   crime, even though it's not a legal excuse for the crime.


                                       17

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   And so, counsel was dovetailing his very effective

 2   argument with the -- with the instruction itself.               And

 3   what's significant here is that, like in Payton, like in

 4   Boyde, this case involved virtually all of Belmontes'

 5   penalty-phase evidence.        And the entire main thrust of his

 6   argument to the jury was that he could not make it on the

 7   outside, but he could fit in the system and contribute to

 8   society in the future, if given a chance on the inside.

 9   And again, as was true in Boyde and Payton --

10            JUSTICE STEVENS:           If that were true would that

11   have extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get

12   along in prison?

13            MR. JOHNSON:        Yes, for purposes of jurors -- at

14   jury's sentencing determination, absolutely, because it

15   would be viewed as good-character evidence, precisely --

16            JUSTICE STEVENS:           And you think juries would

17   clearly understand that what he did in the future in

18   prison would extenuate the gravity of the crime.

19            MR. JOHNSON:        Yes, Your Honor, because, in light

20   of everything that's been said and done in this trial, as

21   the Boyde Court noted, jurors do not parse instructions

22   for subtle shades of meaning; they understand instructions

23   in a commonsense manner, and in --

24            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The prosecutor didn't

25   object to any of this mitigating -- mitigation evidence


                                       18

 1   that was submitted by the defendant, did he?

 2            MR. JOHNSON:          The prosecutor objected to none of

 3   this evidence.     And, in fact, the prosecutor, in closing

 4   statement, argued that the -- not only could the jurors

 5   consider Belmontes' forward-looking prospects, but the

 6   jurors should consider those prospects.                   So, in this case

 7   what we have --

 8            JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Well, the prosecutor's

 9   closing was schizophrenic, because he said, "But really

10   this shouldn't matter."

11            MR. JOHNSON:          He acknowledged it was something

12   that -- this argument was something that was proper for

13   consideration, but -- however, he argued that the evidence

14   of Belmontes' religious conversion, which happens -- you

15   know, and then lapsed immediately before he committed the

16   murder, in this case -- was very weak evidence.                  But he

17   did, nonetheless, tell the jurors that they could consider

18   Belmontes' prior character as bearing on his present

19   character now.

20            JUSTICE SOUTER:             But, didn't he go beyond saying

21   it was weak?     He did say that, but didn't he say that he

22   doubted that it fit within (k)?

23            JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Yes.

24            MR. JOHNSON:          He's -- yes, the prosecutor first

25   stated that the factor (k) was a catchall, a true


                                         19

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   catchall.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:         So, the prosecutor, I take it,

 3   would have answered Justice Stevens's question the other

 4   way.   The prosecutor would have said, "Well, no, this

 5   probably would not be understood by the jurors to refer to

 6   the gravity of the offense."

 7               MR. JOHNSON:      No, Your Honor, because in the --

 8   in the previous page, the prosecutor did State that it was

 9   a catchall, you know, which, by implication, incorporates

10   everything, but -- and the prosecutor's argument, that,

11   "I'm not sure if it fits in there," signifies that there

12   -- not that the evidence -- that such evidence could not

13   be considered as mitigating as a -- in a general matter,

14   but that -- just that the religious evidence in this case

15   was extremely weak, to the point of having, as a practical

16   purpose, no mitigating value.              The prosecutor followed

17   that comment.    I'm not sure it fits in there, in next

18   breath, with, "It's" -- something to the effect of, "It's

19   no secret that Belmontes' religious evidence is pretty

20   shaky here," and went on to conclude that.               But then, in

21   the next breath, he said, "But, nonetheless, this is

22   something that's proper for you to consider."

23               And, again, reasonable jurors, hearing this --

24   having been given the instruction here -- would reasonably

25   interpret this -- all of this evidence as something they


                                        20

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   could use to extenuate the gravity of the crime.              And

 2   particularly in this context, because, like in Boyde, in

 3   addition to this factor (k), the standard instruction

 4   directed the jurors to consider all the evidence.              The

 5   first factor of the enumerated factors -- (a) through (g),

 6   in this case -- told the jurors that they should -- that

 7   they should focus on -- that the first thing to consider

 8   was the -- or the circumstances of the crime itself.

 9            The final factor, therefore, that any other

10   circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime

11   would clearly be understood to relate to matters outside

12   the crime itself.    And, to the extent that there was any

13   ambiguity about the meaning of that in this particular

14   case, the argument by counsel, the additional instruction

15   here, clarified that to the point that there is certainly

16   no reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt that they

17   were constrained in considering any mitigating evidence in

18   any way they thought fit.

19            JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Johnson, when I asked you

20   about the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a

21   California statutory cite, but is there -- does it come

22   from any model code?       Does any other State have such a

23   provision?   How widespread is it?

24            MR. JOHNSON:         Of the -- the actual wording of

25   this instruction?

 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How many States have an

 2   instruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances

 3   of the crime?

 4             MR. JOHNSON:       I'm not sure, Your Honor.        I'm not

 5   sure.   I know that this -- that this instruction itself

 6   came from the statute, which, in turn, was adopted from

 7   the California Briggs initiative in the 1978 statute.                I'm

 8   not aware of any -- of any other States -- there may or

 9   may not be -- who have adopted the same statutory model

10   that California has.

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which -- California hasn't

12   had it since 1983, right?

13             MR. JOHNSON:       Pardon me, Your Honor?

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             California hasn't used this

15   instruction since 1983.

16             MR. JOHNSON:       That's correct, Your Honor.          After

17   People v. Easely, the California Supreme Court augmented

18   the instruction.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So, is this a one-of-a-kind

20   case?   I mean, you said, in your brief, that the Ninth

21   Circuit decision threatens many other valid California

22   death judgments.   But these would all have to be rather

23   ancient cases.

24             MR. JOHNSON:       Yes.       And, unfortunately, there's

 1   litigated.   I've done research on this issue, and, as of

 2   this date, I can't give you an actual -- an absolute

 3   number, but I believe there is approximately 15 cases

 4   pending, like this one, that involve the factor (k)

 5   instruction -- this factor (k) instruction -- that involve

 6   evidence of -- somehow, future-looking evidence, which --

 7   all character evidence, frankly, is future-looking --

10            JUSTICE GINSBURG:                -- that wouldn't wash out, on

11   the other grounds?

12            MR. JOHNSON:          Right, that -- and -- that are

13   still pending, and that are -- unlike Payton, are not

14   governed by the AEDPA.

15            JUSTICE SCALIA:             But you're saying those

16   convictions are more than -- more than 23 years old?

18   there's -- they're -- I believe all of them are being

19   litigated now in the Federal court system in California.

 1             MR. MULTHAUP:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3             Here is Respondent's 60-second nutshell summary

 4   of our core position.       This case does not turn on the

 5   constitutional factor (k) standing alone.                Rather, it

 6   turns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test,

 7   to the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during

 8   the arguments, instructions to deliberations at the

 9   penalty trial of this case.

10             Here are the two key components of our claim.

11   During arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the

12   jury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious

13   experience was not covered by factor (k).                However, both

14   counsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered

15   anyway.   Now, this is unusual, because, of all -- of all

16   the things that the district attorney and the defense

17   counsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on,

18   and it's likely that the jury would have taken note of

19   that.

20             The case then proceeded to instructions and

21   deliberations.   The jury came back to court, announced

22   that they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority

23   favoring life.   The turning point occurred when one juror,

24   Juror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the

25   specific list of factors previously given was the only


                                        24

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   base -- was the only framework within which the penalty

 2   decision could be made.         At that point, the trial court

 3   had a constitutional obligation to disabuse Juror Hern and

 4   the rest of the assembled jurors of that misapprehension

 5   and, at the very least, to reinstruct the jurors that the

 6   enumerated factors were merely illustrative and not

 7   exhaustive, and instruct the jurors that the jury had to

 8   consider all of the mitigating evidence.

 9               The trial court did neither, with the result

10   that the jury all too likely returned to its deliberations

11   with the belief that the only factors -- the only matters

12   they considered -- could consider were those encompassed

13   within the enumerated factors, and believing -- based on

14   counsel's prior arguments -- that factor (k) did not

15   include the Youth Authority religious-experience evidence.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:        When did the defense counsel say

17   that this evidence did not fit within factor (k)?

18               MR. MULTHAUP:       Your Honor, it occurred in

19   argument.    And my counsel -- esteemed co-counsel will give

20   me the exact page -- but it occurred in the context -- the

21   context -- during the prosecutor's argument, the

22   prosecutor said to the jury that, "I suspect" -- and then

23   he, for emphasis, said, "I can't imagine that you won't be

24   told that the religious-conversion evidence doesn't fit

25   within factor (k)."      And, at that point, he expressed

 1   reservations, doubts, as to whether it did fit in factor

 2   (k) or --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why does that --

 4               MR. MULTHAUP:       -- any other factor.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why does that matter?

 6   Because the jury was told that the factors were merely

 7   examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.

 8               MR. MULTHAUP:       I'm more than --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It probably didn't fit

10   into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter.

11               MR. MULTHAUP:       Well, it has -- if it -- oh, Your

12   Honor, the -- calling your -- or you've called my

13   attention to the instruction that said that the set -- in

14   the prior set of -- or in the general set of instructions,

15   that the enumerated factors were merely illustrative.

16   Now, that instruction had a cloud of confusion surrounding

17   it, because the way it was phrased was, the Court said,

18   "The mitigating factors that I have expressed to you are

19   illustrative."    There was no list of mitigating factors.

20   There was only a single list, unitary list, of factors

21   that could be either aggravating or mitigating, depending

22   on a jury's decision.

23               The instruction that you're referring to, Your

24   Honor, was a -- was the result of the trial court denying

25   some, and granting some, parts of the special instructions


                                        26

 1   requested by the defense.          And so, when the trial court

 2   said to the jury, "The list of mitigating factors is

 3   illustrative only," I -- we, who know the background of

 4   this, understand what -- the point he was trying to make,

 5   but the jury, hearing it, they would think, very

 6   reasonably, "There's no list of mitigating factors."

 7             JUSTICE ALITO:         You said this case is different

 8   because both counsel told the jury that the evidence that

 9   you're relying on did not fit within factor (k).             And I'm

10   not sure what you're referring to.

11             MR. MULTHAUP:        Okay.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:         Now, as to defense counsel, are

13   you referring to what you quoted on page 9 of your brief,

14   where he says, "I'm not going to insult you" -- what you

15   highlighted on page 9 -- "I'm not going to insult you by

16   telling you I think it excuses, in any way, what happened

17   here"?   That's what you -- is that what you're referring

18   to?

19             MR. MULTHAUP:        That's one of the passages that I

20   am referring to, and it came as a direct response to the

21   District Attorney, in effect, calling out the defense

22   attorney, "I can't imagine that you won't be told that

23   this fits within factor (k)."             So, at that point, the

24   defense counsel had to make a decision, "Okay, either I

25   have to argue that my Skipper evidence is -- my square peg

 1   of Skipper evidence has to fit in the round hole of" --

 2            JUSTICE ALITO:            Isn't he --

 3            MR. MULTHAUP:           -- "factor (k)" --

 4            JUSTICE ALITO:            -- saying something very

 5   different there?     He isn't -- he's not saying, "This

 6   doesn't fit within factor (k)."                 And he makes no reference

 7   to factor (k).     He says nothing about "extenuating."              He

 8   says "excuses."     Isn't that something very different,

 9   "excusing" the crime?

10            MR. MULTHAUP:           Your Honor, this Court has used

11   the terms "extenuate" and "excuse" as synonyms in Boyde

12   and --

13            JUSTICE ALITO:            If you had been --

14            MR. MULTHAUP:           -- in Payton with --

15            JUSTICE ALITO:            -- if you were arguing this to

16   the jury, would you have said, "You know, my client earned

17   a position of responsibility on the fire crew that

18   patrolled the Sierra Foothills, and, therefore, that

19   excuses the crime that you've found that he committed

20   here"?

21            MR. MULTHAUP:           No.      No.      The --

22            JUSTICE BREYER:             I don't see, anywhere in Mr.

23   Schick's statement, at least from 165 to 170, where he

24   says what you said he said.               Now, maybe he says it some

25   other place, but -- I'd like the reference to it -- but I

 1   -- what I have him as saying is that -- he says, for

 2   example, several times, "The presence -- I don't suggest

 3   that the -- that the presence of religion, in itself, is

 4   totally mitigating."        Well, it certainly wasn't, in this

 5   instance.     I gather I'm right.             Am I right in thinking

 6   that all this religious conversion took place before he

 7   murdered the girl?      So, this is not a case of your trying

 8   to get some evidence that took place after the crime.

 9               MR. MULTHAUP:        That's right.             And --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.           If --

11               MR. MULTHAUP:        -- then --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:          -- that's right, then maybe it

13   does more easily fit within factor (k).                     The prosecutor

14   told the jury they should consider it, or they could.                     The

15   judge told the jury they could consider it -- it sounded

16   as -- says, "You take it -- this is an example" -- he

17   says, "It's an example in factor (k)."                    Maybe he's wrong,

18   but they certainly likely think they can consider it.                     And

19   Mr. Schick doesn't say it's not in factor (k).                      At least,

20   I don't see it.    That's why I'm asking.

21               MR. MULTHAUP:        Your Honor, the whole point of

22   factor (k) is that -- evidence that's an excuse for the

23   crime.   And if we're --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:          No, no, I know the point of

25   factor (k).    I'm trying to be absolutely certain, before

 1   thinking --

 2            MR. MULTHAUP:         Right.

 3            JUSTICE BREYER:           -- he didn't say it, that I've

 4   made every effort to get from you the place where -- that

 5   this -- where the defense counsel says, "Jury, I agree,

 6   you cannot put this into factor (k)."

 7            MR. MULTHAUP:         Okay.        And, Your Honor, looking

 8   at it in context, given the district attorney's argument,

 9   the district attorney says, "I can't imagine you won't be

10   told that it doesn't -- that it -- that it doesn't fit

11   within factor (k)."     So, the defense attorney gets up and

12   says, "I'm -- I am going to tell you that it doesn't

13   within -- fit within factor (k).               It doesn't" --

14            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that page --

15            MR. MULTHAUP:         -- "constitute" --

16            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- where he says that is

17   where?

18            MR. MULTHAUP:         When he -- when he says, Your

19   Honor, "It doesn't constitute an excuse in any way."

20            JUSTICE BREYER:           Were his words "it doesn't

21   constitute an excuse"?

22            MR. MULTHAUP:         "It doesn't excuse, in any way,"

23   Your Honor.   And we -- as a matter --

24            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But in --

25            MR. MULTHAUP:         -- of semantics --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:         -- but, in a sense, that's

 2   right, just like remorse.           Remorse doesn't excuse the

 3   crime.   It's a consideration that you take into account in

 4   assessing the gravity of the crime for purposes of

 5   punishment.

 6               MR. MULTHAUP:        Okay.       Your Honor, this is a

 7   point of, perhaps, semantics.              But the -- by the time you

 8   get to penalty phase, there's nothing to excuse the crime,

 9   in the sense of self-defense or "not guilty by reason of

10   insanity."    The only thing --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- "in any way."

12               MR. MULTHAUP:        It does say "in any way."

13               JUSTICE BREYER:         Where?

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:         It's on page 9 of your -- of

15   your brief.    The --

16               MR. MULTHAUP:        Thank you.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:         Thank you.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:         It's on 166 of the joint

20   appendix.

21               MR. MULTHAUP:        Thank you.

22               And if the -- if trial counsel was trying to

23   make the point that, "Well, it doesn't constitute a legal

24   excuse, but it does constitute a partial excuse or some

25   kind of mitigating evidence under this factor," he would

 1   have put that in there.       The clear import, from the

 2   context here, is that defense counsel was not trying to

 3   sell the jury a position that was, on its face, untenable,

 4   but, rather, to acknowledge that it did not fit within the

 5   "excuse the gravity of the crime" factor, which --

 6            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Only if you think that excusing

 7   the crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same

 8   thing, which I don't really think.

 9            MR. MULTHAUP:        Well, Your Honor, there's two --

10   I'd like to make two responses to that.                  First of all,

11   this Court has used those terms interchangeably, in Boyde

12   and Payton, with respect to mitigating evidence.                  Second

13   of all, let's -- as a -- as a practical matter, we have a

14   defense attorney arguing a case to a jury in a Central

15   Valley California county.         And if the defense attorney has

16   a choice between two synonyms, one which is used in common

17   parlance, "excuse," and one which is not used in common

18   parlance, "extenuate," it hardly constitutes an -- a

19   defect or concession on his part if he were to say, "This

20   does not excuse the crime in any way."                 That's plain

21   speaking to a jury, that -- and what he -- what he --

22   counsel --

23            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But wouldn't a jury think all

24   this evidence must have some purpose?                  The only purpose it

25   could have is to -- is to propel us toward life rather


                                      32

 1   than death.   I mean, the bulk of the evidence at the

 2   sentencing phase -- wasn't it? -- was how he behaved when

 3   he was a prisoner before.

 4              MR. MULTHAUP:       Your Honor, not -- that's not

 5   exactly what happened at penalty phase here.                 This is not

 6   a case like Boyde, where all the evidence was background

 7   and character evidence, and it's not a case like Payton,

 8   where the only evidence was a post-crime conversion.                 This

 9   case involved a mixture of evidence, where first there was

10   the grandfather who testified to what a bad upbringing he

11   had, traditional background and character evidence.                The

12   mother testified to her undying love for her son,

13   traditional evidence.      Friends testified to his good

14   characteristics.   And then, at the end, there was a clear

15   segment that related to his good performance in Youth

16   Authority and his religious conversion.                 So, it was only a

17   -- it was a partial part of -- partial part of the

18   penalty-phase presentation, but it certainly wasn't the

19   entire presentation, as it was in Boyde and --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Even so, there was --

21              MR. MULTHAUP:       -- Payton.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- there was extensive

23   testimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison

24   setting.

25              MR. MULTHAUP:       Well, certainly, Your Honor.


                                       33

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the jury must have

 2   thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that

 3   evidence in.    And what reason could it be, other than to

 4   show that, if he is given life, he will be a good

 5   prisoner?

 6               MR. MULTHAUP:       Your Honor, that's a very

 7   logical, sensible thing for the jury to have thought.               And

 8   now I'd like to drop the second shoe of the key components

 9   of our claim.    The first shoe was the arguments of counsel

10   that we've discussed the various permutations on.             The

11   most likely -- so, the jury began deliberating based on

12   the instructions and the arguments that they had -- that

13   they had had.    And it's entirely likely that when the jury

14   was favoring a life verdict during the first part of their

15   deliberations, Belmontes' prospects for good behavior in

16   prison and contributions were part of the debate.

17               When Juror Hern asked for judicial clarification

18   -- not clarification, confirmation -- of a very specific

19   view that only the enumerated factors could be considered

20   in the penalty-phase deliberations, the jury -- and the

21   trial court assented without qualification to that -- at

22   that point, the jury would have very likely thought, "The

23   trial court who holds a position of great deference to us,

24   much more than most other authority figures we have in our

25   life, just told us what the marching orders are here.

 1   This is the framework for decision."

 2             Now, what happened during the -- during the

 3   trial is the defense -- and I'm suggesting what the jury

 4   might have thought, in relation to your question -- that,

 5   "The defense attorney was taking his best shot for his

 6   client, pushing the envelope, maybe went over the top a

 7   little bit.   But defense attorneys do that.                The

 8   prosecutor was being a very decent stand-up kind of

 9   person, and -- but, right now, when we get down to the

10   business of making the decision, we have to follow the

11   rules.   And the rules are what the -- are what the -- are

12   what Judge Gisson just confirmed to us, that we are

13   limited to the enumerated factors, and factor (k) does not

14   include the Skipper evidence, because that was explained

15   to us by counsel."

16             I would like to --

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Before you move on,

18   Counsel --

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, of course you --

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- don't you --

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- don't you -- excuse me.

22   Excuse me.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- don't you have to

24   address the Teague question a little bit?                 You -- you're

25   entitled to this new rule adopted by the Court of Appeals

 1   only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the

 2   judgment became final.       Isn't that kind of a hard argument

 3   to make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v.

 4   Payton?

 5              MR. MULTHAUP:       Your Honor, I don't see -- as to

 6   the first part of Your Honor's question, I don't believe

 7   that there is any new rule whatsoever in the Ninth Circuit

 8   opinion.   It's a straightforward application of Boyde to

 9   the totality of circumstances that occurred.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Of Boyde?   It's

11   straightforward application of Boyde?

12              MR. MULTHAUP:       Yes.       The Ninth Circuit began

13   with Boyde, and it went through all of the proceedings at

14   trial, and concluded that there was a reasonable

15   likelihood that the jury didn't consider Skipper evidence.

16   And that's what we're asking this Court to do, the exact

17   same -- applying the Boyde test to the rule -- the rule of

18   decision that was clearly established by this Court as of

19   1986, and reiterated and expanded by this Court in 1987,

20   with Skipper.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes, but what has to be clear

22   under Teague is not just the rule, but the rule's

23   application in circumstances like this.                 There are a lot

24   of rules that are clear, but if Teague means anything at

25   all it has to mean that you should have known that, in


                                       36

 1   this case, the rule would produce this result.                 So it's

 2   not enough to say that there was a rule.                  There are a lot

 3   of rules out there, but the question is whether the

 4   outcome should have been clear at the time.                 Isn't that

 5   what Teague means?

 6            MR. MULTHAUP:           Certainly, Your Honor.            And

 7   applying -- because when we -- when we take a look at

 8   Penry I, this Court said -- in response to a Teague

 9   argument by the attorney general, this Court held that

10   Penry got past the threshold Teague issue because of -- at

11   the time of the finality of his direct appeal, in 1986,

12   the rule was well-established that the sentencer may not

13   be precluded from considering relevant evidence in

14   mitigation, by Lockett, Eddings, and others.                 So if that

15   was a firmly established rule as of 1986 --

16            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, Penry was

17   considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in

18   Graham versus Collins, though.

19            MR. MULTHAUP:           Graham v. Collins was an AEDPA

20   case, as was Payton.        So, we have a very, very different

21   standard of review.       And, if I may, Your Honor --

22            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, I know Payton was an

23   AEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not

24   unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read

25   instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be


                                         37

 1   considered.    And I would have thought, if it was not

 2   unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary

 3   reading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit

 4   adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated

 5   by existing precedent.

 6            MR. MULTHAUP:          Ah.      Well, the -- our position in

 7   relation to that is, the direct quote from -- direct quote

 8   from Payton itself, in which the Court said that, assuming

 9   the California Supreme Court was incorrect, Payton,

10   nonetheless, loses.      Here we're arguing that the

11   California Supreme Court was incorrect, and, therefore,

12   Belmontes --

13            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Because if it was --

14            MR. MULTHAUP:          -- should win.

15            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- because, even if

16   incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable.                And I'm just

17   having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position

18   is dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180

19   degrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this

20   Court as reasonable.

21            MR. MULTHAUP:          The unusual facts of this case

22   are much stronger in favor of relief under the Boyde test

23   than were those in Payton.           Therefore, applying the

24   longstanding rule of Lockett and Eddings to the different,

25   and more compelling, facts of this case, there is no


                                        38

 1   reason -- there is every reason to provide Belmontes

 2   relief, where it was denied to Payton.                  And there's no

 3   reason to believe that the California Supreme Court was

 4   being incorrect, but reasonable, in -- to presume, or

 5   find, based on Payton, that the California Supreme Court

 6   was being incorrect, but reasonable, in this case.

 7            Penry could not have won his case under the --

 8   under the -- that particular analysis, because the Texas

 9   --

10            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I --

11            MR. MULTHAUP:         -- Supreme Court --

12            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Graham didn't win his

13   case.

14            MR. MULTHAUP:         And Payton didn't win either, but

15   we're operating under the prior regime.                 So -- I

16   understand the -- the Court is suggesting, I believe, that

17   somehow Payton is a sword, in some sense, to deny relief

18   as to all California defendants under penalty-phase

19   instructional claims cited by the California Supreme

20   Court, even under different facts and under more egregious

21   circumstances.   And I -- I may have -- be misinterpreting

22   the Court's argument, but I would argue that there are any

23   number of scenarios, notwithstanding Payton, that would

24   require relief under the pre-AEDPA standards when you

25   apply the test of Boyde to all the circumstances of the


                                       39

 1   case.

 2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Multhaup, one aspect of

 3   your argument I wish you would clarify, and that's in your

 4   brief at page 20, footnote 3.             As I understand it, you are

 5   saying -- you are not challenging factor -- the factor (k)

 6   instruction as excluding Skipper evidence.                     Your challenge

 7   is limited to this particular case.                     Is that what you're

 8   saying in that footnote?

 9             MR. MULTHAUP:        Yes, Your Honor.               I'm not here to

10   refight the battle of Boyde.            You know, I spilled tons of

11   hours of time and printer's ink in an amicus brief in

12   1989, and I understand the concept of "you lose."                    What we

13   are arguing is that the Boyde test should be applied to

14   the circumstances of this case, and that factor (k),

15   standing alone, in a -- in a case where defendant relies

16   on Skipper evidence, does not warrant relief by that fact

17   alone.   Here we have much more than that fact which, under

18   Boyde, does call for relief.

19             I would like to give --

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And the --

21             MR. MULTHAUP:        -- Respondent's --

22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- the "much more" is the

23   questions that the jury asked?

24             MR. MULTHAUP:        The "much more" includes the

25   arguments by counsel, which, notwithstanding different --


                                       40

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reasonably differing views of it, does put a context on

 2   the -- put into context what defense counsel was arguing.

 3   We have the confusion inherent in the instruction that the

 4   Court gave the -- the putatively proper instruction about

 5   them being illustrative rather than exhaustive.               We have

 6   the colloquy during the penalty deliberations.               We have

 7   Juror Hailstone's follow-up question regarding the

 8   possibility of considering the availability of psychiatric

 9   treatment, which was explicitly rejected, and very likely

10   confirming the message that had just been given to -- via

11   the answer to Juror Hern's case, that only the enumerated

12   factors can be considered.

13            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, there is no

14   evidence on that question presented, right?              The reason

15   that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be

16   considered is because neither party had put evidence on

17   that question before the jury.

18            MR. MULTHAUP:         Well, Your Honor, you know that,

19   because you're the Chief Justice, but the people of San

20   Joaquin County had no idea that that was the reason, and

21   if not explained --

22            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               No, no.   It's a question

23   of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury.              The

24   jurors couldn't consider that, because it was the -- quite

25   proper for the trial judge to say, "You can't consider


                                      41

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that, because there was no evidence on it."

 2              MR. MULTHAUP:         It would have been perfectly

 3   proper for the trial court to say, "You can't consider

 4   that, because" -- appended exactly the -- the explanation

 5   that you gave.     And the jurors would have understood that

 6   they had to consider the evidence presented, but they

 7   couldn't speculate about other things.                      If, at the crucial

 8   point in the proceedings, the trial court had said, "Juror

 9   Hern, you do have to pay attention to those factors, but

10   they're illustrative rather than exhaustive, and you must

11   consider all of Belmontes' evidence.                      Please go back and

12   deliberate," that would have cured the errors here.

13              However, the error occurred when the -- when the

14   court didn't do that.        And Juror Hailstone's question --

15   the trial court's answer could only have reaffirmed the

16   misimpression that the court returned to the -- to

17   deliberate with.

18              I have a -- just a few minutes, and I would like

19   to give Respondent's answer to Justice Kennedy's question

20   to Petitioner, paraphrasing somewhat, How does Skipper

21   evidence extenuate the gravity of the crime?                      And the

22   answer is, it doesn't at all, logically, ethically, or

23   morally.   As defense counsel conveyed to the jury, the

24   circumstances of the crime are what they are, and there's

25   nothing that can be done about that.                      The circumstances of


                                         42

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the crime are immutable and irreparable.                 The only thing

 2   that can be extenuated in a penalty presentation is

 3   Petitioner's culpability for the crime.                 And counsel

 4   argued that Petitioner's culpability was some -- to some

 5   extent, extenuated and mitigated because the evidence

 6   showed that there was no plan to kill the decedent when

 7   they went to her house.

 8            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But we have said that remorse

 9   extenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment

10   purposes, under factor (k).

11            MR. MULTHAUP:         Well, of --

12            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that --

13            MR. MULTHAUP:         -- course --

14            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that -- and that -- that's

15   post -- that's post-crime.

16            MR. MULTHAUP:         And, Your Honor, this pre- and

17   post- distinction, I don't believe has -- is a relevant

18   distinction.   It's whether it's functionally related to

19   the culpability for the crime, because when a defendant

20   expresses remorse --

21            JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Oh, you think pre- and crime --

22   pre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case?

23   I thought that was really the linchpin of your argument?

24            MR. MULTHAUP:         No, Your Honor.          It's that

25   Skipper evidence is a specific and different kind of


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mitigating character evidence that doesn't extenuate the

 2   gravity of the crime, but it provides a different kind of

 3   reason for sparing the defendant's life.                There is --

 4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And yours is both pre- and

 5   post- -- that is, you're referring to conduct that took

 6   place before this crime was committed -- that is, his

 7   prior incarceration -- and asking the jury to project that

 8   forward to say, "That's how he behaved in prison, before

 9   he committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's

10   likely to behave again."

11             MR. MULTHAUP:        Well, all of the Skipper evidence

12   in this case occurred as a matter of historical fact

13   before the capital crime and -- which, in fact, gives it's

14   much -- gives it much more weight, because it can't be

15   suggested that he contrived his good conduct after being

16   arrested for a capital crime.

17             But, I'm going to make a broad statement here.

18   There is no reported case in California where either a

19   defense attorney or the California Supreme Court makes a

20   text-based argument that Skipper evidence extenuates the

21   gravity of the crime, because it's illogical and doesn't

22   work.   Look what the defense attorney did in Payton.                 He

23   argued that, "Well, of course you have to consider that

24   evidence under factor (k), because it's a catchall.               It's

25   supposed to be inclusive."          That's not a text-based


                                       44

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   argument, that's a circumstantial-evidence kind of -- kind

 2   of argument.

 3               When we look at that -- when we look at that

 4   phrasing of "extenuating the gravity of the crime," with

 5   its plain meaning in English, and the distinction made, in

 6   Skipper itself, that Skipper evidence does not relate to

 7   Petitioner's culpability for the crime, the jury is going

 8   to appreciate what the -- what the attorney said to them,

 9   that the -- that the Youth Authority religious evidence

10   does not extenuate the gravity of the crime, but has

11   independent mitigating effect outside those enumerated

12   factors.    There's nothing -- that's a perfectly

13   appropriate position to take, no constitutional problem

14   there until, during deliberations, the trial court

15   confirmed that they could only consider the enumerated

16   factors and could not consider nonstatutory mitigation,

17   the -- any other kind of mitigation, because that, in

18   effect, closed out consideration of the -- of the Skipper

19   evidence.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:          If the judge's response to

21   Juror Hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to

22   it, if it was as obviously misleading as you say?

23               MR. MULTHAUP:        Your Honor, it's like being --

24   stepping off a curb and being hit by a bicycle that you

25   didn't see coming.      This occurs in the middle of jury


                                         45

 1   deliberations.    Nobody expected a juror to ask a question

 2   of this type.    And, of course, I'm speculating here, but

 3   the trial court fielded the questions, responded off-the-

 4   cuff, and the juror -- jury went back.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's why you have counsel

 6   there, to help the court when the court makes a real

 7   boo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say,

 8   one would have expected some objection from defense

 9   counsel.

10              MR. MULTHAUP:        One could also have expected the

11   trial court to say, "Let's take a minute to think about

12   that.   We're going into recess, and I'd like counsel's

13   opinion about this, because this is a difficult question.

14   It's not a simple yes-or-no answer."                     Under --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

16              Mr. Johnson, you have 6 minutes remaining.

17              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON

18                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19              MR. JOHNSON:       Thank you, Your Honor.

20              In a minute, I'd like to briefly touch on the

21   Teague issue.    At the time Belmontes' judgment was

22   pending, there was no precedent that would have dictated

23   the Ninth Circuit's conclusion here regarding the

24   sufficiency of the factor (k) instruction.                     And, indeed,

25   this Court's subsequent holdings, in Boyde and Payton,


                                        46

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   bear out the fact that it was at least -- that that

 2   decision certainly was not dictated by precedent.

 3            In Boyde, this Court dealt with evidence of good

 4   character that was precisely the same as the evidence of

 5   good character here.      The -- Belmontes' evidence of having

 6   succeeded during a prior commitment and religious

 7   conversion, that he might be able to help others in the

 8   future, was good-character evidence in the same way that

 9   Boyde's evidence of having won a dancing prize, of having

10   helped children, of having helped artistic -- having

11   artistic abilities, was all good character.               And there is

12   certainly nothing in Boyde to suggest that there is any

13   distinction.   But, even if there was, it would not be one

14   that would compel all rational jurists to distinguish the

15   two cases.

16            And that's further buttressed, of course, by

17   this Court's more recent opinion in Payton, which found

18   that it was at least reasonable for the State Court to

19   conclude that Payton's post-crime forward-looking evidence

20   would be understood to fall within the factor (k)

21   instruction if it was at least reasonable for California

22   to find that such forward -- post-crime forward-looking

23   evidence would fit within the factor (k).               The Ninth

24   Circuit's conclusion, to the contrary, regarding pre-crime

25   good-character evidence, certainly was not dictated by


                                       47

 1   precedent.

 2               I'd also like to address, quickly in my

 3   remaining time, Mr. Multhaup's arguments regarding the

 4   jury -- or the argument of counsel and the jury questions.

 5               Again, Boyde counsels that the relevant

 6   consideration is whether there is any reasonable

 7   likelihood that the jurors view the instructions in a way

 8   as to foreclose consideration of constitutionally relevant

 9   evidence.    In this case, both -- the jurors were

10   instructed with the factor (k).               As I've said, they were

11   given the supplemental instruction that said that the --

12   that the previous listing -- factors were only examples of

13   some.   And then, both counsel clearly said that the jurors

14   could, and should, consider this evidence.

15               Is there some possibility out there that some

16   juror might have misinterpreted this in a -- in a -- in a

17   different manner?    I suppose so, but there is certainly no

18   reasonable likelihood, especially in light of the fact

19   that Belmontes' evidence, virtually all of it, was

20   directed at this main thrust of the argument.               And, just

21   like in Payton and Boyde, for the jurors to have believed

22   that they could nonetheless not consider that evidence

23   would have turned the whole proceedings in a virtual

24   charade or a pointless exercise.

25               So far as the questions during juror

 1   deliberations, it's, first, important to recognize, none

 2   of these jurors said anything to suggest that they were

 3   actually confused about whether they could consider any

 4   evidence offered.    Their question -- Juror Hern's question

 5   merely related to her -- she wanted to confirm her

 6   understanding about the role of balancing mitigating

 7   versus aggravating factors under California law.                And

 8   certainly the parties there if -- would have been in a

 9   better position to realize it if these questions somehow

10   suggested some ambiguity.           There was no objection there.

11   Moreover, in the same conference, the judge advised the

12   jurors to review the instructions again, which, of course,

13   again included the factor (k), and which, of course,

14   included the supplemental instruction that said that their

15   consideration of mitigating factors was not limited to

16   those that had been listed, but those that had been listed

17   were merely examples.

18            If the Court has no further questions, I will

19   submit the case.

20            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Counsel.

21            The case is submitted.

22            [Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the

23   above-entitled matter was submitted.]
