 3           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We will hear argument

 4      first in Case 07-1239, Winter v. Natural Resources

 5                 Defense Council.           General Garre.

 6                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 7                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8                 GENERAL GARRE:         Thank you, Mr.

 9    Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

10                 The ability to locate and track an enemy

11   submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar

12   is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike

13   groups deployed around the world and therefore critical

14   to the nation's own security.              In this case the Ninth

15   Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places

16   serious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in

17   training exercises that in the judgment of the President

18   and his top naval officers are in the paramount

19   interests of the United States.               That injunction is

20   fundamentally flawed for three principal reasons.

21                 First, it is based on an erroneous

22   assessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's

23   NEPA claim.    Second it is based on an erroneous

24   conception of the showing of irreparable injury

25   necessary to secure what this Court has aptly called


                                         3

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "the extraordinary and dramatic remedy" of a preliminary

 2   injunction.     And finally, it fails to take account the

 3   vital public interests in conducting the training

 4   exercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's

 5   restrictions.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             General Garre, when you

 7   address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as

 8   originally ordered by the district court or are you

 9   taking account of the modification made by the Ninth

10   Circuit, and would you say that the three points you

11   just made would apply as well to the injunction as

12   modified?

13                 GENERAL GARRE:          Certainly we would,

14   Justice Ginsburg.     Obviously our position on the NEPA

15   claim is the same with respect to any aspect of the

16   injunction.    So too with the risk of irreparable harm

17   which we think Respondents haven't shown.                   The Ninth

18   Circuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial

19   stay.   It's important to keep in mind that its

20   modifications were tied only to a stay.                   It didn't

21   actually modify the injunction.                So even if this Court

22   thought those modifications were appropriate, it would

23   have to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Say it again?      I'm not sure

25   I --

 1              GENERAL GARRE:            The Ninth Circuit framed its

 2   modifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision

 3   affirming the district court's preliminary injunction.

 4   That stay and therefore those modifications remained in

 5   effect only until this Court issued its decision in this

 6   case.

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's the temporary

 8   stay pending certiorari, right?

 9              GENERAL GARRE:            Right.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I think what

11   Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can

12   correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from

13   the initial preliminary injunction and the modified

14   preliminary injunction.

15              GENERAL GARRE:            Well, yes, we are here

16   complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard

17   shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes

18   within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these

19   strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as

20   well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when

21   significant surface ducting conditions are present

22   regardless of the presence of marine mammals.

23              JUSTICE ALITO:            You mentioned the effect on

24   naval operations.    On the other side, could you say what

25   the record shows about the number of marine mammals that


                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   are likely to be killed or receive actual physical

 2   injury if the -- as opposed to some sort of behavioral

 3   modification, if the injunction is allowed to continue?

 4               GENERAL GARRE:          The record -- and here I'm

 5   referring to the environmental assessment and the

 6   opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the

 7   petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates

 8   that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of

 9   these exercises.   The environmental assessment predicted

10   there would be eight instances of injurious harm.              These

11   eight instances would take place only with respect to a

12   common species of dolphins of which there are hundreds

13   of thousands in the Southern California Operating Area.

14               Now, the environmental assessment also

15   predicted that there would be a much greater number,

16   170,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level

17   B takes.   These are temporary and by definition

18   non-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at

19   pages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the

20   JA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances,

21   the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the

22   environmental assessment, are temporary and

23   non-injurious.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Just as to dolphins?

25               GENERAL GARRE:          The vast majority of those


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   disturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to

 2   dolphins.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:           And what percentage is

 4   that of the total population in the area?

 5               GENERAL GARRE:         Well, I think that the

 6   statistics I have indicate that there are more than I

 7   think 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there.               As

 8   to -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in

 9   the Southern California Operating Area.                But this is --

10   no one suggests that is in any way a threatened species.

11               With respect to the species that are

12   endangered, threatened, or even strategic under the

13   Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine

14   Fisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse

15   harm on the population level or with respect to annual

16   recruitment rates with respect to those endangered or

17   threatened species in the biological opinion that the

18   district court sustained and that Respondents are not

19   challenging on appeal.

20               The focus of their claim of irreparable

21   injury -- and keep in mind that that environmental

22   assessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year

23   history of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern

24   California Operating Area at the same frequency and, if

25   anything, during more frequent training exercises than


                                       7

 1   have been conducted in recent years.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You didn't mention the

 3   564 exposures that were typed Level A in the

 4   environmental assessment.

 5                 GENERAL GARRE:          With respect to beaked

 6   whales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.                  Those

 7   disturbances are temporary, non-injurious disturbances.

 8   That's important.     Let me give you the page cites to the

 9   record on that because it's an important point.                    JA 178

10   to 180, JA 185 to 188, and JA 198 to 200 discuss each

11   species of the beaked whales and explain that the harms

12   that are predicted in the environmental assessment are

13   non-injurious, temporary harms.

14                 Now as a policy matter --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:          In lay terms, what does that

16   mean?     Does it mean an alteration of their swimming

17   pattern, their migration pattern?                  What does it mean?

18                 GENERAL GARRE:          In most cases it means that

19   there's an alerting response, they hear the sound and

20   they go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a

21   noise that disturbs them would ordinarily do.                  It can

22   also mean that they could have some temporary effect on

23   their feeding or breeding patterns, but it's a temporary

24   effect.

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:          It doesn't necessarily mean


                                          8

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that there's a physical injury to them, does it?

 2              GENERAL GARRE:            No.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:            It means that they may just

 4   swim in a different direction.

 5              GENERAL GARRE:            That's right.       By definition

 6   only a Level A take involves an injurious harm, that is

 7   a physical harm which results in permanent damage to

 8   tissue.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I thought the 564 number

10   was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure

11   resulting in severe harm.

12              GENERAL GARRE:            It is confusing,

13   Justice Ginsburg.    The Navy as a policy matter described

14   for purposes of the environmental assessment the Level B

15   takes with respect to beaked whales as Level A takes

16   because the Navy acknowledged that there is uncertainty

17   about the effects of sonar on beaked whales.               But when

18   you look at what the environmental assessment says as to

19   the actual injuries that the National Marine Fish and

20   Wildlife Service and the Navy predicted based on the

21   best science available to them and to us today, they are

22   non-injurious, temporary exposures, and that is made

23   clear at the portions of the JA that I mentioned.

24              Now, the Navy -- there is nothing that

25   prevents an agency from characterizing the particular


                                         9

 1   harm one way or the other as a policy matter for

 2   purposes of an environmental assessment.

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question,

 4   Mr. Solicitor General.       Is it understood, though, that

 5   there is a duty to prepare an environmental impact

 6   statement?

 7                GENERAL GARRE:         Yes, there is, because we're

 8   not here arguing that, at this point, that we had no

 9   duty to prepare an environmental impact statement

10   because of the intervening event of the Council for

11   Environmental Quality's emergency circumstances

12   alternative arrangements determination.                 That's the

13   pertinent administrative event for purposes of

14   Respondent's claim.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Let me follow that.

16   You concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of

17   the CEQ's emergency circumstances?

18                GENERAL GARRE:         Yes, it's one of the

19   alternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is

20   that the environmental impact statement which has been

21   under way will be completed by January 2009 with respect

22   to all activities in the Southern California Operating

23   Area.   Now, that's not to say that we concede that an

24   environmental impact statement was not required -- was

25   required at the outset.        The Navy doesn't concede that.

 1   It litigated this case up to the point of the Council

 2   for Environmental Quality's determination.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Why didn't you -- I

 4   mean, you emphasize the level of detail and

 5   comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that

 6   the Navy prepared.      Why didn't you just make -- why

 7   didn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset

 8   if you were going to engage in such effort with respect

 9   to the environmental assessment?

10               GENERAL GARRE:            Because the Navy devoted its

11   best resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate

12   bide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded

13   that there would not be a finding of significant

14   environmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees

15   an environmental impact statement is not required.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:              Suppose you have to do it.

17   Given all your work so far, how long would it take?                  You

18   had several months already, so how long?                  When could you

19   do it by?

20               GENERAL GARRE:            It's going to be completed

21   by January 2009, Justice Breyer, under the alternative

22   arrangements that have been approved --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:              So we're talking about two

24   months.

25               GENERAL GARRE:            Well, at this point we are.

 1   The point that the Navy faced in January of 2008, where

 2   it had an injunction against its use of sonar in these

 3   training exercises and only an environmental impact

 4   statement, it faced, as the Council of Environmental

 5   Quality found, emergency circumstances in terms of the

 6   need to conduct these training exercises.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I take it that you're are

 8   here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit,

 9   and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the

10   government on an ongoing basis; and what are the

11   principal reasons for that?

12               GENERAL GARRE:          Because of its impact on

13   national security, Justice Kennedy.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And what particular

15   errors?   The standard for review -- pardon me.                The

16   standard for the grant or denial of injunction?                 What

17   are the principal areas you want to present to us?

18               GENERAL GARRE:          I think there are three

19   fundamental flaws, as I indicated.                 One, we think the

20   Ninth Circuit just got the NEPA claim wrong.                 The Navy

21   is complying with NEPA through the alternative

22   arrangements and the regulations, but the CEQ found --

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Where was the statutory

24   authority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS?

25   You mentioned a regulation.            Where in the statute does

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it say that the Council on Environmental Quality can

 2   dispense with this requirement?

 3                 GENERAL GARRE:         I think we would point to a

 4   couple of things.    First, in terms of the statute, NEPA

 5   says that the obligations of the statute should be

 6   complied with to the fullest extent.                     And it doesn't

 7   specifically say what happens if they are not followed.

 8   These are procedural requirements.                  Secondly --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, but that's not the

10   question I am asking.       I am not asking about the

11   consequences of not complying.               I am asking what is the

12   statutory authority for the Council on Environmental

13   Quality to dispense with the statutory obligation to

14   prepare it?

15                 GENERAL GARRE:         Well --

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           That's what -- as I

17   understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as

18   an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance.

19   And I want to know what the statutory authority is for

20   that.   I don't see it in NEPA.

21                 GENERAL GARRE:         The statutory authority that

22   we find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for

23   alternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged

24   by this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority.                    The

25   Court acknowledged that in Department of Transportation

 1   v. Public Citizen.      So we take that as a given.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Okay.       As a general

 3   proposition that's fine, but what's the statutory

 4   authority for them to engage in rulemaking authority

 5   that dispenses with the government's obligation to

 6   comply with an EIS requirement?

 7               GENERAL GARRE:            Well, let me -- I'll answer

 8   the question, but let me be clear:                   The government's

 9   position is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by

10   complying with the alternative arrangements provided by

11   the Council on Environmental Quality.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But you -- I mean, the

13   claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time

14   the request for an injunction was brought, and

15   everything else is consequent on that.                    So I want to go

16   back to the point, in effect, at which the claim was

17   made that the government is not complying.                    One of your

18   answers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent

19   Council on Environmental Quality action, we're not in

20   the same situation that we were in when the suit was

21   brought.   And I want to know what the statutory

22   authority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to

23   take the action with the effect that you claim it has.

24               GENERAL GARRE:            And I would point, Your

25   Honor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be

 1   complied with to the fullest extent possible --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That --

 3               GENERAL GARRE:          --      and I would --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- seems to cut against

 5   you.   I am not getting it.

 6               GENERAL GARRE:          Well, that language, coupled

 7   with -- which seems to us to suggest that compliance to

 8   the fullest extent possible would depend on the

 9   circumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't

10   impose, doesn't say what the consequences of

11   noncompliance would be --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, but --

13               GENERAL GARRE:          -- but other --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But why -- I don't

15   know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ?

16   I mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory

17   authority -- EPA, CEQ.       And it seems to me that CEQ is

18   an odd entity to be doing this.              They're more or less an

19   office in the White House, rather than a free-standing

20   agency.

21               GENERAL GARRE:          Well, this Court has

22   acknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the

23   Public Citizen case a few years ago, that NEPA gives CEQ

24   rulemaking authority, and that this Court gives

25   substantial deference to the CEQ's rules.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Rulemaking to do what?

 2   To set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to

 3   carry out their obligations under NEPA?

 4               GENERAL GARRE:            To implement the statute,

 5   that's right.     And there are a number of important

 6   procedural requirements that go far beyond what the

 7   statute requires that the CEQ has laid out in its

 8   regulations.     One of the regulations -- and this has

 9   been on the books since 1979 and has been implemented

10   some 40 times.    So this isn't something that was made up

11   in this case.     It's an established regulatory practice

12   under NEPA that where there are emergency circumstances

13   an agency can come up with alternative arrangements to

14   comply with its NEPA obligations.                  And here those

15   alternative arrangements were:                One, to complete an EIS

16   that is under way for all sonar activities and all other

17   activities by the Navy in the Southern California

18   operating area by January 2009.                The Navy is going to

19   meet that goal.     Two, to adopt the mitigation measures

20   spelled out in the alternative arrangements.                  Three, to

21   provide for public participation so that there could be

22   comment on any concerns to marine mammals in the area.

23   And four, to provide for research into harms to marine

24   mammals.   These were significant arrangements that the

25   Navy agreed to.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what good is it if,

 2   as I understand it, the whole training program will be

 3   over in December, and then the environmental impact

 4   statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to

 5   come after the whole project is concluded?

 6               GENERAL GARRE:          Well, it has -- it's

 7   important because the environmental impact statement

 8   that's going to be completed pertains not only to

 9   COMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the

10   Southern California Operating Area in the future, but

11   all activities.   So that environmental impact statement

12   is going to be very meaningful.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Let me -- let me switch

14   back.   Chief?

15               Let me switch back in time for a second to

16   the beginning of these exercises.                One of the -- I mean,

17   one of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I

18   guess the appropriateness of the Council on

19   Environmental Quality's action, if it has any power to

20   act, is emergency circumstances.               My understanding, and

21   correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the

22   exercises began in February of 2007.                    My understanding

23   is that it was in that same month of February 2007 that

24   the Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment,

25   so that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy


                                       17
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   disclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at

 2   just about the same moment that it began the exercises.

 3              GENERAL GARRE:             I think --

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:               And I guess my question is,

 5   to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the

 6   emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any

 7   timely action?    I am assuming in my question that the

 8   Navy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was

 9   going to have these exercises.                So it sounds to me as

10   though that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the

11   Navy created simply by failing to start an EIS

12   preparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect

13   to sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark

14   until the last moment.         So, why -- why shouldn't we say

15   that -- even assuming the Council on Environmental

16   Quality can somehow dispense with the statute, why

17   shouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except

18   one which was created by the Navy's apparently

19   deliberate inattention?

20              GENERAL GARRE:             For several reasons,

21   Justice Souter.   First, there was a gap between when the

22   Navy issued its environmental assessment and when the

23   first training exercises began.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, it was a gap of less

25   than month, right?

 1                 GENERAL GARRE:         I believe -- I believe

 2   that's right, but there was a gap and there's no -- I

 3   don't think there can be any --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And how long does it -- how

 5   long does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's

 6   question, how long does it take to prepare an

 7   environmental impact statement?               It takes more than --

 8                 GENERAL GARRE:         Well, I --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           It takes more than a month,

10   doesn't it.

11                 GENERAL GARRE:         Sure.        Absolutely.

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

13                 GENERAL GARRE:         But I don't think --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And the Navy knew more than

15   the 1st -- earlier than the 1st of February that it was

16   going to engage in these exercises, didn't it?

17                 GENERAL GARRE:         It did, and it also knew

18   that it was in the process of finalizing an

19   environmental impact statement that it prepared in good

20   faith, a 293-page statement, which concluded that there

21   would be --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                An environmental

23   assessment.

24                 GENERAL GARRE:         An environmental assessment,

25   that's right, with the finding of no significant

 1   environmental impact.

 2               This Court presumes the regularity of

 3   administrative actions.        There's no reason for the Navy,

 4   particularly on this record, to have assumed that that

 5   EA would not have been sustained.                The emergency

 6   circumstances arose in January 2008, when the district

 7   court enjoined the use of MFA sonar in these exercises

 8   when the Navy had several exercises.

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Sure, but they wouldn't

10   have been in the situation in January of 2008 if they

11   hadn't been in the situation I described in February of

12   2007.   And it sounds to me as though the Navy played its

13   cards very close to its vest --

14               GENERAL GARRE:          Well --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- in 2007.

16               GENERAL GARRE:          Well, with respect, I don't

17   think that a 293-page environmental assessment with the

18   kind of detail and support that this assessment has --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Look, the problem you face

20   -- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are

21   effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is

22   necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these

23   alternative arrangements.          But you should not be

24   estopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued

25   that was not a good faith completion of all the Navy's


                                       20

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   responsibilities.    And that's the argument that is being

 2   made against you now.       It assumes that the EA wasn't

 3   enough.   And I'm not sure that we -- that that

 4   assumption is valid.

 5                 GENERAL GARRE:         Well, that's right.       And as

 6   I indicated earlier -- I want to be clear -- the Navy

 7   believes that its environmental assessment was not only

 8   prepared in good faith, but was appropriate and reached

 9   the right conclusions.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's exactly what

11   Justice Kennedy started to ask.               I mean, I said why

12   doesn't this thing go away after two months.               I mean,

13   you've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because

14   you want a holding from the Court that will help you in

15   other cases because you think what the court below did

16   here was wrong.    And you said "three reasons," and you

17   got out the first one, and I would like to hear the

18   other two.

19                 GENERAL GARRE:         The other two are:       One, the

20   injunction.    Even if you agree with Respondents on the

21   likelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a

22   showing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally

23   flawed.   The Ninth Circuit and the district court looked

24   to whether there was irreparable injury under a

25   possibility standard.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Didn't both the circuit and

 2   the district court, although they mentioned that, in

 3   fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was

 4   --   beyond question.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Near -- "near certainty."

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            "Near certainty."

 7               GENERAL GARRE:          They did, Justice Souter,

 8   and we think --

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:            There is no -- there is no

10   harm.   I mean, the standard may or may not be bright,

11   but there is no harm to the Navy in this case from --

12   from the use of that standard, I take it.

13               GENERAL GARRE:          Well, I don't think that a

14   court could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of

15   reasons.

16               First, when a lower court applies a

17   fundamentally wrong standard to assess -- to make a

18   determination, this Court usually corrects that legal

19   standard and gives the -- the lower court an opportunity

20   to do it again.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, we -- we may, but so

22   far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently

23   do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no

24   harm in this case, the error was harmless.

25               GENERAL GARRE:          And, two, the finding, which


                                       22

 1   is a sentence in the district court decision repeated by

 2   the court of appeals, of "near certainty of harm to

 3   marine mammals" is utterly belied by the environmental

 4   assessment in this case as well as the fact that -- and

 5   the Ninth Circuit acknowledged this -- the Navy has been

 6   using MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating

 7   Area for more than 40 years and no one can point to any

 8   harm to marine mammals.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let me ask you --

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Garre, could I ask you

11   a question?

12                 GENERAL GARRE:         Yes.

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           If this were not a Navy

14   case with all of the implications of the Navy, but an

15   ordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS

16   had to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action

17   to enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was

18   filed?   Because the -- the very fact that you need an

19   EIS is -- is because you don't know what environmental

20   consequences may ensue.         That's the purpose of the EIS.

21   So isn't it the normal practice to enjoin government

22   action until the EIS is filed when it is clear there is

23   a duty to file?

24                 GENERAL GARRE:         I don't think it is,

25   Justice Stevens.    I think it is -- the normal practice


                                        23
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is to require someone who seeks the extraordinary remedy

 2   of a preliminary injunction to show irreparable injury,

 3   a likelihood of irreparable injury.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Would the irreparable

 5   injury have to -- and this just repeats

 6   Justice Stevens's question.             It is the same concern I

 7   have.

 8                 Let's assume an EIS is required; let's

 9   assume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the

10   government project is going to proceed.                  You still have

11   to show irreparable harm before you can get the

12   injunction?

13                 GENERAL GARRE:         You do.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you have authority for

15   that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?

16                 GENERAL GARRE:         Well, I don't have authority

17   for that precise proposition because I don't --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, yes, you do, but it

19   may not be in the circuits.             Our cases say that

20   procedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that

21   confers standing; that there has to be some concrete

22   harm.

23                 GENERAL GARRE:         Well --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And -- and the only injury

 1   EIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire

 2   population.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then, let's -- let's

 4   assume standing.    Let's assume standing.               Let's -- let's

 5   assume people have standing.

 6                 GENERAL GARRE:         I -- I think that that's

 7   right, Judge Scalia.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, I wouldn't -- look,

 9   you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself,

10   once it reads it, might decide to do something else.

11   That's the whole point of an EIS.                 So if the agency goes

12   ahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes

13   committed to that course of action, and the chances that

14   the EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the

15   chances that any big agency will back up once it's

16   committed to a course, namely a lot lower.                 And that I

17   always thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there

18   to stop.

19                 GENERAL GARRE:         Clearly, the purpose of the

20   requirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency

21   has -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't

22   think there is any question that the Navy was after its

23   293-page assessment.

24                 I am not aware of any --

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But that -- in effect, you

 1   are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.

 2              GENERAL GARRE:            No, I'm not, Justice Souter.

 3   I am saying --

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:              What is the difference

 5   between them?    I -- I assume the difference is the EIS

 6   is a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of

 7   conclusions.

 8              GENERAL GARRE:            That's right, but then --

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:              So that without the EIS,

10   the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree

11   of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it

12   had done -- done the EIS.

13              GENERAL GARRE:            I -- the EIS --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:              And that, I presume, is the

15   harm that the -- that the statute is intended to

16   prevent.

17              GENERAL GARRE:            But it is not a likely --

18   they have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              The EA demonstrates in your

20   view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that

21   this -- this action by the Navy is okay.                 And since that

22   is the case, there is -- there is no probability of

23   irreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the

24   probability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.

25              GENERAL GARRE:            Well, we agree with that.

 1   We think it's important, though, to separate out the

 2   likelihood of success on the NEPA claim with the

 3   distinct question of whether there is irreparable injury

 4   and look to the record of whether there is irreparable

 5   injury.   And we think they have not come close to

 6   establishing that.      The one final --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Are there any authorities

 8   in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable

 9   injury is not required when there's standing, when an

10   EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and

11   when the government is ready to proceed?                   There is

12   always irreparable injury before you can get an

13   injunction?    That's what all the circuits say?

14                 GENERAL GARRE:          Justice Kennedy, I haven't

15   completed that -- that research with respect to all of

16   the circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not

17   aware of a decision in which a court has said that the

18   irreparable injury requirement does not have to be met

19   or is automatically met.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            The whole theory of the --

21   of the environmental impact statement is that we don't

22   really know what the harm will be.                   So how can you say

23   that in order to get an injunction against the

24   government action you have to prove irreparable harm?

25                 GENERAL GARRE:          And it may be easier in some

 1   cases than others, Justice Stevens.                      But I think in this

 2   case where you have the record that has been compiled,

 3   they cannot -- they cannot --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:              But you're really arguing

 5   that an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will

 6   always be enough.

 7              GENERAL GARRE:            We're not taking that

 8   position, Justice Stevens.           We're taking the position

 9   that the record in this case does not show a likelihood

10   of irreparable injury.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:              In all -- in all of these

12   cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an

13   EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary.                     So if the

14   mere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an

15   allegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a

16   preliminary injunction in all cases?

17              GENERAL GARRE:            I think that's right.            I

18   think that fundamentally --

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I thought that you were

20   not suggesting --

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:              But there is a finding

22   that it is necessary, and here we have that finding as I

23   understand it.

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And you are not

25   suggesting that -- that there is a probability of

 1   success on the claim that you had to file an

 2   environmental impact statement.

 3                 GENERAL GARRE:          We -- we are contesting

 4   that.     And if I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 5   And one must -- I can explain, if you would like,

 6   Justice.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.          I thought you

 8   conceded that point.

 9                 GENERAL GARRE:          If I misspoke, I apologize.

10   My point was that the administrative determination that

11   is at issue now in evaluating the NEPA claim is the

12   finding of alternative arrangements.                      The Navy has never

13   conceded that it was required to do an EIS at the

14   outset.    It simply has agreed to live with the

15   alternative arrangements approved by the Council on

16   Environmental Quality.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

20                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. KENDALL

21                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22                 MR. KENDALL:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23   please the Court:

24                 The fundamental question in this case is a

25   very traditional question of equity jurisprudence.                        The

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   fundamental question is whether the district court's

 2   factual finding that the injunction will permit the Navy

 3   to train and certify its sailors is supported by the

 4   evidence.   Because if it is supported by the evidence it

 5   cannot be clearly erroneous.            And if it is not clearly

 6   erroneous, it cannot be reversed.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't there something

 8   incredibly odd about a single district judge making a

 9   determination on that defense question that is contrary

10   to the determination that the Navy has made?

11               MR. KENDALL:         Justice Alito, I submit not,

12   and here is why.   This was an issue of fact.           The

13   question was whether, in light of the Navy's past

14   training, which was abundantly shown in the record,

15   their post-complaint, during the litigation, lawyer-

16   crafted declarations were sufficiently persuasive to

17   undo all that evidence that showed that the Navy had

18   repeatedly used safety zones.

19               Now, what happened here was that the judge

20   was extraordinarily deferential to the Navy.            The judge

21   rejected most of the measures that plaintiffs sought,

22   crediting where the evidence was not to the contrary the

23   declarations of the Navy saying, for example, we need to

24   train at night.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            I didn't see evidence to


                                       30

 1   the contrary on two important points.                     The first was

 2   that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I

 3   read them.     Maybe I just missed the contrary.                  But they

 4   said that:     You are requiring us, judge, to turn the

 5   sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever,

 6   whenever we had to run into a situation called layering

 7   of different temperature levels.                 And we tell you, as

 8   naval officers, that that's just where submarines like

 9   to hide.     And we also tell you that if we can't train

10   people to do that they will miss out on an important

11   part of how to find these submarines.

12                 I saw no answer to that.

13                 The second thing they said was that:                   We're

14   willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine

15   mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter

16   of a mile, about.     But you insist that we turn off the

17   sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter.

18   And that's quite a big distance more.                     A lot of animals

19   come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all

20   those times, we are not going to be able to get much

21   training done.

22                 Now, those two things seem to be quite

23   important.    And I just might have missed, which I might

24   have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by

25   equivalent experts to those points.

 1               MR. KENDALL:        Justice Breyer, the response

 2   in the record appears in the after-action reports of the

 3   eight prior exercises in Southern California.            There

 4   were four from the series that we challenge and four

 5   after-action reports, prepared earlier ones.            And you

 6   will find those in the joint appendix at 326 to -45.

 7               What the court found was that the Navy had

 8   trained and certified its troops during those eight

 9   SOCAL exercises despite the complete absence of surface

10   ducting conditions.     And it was conceded --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:           What do you mean, despite

12   the complete absence?

13               MR. KENDALL:        Because surface ducting

14   conditions are, as it happens, quite rare.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:           That's the whole point.

16   That's why I thought they didn't prove anything.            Fine,

17   they went on some exercises and they didn't run into

18   these layered things.      So obviously they couldn't have

19   training.

20               MR. KENDALL:        Right.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, what they are saying

22   is, when you do run into that situation you've got to

23   train people to deal with it.            It doesn't prove much

24   that when you didn't run into it they didn't train

25   people to deal with it.        How could they have?

 1               MR. KENDALL:         Well, the question before the

 2   court was balancing the requirement that the Navy comply

 3   with the law and the environmental harms against the

 4   Navy's interest.   And our point --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, with one

 6   important qualification.         The question was the balance

 7   of those equities on a preliminary basis.                   In other

 8   words, before we reach a final decision, we're going to

 9   prevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises

10   that they think are necessary.              Not even after we have

11   decided they were wrong, just because we think there is

12   a likelihood that they might be wrong.

13               MR. KENDALL:         That's quite right.            And of

14   course, in this litigation that was the whole ball game,

15   because by the time you had reached trial in this case

16   all of the exercises --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought that

18   would have been the whole ball game until I read your

19   brief.   Your brief does not spend a page defending the

20   decision on the merits of the lower courts.                   Nothing

21   about emergency circumstances or CEQ.                   Instead, you

22   raise other arguments on which the district court did

23   not rely in finding likelihood of success.                   So given

24   that, I would have thought we would have a lot more to

25   talk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on

 1   the merits.

 2                 MR. KENDALL:        I respectfully disagree.            We

 3   took the position from the beginning --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, yes, yes.     You

 5   certainly raised those issues.               I'm not saying that.

 6   What I am saying the district court didn't rely on those

 7   in finding likelihood of success.

 8                 MR. KENDALL:        Well, I also disagree on that

 9   point.   You will find at page 97a of the appendix that

10   was submitted with the petition for certiorari the

11   court's declaration that there was no emergency.                    You

12   will find --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

14                 MR. KENDALL:        But that's the question.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's what the

16   district court relied on.           Where in your brief do I see

17   a defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed

18   to the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and

19   everything else, issues the district court didn't reach?

20                 MR. KENDALL:        The district court did reach

21   the question of whether the Navy could train.                  That

22   negated any emergency under any definition of the term.

23   It doesn't matter whether -- and there was debate about

24   this below -- an emergency can be foreseeable and

25   expected, as Justice Souter was -- his questions were


                                        34

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   probing, or whether the emergency can be -- must be

 2   unexpected.     There was debate about that below.               But the

 3   position that we took and the position that the district

 4   court took was there is no emergency.

 5                 The reason there is no emergency is because

 6   the Navy -- the Navy is perfectly able to train under

 7   these circumstances.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's what I can't --

 9   look, I don't know anything about this.                   I'm not a naval

10   officer.     But if I see an admiral come along with an

11   affidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible --

12   that you've got to train people when there are these

13   layers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there

14   with all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that

15   under oath.     And I see on the other side a district

16   judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look

17   to see what the basis is, because I know that district

18   judge doesn't know about it, either.

19                 So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this

20   one is zero.     That's -- because what you have told me is

21   they completed some exercise where they didn't find any

22   layering.

23                 MR. KENDALL:         There was also prior exercise

24   in Hawaii.     You will recall from the brief that we had a

25   prior litigation that resulted in the consent decree in


                                         35
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Hawaii.   In that consent decree the Navy agreed to train

 2   with a surface ducting powerdown.                 So, they had

 3   previously told the same judge that they were capable of

 4   training in surface ducting conditions with that

 5   powerdown, else they would not have agreed to that

 6   decree.   There was evidence in the record.

 7                The problem that the judge had is that the

 8   Navy cannot be judge of its own cause.                   Deference does

 9   have its limits.    And this judge was in a position of

10   reviewing facts of prior exercises and what the Navy --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            Generalities.       You see --

12   of course, I agree with you as a generality.                  What I am

13   missing here is the specifics, because I am nervous

14   about it, as you can see.           And what I am nervous about

15   is that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on

16   your side.

17                MR. KENDALL:         If I may proceed then to the

18   safety zone specifics, because that's the other issue.

19   Remember there were a number of injunctive measures that

20   the Navy objected to in the district court that they no

21   longer object to.    They ceased to object to them in the

22   court of appeals and they haven't brought them up here.

23                So the next issue is the 2200-yard safety

24   zone.   Now, first, why was the safety zone chosen?                 It

25   was chosen because that is the Navy's preferred method

 1   of mitigation.     They have always mitigated using safety

 2   zones.     They have preferred to mitigate using a safety

 3   zone that is 1,000 yards.            We asked for one that was

 4   2,200 yards.

 5                 The question was, what is the difference in

 6   training capability in the two zones?                      So we looked at

 7   that.    And where did we look?             We looked at the

 8   statistics from the after-action reports.

 9                 Now, in this case we had helpful information

10   to use, because the after-action reports reveal that the

11   effect of widening the safety zone would have been at

12   most one more shutdown or powerdown each exercise.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It would have

14   increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to

15   scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals

16   there.

17                 MR. KENDALL:         Incorrect.             Incorrect.   It

18   would --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, the

20   increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards.                          But

21   it's 1,000 yards of circle.              And if I remember high

22   school geometry right, that's a squared increase.

23                 MR. KENDALL:         But think about how this is

24   being done.    The way it's being done is that you have

25   somebody on the deck with binoculars and they are

 1   looking straight ahead and they can either look out

 2   1,000 yards or out 2,000 yards.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And there are people

 4   in airplanes?

 5                MR. KENDALL:        Yes.       Yes.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Not just straight

 7   ahead.

 8                MR. KENDALL:        There are people in airplanes

 9   and they are looking down and they can see as much as

10   they can see within that area.              And if they see a marine

11   mammal, there will be a shutdown or a powerdown; and if

12   they don't see it, there won't be one.                  You can only

13   shut down or power down when you see one.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I guess my question

15   was, that increases the area exponentially that has to

16   be scrutinized.   And I don't see why, as you said, that

17   was wrong.

18                MR. KENDALL:        Because they argued -- and

19   perhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice, that you

20   were referring to their argument -- which is not that

21   the area was exponentially larger and that creates

22   difficulties of observation; they argued it would create

23   an exponentially greater number of shutdowns.                  And that

24   is mathematically proven false by the after-action

25   reports, because it's one per exercise.

 1              And this judge, keep in mind, had been

 2   listening to the Navy make factual assertions from the

 3   very beginning.    And the factual assertions that the

 4   Navy made at the start of this case about the nature of

 5   the environmental harms were completely disproven by the

 6   EA and by the expert evidence that was brought to bear.

 7   And there are a number of statements that General Garre

 8   may that I think I should address.

 9              One of them in answer to questions from

10   Justice Ginsburg had to do with the Level A takes on

11   beaked whales.    The Navy tries to dismiss those by

12   saying we only graded the effects on beaked whales as

13   Level A because we did that as a matter of generous

14   policy.

15              They didn't do it for policy reasons.                       They

16   did it because that's what the science compels, because

17   beaked whales have stranded repeatedly around the world

18   correlated -- caused by in the views of scientists, and

19   the evidence is overwhelming, by sonar.                      And the reason

20   that happens especially to beaked whales is because they

21   dive for very long periods of time.                      And when they dive

22   for very long periods of time, and they are then

23   bombarded with sonar, which by the way in sound

24   intensity, in this courtroom if we had a jet engine and

25   you multiplied that noise by 2,000 times, correcting for

 1   water, that's the sound's intensity that would be going

 2   on in the water if you were a marine mammal near that

 3   source.    The beaked whales, the scientists believe,

 4   adjust their diving patterns; since they dive down for

 5   so long, if they come up too fast, they get the bends so

 6   there is evidence of -- when they do the necropsies of

 7   these beaked whales, they find hemorrhaging, the

 8   embolisms in various parts of the bloodstream and many,

 9   many deaths.    So there is enormous scientific evidence

10   that there is a greater harm to beaked whales that is

11   caused by sonar and that is precisely why the Navy was

12   compelled in the EA to recognize that evidence.

13                Now, one thing that was said here which I

14   found --

15                JUSTICE ALITO:          Where in the record -- this

16   was the question I asked General Garre.                  Where in the

17   record is there evidence of -- that beaked whales would

18   be killed?

19                MR. KENDALL:         The evidence of the prediction

20   of the Level A takes, in the --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what does Level A take

22   -- maybe can you put this in lay terms.                  Let's start

23   with kill.   Where is the evidence that beaked whales

24   would be killed?

25                MR. KENDALL:         It is in the -- there is a

 1   table on page 223 of volume 1 of the joint appendix.

 2   And then there are the discussions of beaked whale

 3   injuries that General Garre referred to, and what they

 4   show is that beaked whales will experience the effects I

 5   described.   But there is also expert evidence in the

 6   record in the form of a number of declarations by

 7   scientists who have studied beaked whales for -- for

 8   quite some time.     The evidence you can find, and it's

 9   referred to on page 4 of our brief.                       Joint appendix

10   600-602, 673-89, 738-41, 760, the supplemental excerpt

11   of record at 180; also joint appendix 601, 666-667,

12   674-76, 680, 685.     And there are a few other references

13   on page 4 of our brief.

14                I also wanted to talk about the behavioral

15   changes, because it's --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:             This is -- I want to give

17   you a chance to say what's so terrible about what

18   they're doing.     I will express a little frustration.

19   Not your fault.     But why couldn't you work this thing

20   out?   I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot

21   of conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have

22   more conditions.     And you are asking us who know nothing

23   about whales and less about the military to start

24   reading all these documents to try to figure out who's

25   right in the case where the other side says the other

 1   side is totally unreasonable.             And the issue at law

 2   seems to be something that is going to last for two

 3   months.

 4               So -- so, why?          What is so -- what is the

 5   important thing here?

 6               MR. KENDALL:         The important thing here is

 7   that the Navy is focused on having it its way or no way.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's very

 9   unfair.   There were six conditions imposed by the

10   district court.   The Navy didn't even appeal four of

11   them.   They gave up on four out of the six issues.

12   That's not insisting on having it their way.

13               MR. KENDALL:         No -- I agree, although the

14   reason I believe that they conceded those is that the

15   record was -- was so overwhelming on each of those

16   points, they hadn't even put in evidence to suggest that

17   those measures would cause them any problem.                 They

18   simply didn't have the declaration, and even the --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The other ways it

20   struck me how the district court relied on the fact that

21   the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in

22   the past to say well, there can't be any problem with

23   adding more protection.        No good deed goes unpunished.

24               MR. KENDALL:         Well, if I can -- if I can

25   answer that this way.      We negotiated with the Navy for

 1   months and months and months, the Brinpack case, I

 2   settled with them.      We tried very hard to resolve this

 3   case, but keep in mind that the Navy until the district

 4   court ruled refused to agree to any measures that we

 5   proposed -- any measures.            So it was a binary --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    They had already

 7   taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals.

 8   Now you say that wasn't.

 9              MR. KENDALL:            Right.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But they were taking

11   some actions.

12              MR. KENDALL:            That's right.          And -- and so

13   we had a litigation that was focused on were there

14   additional actions that should be taken; and there is

15   extensive evidence taken and extensive argument and then

16   the district court ruled.            And the correct path, if the

17   Navy was aggrieved by that decision, was a higher court.

18   But instead, in order to avoid the clearly erroneous

19   standard -- and remember, that the clearly erroneous

20   standard as this Court said in the Anderson v. Bessemer

21   City case, says when there are two permissible views of

22   the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them

23   cannot be clearly erroneous.

24              So in order to evade that, and this is

25   typical of the tactics that we experienced and the

 1   uncompromising nature of their approach that we

 2   experienced, they went to CEQ to try to trump the entire

 3   injunctive process.     Now that they did without any

 4   authority in NEPA --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            How does the basic thing

 6   work?   Because to a layperson, when I think of the armed

 7   forces preparing an environmental impact statement, I

 8   think, the whole point of the armed forces is to hurt

 9   the environment.   I mean --

10               (Laughter.)

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't under -- I don't

12   understand how it's supposed to work.                    Of course they

13   are going to do something that is harmful.

14               MR. KENDALL:         You know, the whole point of

15   the armed forces, I think is to --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            You see the point, I am

17   trying to give you a -- overstating it.

18               MR. KENDALL:         I think the point of the armed

19   forces is to safeguard our freedoms causing the least

20   damage possible to our environment.                     And this Court has

21   recognized that repeatedly.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            You go on a bombing

23   mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact

24   statement first?

25               MR. KENDALL:         No.

 2               MR. KENDALL:         They don't.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            How does it work?

 4               MR. KENDALL:         We have never, ever contended

 5   that any of our proposed restrictions should apply to

 6   combat at all, and it doesn't.

 7               This training was planned for a very long

 8   time.   Had -- there were questions earlier,

 9   Justice Scalia I think raised a question is the EA as

10   good as the EIS?   There is a big, big difference.                 There

11   are really two, between an EA and EIS.                  The substantive

12   difference is that an EA doesn't have the same

13   alternatives analysis that an EIS has, and the

14   procedural difference, which in a country that values

15   transparency and ideas and exchange with the public, is

16   the notice and comment that EIS requires.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I -- I didn't assert that

18   they are -- that they are the same thing substantively.

19   My -- my only question is whether your assertion of bad

20   faith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long

21   as they were doing an EA.          If -- you do an EA to see if

22   an EIS is necessary.      And you say if there's no -- if

23   there is no significant harm to the environment, you

24   don't even need an EIS.

25               MR. KENDALL:         That --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              And that's how they

 2   started.   That's step one, and many agencies do that.

 3   They are authorized to do that.                I don't know why you

 4   have to attribute bad faith to the Navy simply because

 5   it began with an EA.

 6               MR. KENDALL:           That focus is not an element

 7   of our case.   I was simply responding to

 8   Justice Breyer's question as, I admit, a somewhat

 9   frustrated lawyer who tried to work things out as to why

10   it happened that they weren't worked out.

11               I do want to speak a bit about some of the

12   comments that General Garre made in response to

13   Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia's questions about--

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Can I -- can I

15   derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of

16   equities question?      As I read the opinions most of the

17   balancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the

18   district court.   I found the district court's balancing

19   in only one sentence.        The court after all of its

20   prior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of

21   hardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an

22   injunction. " It goes on.            But it's just one sentence.

23               The Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to

24   the district court but in fact it supplied all the

25   balance of the analysis for the balance.

 1               MR. KENDALL:         Well, I -- with respect I

 2   think the district court spoke in several different

 3   opinions.   So you can -- you can find out what the

 4   district court was thinking by looking not only at the

 5   injunction, but also at the -- at the responsible

 6   district court denying the motion to vacate.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Suppose it's still

 8   fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its

 9   attention on likelihood of success on the merits and

10   irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the

11   equities.

12               MR. KENDALL:         Well I would disagree in one

13   respect, which is the court was very focused on which

14   measures to impose and which measures not to impose.

15   There were, you know, at least 10 pages of her

16   injunctive opinion going through that, and each -- and

17   the denial of the motion to vacate did the same thing,

18   because -- after the Ninth Circuit ordered Judge Cooper

19   to issue a tailored injunction, each side briefed very

20   extensively, with a huge amount of supporting evidence,

21   the issue of which measures should be imposed.                     And

22   Judge Cooper decided that certain measures would not be

23   imposed and certain ones would, and she explained why.

25   that were designed to be prevented.                     And so what I would

 1   submit is --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I think that's -- I

 3   think that's quite right.

 4                 My question, though, is that at no point

 5   that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the

 6   equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm

 7   to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your

 8   point about the record -- and putting on the other side

 9   the potential that a North Korean diesel electric

10   submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor

11   undetected.    Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance.

12   And the district court never entered -- never went into

13   that analysis.

14                 MR. KENDALL:        There's a good reason why she

15   didn't balance that.       And that gets back to my opening

16   remarks, which is that the premise of that question and

17   why, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be concerned about

18   that is that there would be an exposure to that

19   submarine, that North Korean submarine.                  But the judge

20   had made a factual finding, and the factual finding she

21   made was that training would not be affected.                  So, on

22   the one hand, you have a factual finding that there is

23   no harm to the training at all, which means that in the

24   balance the harms to the environment are much heavier.

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Do you -- how much


                                        48

 1   deference, if any, do you think the district court was

 2   obligated to give to the Navy on that military issue

 3   about whether the training would be effective?                 Is judge

 4   Cooper an expert on antisubmarine warfare?

 5              MR. KENDALL:          No.      Judge Cooper, like all

 6   judges, has to sift through the evidence of experts, and

 7   Judge Cooper gave great weight to the Navy on everything

 8   that the Navy said.     But there was a place where she had

 9   to stop because, after all, she's a judge, and where she

10   had to stop was where the evidence belied the

11   declarations.   And, you know, this Court has had in a

12   number of decisions to confront the question of whether

13   wartime exigencies forced the courts to suspend their

14   powers of judgment.     I submit that what happened here is

15   that this court didn't, and that's what --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Even the district --

17   even the district court recognized, in the words of her

18   opinion, that it would propose "a substantial challenge"

19   -- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime

20   that she imposed in the injunction.

21              MR. KENDALL:          That's right, and it will in

22   fact pose a challenge and the proof is then in the

23   pudding, which is that the Navy has now conducted 13 out

24   of 14 exercises, the last 8 of which had been conducted

25   under this regime as modified by the circuit.                 And they

 1   have not, as they were invited, had to come back and ask

 2   for relief despite the fact that they had the

 3   opportunity.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           By the time this case got

 5   back to the court -- the district court a second time,

 6   the President had made a determination that this was in

 7   the paramount interest of the United States.               The

 8   Defense and Commerce Department jointly had made a

 9   determination that this is necessary for the national

10   defense.   And it seems to me, even if those

11   determinations don't resolve the EIS statement, they

12   certainly must be given great weight by the district

13   court in determining whether to continue the injunction.

14   If you could comment on that, incorporate it also in

15   what you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument

16   with reference to the standard.

17                 MR. KENDALL:        Yes.       First, responding to

18   that very point, it's common ground among the litigants

19   and certainly with the court that the interests ascribed

20   by the President and by every other government official

21   with respect to Naval training are of the highest

22   importance.    The question was -- and this is the court's

23   factual finding, and the question is whether there was

24   sufficient record evidence to support it, whether she

25   was right that there wouldn't be an adverse effect


                                        50

 1   except for possibly some logistical changes, but no

 2   adverse effect in terms of an achievement of the

 3   training.   If there's no adverse effect, then what the

 4   President is speaking to is speaking past what's

 5   concerning the court.

 6               Now, with respect to irreparable harm, the

 7   argument that General Garre made I think mistakenly

 8   collapses the normal equity issue in this following

 9   sense:   Once a plaintiff satisfies Article III, very

10   important, and under the Japan Whaling case, the Lujan

11   v. National Wildlife case, there is no question that

12   these plaintiffs deserve to be in court, and it has

13   never been contested.

14               Then you move to the traditional equity

15   standard for assessing irreparable harm, Hecht v.

16   Bowles, but in the environmental area we have a

17   decision, the Amoco v. Gambell decision.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.       That

19   irreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of

20   the injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the

21   harm which is the basis for standing, is it not?

22               MR. KENDALL:         It always does, and the

23   question is somewhat different.              And I think,

24   Justice Scalia, if you look at your opinion in the

25   second Lujan case and you think about the imminence


                                       51
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   requirement of standing there, what irreparable harm

 2   adds to that is the traditional need to show that the

 3   harm you suffer cannot be quantified in damages or it's

 4   difficult to quantify, and that a remedy at law will not

 5   achieve the adjustment between the parties that's

 6   required.     That's what equity does.                    Equity preserves

 7   the positions of the parties.

 8                 And as this Court said in Amoco,

 9   environmental injury, by it's very nature, can seldom be

10   adequately remedied by money damages and is often

11   permanent or at least of long-lasting duration, i.e.,

12   irreparable; that is Amoco at page 545.                      If such injury

13   is sufficiently likely, therefore, the Court said, the

14   balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an

15   injunction.

16                 Now, there's one other point which was

17   briefly touched on here.           Justice Kennedy was asking

18   what the circuits have said.              Now, the circuits have

19   said different things about irreparable harm.                      The

20   leading edge of discussion in the circuits began with

21   then-Judge Breyer on the First Circuit in the

22   Massachusetts v. Watt and Sierra Club v. Marsh cases,

23   where he pointed out that NEPA itself has, while it's a

24   procedural statute, a substantive purpose, the

25   substantive purpose being informed decisionmaking.                       And


                                         52

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   if there is not informed decisionmaking before there is

 2   an agency committed to action, a harm has occurred.

 3   That's the harm that --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's unfortunately

 5   contrary to what our opinions have said, which was quite

 6   clearly that procedural --

 7                (Laughter.)

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- procedural injury is not

 9   the kind of injury that gives rise to Article III

10   standing.

11                MR. KENDALL:         Can I --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The whole country can

13   complain about the failure to issue an EIS.                  That is not

14   the kind of injury that gives standing.

15                MR. KENDALL:         I was only responding to

16   Justice Kennedy's question as to what the circuits have

17   said.   That's the leading edge of what the circuits have

18   said.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't see why you backed

20   down on this.

21                (Laughter.)

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Kendall, you

23   wanted to respond to some comments by the Solicitor

24   General.    I wanted to make sure that you've had an

25   opportunity to do that.         I -- you were derailed by

 1   questioning, but I know you responded to some.                      Are you

 2   --

 3                MR. KENDALL:          That's very kind.          I think

 4   there's just one other point perhaps I should make,

 5   which is there was some discussion of whether NEPA

 6   actually authorizes CEQ to conduct this kind of

 7   examination of a district court's ruling.                   I submit that

 8   there is nothing anywhere in NEPA and certainly not in

 9   the "fullest extent possible" language which gives that

10   authority.   This Court has already decided that point in

11   the Flint Ridge case, where it said that NEPA does not

12   give way unless there is an irreconcilable conflict

13   between NEPA and another statute.                  They have pointed to

14   no such thing.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

16   Mr. Garre, have you one minute remaining.

17                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

18                    ON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19                GENERAL GARRE:           Thank you,

20   Mr. Chief Justice.

21                First, the Court of Appeals did not

22   adequately consider the balance of equities.                   It

23   completely disregarded the President's determination of

24   the paramount interests in these exercises.                   It

25   disregarded the Chief Naval Officer's evidence on the


                                         54
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   harm of the 2200-yard shutdown, at Pet. App. 344-345A.

 2   It disregard the harm as to surface ducting, Pet. App.

 3   33 A.

 4              Justice Alito, there is -- the EA says,

 5   quote, on page 200 of the JA, "No serious injury or

 6   mortality of any marine mammal species is reasonably

 7   foreseeable because of these exercises."                   Page 170 makes

 8   clear that that applies to beaked whales as well.

 9              And finally I think I heard my colleague, my

10   friend, concede that you have to show Article III injury

11   in order to show irreparable injury.                   They not only have

12   to show irreparable injury to marine mammals, which they

13   haven't; they have to show irreparable injury to

14   themselves, and particularly as to beaked whales, which

15   none of the declarants and none of their members have

16   ever asserted they have seen.            They can't possibly

17   establish any irreparable injury from any conceivable

18   harm to beaked whales, even though the record in this

19   case makes clear that all harms to the marine mammals

20   that we have been discussing today are temporary

21   non-injurious harms.

22              We would ask this Court to set aside the

23   decision of the Ninth Circuit, which seriously

24   interferes with critical training exercises that the

25   President, his chief Naval officers have determined to


                                      55

 1   be in the paramount interests of the United States.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can I -- before you sit

 3   down.   I thought I recalled something in your briefing

 4   dealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point

 5   regarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very

 6   substantially showed that they were caused by sonar.

 7   You had something in your briefs about beaching, but I

 8   wasn't sure whether it was beaked whales or only

 9   dolphins.

10                GENERAL GARRE:          It pertains to beaked whales

11   as well.    Page 256 of the petition appendix is the

12   National Marine Fisheries Service's determination that

13   the conditions which led to strandings with respect to

14   beaked whales in other parts of the world are not likely

15   to lead to strandings in the Southern California

16   Operating Area.    Those conditions are taken into account

17   in the national defense exemption mitigation measures at

18   page 258 of the petition appendix.                  There have been

19   beachings of beaked whales in Southern California.                    None

20   have been tied to sonar operations, and that further

21   underscores the absence any injury to any marine mammal

22   in Southern California despite 40 years of the Navy's

23   use of sonar operations in that area.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

25                The case is submitted.
