3              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:             We'll hear argument


4    next in No. 129 Original, Virginia v. Maryland.


5              Mr. Baida.


6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA


7                       ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF


8              MR. BAIDA:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


9    may it please the Court:


10             There are two reasons why the State of Maryland


11   has the authority to regulate Virginia and its citizens


12   when they seek to place structures in and withdraw water


13   from the Potomac River. 


14             First, as confirmed by the Black-Jenkins Award

15   of 1877 and this Court's decision in Morris v. United


16   States, the State of Maryland is and has been the owner of


17   the Potomac River since 1632, and Maryland has never --


18             QUESTION:      Mr. Baida, before you get into your


19   argument, can I just ask you a preliminary question?                   I


20   made the mistake of reading the Master's report before I


21   read the briefs.     There's an awful lot of discussion of


22   the entire river issue in there.             Is that -- you're no


23   longer making that point?


24             MR. BAIDA:       Correct, we are not.


25             Maryland is and has been the owner of the river,




                                              3

                               ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
             1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    and it has never relinquished the sovereign authority that


2    its title to the river gives it to regulate what takes


3    place on and over the bed. 


4              And the second reason --


5              QUESTION:      Do you think the compact covers


6    withdrawals of water by Virginia?            I mean, does it


7    directly cover that at all?


8              MR. BAIDA:       It's not the privilege of making and


9    carrying out orders, Justice O'Connor, although that


10   privilege would seem to apply to building something into


11   the river to exercise a riparian right, and there is a


12   riparian right to withdraw water.


13             QUESTION:      Well, do you -- do you take the


14   position that Maryland could reject every effort by

15   Virginia to withdraw water from the river?


16             MR. BAIDA:       No, Justice O'Connor.           We -- we have


17   never taken that position.


18             QUESTION:      What is your position then?


19             MR. BAIDA:       That Virginia has riparian rights


20   with respect to the Potomac River.


21             QUESTION:      Which includes the right to use some


22   of the water.


23             MR. BAIDA:       Correct. 


24             QUESTION:      And take it out of the river.


25             MR. BAIDA:       Correct.

1                 QUESTION:    With your permission.


2                 MR. BAIDA:    Correct.


3                 QUESTION:    But only with your permission.


4                 QUESTION:    It's only the last step that's the


5    problem. 


6                 (Laughter.) 


7                 QUESTION:    Is that right?        Only with Maryland's


8    permission --


9                 MR. BAIDA:    Subject to a standard of


10   reasonableness, Justice O'Connor. 


11                QUESTION:    Is that reasonableness in part


12   assessed by the fact that Maryland is a sovereign?


13                MR. BAIDA:    It's --


14                QUESTION:    Pardon me. 
 That Virginia is a

15   sovereign?


16                MR. BAIDA:    No.    It's assessed by the fact that


17   Maryland owns the river, but that Virginia, as -- as a


18   riparian owner, has rights with respect to the river that


19   Maryland must be reasonable with respect to which in its


20   regulations. 


21                QUESTION:    Virginia rights are -- Virginia


22   rights are no greater than any private landowner?


23                MR. BAIDA:    That's precisely correct.


24                QUESTION:    Even -- even assuming that's true, I


25   -- I thought a right is a right.             I -- I thought we have a




                                              5

1    right to something.        It doesn't mean somebody can turn it


2    down.


3                MR. BAIDA:       And -- and --


4                QUESTION:      And riparian rights include the right


5    to take the water.        That's clear.


6                MR. BAIDA:       And --


7                QUESTION:      And that's the right to take water,


8    not -- not the right to come and beg Maryland to take


9    water.


10               MR. BAIDA:       The river, Justice Scalia, is


11   entirely within the State of Maryland, and that is


12   undisputed from the -- the language of the Maryland


13   charter back from 1632.          The entire river is in Maryland.


14               QUESTION: 
 But the compact reserves to the State

15   of Virginia and its citizens riparian rights.                   If riparian


16   rights include, as I think they do, the right to take


17   water, it seems to me that aspect of the case is -- is


18   quite easy to decide.


19               MR. BAIDA:       Maryland's ownership of the Potomac


20   gives it to right -- gives it the right to regulate what


21   takes place on and over the bed.               There are riparian


22   rights, but as this Court has recognized, those riparian


23   rights have always been subject to government regulation. 


24               QUESTION:      I'm mixed up.         I'm sorry.      Maybe -- I


25   didn't think the case was basically about taking water out

1    of the river.    I thought it was about building something


2    for the purpose of taking water out.


3              MR. BAIDA:       There --


4              QUESTION:      Is -- is it actually that you're


5    saying -- I may have misread this and so is it actually --


6    you're saying if -- if somebody -- if the Governor of


7    Virginia goes to the river with a bucket and takes water,


8    a little bit of water, to wash some pans that he has, that


9    they have to get Maryland's permission?              Is it about


10   taking the water out of the river?              Is it about building


11   something, or both?


12             MR. BAIDA:       It's about both.


13             QUESTION:      All right.          So now you're just


14   addressing the problem of taking water out of the river.

15   So can a person who lives next to a river under the common


16   law from 1302 or whatever -- now, can he go to the river


17   and just take some water when he's thirsty?


18             MR. BAIDA:       Yes. 


19             QUESTION:      Yes.     All right.       So Virginia is just


20   taking water when they happen to have a lot of people who


21   are thirsty. 


22             (Laughter.) 


23             QUESTION:      So what's the -- what's the special


24   thing about the water?        I thought it was building a water


25   intake system.

1                 MR. BAIDA:    It's -- it's about both.            The right


2    to build into the Potomac which the compact --


3                 QUESTION:    All right.          Let's imagine there were


4    no building.    Then would you have an objection?


5                 MR. BAIDA:    Yes, because --


6                 QUESTION:    Because you can't take water out when


7    you're thirsty.


8                 QUESTION:    There are too many thirsty people is


9    what your objection is.         Right?


10                MR. BAIDA:    The -- the objection is simply that


11   Maryland has the right to regulate what takes place in its


12   territory, and what takes place --


13                QUESTION:    It doesn't.          What they do is they --


14   they build a -- a hole which fills up with the water from

15   the Potomac and that hole, which happens to be in


16   Virginia, is filled up with water and they drink it.                   Now,


17   is there any objection?         They haven't built a thing.


18                MR. BAIDA:    I think that's a different question. 


19   That's --


20                QUESTION:    No.    I'm asking you, are you


21   objecting to the building or are you objecting separately


22   -- because I hadn't focused on that -- to just taking


23   water without building anything?


24                MR. BAIDA:    If they're taking -- if they are --


25   the low-water mark on the Virginia side --

1                QUESTION:     No.    They have nothing built over


2    there.   What happens is water comes up out of the Potomac


3    into Virginia and they drink it.


4                MR. BAIDA:      But I'm trying to understand the


5    nature of your question, Justice Breyer.                When they build


6    a hole, are they building the hole in Virginia? 


7                QUESTION:     In Virginia. 


8                MR. BAIDA:      So they're building a trench in


9    Virginia. 


10               QUESTION:     Yes, that's right.


11               MR. BAIDA:      Maryland may have some objections to


12   that at some future point in time, but that's activity


13   that's taking place in Virginia. 


14               QUESTION:     Yes. 
 That's what I thought the case

15   was about. 


16               QUESTION:     Unless the trench creates a new low-


17   water mark for the Potomac.           I mean, I think that's what


18   Maryland's argument would be, that when you make an inlet


19   into Virginia, that's -- that's the low-water mark of the


20   Potomac.


21               MR. BAIDA:      Well, that may -- that -- I don't


22   know whether that would actually change the --


23               QUESTION:     I didn't want to get it mixed up. 


24   All I wanted to do is I focused on this case as a matter


25   of building something.         I didn't focus on it as a matter

1    of taking water out.          And I'm -- and that's -- that was my


2    problem.     Now, maybe just forget my problem.                Maybe I'm


3    the only one who had it.           So skip --


4                 QUESTION:      Let -- let me ask you this.              There's


5    a Potomac River Flow Allocation Agreement of 1978.                      Does


6    it deal with the right of Virginia to use water or take it


7    out?


8                 MR. BAIDA:       That imposes restrictions on the


9    three major users of the Potomac River, the Washington


10   Aqueduct, the Army Corps of Engineers, the -- the Fairfax


11   County Water Authority and the Washington Sanitary --


12   Suburban Sanitary Commission, and imposes limitations on


13   the amount of water that they can take --


14                QUESTION: 
 On the amount, but it acknowledges --

15                MR. BAIDA:       -- in periods of low flow.


16                QUESTION:      -- that water can and will be removed


17   by Fairfax County?


18                MR. BAIDA:       Subject to a permitting system that


19   was in place at the time and still is in place.                    And the


20   only permitting system that's ever been in place with


21   respect to the Potomac River has been the permitting


22   system established by the State of Maryland. 


23                And I think I'd like to just go back to the


24   initial point I tried to make at the beginning, which is


25   why Maryland has the right to do what it's doing here.

1                 QUESTION:      Before you do that, can I ask a


2    practical question?         How is Maryland, if it is, adversely


3    affected by this pipe and the water intake?                   Is there any


4    adverse impact on Maryland or is Maryland just trying to


5    say, we are the sovereign?            So even though our people are


6    not being adversely affected, you need to get a permit


7    from us.     Is there any adverse impact on Maryland or its


8    residents?


9                 MR. BAIDA:       Well, the Maryland administrative


10   and judicial review proceedings answered that question


11   "no."


12                But the reason why Maryland took the -- the


13   action that it did was because Fairfax County already had


14   an existing waterway intake pipe in the -- in the river.

15   They wanted to build another intake pipe 725 feet into the


16   river, and the edge of it would be 30 inches above water


17   with a 5-foot walkway.           Maryland took the position let's


18   see if there are less intrusive alternatives that are


19   available. 


20                Virginia wanted to do this.              Fairfax County


21   wanted to do this because it was concerned about the


22   effect of the -- the water on the shoreline which is where


23   the existing intake pipe was and wanted to get cleaner

3               QUESTION:      Yes.


4               QUESTION:      Because -- because there wasn't


5    enough water for the people in -- in Maryland?                  That's --


6    it -- one thing is, well, we're sovereign and you -- we


7    have to give our permission.           Another is our people are


8    not going to have enough water if Virginia does this.                     I


9    think you're saying Maryland had no such objection.


10              MR. BAIDA:       Maryland had no objection to the


11   Fairfax County Water Authority withdrawing water. 


12   Maryland's objection was to minimize the impact on the


13   Potomac River.


14              QUESTION: 
 What authority did you have to

15   minimize the impact?        The compact between the States gives


16   the State and its citizens riparian rights, including the


17   right to build structures into the river so long as they


18   do not impede navigation.          Was Maryland's objection that


19   -- that this new structure would impede navigation of the


20   river?   It's a -- it's above the navigable portion anyway,


21   isn't it? 


22              MR. BAIDA:       Yes, it is.


23              QUESTION:      So.     So what was your objection?


24              MR. BAIDA:       Because the riparian rights that --


25              QUESTION:      It was ugly?

1                 MR. BAIDA:      Well, there was -- that was part of


2    it because it -- it was in the scenic portion of the


3    Potomac River.


4                 QUESTION:     Well, you should have reserved that


5    right in the -- in the compact.             The compact could have


6    said, you know, provided it does not impede navigation or


7    be ugly. 


8                 (Laughter.) 


9                 MR. BAIDA:      What the -- what the compact does,


10   Justice Scalia, is it provides that the Potomac River


11   could be used as a common highway by the citizens of both


12   States, and it also secures important private property


13   rights.    Private property rights, again for the citizens


14   of both States.


15                QUESTION:     All right.       Let -- if I may, let me


16   interrupt you there.         Do you concede that the State has


17   any rights under article VII of the compact?


18                MR. BAIDA:      That the States?


19                QUESTION:     The State, the State of Virginia, the


20   Commonwealth of Virginia.           Article -- article VII talks


21   about citizens.


22                MR. BAIDA:      That --


23                QUESTION:     It doesn't talk about the


24   commonwealth.

2                QUESTION:      Well, is that -- I mean, is that a


3    premise of your argument? 


4                MR. BAIDA:       Yes.


5                QUESTION:      Do you -- do you also deny that the


6    State with respect to withdrawal of water for its citizens


7    that the -- do you deny that the State stands in the shoes


8    of its citizens?


9                MR. BAIDA:       The -- the State -- the Commonwealth


10   of Virginia brought this action on behalf of its citizens


11   to seek --


12               QUESTION:      No.     I realize that, but are you


13   denying that it may properly do that?


14               MR. BAIDA:       No.     No, we are not.


15               QUESTION:      So, in effect, are you saying the


16   State -- it -- it is just as though the State had express


17   rights under article VII because in making the claim that


18   it's making, it stands in the shoes of its citizens, and


19   its citizens do have rights.            Is -- is that -- do you


20   concede that?


21               MR. BAIDA:       Yes.     The -- we've never denied that


22   the --


23               QUESTION:      Then it's irrelevant that the -- that


24   article VII speaks only of citizens and not of the State.

1                 MR. BAIDA:       No, it's not irrelevant, Justice --


2                 QUESTION:      Then what -- what difference does it


3    make?


4                 MR. BAIDA:       Because all that the compact does,


5    it secures -- it -- it makes a -- there is -- the compact


6    drafters recognized the difference between jurisdiction


7    and sovereignty and private property rights, and when they


8    wanted to, they knew exactly how to go about addressing


9    issues of sovereignty.


10                QUESTION:      Now, one of my questions in this case


11   is this.     You've answered Justice Souter and he posed his


12   questions this way based on article VII or paragraph --


13   clause VII of -- of the compact.                But must we not


14   interpret that too according to the Black-Jenkins Award,

15   particularly paragraph 4 at page C-4 of -- of the -- of


16   the Special Master's appendices?                That uses the -- that


17   says Virginia -- not citizens.              That says Virginia has


18   riparian rights, and both of those two phrases are not


19   used in the compact.          The phrase, riparian rights, I don't


20   think is used in the compact, and the compact talks about


21   citizens.


22                But the Black-Jenkins Award goes -- it seems to


23   me, interprets authoritatively -- and you correct me if


24   I'm wrong -- what the compact means.                And I read the Black


25   -- at least I think it's a permissible reading -- to say




                                                15

1    that Virginia -- and we'll argue about as a sovereign. 


2    That -- that's -- that's a phrase I add -- has riparian


3    rights.    So we really do have to focus not just on section


4    VII, but on part 4 of the Black-Jenkins Award, do we not?


5                MR. BAIDA:       Yes.    And we -- Maryland's view is


6    that that part of the award confirms Maryland's rights


7    over the river.       And I'd like to explain this a little bit


8    more fully. 


9                What the Black-Jenkins arbitrators did was they


10   rejected Virginia's claim to any right in the soil -- any


11   right in the soil -- beyond the water mark, any right to


12   any of the islands in the river, and any right to any part


13   of the bed of the river.          Now --


14               QUESTION: 
 Yes, but it said, as has been pointed

15   out, that Virginia was given a proprietary right and a


16   privilege to erect any structures necessary to the full


17   enjoyment of Virginia's riparian ownership, which


18   presumably encompasses taking out water.


19               MR. BAIDA:       And the presumption, Justice


20   O'Connor, is overcome by looking at the rest of the award,


21   and what the -- the arbitrators did, they did give


22   Virginia title to the middle of other bodies of water,


23   namely the -- the Tangier Sound, the Pocomoke Sound, and


24   the Pocomoke River.        But they specifically rejected --


25               QUESTION:      Yes, but do you deny that Virginia

1    has riparian ownership up to the low-water mark of the


2    Potomac?


3                MR. BAIDA:      The arbitrators said that Virginia


4    has full dominion over this right in the soil up to low-


5    water mark, but beyond that point, Virginia only has a


6    right to use the river.         A right of use is not dominion,


7    it's not title, it's not sovereignty.


8                QUESTION:     But it says --


9                QUESTION:     Why?     But it is a right of use, and


10   that's what you're -- and that's what you're contradicting


11   here.   That's all they want.          They're not trying to govern


12   the river.    They just want to use it.


13               MR. BAIDA:      A right of use, Justice Scalia, is


14   subject to governmental authority and regulation, and

15   that's exactly what this Court said --


16               QUESTION:     Well, but it says here in the Black-


17   Jenkins Award and in the earlier compact, the privilege to


18   erect structures necessary to the full enjoyment of the


19   riparian ownership.       That might mean a pipe to take water


20   out.


21               MR. BAIDA:      This Court has said in, for example,


22   Massachusetts v. New York that Massachusetts' right to use


23   Lake Ontario was still subject to the regulatory authority


24   of New York because New York had title to the bed of Lake


25   Ontario.

1              QUESTION:      Mr. Baida, can I ask you sort of a


2    basic question?     In your view is there any difference


3    between the right that Virginia has, the riparian rights


4    of Virginia, on the one hand, and the riparian rights of


5    Maryland's citizens who -- who own the property on the


6    Maryland shore of the river?          Do -- are they equivalent? 


7    Or what is the difference between the riparian rights of


8    the people on the opposite sides of the river?


9              MR. BAIDA:       The -- Maryland is to treat them


10   identically, and that's set forth clearly in article VII


11   of the compact.


12             QUESTION:      So that either -- on either side of


13   the river, a property owner could stick a pipe in and


14   drain the river.


15             MR. BAIDA:       Not -- not if it has any kind of


16   adverse impact from Maryland's perspective, whether it's


17   in Maryland -- if -- if the City of Rockville wanted to do


18   this, it would encounter presumably exactly the same kind


19   of reaction that Fairfax County initially did.


20             QUESTION:      You say the riparian rights on either


21   side of the river are subject to the paramount authority


22   of the Maryland -- the State of Maryland to -- to govern


23   what happens to the water.


24             MR. BAIDA:       Yes.


25             QUESTION:      And -- and in the exercise of that

1    authority, could Maryland give a higher priority to the


2    citizens of Rockville than to the citizens of Vienna,


3    Virginia? 


4              MR. BAIDA:       No, and this Court said in Yates v.


5    Milwaukee that -- that the riparian right cannot be


6    arbitrarily and capriciously denied.             And that --


7              QUESTION:      No.    It's not arbitrary and


8    capricious.    They make a lot of findings and they said


9    there's too much traffic in Virginia.              Virginia would be


10   better off if it's rural.


11             (Laughter.) 


12             MR. BAIDA:       Well, Your Honor, I think --


13             QUESTION:      And -- and what is -- what is the


14   source for your statement that Maryland has to be non-

15   arbitrary?    Is this riparian water law or is this some


16   constitutional obligation that one State owes to another?


17             MR. BAIDA:       I -- I think it's again set forth in


18   Yates v. Milwaukee where the Court said that a State


19   cannot -- or a government -- municipality cannot


20   arbitrarily and capriciously deny someone the exercise of


21   a riparian right.


22             QUESTION:      So in your opinion --


23             QUESTION:      But -- but that's based on -- on --


24   that's a statement of riparian law?


25             MR. BAIDA:       Yes.    I think -- I mean, it's a

2    arbitrarily --


3                 QUESTION:      So we're talking about -- all we're


4    talking about is property rights here.                 We're just talking


5    about the definition of what a riparian right is.


6                 MR. BAIDA:       Yes.


7                 And just so I'm clear, Justice Kennedy, the rule


8    of law, not administrative hyperbole, is what governed the


9    judicial and the administrative review proceedings that


10   led to Fairfax County getting this waterway intake pipe


11   permit.     I mean, it -- there was -- it went through the


12   process.     Maryland thought it had valid reasons for


13   restricting the -- the permit, and Maryland was -- was


14   overruled, and the permit has since issued.                   And so this


15   is not a case of Maryland just arbitrarily deciding, well,


16   we don't like what's happening over there, and -- and


17   then --


18                QUESTION:      So your opinion is --


19                QUESTION:      You -- you used the word arbitrary. 


20   I didn't.      I just want to know the source of law which


21   governs Maryland's obligation under your point of -- under


22   your submission to make these determinations.                    And you


23   said it has to just be fair among riparian owners because


24   this is what riparian law requires it to do.


25                MR. BAIDA:       And I think it's also required by

2                QUESTION:    Your -- your point --


3                QUESTION:    What provision of the Constitution? 


4                MR. BAIDA:     I think the Due Process Clause. 


5    Maryland just can't arbitrarily and -- and capriciously


6    deprive someone of a property right.


7                QUESTION:    Oh, but that's just an obligation it


8    has as to all of its citizens.           Virginia doesn't have any


9    special standing as a State.


10               MR. BAIDA:     No.    And -- and again, it's because


11   of what Maryland gave up in this compact and -- and what


12   the Black-Jenkins Award provided.


13               And again, we have to go back -- and the -- the


14   problem with -- with the Special Master's recommendation

15   from Maryland's perspective is that he began at the wrong


16   place in history.      He began with the compact.             He should


17   have begun with the charter because the plain language of


18   the charter gives Maryland this river, and -- and so the


19   question at that point, since Maryland owns this river,


20   Maryland does have sovereign authority over it.                 So --


21               QUESTION:    What was wrong with the Special


22   Master saying, yes, Maryland has this 1632 decree.                   It


23   looks -- this grant.       It looks pretty good.            But Virginia


24   has these other grants.        And I think that they're both


25   arguable.   So the States sensibly twice dealt with it.

1                 But your argument seems to hang on that 1632


2    document indisputably was it, and that everything else


3    flows from there.         The Special Master said, not


4    necessarily so.        They couldn't even resolve it in 1785. 


5    They finally resolved it in 1877, but it wasn't an


6    inevitable truth that it was 1632 rather than the Virginia


7    grants.


8                 MR. BAIDA:       Justice Ginsburg, the -- the flaw in


9    the reasoning is that it ignores the plain language of the


10   charter which this Court said includes the Potomac River


11   in unmistakable terms to the further bank.                   It doesn't


12   matter what kind of competing claims existed as of 1785


13   when the compact was written.


14                What matters is who had title, and under

15   Virginia's view, Maryland was a -- this -- Maryland was


16   basically a deed holder.           This was a royal deed, and under


17   Virginia's view, this royal deed could not create rights


18   until it was interpreted by either the arbitrators or this


19   Court.


20                QUESTION:      But there were other royal deeds too,


21   different kings, but there were royal decrees that -- that


22   Virginia had.


23                MR. BAIDA:       Which this Court noted did not do


24   anything to divest Maryland of the authority it had under


25   the -- Maryland was first in time.               First in line, first

1    in time.     And so it had it in 1632.             There was a


2    subsequent deed that was given by --


3                 QUESTION:      I thought there was -- the earliest


4    in time was in, wasn't it, 1609 or something?                    The --


5                 MR. BAIDA:       But in -- yes, in 1609 Virginia was


6    initially set up but then its charter was annulled in


7    1624.   It converted to a royal colony which meant that


8    King Charles I in 1632 had the right to carve Maryland out


9    of Virginia, which is what he did.               He created Maryland as


10   a proprietorial colony.           At that point, the only way that


11   Maryland could lose any rights it had under its charter


12   was through a quo warranto proceeding.                 It was initiated


13   in 1685.     It never resulted in anything, as the


14   arbitrators in 1877 noted. 
 And so Maryland --

15                QUESTION:      But -- but are you saying that the


16   compact in 1785 and the Black-Jenkins Award in 18 -- were


17   -- were simply wrong because they didn't follow that


18   interpretation that you're giving now?


19                MR. BAIDA:       No, I'm not saying the compact was


20   wrong at all, Mr. Chief --


21                QUESTION:      Are you saying the Black-Jenkins


22   Award was wrong?


23                MR. BAIDA:       No.    The -- I think -- all -- all


24   I'm saying is that Maryland had this authority as a result


25   of the plain language in the charter.

1                QUESTION:    Well, are you saying that the


2    implicit assumption at least of both the 1877 Black-


3    Jenkins Award and the 1785 compact -- the implicit, if not


4    explicit, assumption was that Maryland owned the river?


5                MR. BAIDA:     No.    I think a fair reading of that


6    document -- of -- of the -- the 1785 compact and the 1877


7    award was that reasonable minds may have differed.                   And so


8    the States decided this is how we're going to address


9    issues of navigation.


10               QUESTION:    Well, but I thought I was arguing --


11   making your argument for you.          So -- so you -- but then,


12   it seems to me, that justifies the Special Master's


13   approach.     You -- I thought you were saying, oh, now, he


14   proceeded on the wrong premise.           This -- the -- the


15   boundary line was settled.         All -- all we're talking about


16   is -- is the rights -- or -- or ownership and stuff.                   But


17   you're saying no.      If it's everything is up for grabs,


18   then the 1785 compact and the Black-Jenkins Award, what do


19   we look to?


20               MR. BAIDA:     If I said that, let me retrieve it


21   immediately because that was not what I meant to say. 


22               (Laughter.) 


23               MR. BAIDA:     What I -- what I meant to say was


24   that Maryland's title has not changed one iota in almost


25   400 years.

1                QUESTION:    Mr. Baida, maybe I'm missing


2    something here, but I did not understand that the State of


3    Virginia is contesting the ownership of Maryland of the


4    bed of the river.      Is -- is that -- is that contested by


5    Virginia?   I thought that they concede that the river


6    right up to the low-water mark on the southern shore of


7    the Virginia shore belongs to Maryland.              But that -- but


8    that does not answer the question of whether the riparian


9    rights given to the citizens of Virginia and to the State


10   of Virginia requires that -- that they obtain permission


11   from Maryland before withdrawing water or creating a


12   structure to withdraw water.


13               MR. BAIDA:     I agree, Justice Scalia, but it goes


14   a long way in resolving that question because by

15   acknowledging that -- that the boundary is not in dispute,


16   by acknowledging that Maryland does, indeed, have title to


17   this river, Virginia has acknowledged Maryland's


18   regulatory authority --


19               QUESTION:    No, it hasn't because it --


20               QUESTION:    No, it hasn't. 


21               QUESTION:    But it's all -- it's all subject to


22   the fact that the owners on both sides of the river have


23   riparian rights.     Right?


24               MR. BAIDA:     Correct. 


25               QUESTION:    Now, my question -- Justice Kennedy

1    asked it earlier, and I'm not sure you got an answer.                     Who


2    defines the riparian rights?           I guess on Maryland's side


3    of the river Maryland can define the riparian rights.                     Who


4    defines the riparian rights on the Virginia side of the


5    river?   Do you think Maryland has the authority to do


6    that, or is there a common law that's binding on us or


7    some kind of overriding Federal constitutional principle


8    at stake?


9                 MR. BAIDA:     I think a fair reading of the


10   compact is that both States agreed that they couldn't


11   agree on where the boundary was, and so they decided --


12                QUESTION:    I think the fair reading is that


13   everybody thought there would be plenty of water, so we


14   didn't have to decide this.           All we're worried about is


15   transportation down the river, and it's not -- and now


16   we've got a -- a possible problem on what is enough water


17   to go around.


18                MR. BAIDA:     And -- and --


19                QUESTION:    And I don't know that the compact


20   addresses the question of who defines the riparian rights


21   on the Virginia side of the river.


22                MR. BAIDA:     And I think that both States agreed


23   that wherever the boundary was, the citizens of both


24   States would have the same rights of access to the river.


25   And -- and for that reason, they -- they --

1                 QUESTION:      Does that mean that because Maryland


2    can define the rights on the Maryland side of the river,


3    it may also define them on the Virginia side?


4                 MR. BAIDA:       I think that the -- the view -- a


5    fair reading would be that wherever the boundary was --


6                 QUESTION:      But is it your contention that that's


7    what it is?


8                 MR. BAIDA:       If -- if at the end of the day the


9    boundary is on Virginia's side, yes, Maryland gets to


10   decide because it's activity occurring in Maryland.                      This


11   is Maryland --


12                QUESTION:      What if -- what if the Virginia


13   legislature passed a statute governing riparian rights on


14   -- all over the State in other bodies of water, not

15   limited to the Potomac?           Could that statute govern the


16   riparian rights of Virginia property owners on the


17   Potomac?


18                MR. BAIDA:       Not if Virginia does not own the


19   Potomac.     And I'd like to --


20                QUESTION:      May I ask just one quick question


21   before you sit down?


22                QUESTION:      I just think it's not --


23                QUESTION:      Does -- does Maryland require


24   Virginia's citizens to have a Maryland fishing license to


25   fish in the Potomac?

1                 MR. BAIDA:    No, because that's settled by


2    article -- I think article VIII of the compact.


3                 QUESTION:    It just says that they have rights to


4    fish, but just as you argue that riparian rights and


5    rights to take water can, nonetheless, require prior


6    permission, you could also take the -- you ought to also


7    take the position that the right to fish requires prior


8    permission.     So you ought to get a Maryland fish -- I'm


9    darned if I'm going to get a Maryland fishing right --


10   fishing license --


11                QUESTION:    Do you want to reserve the rest of


12   your time, Mr. Baida? 


13                MR. BAIDA:    I would.      Thank you, Mr. Chief


14   Justice.

16                Mr. Raphael, we'll hear from you.


17                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. RAPHAEL


18                      ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT


19                MR. RAPHAEL:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


20   please the Court:


21                The Special Master correctly decided the


22   regulation issue for two reasons.            First, the language of


23   the compacts in question is plain and unambiguous, and


24   second, for more than 180 years, Maryland never disputed


25   that it was entirely --

1                 QUESTION:   Does that plain language tell us what


2    riparian rights are?


3                 MR. RAPHAEL:     The plain language of article IV


4    of the Black-Jenkins Award uses the term riparian


5    ownership.


6                 QUESTION:   But you said plain language of the


7    compact, and now you're all of a sudden talking about


8    Black-Jenkins. 


9                 MR. RAPHAEL:     It's both. 


10                QUESTION:   The compact does not use the word


11   riparian.


12                MR. RAPHAEL:     That -- That's correct.           But we


13   think that the plain language --


14                QUESTION: 
 So you say it's the plain language of

15   the compact with the gloss of the Black-Jenkins Award.


16                MR. RAPHAEL:     We think it's both.


17                QUESTION:   What do you make -- and I don't have


18   this in front of me, so maybe I -- I'm missing something. 


19   But I thought the Black-Jenkins Award also put a --


20   included a disclaimer that it wasn't, in fact, modifying


21   anything in the 1785 compact.          Am I right?


22                MR. RAPHAEL:     That's -- that's correct because


23   the enabling legislation for the Black-Jenkins Award


24   provided that neither of the States would be deprived of


25   any of the rights or privileges, nor would the citizens be




                                             29

1    deprived of rights or privileges that they had under the


2    Compact of 1785.


3              QUESTION:      How -- I'm sorry.


4              Assuming that then, how do we get from the


5    language of article VII in the compact that refers to


6    citizens to the language in Black-Jenkins that talks about


7    the States?


8              MR. RAPHAEL:        Your Honor, the citizens in


9    Virginia only had those rights under the compact because


10   Virginia as a sovereign entered into an interstate compact


11   with Maryland.


12             Secondly, Maryland recognized in the enabling


13   legislation that provided for the Black-Jenkins Award that


14   the rights were the rights not only of citizens, but of

15   the States.    That language is used in the enabling act.


16             QUESTION:      So you -- you say that in


17   interpreting the Black-Jenkins Award, Virginia's riparian


18   ownership is -- is defined by its -- in part by its


19   sovereign status?


20             MR. RAPHAEL:        Yes, that's correct.


21             QUESTION:      So that sovereignty is inherent in


22   ownership?


23             MR. RAPHAEL:        I think that's correct.           If -- if


24   you look at the opinion that accompanied the Black-Jenkins


25   Award, the arbitrators said that Virginia had proven her




                                             30

1    use of the Potomac River since her earliest days and that


2    her rights were, therefore, indisputable and that Maryland


3    assented to Virginia's use when she signed the Compact of


4    1785.


5               Now, that compact, Your Honor, was entered into


6    at a time when the boundary was disputed, and regardless


7    of where the boundary was set -- I think Mr. Baida admits


8    this -- it was recognized that that compact did not set


9    the boundary, but each State agreed that wherever the


10   boundary ultimately would be set, the citizens of each


11   State and the States themselves would have certain rights,


12   and those rights included the right to property in the


13   shores, and all advantages and emoluments thereunto


14   belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out

15   wharfs and other improvements. 


16              QUESTION:      Except for the sense of the document,


17   at least of the compact, as I read it, is that the State


18   is treated just like any other owner.


19              MR. RAPHAEL:        I don't think that that's correct,


20   Your Honor, because article --


21              QUESTION:      Well, can you point me to


22   something --


23              MR. RAPHAEL:        Yes.


24              QUESTION:      -- in the compacts or the -- or the


25   Black-Jenkins Award to the contrary?

1                 MR. RAPHAEL:        Well, the Black-Jenkins Award


2    clearly deals with Virginia as a State.                 The compact deals


3    with Virginia as a State in article VIII, for example,


4    where it requires that neither State could regulate


5    fishing or navigation without the concurrence of the other


6    State.   Articles X and XI and XII also deal with the


7    rights of the citizens.           Wherever the compact involved a


8    matter in which a State would touch the activities of the


9    citizens of the other State, it said so expressly.


10                And it's inconceivable to think that the -- the


11   drafters of the compact would have agreed that concurrent


12   legislation would be required for fishing and navigation,


13   but Maryland could somehow regulate Virginia's right to


14   build improvements from the shore.               It's inconceivable


15   that they would have ratified the compact if that had been


16   required.


17                QUESTION:      Why -- why is it concurrent for


18   fishing?     Article seventh says that the -- that the


19   citizens of both States -- the right of fishing in the


20   river shall be common to and equally enjoyed by the


21   citizens of both States. 


22                MR. RAPHAEL:        That's correct, Your Honor. 


23   Article VIII requires concurrent legislation for fishing


24   and navigation rules in the Potomac River.


25                QUESTION:      For the preservation of fish or for

2    channel?


3                MR. RAPHAEL:       That's correct. 


4                QUESTION:     Has -- has Virginia issued -- is a


5    Virginia fishing license valid in the -- in the Potomac?


6                MR. RAPHAEL:       Your Honor, until 1957, the States


7    had concurrent legislation governing fishing in the


8    Potomac River.     In 1957 -- and that was based on article


9    VIII of the compact.        In 1957, Maryland attempted to


10   abrogate that requirement and to assume unilateral


11   authority over the Potomac River.             Virginia filed suit


12   here.   This Court appointed a special master to hear the


13   case.   The States resolved their dispute as to the tidal


14   Potomac with the creation of the Potomac River Fisheries


15   Commission, which is a bi-State agency that now regulates


16   fishing in the -- in the tidal Potomac. 


17               As to the non-tidal Potomac, since 1957 each


18   State has had laws on the books that recognize permits


19   issued or licenses issued to citizens of the other State


20   as valid licenses for fishing in the non-tidal Potomac.


21               QUESTION:     What's left of the dispute now?               Is


22   -- does Virginia now have a permit to withdraw the water?


23               MR. RAPHAEL:       The -- the permit, Justice


24   O'Connor, was issued to the Fairfax County Water

1                 QUESTION:      Yes.     Is that all you're arguing


2    about?


3                 MR. RAPHAEL:        No, Your Honor, because we contend


4    that no permit was required in the first instance, and we


5    also challenged that specific permit because the Maryland


6    legislature required that it contain a condition requiring


7    the water authority to put a flow restrictor into the


8    pipeline for the sole purpose, the Maryland legislature


9    said, of allowing Maryland to control growth and


10   development in northern Virginia.               We object to that.          The


11   authority objected to that subject to the outcome in this


12   case.     We object to any --


13                QUESTION:      So we're -- we're talking now about a


14   flow restrictor in the pipe?


15                MR. RAPHAEL:        That's correct. 


16                QUESTION:      I mean, that's what it comes down to.


17                MR. RAPHAEL:        That's correct.        And --


18                QUESTION:      Well, but Virginia objects on general


19   principle, I take it, to the idea that Maryland can


20   restrict the amount of water it takes out of -- of the


21   Potomac.


22                MR. RAPHAEL:        That's exactly right, and I don't


23   mean to say my answer is limited to just the Fairfax


24   County Water Authority.           We object to the continuation by


25   Maryland of a permit system that requires Virginia to get




                                                34

1    Maryland's permission anytime we want to withdraw water


2    from the Potomac River or build improvements appurtenant


3    to the shore.


4               QUESTION:      But do you -- what about the general


5    right of a riparian owner on a river to withdraw water? 


6    Would you say that right includes the right to withdraw an


7    unlimited quantity of water?


8               MR. RAPHAEL:        I don't believe that that would be


9    a riparian right, Your Honor. 


10              QUESTION:      Well, then who decides what limit can


11   be -- can be imposed on the riparian owner's right to


12   withdraw water?


13              MR. RAPHAEL:        With respect to the Potomac River,


14   there's a low flow allocation agreement in place that

15   Congress required which allocates the flows during periods


16   of low flow.     There is a water coordination agreement of


17   1982 in place by which the three main utilities in the


18   District of Columbia have agreed to provide for a future


19   water supply. 


20              This Court said in Colorado --


21              QUESTION:      But assume there are no agreements.


22              QUESTION:      -- riparian question that's not


23   controlled by those documents. 


24              QUESTION:      Assume there are no agreements at


25   all.   Would Maryland have the right to say no more than X




                                              35

1    amount of water may be withdrawn by any riparian owner in


2    Maryland or Virginia? 


3               MR. RAPHAEL:        No.    We don't believe they do have


4    that right.


5               QUESTION:      Could you drain the river?


6               MR. RAPHAEL:        Not under the low flow agreement


7    and not under the water supply coordination agreement,


8    absolutely not.


9               QUESTION:      No.    But let's assume there were


10   none.


11              QUESTION:      We've -- in some original


12   jurisdiction cases, we have decided on amounts of water. 


13   In fact, in the Texas against New Mexico case, there's a


14   -- there's a river master on the Pecos River operating

15   under one of our decrees.


16              MR. RAPHAEL:        Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.           This


17   Court said in Colorado v. New Mexico that before this


18   Court will enjoin any State from diverting water from the


19   Potomac River, the State --


20              QUESTION:      Well, they weren't talking about the


21   Potomac River.


22              MR. RAPHAEL:        I'm sorry.      That was the Vermejo


23   River.   This Court requires a showing that the diversion


24   would cause clear -- by clear and convincing evidence that


25   the diversion would cause injury to the State seeking to




                                              36

1    prevent the diversion.


2              In this case, Maryland has circumvented that


3    requirement by controlling the tap.             Maryland doesn't


4    contend that anything Virginia has done to date injures


5    the river.


6              QUESTION:      No, but I mean, your -- your --


7              QUESTION:      If they did so contend, could they


8    enforce that contention?


9              MR. RAPHAEL:        There -- there would be many


10   places where they can raise that issue if Virginia


11   prevails in this case.        They can raise it in the context


12   of the Federal and Virginia permitting requirements, the


13   404 and section 10 permitting requirements. 


14             QUESTION: 
 I'm just trying to -- trying to -- we

15   have an original jurisdiction case involving a fight


16   between two States.      And assume nobody had made any


17   agreements other than those determining the ownership of


18   this river.   Would then Maryland have no right to -- to


19   limit the amount that Virginia could withdraw?


20             MR. RAPHAEL:        If -- if Maryland has a claim that


21   Virginia's withdrawals injure it, it has a place where it


22   can raise that claim.


23             QUESTION:      And that's here.


24             QUESTION:      That's --


25             MR. RAPHAEL:        It could be here.

2                MR. RAPHAEL:        It could be in the Army Corps of


3    Engineers permitting process.


4                QUESTION:      Now, well, let's -- let's forget


5    the --


6                QUESTION:      -- findings.        I'm trying to put to --


7                QUESTION:      Assuming that the one --


8                QUESTION:      -- one side all the agreements and


9    just have a brand new problem.             Maryland or Virginia are


10   fighting about who can control withdrawals of water from


11   this river.     And is there any principle that -- that says


12   that someone other than the owner of the river can make


13   that decision? 


14               MR. RAPHAEL: 
 Federal common law would govern

15   that, as this Court said in Colorado v. New Mexico.                     The


16   fact that that the river was in Colorado didn't give


17   Colorado a right to withdraw water from that river.


18               QUESTION:      Well, Virginia would have the same


19   claim against Maryland if Maryland took out too much


20   water.


21               MR. RAPHAEL:        Yes, Your Honor. 


22               QUESTION:      And that's Federal common law because


23   two States are involved?


24               MR. RAPHAEL:        That's correct.        They're co-equal


25   sovereigns contending about an interstate river that




                                               38

2              QUESTION:       All right.      Let --


3              QUESTION:       What about a citizen of Virginia who


4    owns property on the -- up to the low-water mark of the


5    river and wants to build a dock and a pier out, that


6    extends out into the river?          Does that citizen have to get


7    permission from Maryland to do that? 


8              MR. RAPHAEL:        Under -- under our view of the


9    case, no, because the compact gave that citizen the right


10   to do it, subject to Federal regulations, subject to


11   Virginia regulation.       And Maryland can contend either in


12   the permitting process or independently that any action by


13   a Virginia citizen that -- that it can show causes injury


14   to Maryland shouldn't be allowed.            But --


15             QUESTION:       Is that what the Special Master


16   specifically held in your view?


17             MR. RAPHAEL:        The Master ruled that under the


18   compact and the award, Virginia and its citizens have the


19   right to withdraw water and to construct improvements


20   appurtenant to the shore without having to get permission


21   from Maryland.    Yes.


22             QUESTION:       What if Maryland takes the position


23   that it obstructs navigation?          Who's going to decide that? 


24   Virginia? 


25             MR. RAPHAEL:        No, Your Honor.        The primary place

1    will these -- where these disputes will be decided is in


2    the -- as a practical matter is in the Federal permitting


3    process.     It's very much like then-Associate Justice


4    Rehnquist wrote for the Court in Milwaukee v. Illinois,


5    that the Federal permitting process -- that was a -- a


6    Federal water pollution control act case -- that the


7    Federal permitting process provides an adequate forum for


8    the State to raise concerns that it has about --


9                 QUESTION:      Because this is a navigable river,


10   the Federal Government has such a scheme in place.


11                MR. RAPHAEL:        That's exactly right.


12                QUESTION:      But if -- if it did not, I -- I take


13   it the answer would be in -- in a Federal question suit


14   brought by Maryland against the Virginia citizen?

15                MR. RAPHAEL:        That's correct. 


16                QUESTION:      Yes. 


17                MR. RAPHAEL:        I think the key evidence of -- let


18   me move beyond what we think is -- is the plain language


19   and -- and discuss also what the Master looked at with


20   respect to Maryland's practice historically.


21                The -- the key evidence here comes from 1873. 


22   This is at a time when Maryland and Virginia were trying


23   to settle their boundary dispute.               In the boundary


24   arbitration, Maryland contended that the boundary line


25   should be on the Virginia side at the low-water mark and

2    may hereafter be extended by authority of Virginia,


3    unquote.     That's at page 130 of the Virginia lodging.


4                 In the Maryland view in 1873 and in the view


5    they maintained in the arbitration, it was entirely up to


6    Virginia to decide when, whether, and where to build


7    improvements from the shore.             And they actually thought


8    that would alter the boundary line.


9                 QUESTION:      Could you answer this question for


10   me?   And in part, I'm going back on the ground that we've


11   been traversing already.


12                What is there in -- in the documents before us


13   -- by that, I mean the compact and the Black-Jenkins


14   agreement, number one, or in the law generally, number two

15   -- that gives Virginia special rights as a sovereign to


16   withdraw water for its people as opposed to the right it


17   would have simply as an owner of -- of property to


18   withdrawal rights for that property that it owns?


19                MR. RAPHAEL:        I think, Your Honor, all of the


20   Court's equitable apportionment cases recognize that the


21   State has a sovereign interest in protecting the water


22   supply of its citizens where that water supply is served


23   by an interstate river.


24                QUESTION:      But -- but those are cases -- correct


25   me if I'm wrong -- in which the State owns out to the --

2              MR. RAPHAEL:        Most of the cases --


3              QUESTION:      Correct me if I'm wrong.


4              MR. RAPHAEL:        Justice Kennedy, most of the cases


5    involve a river which goes from one State into another


6    State, and we don't --


7              QUESTION:      Yes, in which each State has an


8    interest in the river.        But here --


9              MR. RAPHAEL:        That's right. 


10             QUESTION:      -- Virginia owns only to the -- to


11   the low-water mark.      And I want you to show -- tell me


12   something in these documents which says that Virginia has


13   a special right -- special rights as a sovereign --


14             MR. RAPHAEL:        Article IV of the Black-Jenkins --


15             QUESTION:      -- other than what I just -- other


16   than we know that Virginia is a party.


17             MR. RAPHAEL:        Your Honor, article IV of the


18   Black-Jenkins Award says Virginia has a right to the use


19   of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as being --


20   as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian


21   ownership.   And Maryland stipulated --


22             QUESTION:      But her -- but does her riparian


23   ownership give it any rights that are different and


24   greater than a private owner of land?


25             MR. RAPHAEL:        Absolutely.       It absolutely does.

3    that proposition?


4                 MR. RAPHAEL:     This Court's Federal common law


5    cases that distinguish between the rights of States with


6    respect to a water supply and the rights of individual


7    citizens.


8                 QUESTION:   But those are cases in which the


9    States have an ownership interest -- an equal ownership


10   interest in the river.


11                MR. RAPHAEL:     I don't think that --


12                QUESTION:   And is just riparian ownership.


13                MR. RAPHAEL:     Colorado v. New Mexico is a good


14   example. 
 The Pecos River -- 75 percent of it came from

15   Colorado, and it then flowed into New Mexico.                 But this


16   Court effectively denied Colorado any use of that river


17   regardless of the fact that she owned the river. 


18   Ownership is not dispositive in -- in a dispute between


19   States over a -- a water supply that supplies the citizens


20   of both States.


21                Now, the Potomac River is an interstate river. 


22   The Congress recognized that in 1976 when it required the


23   waters to be allocated.        A drop of water that begins in


24   the Shenandoah is not a Virginia drop of water anymore


25   than it's a Maryland drop of water when it's in the main

2              QUESTION:      I think at the -- I think at the


3    least, would you concede or would you -- that the Black-


4    Jenkins agreement goes a step beyond the -- the compact in


5    this regard?


6              MR. RAPHAEL:        We think it's at least coextensive


7    with the compact, but I -- I don't -- I think that that


8    position would be defensible but it does go beyond --


9              QUESTION:      Well, isn't it --


10             QUESTION:      But you --


11             QUESTION:      -- isn't it limiting in this extent? 


12   There is something in this fourth article of the Black --


13   of the 1877 arbitration award that refers to without --


14   without impeding navigation -- that's been there

15   throughout -- or otherwise interfering with the proper use


16   of it by Maryland.      What would those words suggest other


17   than Maryland can permit the use to assure that its proper


18   use is not interfered with?


19             MR. RAPHAEL:        Your Honor, those words give


20   Maryland a right of action and a cause of action against


21   Virginia or the user if it -- if the use interferes with


22   Maryland's use of the river.          That doesn't mean Maryland


23   gets to decide.     No State can control another State's


24   access to the water supply and no State can be a party to


25   a dispute and -- and then fairly decide that dispute.

1                QUESTION:    But you are depending then on what


2    you referred to as Federal common law and not the words of


3    the compact and not the words of -- of the -- the Black-


4    Jenkins.


5                MR. RAPHAEL:      No.    Your Honor, we rely on -- on


6    the -- the plain language of the compact and the Black-


7    Jenkins Award which clearly give Virginia the right to the


8    use of the --


9                QUESTION:    But I -- I thought when Justice


10   Kennedy pressed you, your -- you ultimately rested on


11   Federal common law.


12               MR. RAPHAEL:      My understanding of Justice


13   Kennedy's question was whether there's a distinction


14   between riparian -- the rights of -- of riparian users as

15   private users and the rights of States as riparians.                   And


16   I was answering that question that yes, there is a


17   difference, as this Court has repeatedly said.                 The civil


18   law as between riparian users does not bind States with


19   respect to their use of an interstate stream.                 That was


20   the question I -- I was answering.


21               QUESTION:    Mr. Raphael, what -- it's your


22   position that if -- I believe, that if a private


23   landowner, riparian owner on the Virginia side, the


24   southern shore, wants to build a pier out into the river,


25   that pier would be permitted by Virginia?

1                 MR. RAPHAEL:       That's correct. 


2                 QUESTION:     Why?


3                 MR. RAPHAEL:       It --


4                 QUESTION:     You see, I can understand the


5    authority for Maryland to permit it since Maryland owns


6    the river bed.      What -- what is the authority for Virginia


7    to demand a permit from its riparian owners?


8                 MR. RAPHAEL:       Virginia has the right to regulate


9    its citizens' use of the river, and it -- it has been


10   doing that for many years through the local building


11   permit requirement that you can't build a -- a pier or a


12   wharf on the Virginia side, even though it goes beyond


13   low-water mark, without getting a -- a building permit


14   from the -- from the county. 
 Virginia has enacted --

15                QUESTION:     Because of its State riparian


16   sovereignty over -- because of its State sovereignty over


17   the bank.


18                MR. RAPHAEL:       That's correct.        And Virginia has


19   enacted, subject to the resolution of this case, a -- the


20   Virginia water permit protection requirement applicable to


21   Virginia users of the river.             So if -- if Virginia


22   prevails in this case, Maryland will regulate its users of


23   the river and Virginia will regulate its users of the


24   river.


25                QUESTION:     But what if there's a -- a pier going

1    out into the river that's been there for 5 years and the


2    owner wants to modify it, wants to build something more at


3    the end of the pier?         From whom would he get authority to


4    do that?


5                 MR. RAPHAEL:       He would get that authority from


6    Virginia. 


7                 QUESTION:     But that's -- it's in the State of


8    Maryland.


9                 MR. RAPHAEL:       The -- the construction --


10                QUESTION:     The end of the pier I'm talking


11   about.


12                MR. RAPHAEL:       Your Honor --


13                QUESTION:     The pier is not part of Virginia, is


14   it?


15                MR. RAPHAEL:       The pier is appurtenant to


16   property on the Virginia shore, and --


17                QUESTION:     Yes, but the pier is located in the


18   State of Maryland.


19                MR. RAPHAEL:       That's correct. 


20                QUESTION:     Then why wouldn't he have to get the


21   authority to make the modification from the State of


22   Maryland?     I guess the -- when they enforce the gaming


23   laws or whatever they are, the Maryland police are the


24   ones that have jurisdiction, aren't they?

2    riparian.   99 percent of everything that's ever been built


3    there --


4                QUESTION:    Well, repairing the end of a pier, is


5    that a riparian use or a non-riparian?


6                MR. RAPHAEL:      That would be a riparian use. 


7    Operating a casino on the pier would not be a riparian


8    use, and that's why Virginia has not objected to a wide


9    variety of activities by Maryland on its side of the line


10   that don't go to whether Virginia has the right to build


11   the riparian structure in the first place.


12               QUESTION:    And for that answer, I take it, you


13   -- you do rest on article VII of the 1785 compact.


14               MR. RAPHAEL:      Article VII and article IV of the


15   Black-Jenkins Award. 


16               QUESTION:    Yes. 


17               MR. RAPHAEL:      That's correct. 


18               QUESTION:    What about operating a fishing pier,


19   charging for -- who -- who would have the authority to tax


20   the fishing pier?      Is that a riparian use or not riparian?


21               MR. RAPHAEL:      Well, there may be uses that are


22   in between in gray as to whether it's a riparian use --


23               QUESTION:    Yes.     I tried to pick one.


24               MR. RAPHAEL:      Let me -- here's -- I'm not sure


25   how the question would be answered, but let me tell you

             1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    what the guiding principles would be.              Most of the uses,


2    the States are going to agree, are riparian uses,


3    traditional things, bulkheads, piers, wharfs, docks, water


4    intakes, as the Master found.          There are a number of uses


5    that, we'll agree, are non-riparian.             Building a casino in


6    the middle of the river.        If there's a gray area in


7    between and -- and we've got an argument that it's


8    riparian and Maryland has an argument it's not, that issue


9    may have to be litigated if we can't resolve it.                  But


10   that's the framework I think that answers these questions.


11             Now --


12             QUESTION:      Is that why the Special Master said


13   gambling, safety rules, health, tax, licensing, all of


14   that is irrelevant to this case? 


15             MR. RAPHAEL:        That's -- that's exactly right,


16   Justice Ginsburg, because after Maryland -- after the


17   boundary was set on the -- on the Virginia side at low-


18   water mark in 1877, Virginia doesn't dispute that Maryland


19   acquired a wide range of police powers on its side of the


20   boundary, but that specifically did not apply to those


21   rights that Virginia and its citizens enjoyed under the


22   Compact of 1785 and which were preserved as a condition of


23   the Black-Jenkins Award and which Maryland historically,


24   at least until 1957, recognized was entirely up to


25   Virginia to decide what to do on Virginia's shore.

1                QUESTION:     Does Maryland or Virginia tax the --


2    the value of a -- of a major pier that goes out into the


3    river?   I mean, it's worth something, and I assume there's


4    a tax on it.     Anything that's worth anything is taxed.


5                MR. RAPHAEL:       Your Honor, there are something


6    like 340 piers extending from the Virginia side of the


7    Potomac River.     All -- all of them are taxed by the -- by


8    Virginia.    Only -- there are only three properties that


9    are taxed by Maryland and those are unique.                 They're


10   restaurant properties that are sited on property that's --


11   the fee simple title to which is recorded in Maryland. 


12   Those are on the Maryland side of the line.                 So Virginia


13   taxes 99 percent of those improvements. 


14               Maryland argued that -- that you should -- the

15   Court should look at its taxation of those three


16   restaurant properties.         We think that that is the


17   exception the proves the rule.            Maryland doesn't tax 99


18   percent of everything that Virginia has ever built.


19               The Maryland construction in 1873 that it was


20   entirely up to Virginia to decide when and whether and


21   where to build improvements remained their construction


22   until at the earliest 1957.           And it was in 1957 when the


23   first permit was issued to a Virginia user that was


24   Fairfax County, but the record is undisputed that that


25   permit was not known to Virginia State officials.

1                 QUESTION:   In the -- in the compact beginning


2    with article or clause VIII, there's some very particular


3    assignments of sovereign powers, abrogation of sovereign


4    power, but that doesn't apply in VII.              And it seems to me


5    that that helps Maryland in this case.              When the compact


6    wanted to provide Virginia would have very specific police


7    powers, it provided it, but it didn't provide that with


8    respect to riparian rights.          In fact, it doesn't even


9    mention riparian rights.        It just talks about wharfs.


10                MR. RAPHAEL:     It refers to the advantages and


11   emoluments.


12                QUESTION:   Referring to the compact.


13                MR. RAPHAEL:     Right.     The article VII refers to


14   the advantages and emoluments of the ownership of land.

15                QUESTION:   But that -- it doesn't use the word


16   riparian.


17                MR. RAPHAEL:     That's -- that's exactly right.


18   But the answer to your question, Your Honor, is that there


19   was no need in article VII to address that specific


20   question because it was -- everybody would have assumed


21   that each State retained the authority to regulate its own


22   citizens.


23                QUESTION:   Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure.               If --


24   if three or four provisions of the contract -- of the


25   compact have very specific abrogations or assignment of

1    sovereignty and the other one doesn't, I -- I would assume


2    that there is -- that that provision has not been made.


3               MR. RAPHAEL:        But, Your Honor, it's -- to our


4    thinking it would be inconceivable that George Mason who


5    -- who negotiated that compact on behalf of Virginia, who


6    opposed the Federal Constitution because it gave Congress


7    too much authority over -- over commerce, that he would


8    have signed an agreement with the understanding that


9    Maryland had the authority to decide when and where


10   Virginia could make use of the river.


11              QUESTION:      Well, other than he's operating from


12   the baseline where Maryland owns the river.


13              MR. RAPHAEL:        That's -- but history is the other


14   way. 
 That's Maryland's argument, is that it always had

15   every stick in the bundle of sticks, but historically


16   that's not the case because there were prior and


17   subsequent grants to Virginia which included the Potomac


18   River.   Five monarchs disputed Maryland's claim.                  And the


19   issue was in controverse, as this Court has twice said in


20   Morris v. United States and Marine Railway, and they


21   agreed in 1785 that the bundle of sticks was over here and


22   the two States agreed that regardless of where the


23   boundary would be set, each State would have equal sticks


24   from that bundle representing the right of equal access to


25   the river, and they further agreed that as a condition of




                                              52

1    the award, those sticks in that bundle would never be


2    deprived of either State.         And if Maryland didn't have the


3    authority to take away or regulate Virginia's rights prior


4    to 1877, they could not have gained that authority by the


5    Black-Jenkins Award.


6                QUESTION:    Yes, but it seems to me that as a


7    matter of sort of looking at history and all, at the time


8    these documents were negotiated and prepared, I don't


9    think anyone contemplated the possibility that a diversion


10   of water from the river would be so great that it might


11   lower the low-water mark.         And is it your view that --


12   that Virginia could syphon off enough water to reduce the


13   -- move the low-water mark about, say, a foot, but not


14   obstruct navigation? 
 Clearly, they couldn't take that

15   much out.   But could they change the State -- the boundary


16   of the State by doing that?


17               MR. RAPHAEL:      Part of that question, Your Honor,


18   goes to the -- goes to whether the boundary is at the


19   historic low-water mark or at the mean low-water mark.


20               QUESTION:    I see. 


21               MR. RAPHAEL:      And I don't think the Court has


22   answered that question, and that may require resolution in


23   the future.   But --


24               QUESTION:    I don't know how you'd know what the


25   historic low-water mark was if you --

1              MR. RAPHAEL:        This Court determined in Ohio v.


2    Kentucky what the low-water mark was as of 1792.


3              QUESTION:      We can do that kind of stuff. 


4              (Laughter.) 


5              QUESTION:      You -- you would say -- but assuming


6    -- assume there is a -- a -- now an understanding of what


7    the border is and it's a fixed border.              Could Virginia


8    change that by drawing -- withdrawing water in your view?


9              MR. RAPHAEL:        Again, I think it's going to


10   depend on whether it's the historic low or the mean low,


11   and if -- you have to answer that question before I think


12   you can answer the question. 


13             QUESTION:      But you do say that even if it might


14   not change the boundary of the State, they could withdraw

15   as much water as they want as long as it doesn't interfere


16   with the transportation on the river.


17             MR. RAPHAEL:        And as long as it doesn't


18   interfere with Maryland's use, and once it does, Maryland


19   has a remedy.    It can object in the permitting process. 


20   It can file an original action.           It could sue the Virginia


21   user making use of that water. 


22             The issue, though, is whether Maryland gets to


23   decide in the first instance what Virginia's rights are,


24   and this Court has never given one State the authority to


25   control another State's water supply.

2    own -- have the -- the right to withdraw water subject to


3    the overriding control of the governmental body that


4    controls the -- the lake or the river, whatever it is.


5               MR. RAPHAEL:        That's right.


6               QUESTION:      But you're saying that's not true


7    here.


8               MR. RAPHAEL:        It is true here.         Virginians can


9    withdraw water subject to paramount Federal control and


10   subject to Virginia's control.


11              QUESTION:      But not subject to the control of the


12   owner of the river.


13              MR. RAPHAEL:        They can withdraw water subject to


14   Virginia's control.


15              QUESTION:      But riparian ownership usually


16   contemplates beneficial use of the waters on the riparian


17   land, not just general withdrawal for inland uses.


18              MR. RAPHAEL:        That's correct, Your Honor.             But


19   this Court has said in a number of cases, including New


20   York -- New Jersey v. New York, Connecticut v.


21   Massachusetts, that a common law limitation that may limit


22   it to the shoreline use of the riparian use would not


23   apply as between States.         And article VII of the --


24   article IV of the Black-Jenkins Award refers to Virginia's


25   rights as a sovereign to the use of the Potomac.

4    This is very important. 


5              MR. RAPHAEL:        Well --


6              QUESTION:      I'm right. 


7              MR. RAPHAEL:        It doesn't use the word sovereign,


8    but I don't -- I fail to see the distinction --


9              QUESTION:      Of course, it does not use the word.


10             MR. RAPHAEL:        -- because both in the award and


11   in the -- in the opinion, the arbitrators were talking


12   about Virginia as a commonwealth, as a State, not -- not


13   Virginia as -- as a mere property owner.


14             QUESTION: 
 Well, they were talking about

15   Virginia as a sovereign when it has a right to regulate,


16   but the question is whether they were talking about


17   Virginia as a sovereign when it withdraws water.


18             MR. RAPHAEL:        Well, the issue of withdrawing


19   water, whether that's a riparian use, has been -- has been


20   stipulated.   The Master said at page 12 of his report that


21   Maryland never disputed that this was a riparian use or a


22   use covered by the compact.          So that's not an issue.


23             QUESTION:      I think it's fair to say that article


24   fourth acknowledges that Virginia is what you might call a


25   riparian sovereign.      It has sovereign rights over -- over




                                              56

1    the bank of the river.        It says is entitled not only to


2    full dominion over the soil to low-water mark, blah, blah,


3    blah, blah, but such use of the river beyond the line of


4    low -- as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her


5    riparian ownership.


6                MR. RAPHAEL:      That's correct. 


7                QUESTION:    And I think that's referring to


8    sovereign ownership.


9                MR. RAPHAEL:      I -- I agree with that, Justice


10   Scalia. 


11               I'd like to correct one misstatement I think my


12   friend, Mr. Baida, made with respect to the Low Flow


13   Allocation Agreement.       That agreement and the -- the


14   enabling legislation that provided for it was amended to

15   make clear that Maryland did not have the authority to


16   control Virginia's withdrawals.           That issue was put aside


17   to another day, and the Low Flow Allocation Agreement, for


18   example, says that no party can withdraw water from the


19   Potomac River without being subject to a permit which


20   imposes the low flow conditions or becoming a member party


21   to the agreement.      And we point out in our papers the


22   numerous instances in the 1970's where Virginia went on


23   record saying Maryland did not have the authority to


24   regulate Virginia's water withdrawals.


25               Whether you look at this case under the -- under




                                             57

1    the compacts in question or under the -- under Federal


2    common law, you cannot give one State the authority to


3    control another State's water supply.              This case is


4    important not only because of Virginia's rights to build


5    wharfs and improvements.        It's important because if


6    Maryland prevails, they can control growth and development


7    in -- in Virginia.      Under Mr. Baida's theory, as long as


8    they treat everybody equally, they can do anything they


9    want, and that would include things like in 2001 when


10   there was legislation before the Maryland General Assembly


11   that would have made users of the -- of the waters pay for


12   water withdrawal.      Maryland could decide that it doesn't


13   like growth and development on either side of the river,


14   and therefore it's treating each State equally by not

15   allowing any use.      It's impossible to square that type of


16   position with the plain language of article IV of the


17   award or article VII of the compact.


18             And if there are no further questions, thank you


19   very much.

21             Mr. Baida, you have 3 minutes remaining.


22               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA


23                      ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF


24             MR. BAIDA:       Prior to this case, Virginia has


25   never taken the position that it has any authority to take




                                             58

1    any kind of regulatory action at all with respect to piers


2    and wharfs beyond the water mark.            And in fact, what


3    Virginia has done is it has sent hundreds of its citizens


4    to Maryland and it has told its citizens that their


5    construction projects from the Virginia side of the


6    Potomac River fall outside of Virginia's jurisdiction but


7    fall within Maryland's because Maryland owns the bed of


8    the river.   That ownership gives Maryland the right,


9    putting aside just for the moment any agreements -- it


10   gives Maryland the right to regulate withdrawals of water


11   from Maryland.


12             And so what we're left with at this moment is


13   article VI, the fourth paragraph, of the Black-Jenkins


14   Award, and it says it does give Virginia full dominion

15   over the right in the soil, but Justice Scalia, I would


16   disagree it gives Virginia any sovereign rights to use the


17   river beyond that point because if it gave Virginia the


18   unrestricted right to use the Potomac River beyond that


19   point, that's called quiet title.            That means Virginia


20   gets to do what it wants.         Maryland can't regulate it, and


21   this Court said in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe that that


22   kind of regulatory action, if unrestricted, is the


23   equivalent of a quiet title action.


24             The Black-Jenkins arbitrators rejected


25   Virginia's claim to any title to the middle of the river.

1    They set Virginia's boundary at low-water mark on the


2    Virginia side.    They could have done the boundary line. 


3    They could have drawn it around the piers and wharfs. 


4    They showed an unbelievable dexterity in drawing the


5    boundary through Smith Island.           They went from the bottom


6    of the Chesapeake Bay up through the bottom third of Smith


7    Island and back down again.          They didn't do that on the


8    Virginia side of the Potomac.          They set low-water mark on


9    Virginia's side.


10             Title to -- Virginia has title to low-water


11   mark, but only a right of use beyond that point.                  It has


12   not an unrestricted right of use.            The right of us is


13   subject to governmental authority.            The government that


14   gets to regulate it is the government that owns it.

15             Thank you. 


16             CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:            Thank you, Mr. Baida.


17             The case is submitted.

19   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
