 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       We'll hear argument

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. WAXMAN:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               In Stolt-Nielsen, this Court held first that

12   a party may not be compelled to submit to arbitration

13   unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that

14   the party agreed to do so.               And second, that because

15   class arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to

16   such a degree that it cannot be presumed that parties

17   consented to class arbitration simply by agreeing to

18   submit their disputes to an arbitrator.                       That precisely

19   describes this case.

20               The agreement commits the parties to submit

21   their disputes to arbitration and says nothing about

22   class arbitration.      There is no extrinsic evidence

23   suggesting that the parties ever considered such a

24   prospect, and there is no background principle of State

25   law that favors it.

                                         3

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But -- about the parties

 2   never considering it, when this case was in the New

 3   Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red

 4   brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then,

 5   that "the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether

 6   the parties contemplated class arbitration in their

 7   agreements."     A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does

 8   not contest.     Does it -- that seems to be a recognition

 9   by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was

10   contemplated.

11                  MR. WAXMAN:        Well, Justice Ginsburg, two

12   things.   First of all, if you look at page 10 -- or page

13   14, footnote 7 of our yellow brief, you'll see all of

14   the references made in the advocacy before the State

15   court judge by my -- my brother here, not recognizing

16   repeatedly that what Oxford was asking for was a

17   dismissal and a transfer to individual arbitration -

18   bilateral arbitration.

19                  There was no mistake, whatsoever, in the New

20   Jersey State courts that Oxford's position was that -

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Waxman -

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Finish your answer.

23                  MR. WAXMAN:        Yes -- that bilateral

24   arbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was

25   similarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly

                                         4

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Oxford took the position based on an understanding of

 2   New Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't

 3   decided class action question, that the decision would

 4   be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as

 5   it was in Stolt-Nielsen.

 6                Yes, Justice Sotomayor.                   I apologize.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's my question.       Did

 8   you never -- you never argued that it was beyond the

 9   power of the arbitrator to decide this question, did

10   you?

11                MR. WAXMAN:        In the first instance, no.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And do you take the

13   position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's

14   question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted,

15   or was just -- was there just a mistake here?

16                MR. WAXMAN:        Well, I think there was a

17   mistake here.   I think it was -- it was understandable,

18   in light of the state of the law in 2002.                    But we -

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So why should we rewrite

20   our standard of review to accommodate your client's

21   error?   Because that's really what you're asking us to

22   do.

23                MR. WAXMAN:        I'm -

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               More than once we have

25   said an error of law or fact is not a basis to say that

                                       5

 1   an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.

 2                 MR. WAXMAN:        Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are

 3   not asking the Court to vary in any material respect the

 4   highly deferential standard that's reflected in Section

 5   10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act.

 6                 But we are asking that that generally

 7   applicable standard of review be applied to a question

 8   with a very strong empirical presumption that the FAA

 9   has attached to it and this Court has announced, which

10   is, that absent an actual agreement by the contracting

11   parties that they will permit their disputes to be

12   arbitrated on a class basis, an inference that may not,

13   as a matter of Federal law, be derived from an agreement

14   to submit all disputes to arbitration -

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So your rule is that

16   although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation

17   of the contract, in this case, there is an exception

18   because?

19                 MR. WAXMAN:        Well, in this case, you defer,

20   as you always do, but you -- you have to provide -

21   there is some level of review.                 It's not just because

22   the arbitrator says I've looked at the contract and I

23   think this.

24                 As this Court has said over and over again,

25   including in Stolt, just saying something is so doesn't

                                        6

 1   make it so.     There is deferential review, but there is

 2   review.     And the review is of a proposition that this

 3   Court has now said twice strongly presumes that there

 4   is -- there is no agreement to arbitrate as a class

 5   unless it is clearly shown to be so and that that

 6   showing is not satisfied by an all-disputes clause.

 7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So -- so we make that rule

 8   just with reference to the word "arbitration" when it's

 9   in the class action context, or does this apply to other

10   words as well?

11                  MR. WAXMAN:        Well, I think -

12                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'm -- I'm just not sure

13   what the -

14                  MR. WAXMAN:        So I -- I think -- I mean, this

15   Court has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the

16   question of class versus bilateral arbitration is a

17   special kind of question under the FAA as to which the

18   Federal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of

19   decision.

20                  And therefore, the question I suppose is,

21   when a court looks at a -- an assertion by an arbitrator

22   that the language of the contract permits -- and in this

23   case, the arbitrator found that it required class

24   arbitration, a court has to ascertain whether that

25   assertion of fact is at least plausible, or, to use the

                                         7

 1   vernacular of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, the Court

 2   said in Stolt-Nielsen that the stipulation left no room

 3   for an argument that the parties had agreed.

 4               And similarly here, the -

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But there was no -- in

 6   Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract

 7   said nothing on the issue of class proceeding.              In this

 8   case, we have no such stipulations -

 9               MR. WAXMAN:        Correct.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- and the arbitrator is

11   interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule

12   is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's

13   interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right,

14   unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.

15               MR. WAXMAN:        Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -

16   everyone agrees in this case, as one would have to,

17   based on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the -

18   this arbitration clause in this case just said all

19   disputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the

20   arbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed

21   if it -- if he found that that indicated an actual

22   agreement of the parties to class arbitration.              That is

23   inconsistent with the actual holding in Stolt-Nielsen.

24               And in this case, that sentence is

25   indistinguishable from that orthodox clause.              All that

 1   we -

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're -- you're saying

 3   that this is off the wall.            That's your -- to put it

 4   in -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?

 5               MR. WAXMAN:        Well, not to be pejorative, but

 6   I would say this, in the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen,

 7   this language, quote, "leaves no room" for a conclusion

 8   that the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts -

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you're saying -- you're

10   saying that the -- that the deference which we give to

11   arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we

12   give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a

13   limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact

14   becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact,

15   right?

16               MR. WAXMAN:        Yes.        And in this case, a

17   question of Federal arbitration.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you have other examples

19   from other -- other review that we've given to

20   arbitrators' factual decisions?

21               MR. WAXMAN:        Well -

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, I -- I don't want

23   to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but

24   if -- if you're telling me this is just a general

25   principle, that at some point if it's too much off the

                                      9

 1   wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can

 2   reverse it.    What -- what other examples do -- do we

 3   have?

 4                 MR. WAXMAN:        Well, let me -- let me -- let

 5   me refer you to Stolt-Nielsen first, and then to a

 6   hypothetical example that my brother gives.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, I want a case.

 8   You're -

 9                 MR. WAXMAN:        Okay.         Stolt-Nielsen said --

10   I -- I -

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that is a class action

12   case.   I -- I don't care what it said.                   I want a -

13                 MR. WAXMAN:        Oh, you mean a non-class action

14   case.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I want a case where we

16   have, or where Federal courts have with our approval,

17   disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator

18   because the factual finding was too much off the wall.

19   That there was simply not enough basis to support it.

20                 MR. WAXMAN:        Justice Scalia, I can't -- I'm

21   sort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration

22   decisions.    I can't -- there may be.                  I can't think of a

23   holding of this -- well, no, I guess -- I guess First

24   Options is an example in which the arbitrator found that

25   the parties had agreed to let the arbitrator decide the

                                       10

 1   arbitrability question.           And this Court held that that

 2   was wrong as a matter of fact.

 3                  The Court reviewed the -- the facts of the

 4   case and said there is no way that the Kaplans agreed to

 5   have the arbitrability question submitted.

 6                  And if I may -- I realize this isn't an

 7   actual case -- but my brother gives the example of a

 8   form of deferential review, which would allow a court to

 9   examine and reverse an arbitrator's decision in the

10   context in which the arbitration agreement says, this is

11   going to be arbitrated under California law, and the

12   arbitrator says, well, I'm going to apply New York law

13   in this case because -- I don't know, the parties have

14   all moved to New York and they like New York and they

15   litigate in New York.

16                  My brother says that is reviewable and

17   reversible.     And that's exactly what we have here.                    We

18   have here a clause that this Court has said cannot

19   suffice to establish actual agreement to arbitrate as a

20   class.

21                  And the arbitrator has said nonetheless, I

22   have read it that way.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, but it's not

24   exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for

25   arbitration.     It is not the standard boilerplate so you

                                        11

 1   could say when he interprets it, he's really making a

 2   decision about arbitrability.                And you can follow -- I

 3   mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with

 4   it -- but you understand the reasoning.                 It says, no

 5   civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to

 6   arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil

 7   action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore,

 8   it's there.

 9                 Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but

10   it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of

11   the language rather than a general rule.

12                 MR. WAXMAN:        The fact -- the fact that the

13   arbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses.                   One

14   says, you cannot bring a civil action in court about any

15   dispute under this agreement, you must settle your

16   disputes in arbitration, is completely orthodox.

17                 And as we point out at page 24, note 3 of

18   our blue brief, it's quite arguably required by New

19   Jersey law and laws of other States that say to be

20   perfectly -- it is -- you have to be perfectly clear

21   when you are telling a contract -- a contracting

22   counterparty that disputes will be arbitrated.                 You have

23   to tell them that that means that they cannot bring

24   their disputes in court.

25                 And a rule -- a reading of this -- I mean,

                                       12

 1   I -- I submit to you that, consistent with grammar and

 2   ordinary meaning of words, it cannot be plausibly read

 3   to say that you can't bring a civil action about any

 4   dispute in court means that you can -- you are agreeing

 5   to arbitrate your dispute on a class basis, for a whole

 6   variety of reasons.

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Waxman, can I just ask

 8   you what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4)

 9   because my understanding of the standard was that a

10   court had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his

11   powers, was acting outside the scope of his authority -

12               MR. WAXMAN:        Yes.

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:            And that we have said quite

14   a number of times that the fact that the arbitrator

15   committed an error and even a serious error is not

16   enough, that he had to be doing something that was

17   simply outside the scope of his authority.                 Do you agree

18   with that or disagree with that?                 And if you disagree

19   with that, what's your standard for what we should be

20   thinking about in -- under 10(a)(4).

21               MR. WAXMAN:        I agree with that as a

22   proposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is

23   whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority.                 In this

24   case, in the context of the question about actual

25   agreement to arbitrate on a class -- as a class, this

 1   Court has interpreted Federal law to require evidence of

 2   a contractual basis of actual agreement between the

 3   parties and has precluded, as a matter of Federal law,

 4   an arbitrator from inferring such agreement from an

 5   all-disputes clause.

 6                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            And you don't disagree, do

 7   you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion,

 8   you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's

 9   doing is trying to construe a contract.

10                  MR. WAXMAN:        I think that -- I mean, trying

11   I think is not a defense.             What I would say, in

12   addition -

13                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Yes, but he is going -- but

14   he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure

15   out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit

16   statement about what the parties agreed on.

17                  MR. WAXMAN:        Right, but he did not take

18   cognizance of the holding of this Court in

19   Stolt-Nielsen, reiterated in Concepcion, that you may

20   not infer intent from an agreement to submit to

21   arbitration.     And more fundamentally, he did not heed

22   the presumption in the Federal -- under the Federal

23   Arbitration Act that this Court's holdings in those two

24   cases reflects.

25                  That is, there -- this Court said in

 1   Concepcion that it would be hard to imagine that -- hard

 2   to believe that defendants would ever bet the company

 3   with no effective means of review.

 4                  There is therefore a presumption in the law

 5   that, absent a very clear statement of a meeting of the

 6   parties' minds there is no consent.                      But he indulged the

 7   opposite presumption.         His presumption was -

 8                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            So now you're saying that he

 9   exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of

10   clear statement presumption.                But I don't think that

11   we've ever suggested that there is such a clear

12   statement presumption.          In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that

13   if the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed

14   on anything, then we're not going to accept class

15   arbitration.

16                  But we've not said that in the process of

17   construing an agreement there is a clear statement rule.

18   Now, maybe we should have said that, but -- you know,

19   it's -- it's no place in our case law now.

20                  MR. WAXMAN:        Justice Kagan -

21                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Am I wrong?

22                  MR. WAXMAN:        We are not -- you didn't say

23   the words "clear statement."                You -- what you said in

24   Stolt-Nielsen -- what you held in Stolt-Nielsen was not

25   simply that parties who have stipulated can't be forced

 1   into class arbitration.           What you held was that you

 2   cannot have class arbitration in the absence of

 3   affirmative agreement that is not evidenced by an

 4   all-disputes clause.        And the -- that background -- that

 5   strong presumption must, as a matter of Federal law,

 6   inform the arbitrator's decision.

 7                  And in this case, not only didn't it because

 8   you said, look, an all-disputes clause doesn't suffice.

 9   And he said, well, there's the word "civil action" in

10   here and I think that that not only suffices, but that

11   indicates an actual agreement to require class

12   arbitration.     That doesn't pass any test.              It doesn't -

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It was a combination of

14   the two provisions.       He said that everything that is

15   excluded by the first provision is included in the

16   second.    And he also said something, which may or may

17   not be so.     He said that this particular way of

18   describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an

19   unusual wording.     We have -- there's no civil action in

20   the first clause and then arbitration in the second.                    He

21   said that he had never seen this particular language.

22   Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is

23   unusual?

24                  MR. WAXMAN:        Arbitration clauses that say,

25   in one form of words or another, that you may not bring

 1   any dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to

 2   arbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace.                      There was

 3   a -- there was a clause in the Steelworkers' trilogy.                       I

 4   mean, they -- there's a lot of citation to Enterprise

 5   Wheel in this case.

 6                  The -- the provision in -- in the

 7   Steelworkers agreement, and virtually all labor

 8   agreements, make this explicit.                   It's not precisely

 9   every single article and preposition in the clause here,

10   but it is functionally indistinct.                       The same was true -

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Was this -- was this a -

12   well, was this an experienced arbitrator?

13                  MR. WAXMAN:        I -- so far as the record

14   shows, yes.     But my -- whether he was right or wrong

15   about this, I submit to you two things:                      Number one,

16   there is no way -- three things:

17                  Number one, there is no way consistent with

18   the rules of grammar that one can read this sentence as

19   sending class actions to arbitration -- requiring class

20   arbitration.

21                  Number two, there is no heed by the

22   arbitrator -- Number two is that -- that for all intents

23   and purposes this clause is the clause that is orthodox,

24   that was at issue in Stolt-Nielsen.                      It's the same as

25   the one the Fifth Circuit decided and the Second Circuit

                                        17

 1   decided in the cases -- the other cases that created the

 2   split here.    It's the same as the standard labor clause

 3   that was at issue in the Steelworkers v. Enterprise

 4   Wheel.

 5                 And -- and this is my other point -- it is

 6   plain from the arbitrator's decisions, both in his 2003

 7   decision and his post-Stolt-Nielsen 2010 decision, that

 8   he not only was not applying the Federal law presumption

 9   that this Court identified in Stolt and Concepcion, but

10   he was applying the opposite presumption.

11                 He said in 2003 that because -- if this -

12   if this clause wouldn't be construed to permit or

13   require class arbitration, it would mean that the

14   parties had agreed not to resolve their disputes in any

15   forum using a class manner, and that would be, quote,

16   "so bizarre, it would require an express provision."

17                 In 2010, he said, well, I overshot the mark

18   here.    But the point is still the same.               And this is on

19   page 41a -- 40a and 41a of the petition appendix.                 He

20   said, the -- the point is that if he is not allowed to

21   bring a class proceeding in arbitration when he at least

22   presumptively was in State court, that would be so

23   strange that, "If the clause," and I'm quoting from the

24   second full paragraph on 41a, "If the clause cannot

25   permit Dr. Sutter's court class action to go to

                                       18

 1   arbitration, then Dr. Sutter's original class action

 2   must be outside of the arbitration agreement

 3   altogether."

 4                  In other words, he was indulging a

 5   presumption that it is so unnatural -

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:            That -- that comes under

 7   our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was

 8   between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties

 9   here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether

10   or not this language, that says nothing about it, did

11   encompass class or not.

12                  In Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted

13   arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about

14   it.     So, given his concession there, the only way it

15   could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some

16   policy thing.     Given the lack of any similar concession

17   here, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read

18   this ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and

19   said, hmm, guess it's in.

20                  Now, in the latter case, we should presume

21   everything from the arbitrator's favor.                  Former case,

22   no, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause.

23   Okay.     So that -- now, what's the response to that?

24                  MR. WAXMAN:        So the arbitrator -- so a

25   couple of responses.        The arbitrators in Stolt-Nielsen

 1   didn't apply -- didn't construe AnimalFeeds' lawyers'

 2   concession at oral argument before the arbitrators the

 3   same way this Court did.            What it said was that it is

 4   looking at the language of the contract and as this

 5   Court's majority opinion points out, there are several

 6   textual references in the arbitrators' decision, and

 7   they decided, well, we're interpreting this, applying, I

 8   think they said, New York principles, that the parties

 9   didn't agree to preclude it, therefore, they must be

10   understood to have permitted it.

11                  What this Court said is, as a matter of law,

12   no.     Silence doesn't mean consent.                    Consent can only be

13   shown in this type of decision by an actual agreement.

14   The Court italicized the word "agreement" twice in its

15   opinion.     And it doesn't show actual agreement if you

16   just agree to arbitrate, not litigate, your disputes.

17                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Out of curiosity,

18   Mr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator

19   paid?     Is the arbitrator paid by the hour or a flat fee?

20                  MR. WAXMAN:        I am not sure, Justice Alito,

21   if the record shows.        I believe it's by the hour.

22                  The -- the point is that what this

23   Court's -- the fact that there was a stipulation that

24   the Court identified in Stolt-Nielsen made it easier to

25   apply the principle that you -- that -- that actual

                                        20

 1   agreement is required, but you can't infer it from an

 2   all-disputes clause to the case.                  The Court said that

 3   the stipulation, quote, "left no room for an inquiry

 4   regarding the parties' consent."

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Waxman, how wrong

 6   does an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an

 7   issue of law?   Meaning -- because that's the rule you're

 8   proposing.   I used to think that exceeding your powers

 9   was deciding an issue the parties hadn't agreed to

10   arbitrate, but here you've conceded that you gave the

11   issue to the arbitrator.          So he hasn't exceeded his

12   power to construe the contract with respect to this

13   dispute, do you agree with that?

14                MR. WAXMAN:        Yes, I do, but -

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.    So what

16   instead you're saying is that "exceeded your powers"

17   means that an error the arbitrator makes has to be of

18   what quality?

19                MR. WAXMAN:        If you -- so if you -- an

20   arbitrator exceeds his powers if it -- if he decides to

21   arbitrate a subject matter that the parties have not

22   agreed to arbitrate.      He -- he exceeds -- he or she

23   exceeds his or her power if they -- if he or she

24   decides, as this Court stated in Stolt-Nielsen, that you

25   agreed to arbitrate with someone with whom you didn't

                                      21

 1   agree to arbitrate.     That is this case.

 2                And as I said, we are not at the -- if you

 3   asked -- I don't -- I would apply -- I think you could

 4   simply apply the standard that you've applied in

 5   Stolt-Nielsen, which is the "leave no room" standard,

 6   which is pretty darn deferential, and you would have to

 7   find that this sentence, in light of Federal law as

 8   announced by Stolt-Nielsen, leaves no room for a

 9   conclusion that the parties, that Oxford and Dr. Sutter,

10   actually agreed to class arbitration regarding their

11   disputes.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, of course, this

13   was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no -

14   it was drafted by Oxford.           And you made a point about

15   betting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed

16   to it.   But on the side of the doctor, he has a

17   $10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without

18   a class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no

19   means to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none

20   of these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000

21   doctors, none of them could enforce the contract because

22   the expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they

23   could get at the end.

24                MR. WAXMAN:        Justice Ginsburg, neither the

25   arbitrator nor any of the courts below made any finding

                                      22

 1   about whether this is a contract of adhesion or whether

 2   this is a so-called negative value case.

 3               There was litigation over Federal court

 4   subject matter jurisdiction and the court found that

 5   there was, in part based on evidence that Oxford

 6   submitted, that there were many claims that were far in

 7   excess of $75,000.      And it is not true that Dr. Sutter's

 8   claims as he brought them to arbitration was $1,000 or

 9   anything like it.

10               May I reserve the balance of my time?

15               MR. KATZ:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16   please the Court:

17               I would like to start out by discussing the

18   applicable standard.        There are only two ways a losing

19   party can vacate an arbitration award under 10(a)(4),

20   which is the only standard that applies here.                       It's the

21   only question that came up to this Court on cert and -

22   under the exceeding powers standard.                       Number one, the

23   arbitrator had no authority to interpret the contract;

24   or number 2, the award was based not on an

25   interpretation of the contract.

 1               Oxford cannot satisfy either of those

 2   standards here.    Oxford does not dispute that the

 3   arbitrator interpreted the contract.                    Oxford's sole

 4   dispute here or challenge is that the -- that the

 5   arbitrator interpreted the contract incorrectly.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's -- that's all he has

 7   to do is saying -- you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the

 8   contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?

 9               MR. KATZ:        Justice -

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I mean, we -- we were

11   concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company

12   betting the company, right, on -- on class action

13   whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration because

14   class arbitration -- you know, will bankrupt the company

15   and without an appeal to the court or -- you know,

16   not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway.                    And you're

17   saying that, in effect, you do bet the company every

18   time.

19               So long as you leave it up to the arbitrator

20   to decide whether there's a class action allowed or not,

21   which most agreements probably do, he can find whatever

22   he likes, right?    He can find -- so long as he says, I'm

23   interpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly

24   inconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's

25   nothing the courts can do about it.

 1                MR. KATZ:      Justice Scalia, Stolt-Nielsen

 2   taught us that the language of the contract or any other

 3   evidence has to demonstrate the -- that the parties

 4   agreed to class arbitration.              Stolt-Nielsen did not

 5   alter this 10(a)(4) standard, the same standard which

 6   before it was codified -

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you think that standard

 8   -- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to

 9   say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what

10   he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to

11   what the contract says, and the court has to accept

12   that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.

13                MR. KATZ:      This Court's jurisprudence for

14   almost 2 centuries has held just exactly that.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just exactly that?

16                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I don't think so.             I

17   thought it said that -- that the award -- if the award

18   displays manifest disregard, or words like that.                       I

19   mean, Misco is -- is not absolute.                     Misco has a narrow

20   exception, and that exception is where there's just no

21   basis in the contract for the decision.                     And so I

22   thought you were arguing that here that's clearly not

23   so, there is a basis.

24                MR. KATZ:      Well, there -- well, there is a

25   basis.   What Misco -- as I understand what Misco teaches

                                      25

 1   is that it has to be unambiguous, that the arbitrator -

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's a different thing,

 3   that's a different thing.           It doesn't say whatever he

 4   says about the contract, he wins.                      It says what he says

 5   about the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it

 6   isn't just plain language to the contrary, and et

 7   cetera.   There is language in the cases to that effect.

 8   So I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there

 9   is no loophole no matter how tiny?                      That's news to me.

10                MR. KATZ:      Well, Justice Breyer, I don't

11   think manifest disregard -- certainly, manifest

12   disregard is not a standard by which this matter has

13   come up before the Court.           And this Court has held in

14   Hall Street and other cases that 10(a)(4) is the

15   exclusive ground set forth by Congress, that this Court

16   did not have the authority -- and I'm quoting the

17   Court -- it "did not have the authority to expand."

18                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.           Suppose I

19   think, since I wrote the words in First Options, that

20   something like manifest disregard or totally ignoring

21   plain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even

22   an arbitrator.   Now, suppose I think that.                     Then do I

23   decide against you?

24                MR. KATZ:      No, Justice Breyer, because here

25   both sides, not only in 2003, but in 2010 after

                                      26

 1   Stolt-Nielsen, came to the arbitrator and said, we want

 2   you to decide it.     They told the arbitrator at that

 3   time, look at the agreement, look at what transpired in

 4   2002, back when this matter was in the superior court

 5   and make your decision.

 6                  So the arbitrator applied the law that -

 7   and applied the -- the standard that he was told to

 8   apply.     He didn't just disregard it.                  He didn't make a

 9   decision saying, I don't care what you are telling me to

10   do.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            What supports his decision?

12   I mean, you -- you say that.                What -- what supports his

13   decision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's

14   the standard.     Did they agree to class arbitration?

15   What -- what supports that?

16                  MR. KATZ:      Justice Scalia, they did agree.

17   When we were in court in 2002, Oxford represented to the

18   State court judge there that not only are the disputes

19   going to arbitration, but all actions regarding the

20   dispute.

21                  And the judge specifically relied upon that,

22   expressly relied upon that, in not sending just the

23   disputes, but sending everything that had been asserted

24   by Dr. Sutter, including the claims of the class.                     And

25   the arbitrator -

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand.             There

 2   is a distinction between all disputes and all actions

 3   relating to the dispute?

 4                 MR. KATZ:      Oxford made that distinction in

 5   2002.   In fact -- and we point this out in our brief on

 6   page 5, the red brief, where Oxford has expressly -

 7   it's both on page 5 and page 6 and I will refer to page

 8   6, the top of 6.    This is Oxford's counsel in 2002.

 9   "The contract" -

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The top of page 6?

11                 MR. KATZ:      The top of page 6, Your Honor.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.

13                 MR. KATZ:      Plaintiff quoted the contract

14   here as saying "that any dispute under the contract

15   needs to be arbitrated."           That's wrong, the contract

16   says "actions concerning any dispute."                      That is what

17   Oxford has always argued at all times before the

18   arbitrator.    The arbitrator understood that.

19                 The arbitrator interpreted the agreement.

20   It's based both on the agreement and on the

21   representations made by Oxford as to what its own

22   agreement meant.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I think that's

24   inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually

25   in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his

                                       28

 1   initial decision, which is that if you have something

 2   that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of

 3   class arbitration at all, that you can't have class

 4   arbitration.

 5                  MR. KATZ:      The arbitrator, however,

 6   Mr. Chief Justice, cannot be faulted or -- or his award

 7   vacated based upon changes or arguments that were never

 8   made at the time.     The parties made their arguments to

 9   the arbitrator.     Oxford, if you will, sat on the

10   sidelines.

11          And this Court has also held that a party cannot

12   sit on the sidelines, wait till the award comes down,

13   and when it's against them then raise new arguments for

14   the first time.     Oxford -

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Could you get

16   back -- I'm sorry, go ahead.

17                  MR. KATZ:      I'm sorry.                 I was just going to

18   finish saying, Oxford could have raised these arguments

19   and maybe at the end of the day, if they raised these

20   arguments, they would have carried the day.

21                  But I respectfully submit, as this Court

22   repeatedly held, that courts do not have the authority

23   to second-guess the arbitrator and make decisions or

24   come up with a resolution that would have been different

25   with the arbitrator just because they disagree.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Can I -

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Getting back to

 3   Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First

 4   Options is fairly strong authority for him because there

 5   you have a situation with the arbitrator determining

 6   that a particular entity or individual is bound by the

 7   agreement.    And we said that's something that we will

 8   review de novo, without deference.                      Why isn't it the

 9   same here?

10                 In other words, not everything an arbitrator

11   says is subject to the deferential standard of review,

12   even if he purports to say I'm interpreting the

13   agreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options

14   did?

15                 MR. KATZ:      Here, Mr. Chief Justice, the

16   arbitrator did exactly what the parties had asked him to

17   do, though.    He did not venture and do something outside

18   of what the parties had asked him.

19                 The parties specifically presented the

20   question to the arbitrator as to whether class

21   arbitrations were available and specifically directed

22   the arbitrator both to the agreement -- the language in

23   the agreement, as well as the representations and the

24   submissions that were made below in the court system in

25   making their respective arguments.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Can I see -

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I thought that Oxford

 3   conceded that it did not preserve any question of

 4   entitlement to de novo review.

 5               MR. KATZ:       That is correct.                 Oxford has

 6   always maintained that it was the arbitrator's decision

 7   to make, and in 2010, even after Stolt-Nielsen, came

 8   back to the arbitrator and asked the arbitrator to

 9   reconsider his opinion from 2003.                      The -- Oxford had

10   never, until after losing this case obviously, has

11   Oxford sought the Court for the first time for a de novo

12   interpretation.

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Counsel -- counsel, you

14   seem -- I don't know.       I see two questions here.                   The

15   first was an arbitrator exceeds his power if he decides

16   a question is arbitral when it's not.                      And -- but here

17   there is no dispute about that because you are right,

18   your adversary submitted this question to arbitration.

19   And that's what I'm hearing you respond.                      He did,

20   there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to

21   decide this issue.

22               Justice Breyer raised the second question.

23   Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the

24   Court to overturn his decision?                 And Justice Breyer

25   said, if the standard is manifest disregard of fact and

                                      31

 1   law, why would you still win?

 2                  Because your adversary is saying, the law is

 3   clear.     You have to find some hook in the agreement to

 4   agree to class action -- arbitration, and he says there

 5   is none.     That's basically his position, that the

 6   arbitrator's decision on its substance manifestly

 7   disregarded the law.        So that's the question that I

 8   believe is extant still.

 9                  MR. KATZ:      Answering that -- answering that

10   hypothetical, assuming that was -

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Was it a hypothetical?

12                  (Laughter.)

13                  MR. KATZ:      Well, if there was a manifest

14   disregard -

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, I want to say why

16   there wasn't.     I want you to explain why there wasn't

17   one.

18                  MR. KATZ:      Well, the arbitrator did not

19   manifestly disregard.         The arbitrator did what the

20   parties wanted the arbitrator to do.

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Look, I'm going to say

22   something and you are going to say, that's right, that's

23   just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you

24   don't think of it.      The arbitrator in front of me, so

25   you better tell me why I'm wrong because they certainly

 1   will and they are in the briefs.

 2                   Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language

 3   here says all disputes will go to arbitration.                      It

 4   doesn't say they are supposed to be class or can be or

 5   can't be.      You decide what it means.

 6                   And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it

 7   doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision.                      So what

 8   kind of a case is it?          Small claims.              And then it says

 9   something about court suits where they have class.                         Hmm,

10   gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says,

11   that's what it means.          It means it could include class,

12   too.   Okay?

13                   Where in our case law is that a manifest

14   disregard?      He's looked at the language, there were two

15   plausible constructions, he came up with one of them.

16   What's the problem?         Now, that's of course their

17   problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why

18   they are saying no it's not going to help me.

19                   MR. KATZ:      Well, I don't believe that is --

20   Justice Breyer, I don't believe that is a manifest

21   disregard.

22                   JUSTICE BREYER:            So -- obviously you don't.

23                   (Laughter.)

24                   MR. KATZ:      And the reason being is that the

25   arbitrator based his determination on the standards or

                                         33

 1   the materials that were put forth before him, the

 2   agreement and the evidence, and he made a decision.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that's not enough.             As

 4   stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a

 5   plausible construction.        It's not enough that he said,

 6   I'm construing the contract.             I have looked at the terms

 7   of the contract and what the parties' said, and my

 8   construction of the contract is X. That's not enough.

 9   It has to be plausible.

10               MR. KATZ:      Yes.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now, why is this plausible?

12               MR. KATZ:      Well, with all due respect,

13   Justice Scalia, I don't think plausibility comes into

14   play.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            Use whatever word you want.

16   Manifest disregard, stick to the law.                    Now, suppose the

17   arbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it.

18   I see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball.                    Now,

19   we would strike that down because that is not relevant.

20   But he didn't say magic 8-ball.                He said class.      And

21   there are many class arbitrations.                    So it isn't quite

22   magic 8-ball.

23               Now, you explain to me -

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What's a magic 8-ball?             I

25   don't know what you are talking about.

 3   have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a

 4   non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts.

 5                 (Laughter.)

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why don't you, Mr. Katz,

 7   why don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself

 8   said.   Mr. Waxman said this clause wasn't unusual, but

 9   the arbitrator said, I've never seen anything like this.

10                 MR. KATZ:      Justice Ginsburg, what the

11   arbitrator had found was that the "no civil action" part

12   of the clause was -- was coextensive.                       It was completely

13   interrelated with the mandatory arbitration provision.

14   In other words, what the arbitrator found was that

15   everything that was prohibited from being filed in a

16   litigation in the court had to be arbitrated, and that

17   was based on not only -

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Can I ask you a question on

19   something a little bit different?                       Did the arbitrator

20   have -- how many parties were there to this agreement?

21   There is Oxford on one side and how many doctors on the

22   other side?

23                 MR. KATZ:      Well, this specific agreement was

24   Dr. Sutter and Oxford, but there are 20,000 physicians

25   who had signed the same agreement.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:             All right, so 20,000.         And

 2   the effect of the arbitrator's decision is that all of

 3   those 20,000 doctors are deemed to have agreed to class

 4   arbitration, right?

 5               MR. KATZ:       Correct.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:             And if we assume -- if I ask

 7   you to assume, for the sake of argument, that this

 8   agreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in

 9   class arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the

10   authority to make that holding with respect to all of

11   these absent class members?

12               MR. KATZ:       Well, the arbitrate -

13               JUSTICE ALITO:             If they didn't agree to

14   class arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree

15   to have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement

16   calls for -- for class arbitration.                    How did he purport

17   to bind them to that decision?

18               MR. KATZ:       Well, the arbitrator made the

19   decision based on the language and the evidence

20   presented before him and finding that it authorized

21   class arbitration.     That was the determination that was

22   made initially.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Is the -- is the contract

24   authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are

25   similarly situated, they got the same contracts?

 1                  MR. KATZ:      They all -- they all had the -

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So either the contract

 3   means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't.

 4   If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then

 5   everybody's bound.

 6                  MR. KATZ:      That -- that is correct.                Now,

 7   ultimately, when the matter was certified -

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Wait a minute.          Where did he

 9   get the authority to make that decision to interpret the

10   contract with respect to them?

11                  MR. KATZ:      Well, the -

12                  JUSTICE ALITO:            You're saying he can do it

13   with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the

14   arbitrator decide whether this calls for class

15   arbitration.     But these other people didn't.                    They

16   didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it

17   calls for class arbitration.

18                  MR. KATZ:      Well, Justice Alito, this -- this

19   is no different than in any other contract

20   interpretation issue.         The arbitrator makes a

21   determination based upon the reading of the language and

22   what the parties are telling him that language means.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But the difference

24   is in First Options.        The one thing First Options says

25   is the question of who's going to be bound by

 1   arbitration is decided by the court de novo.                  And in the

 2   class context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who

 3   did not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular

 4   interpretation.

 5                  MR. KATZ:      But Stolt-Nielsen, which the

 6   arbitrator faithfully reviewed, analyzed, and followed,

 7   makes clear that you can have class arbitration as long

 8   as the arbitrator determines that the contracting

 9   parties to that agreement establish that class

10   arbitration is available.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did these other people

12   agree to this arbitrator?             I mean, they might have said,

13   this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say

14   that -- that we agreed to class action.                  We didn't agree

15   to class -- I don't want this arbitrator.

16                  They didn't agree to this arbitrator.               Why

17   should they be bound by -- by whatever he says?

18                  MR. KATZ:      Well, for one thing,

19   Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Oxford wanted.

20   Oxford argued that the class action should go into

21   arbitration.

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Could they -- could they

23   opt out?

24                  MR. KATZ:      Well, ultimately, they could -

25   they could opt out when it was certified.                  And I want

 1   to -- I'd like to be clear on a point, if I may.

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            How can they opt out if

 3   they've agreed to class arbitration?

 4                  MR. KATZ:      Well, they can opt out of the

 5   class and pursue, if they wanted to at that point, an

 6   individual arbitration if that's what they chose to do.

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are you sure?    It seems to

 8   me if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've

 9   agreed to class arbitration.

10                  MR. KATZ:      Well, they -- they proceeded -

11   they agreed for the matter to proceed as a class

12   proceeding.     But the matters -

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And those -- and there

14   are rules that governed that, right?

15                  MR. KATZ:      That is correct, Justice

16   Ginsburg.     That is before we get to the issue of whether

17   the class itself be certified.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But -- but how could -

19   how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says,

20   as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we

21   have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case.                 I

22   decide that there is a class action, all these people

23   are in the class.

24                  MR. KATZ:      Justice Kennedy, the

25   determination that this matter could proceed as a class

 1   arbitration was only the first issue that was decided.

 2   We then engaged in the procedural mechanism by which the

 3   matter could be certified and that they could -

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:               Well, presumably they could

 5   opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless

 6   they opted out?     That's not the usual way people are

 7   bound by litigations.

 8               MR. KATZ:         But everyone, Justice Alito,

 9   everyone signs the same agreement.                       And therefore, if

10   the arbitrator's going to make a determination here -

11               JUSTICE ALITO:               No, but I think you're -

12   you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that

13   this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract.

14   That's the assumption.          This is incorrect.               If we were

15   reviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the

16   interpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we

17   would say, this is wrong.             This is really wrong.            Okay?

18   Assume that to be the case.

19               Then how are they -- how are these absent

20   people bound?     And it's really not an answer to say,

21   well, they can opt out.           If they didn't agree to be

22   bound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't

23   agree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an

24   unusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 You would never have

 1   class action arbitration if that were so.

 2               MR. KATZ:       If -- if it was -

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It would be impossible

 4   because you could never get in advance -- they find out

 5   that by getting notice and then they decide whether they

 6   want to stay with it or opt out.

 7               MR. KATZ:       Well, in any class arbitration,

 8   the arbitrator is not going to decide the same questions

 9   as to the 20,000 of the same agreements.                    It's decided

10   based upon the class representative who brings the

11   matter.

12               And even if the arbitrator was wrong,

13   Justice Alito, I submit that under 10(a)(4) in the

14   applicable standard, that even in Concepcion, this Court

15   said 10(a)(4) is -- is not an issue of mistake, it's an

16   issue of misconduct.      And that's not what we have here.

17   If there was a mistake, that still would not be enough

18   with respect to the courts to have vacated the

19   arbitrator's determination on this matter.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     And this may not -

21   I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be.                    I

22   thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these

23   things quickly.   This has been going on 11 years, right?

24               (Laughter.)

25               MR. KATZ:       This has been going on 11 years.

 1   That is true.   It's been going on -

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     It's not -- it's not

 3   a facetious question because I think one of the concerns

 4   about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the

 5   supposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have

 6   sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when

 7   it's going to bind 20,000 people.

 8               MR. KATZ:       Well, class arbitration is, as in

 9   many arbitrations in this day and age, involves complex

10   issues, that sometimes you have major corporations doing

11   battle over -- over major agreements that they know at

12   the time involved big ticket items.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, let me ask -- ask

14   you this question because I think it's consistent with

15   the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little

16   bit different, though.        Suppose you have -- and this is

17   a hypothetical case, this is not this case because I

18   don't know the facts.       Suppose you have an attorney in a

19   small town, well respected, doesn't have a great big

20   practice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator.

21               And if he arbitrates the one case, he's

22   going to get a fee of, I don't know, $10,000.                     He

23   says -- you know, if this is a class arbitration, I can

24   keep this going for 11 years, I will make a million

25   dollars.

 1                 Does he have the obligation to say, I'm

 2   going to decide the class action issue under this theory

 3   that is decided here, and after I do that, since I have

 4   a conflict, I'll bow out.            I'll just say, there is a

 5   class action, and then I will leave it for some other

 6   arbitrator.    Does he have that obligation?              And if he

 7   doesn't, should that bear on our decision here?

 8                 MR. KATZ:      Justice Kennedy, that should not

 9   bear on the decision here because this matter comes up

10   under 10(a)(4).    If there were questions about the

11   partiality of the arbitrator, then I want to rule in

12   favor of Katz because I want to prolong this thing as

13   long as possible, then perhaps Oxford should have

14   brought the matter under 10(a)(2) and -

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How long -- can we

16   straighten out this 11 years?                How many years was this

17   in the New Jersey court before there was ever an

18   arbitrator appointed?

19                 MR. KATZ:      Well, the matter wasn't in the

20   New Jersey courts for that long, but various points in

21   time because the AAA rules allow for a -- a filing of

22   a Federal suit to vacate Oxford, on multiple

23   occasions -

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But -- but tell me why -

25   why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our

                                       43

 1   decision?   That should not be a factor in our decision?

 2                  MR. KATZ:      Partiality is not a factor,

 3   Justice Kennedy -

 4                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but surely -

 5                  MR. KATZ:      -- in this decision.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I'm sorry.    Finish

 7   your answer.

 8                  MR. KATZ:      In this decision, because

 9   partiality or what could potentially be perceived as a

10   subjective intent, so the arbitrator does not play under

11   10(a)(4).

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But under -

13   under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is

14   addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another

15   party.

16                  I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to

17   an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a

18   decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to

19   partiality between parties, but a problem about the way

20   the system would work, that would create an incentive

21   for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a

22   ruling that expands his authority.

23                  MR. KATZ:      Well, arbitrators -- I would

24   submit that an arbitrator who was doing something that

25   was -- that was documented or perceived to be crazy -

                                        44

 1   and pardon my vernacular -- or just way out of line,

 2   then I'd submit that arbitrator is not going to be hired

 3   again.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How many -- how -- what

 5   is the history of class actions and arbitrations?                 There

 6   are at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of

 7   rules about how you handle class arbitrations, right?

 8                MR. KATZ:      That's correct.            I think it's

 9   important -- if I could just address a couple of points

10   regarding that.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            How many have there been?

12   Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?

13                MR. KATZ:      Well, I don't know -

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you have any idea?

15                MR. KATZ:      Well -- I don't think there has

16   been thousands, but there -- I know there have certainly

17   been a number so far that the American Arbitration

18   Association has set forth rules -

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm sure there's been a

20   number.   What's the number?

21                MR. KATZ:      I -- I don't -- I don't know the

22   number.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It could be less than 100?

24                MR. KATZ:      I wouldn't know that,

25   Justice Scalia.

 1               But -- if I may point this out, class

 2   arbitrations were certainly in existence at the time

 3   that this matter was sent into class arbitration.                      And

 4   in fact, I think it's also worthy to understand that

 5   when I brought this matter in superior court, I argued

 6   that the class action should be kept in court, but it

 7   was Oxford's argument that everything including the

 8   class action go into arbitration.

 9               It was Oxford's interpretation of its own

10   clause that the arbitrator relied upon, which puts this

11   case completely outside of Stolt-Nielsen, where in

12   Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator fashioned his -- their own

13   rules based on some policy preference about arbitrations

14   -- about class actions which wasn't present here.

15               And if I could address an issue that was

16   raised about -- that the arbitrator discussed something

17   that was bizarre.     In 2003, that was a pre- -- so that

18   was prior to Stolt-Nielsen -- the arbitrator expressly

19   disavowed that in his 2010 opinion.                      And he made it very

20   clear that he based his decisions on the interpretation

21   of the agreement as well as the representations made as

22   to what that agreement meant to the court system.

23               I think this Court has recognized for 2

24   centuries that an arbitrator's error in law or fact

25   cannot be the grounds for a vacatur.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I'm sorry to just

 2   interrupt.   For most of that two centuries, courts

 3   refused to enforce arbitration agreements.                      That's the

 4   whole reason we have the FAA.

 5                MR. KATZ:      But here, both sides, Mr. Chief

 6   Justice, expressly asked the arbitrator.                      This is not a

 7   question of arbitrability because both sides wanted the

 8   arbitrator to make that decision.                      Then even after 2010,

 9   when it came to light that Bazzle -- there was a

10   plurality and the issue of whether it's a question of

11   arbitrability is an open question, Oxford didn't go

12   running to court then.

13                Instead, it went back to the arbitrator and

14   said, we want you to reconsider your 2003 decision.                         And

15   the arbitrator again went through the analysis of

16   interpreting the agreement and the representations made

17   by the parties about what that agreement meant.

18                I submit we have to -- if we trust

19   arbitrators to handle such important issues as civil

20   rights issues and other very important matters of

21   singular importance, we have to expect that they will

22   follow the precepts of this Court and the FAA as to what

23   constitutes grounds for class arbitration.

24                I think the Third Circuit should be

25   affirmed, if there are no other questions.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, Mr. Katz.

 2                  Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.

 3                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 4                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5                  MR. WAXMAN:        Thank you.

 6                  I have three points, two small ones and one

 7   significant one.

 8                  The first small one is that this notion,

 9   this canard, that we told the district -- the State

10   court judge that class actions should be sent to

11   arbitration is dispensed with on pages 13 and 14 of our

12   reply brief, following the sentence, "Tellingly, Sutter

13   resorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous

14   positions."

15                  And I refer the Court again specifically to

16   footnote 7 on page 14, where we quote my brother's

17   statements to the State court judge explaining that what

18   we were asking for was, quote, "a motion to compel

19   individual arbitration."

20                  The second small point goes to the issue of

21   what the number is of class arbitrations.                       I also don't

22   know that.     But we know that as of this Court's decision

23   in Stolt-Nielsen because this was reported in the AAA

24   amicus brief, that not a single final decision had been

25   rendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in

                                        48

 1   any class arbitration.

 2               The AAA class arbitration rules were adopted

 3   after this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open

 4   the possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in

 5   this case said was surprising because the arbitrator

 6   said quite correctly that everyone expected that in

 7   Bazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as

 8   class arbitration.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What is your significant

10   point?

11               (Laughter.)

12               MR. WAXMAN:         I can't go back 200 years, but

13   let's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard.             And in

14   the Steelworkers v. the Enterprise Wheel case, what this

15   Court held was, quote, "An award is legitimate only so

16   long as it draws its essence from the agreement.             When

17   the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this

18   obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse

19   enforcement of the award."

20               And our submission is that this award, the

21   conclusion that the all-disputes provision here

22   manifested an actual agreement by the parties to class

23   arbitration, cannot possibly be reconciled with the

24   plain language or Stolt-Nielsen's holding.

25               Thank you.
