 8             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. MCKENNA

 9                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10                 MR. MCKENNA:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                 Washington law authorizes union security

13   agreements which permit unions to enter into collective

14   bargaining agreements that require non-member employees

15   to pay an agency shop fee or lose their job.                 The

16   union's authority to select these compelled fees is

17   based solely on statute and the subject of statutory

18   conditions.    Section 760, as adopted by Washington

19   voters in 1992, requires unions to obtain the

20   affirmative consent from non-members before their fees

21   may be used to influence an election or operate a

22   political committee.       760 serves the state's interest in

23   election integrity by means of ensuring that union

24   election activity is funded by voluntary contributions,

25   just like every other organization that seeks political


                                         3

 1   funds.     760 is a valid condition on the union statutory

 2   authority and does not violate the union's First

 3   Amendment rights.

 4                 760 serves the state's interests specified

 5   in the adopted initiative, which were -- which are found

 6   at petition appendix 138a codified as RCW 4217.620.

 7   Three interests in election integrity are stated, or

 8   three means of serving an interest in election integrity

 9   are stated in this portion, the intent portion of the

10   statute.

11                 First, to ensure that individuals have a

12   fair and equal opportunity to influence elections;

13   second, to reduce the influence of large organizational

14   contributors; third, to restore public trust in the

15   election process.     The Washington Supreme Court,

16   petition appendix 22a-23a, agreed that the intent of

17   Initiative 134 was to protect the integrity of the

18   election process from the perception that individuals

19   have an insignificant role to play.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm surprised that that's

21   the -- I would have thought its primary purpose would be

22   to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes

23   that they don't support.           Was there no First Amendment

24   interest.

25                 MR. MCKENNA:         Justice Scalia, I --

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is it only an election law

 2   interest?

 3               MR. MCKENNA:         Actually, Justice Scalia, we

 4   believe that Section, Section 760 accomplishes both

 5   purposes.   The overall intent of the initiative was as I

 6   stated found by the State Supreme Court, but clearly

 7   from the plain language of Section 760 --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But you just said the State

 9   Supreme Court was wrong.         I mean, why do you believe it

10   on this if you don't believe it on everything else?

11   You're appealing from it, aren't you?

12               MR. MCKENNA:         We believe that the integrity

13   of the election process, Justice Scalia, is in fact

14   served by helping ensure that individuals make voluntary

15   contributions.   We think that in fact it does help the

16   integrity of the election process, yes, sir.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, how can the State

18   Supreme Court determine what is the purpose, the intent,

19   of the ballot initiative?

20               MR. MCKENNA:         I'm not certain, Your Honor.

21   They referred to the --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          A lot of people voted for

23   it.

24               MR. MCKENNA:         Right.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          But is the State Supreme

 1   Court in a position to determine why they voted for it?

 2                 MR. MCKENNA:        They simply hold, Your Honor,

 3   in their opinion that this is what the voters intended.

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:         How do they know that?

 5                 MR. MCKENNA:        I don't know how they know it,

 6   Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            If that's what they

 8   intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the

 9   union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit

10   of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the

11   local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or

12   the corporation, if they want to spend money that people

13   have given them for totally other purposes, the

14   compulsory bar association, well, they can do that.

15   It's just the labor unions that can't spend the money

16   that these people forced to belong -- you know, they

17   have to object affirmatively -- but all the other

18   similar organizations, they can't.

19                 MR. MCKENNA:        Your Honor, beginning with the

20   Railway Labor Act case and continuing up through the

21   public school teacher cases, Abood and Hudson, this

22   Court has recognized that compelling employees to pay

23   fees must be balanced against the need to protect them

24   from --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, now you're talking


                                         6

 1   about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which

 2   is rather interesting -- I take it that's one of the

 3   main points on the other side -- the other purpose has

 4   nothing to do with this case.               If Washington wanted to

 5   have a similar statute where it was worried about

 6   protecting the interests of the compelled member or the

 7   compelled payor, fine, fine, that would be a different

 8   case.   That isn't this case.

 9                 MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:             In this case they couldn't

11   care less about that.

12                 MR. MCKENNA:         Actually, Your Honor, I think

13   the plain language of 760 makes it clear that the

14   authors of the initiative intended to protect individual

15   interests.     There is no meaningful distinction between

16   the use of individuals in 760, in Section 760, than

17   there is in the Hudson, in the Hudson statute, for

18   example.     The Hudson statute, the Illinois statute at

19   issue in Hudson, also required nonmembers to opt in in

20   order to make, not just political contributions but any

21   contributions.     But the Court, this Court, found no

22   problem with Hudson or with the Illinois statute in that

23   case.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:             That's true, but in that

25   case, in that case they didn't have a State Supreme

 1   Court interpreting the statute which is just as you

 2   started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the

 3   rights of the nonmember, zero.                It has to do with the

 4   appearance of fairness in the election.

 5                 MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor, with due respect

 6   that was the legal conclusion of the Washington Supreme

 7   Court.     It was not a construction of the statute.              It

 8   was a legal conclusion based on their reading or

 9   divining of voter intend.            But this Court is not bound

10   by such an assessment.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I wanted to ask

12   about that.    Suppose Washington says that as a matter of

13   Washington law we are bound by our interpretation of

14   purpose and we interpret the statute according to that

15   purpose.    You use the words "plain language" a few

16   minutes ago.

17                 MR. MCKENNA:         Yes.       Yes.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Are we free to disregard

19   that and to say.    Oh well, we're just going to follow

20   the plain language?

21                 MR. MCKENNA:         No, no.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Like the says that was

23   argued, the first case this morning?

24                 MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor, as Chief Justice

25   Roberts mentioned in the last case you heard this


                                          8

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   morning, first look to the plain language, as the

 2   Solicitor General has pointed out in numerous briefs --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's a Federal, a

 4   Federal statute and this is a State statute.                  If the

 5   State court says, we're interested in purposes, we

 6   decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret

 7   the statute according to the purpose as we found it,

 8   aren't we bound by that?

 9               MR. MCKENNA:         I don't believe you are bound

10   by that, Your Honor.      For example --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What's your authority for

12   that?

13               MR. MCKENNA:         Wisconsin v. Mitchell, Your

14   Honor.   In that case the Wisconsin Supreme Court was

15   found by this Court not to have constructed the statute,

16   but to have made an assessment of its practical effects,

17   and this Court found it was not bound.                  Similarly in

18   Teller, a case more directly relevant to this case, the

19   State Supreme Court found that the Bar Association of

20   California is a governmental agency and this Court

21   declined to follow the State Supreme Court of California

22   and found that in fact it was not.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, that's because the

24   characterization had a Federal consequence.

25               MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor, I simply observed


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that this Court did not find it was bound by the

 2   California Supreme Court's finding that the bar

 3   association is a government agency, nor did it find in

 4   Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it was bound by the Wisconsin

 5   Supreme Court in regards to its assessment of practical

 6   effects of the Wisconsin statute at issue there.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            Do they get their money

 8   back?   If this is upheld and I'm an agency member, I

 9   hate the union, can't stand it, gave them the $20 for

10   this and they spent it on a political candidate I hate

11   even more and you win, do I get my $20 back or can the

12   union just spend my $20 on something else?

13               MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor, if it is a 760

14   expense they should get the money back.                 If it is a

15   non-760 expense which is not germane, then they would

16   have to opt out at that -- they would have to opt out to

17   get that kind of money back, unless Your Honor is

18   referring to what happens on, if the statute is upheld,

19   what happens when we go back and have a further trial on

20   the issues in this case.         I'm not sure which scenario

21   you were envisioning, but --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm trying to get at the

23   question is this the union's money or is this the

24   workers', the teachers' money?

25               MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor --


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           So does he get this money

 2   back if they violate the statute.

 3                MR. MCKENNA:        Your Honor, the 760 money --

 4   excuse me.   The 760 money is not the union's money until

 5   they have satisfied the conditions laid out in the

 6   statute, in this case Section 760.                 Possession of the

 7   fees does not entitle the WEA or any union to use those

 8   fees to influence an election or operate a political

 9   committee until after they have satisfied the condition

10   on that collection, the condition being in this case

11   they have to obtain affirmative authorization.                This

12   Court held in Phillipson and Brown that, analogizing to

13   that money, that non-members own the fees until the

14   statutory conditions are satisfied.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Let, let's assume that it

16   makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute

17   was at least in part to protect the First Amendment

18   rights of the non-union members or whether, as the

19   Washington Supreme Court seemed to say -- at least they

20   said its principal purpose was to protect the voting

21   process.   Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the

22   Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is

23   ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a

24   manner which renders it constitutional the court is

25   obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law.

 1   Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the

 2   intent of the people who enacted this statute were?

 3                MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, sir --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wouldn't the Washington

 5   Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which

 6   would make it constitutional rather than

 7   unconstitutional?

 8                MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, Your Honor, it would if

 9   in fact Section 760 were ambiguous.                      It is, however, not

10   ambiguous.   It is plain on its face, and in fact the

11   Supreme Court did not state that any term or phrase in

12   Section 760 is ambiguous.           Instead they referred to

13   their divination of voter intent.                 And I believe, Your

14   Honor --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Do you agree with the

16   court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue

17   here?

18                MR. MCKENNA:         The constitutionality of the

19   statute with regard to the union's First Amendment

20   rights is not at issue here, Your Honor, no.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Isn't it your position

22   that this statute is constitutional either way you

23   interpret it?

24                MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, Your Honor, it is.             Your

25   Honor, I'd like to make the further point that -- and I

 1   think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that

 2   since under your decisions the State can prohibit a

 3   union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it

 4   is reasonable for the State to impose a condition on

 5   that collection which falls, falls far short of actually

 6   prohibiting it.    We further point out that in the Hudson

 7   case the Illinois statute at issue was effectively an

 8   opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was

 9   not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the

10   more generous Washington State statute which allows the

11   union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount

12   equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which

13   had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or

14   reduced just to reflect 760 expenses.

15              It seems to us that it is within the power

16   of the State to establish such a condition in the

17   interest of an election's integrity by means of

18   protecting the First Amendment interests of the

19   non-members, and we think the statute does that very

20   well without imposing in fact a substantial

21   administrative burden on the union in this case or

22   unions in general.      For example, the, the way that the

23   WEA or any union can comply with Section 760 would be to

24   simply place an additional form in the Hudson packet

25   they send out.    Now, recognizing that the Hudson packet


                                         13

 1   is about this thick, that it is received by the teachers

 2   in September, the busiest month of the year for

 3   teachers, and that there is no form currently provided

 4   in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out,

 5   but rather a statement that you must send a letter to

 6   the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy.                   And we

 7   look to the WEA PAC for instruction on what they could

 8   do.   But now.   Because the WEA has chosen to form a PAC

 9   and is required to solicit members and non-members if

10   they choose in order to contribute to that PAC, they do

11   a very good job of soliciting members.                   They include a

12   very convenient form encouraging people to check off and

13   send their dues in to the PAC to support candidate

14   elections.   They provide no such form for the opt-out

15   process, but it would be easy for them to do so.

16                The burden imposed on them is not great

17   administratively, as they suggest, any more than the

18   burden on the other teachers unions in Abood or in

19   Hudson because it can easily be met through these

20   simple.

21                If there are no further questions, Your

22   Honor, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 1            ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

 2                      IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 3               GENERAL CLEMENT:              Mr. Chief Justice and may

 4   it please the Court:

 5               The statute at issue here imposes only a

 6   narrow limitation on the union's use of agency fees,

 7   namely by requiring the affirmative assent of the

 8   non-members before the union may use those funds for

 9   non- germane political expenditures.                      The statute does

10   not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on

11   political causes and every avenue that is available to

12   any other organization in the State to solicit

13   contributions from non- members remains available to the

14   union.

15               The court below nonetheless struck the

16   statute down only by treating the workers' minimum

17   constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as

18   well as a floor.     In the process, the court below

19   rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which

20   the States and the Federal Government have at least

21   since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to

22   make labor policy.      We would request that the Court

23   reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore

24   room for play in the joints in this area of labor law.

25               I think the starting problem with the


                                         15

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   court's analysis below is that the rights that are at

 2   issue in this area principally are the rights of the

 3   individual workers.      This court has recognized that

 4   agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment

 5   issues and First Amendment impingements and so the

 6   forced extraction of fees is justified only to the

 7   extent that it can be justified by the government's

 8   interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free

 9   ridership.   So as a minimum constitutional matter, the

10   workers have to have an opt- out right.                  The question is

11   whether the States can go further and either do an

12   opt-in regime or do what was at issue in the Hudson case

13   and not even allow the union to collect the non-germane

14   funds in the first place from non-members.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Clement, if we reverse

16   as you suggest and the State Supreme Court said, well, I

17   guess we were wrong under the First Amendment, we just

18   realized our State constitution requires the same

19   result, would that judgment stand, do you think?

20                GENERAL CLEMENT:            I think it might well.       I

21   mean, I think there might be an argument at that point

22   that somehow the Federal Constitution requires more than

23   opt-out rights.    Certainly some of the amici have made

24   that argument.    The Davenport Petitioners have made that

25   argument, and I suppose you could at that point confront

 1   a second petition in this case.              But at least as a

 2   starting matter, I think that's an option that's

 3   available to the Washington Supreme Court.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But Washington -- at a

 5   minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme

 6   Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a

 7   crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion,

 8   because there is no constitutional issue here under your

 9   view.

10              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Right, though I mean -- I

11   don't mean to be able to constrain the Washington

12   Supreme Court's ability to find a State constitutional

13   problem that it would then think there's a need to

14   avoid.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Are the courts in

16   Washington State elected, do we know that?              Are they

17   elected?

18              GENERAL CLEMENT:             They are elected.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:             They are elected, so it's

20   easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we

21   hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be

22   done and we disallow what the people have voted for.

23   That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?

24              GENERAL CLEMENT:             It might be a harder call,

25   Justice Scalia.   I seem to recall a reference -- it

 1   might have actually been in the court of appeals opinion

 2   rather than in the State Supreme Court opinion -- that

 3   as a general matter the Washington courts have not

 4   construed their First Amendment, State constituent First

 5   Amendment to be radically different than the Federal

 6   Constitution.    So I would imagine there's going to be

 7   some State law that may limit their ability to do that.

 8   I'm certainly not an expert on the Washington State law

 9   of the First Amendment.

10              JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, if this money is the

11   non-union member's money and an opt-out -- I'm sorry --

12   opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why

13   should the First Amendment permit anything other than an

14   opt-in scheme.

15              MR. CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Scalia, it's a

16   fair question.   As I say, it's a question that's

17   certainly raised by the Davenport Petitioners.           I think

18   there's an answer to it and I'll get to it in a minute.

19   But I would say in fairness to Mr. -- one of the

20   anomalies of this case is that in many respects I think

21   that's a more difficult constitutional question than the

22   one that the Washington Supreme Court answered adversely

23   to Petitioners in this case.

24              I think, if I can sketch an answer as to why

25   it is that the opt out is the constitutional minimum and


                                        18

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there isn't as a matter of constitutional law required

 2   to be an opt-in right, I think it goes back to what the

 3   Court has construed as the relevant First Amendment

 4   interest here.    And the Court has seemingly construed

 5   the relevant First Amendment interest here in not having

 6   a compelled extraction, and as part and parcel of the

 7   constitutional violation, it seems to have assumed

 8   there's a need for a stated objection.                   And I think

 9   that's where you get the opt-out right.

10                And so if you put it in the analogy, an

11   analogous compelled speech context like Willie against

12   Maynard and the New Hampshire license plate, in that

13   context an important parcel of the violation is the

14   objection to having "Live Free or Die" on your license

15   plate.    And the Court hasn't construed the compelled

16   speech there to be that everybody has a compelled speech

17   violation because they are presumptively forced to have

18   the license plate on the back of their car.                  So I think

19   that --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:          The union can make it as

21   difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out.                  They can

22   send a packet that's this thick and not provide a form.

23                MR. CLEMENT:         I wouldn't think so, Justice

24   Alito.    And I think that there are two separate

25   questions, I would think.           One is, what is an adequate


                                        19

 1   set of procedures and protections for exercising the

 2   opt-out right?   And then a separate question would be,

 3   do you actually have to go all the way to an opt-in

 4   right?   And I think that there may well be many cases

 5   where the Hudson notice that's provided doesn't provide

 6   a sufficient constitutional opportunity.                  I mean, you

 7   have in a case like this, a 100-page packet, I'm told,

 8   that has no -- no form in it that you're supposed to

 9   return to opt out.      You basically have to go to the

10   third page, find the address of the president of the

11   union, and then send in a letter.

12               And I think it's instructive if you look in

13   the joint appendix, I think it's at page joint appendix

14   45, you have the form that's available to union members

15   to opt in to PAC contributions, and have payroll

16   deductions made for the PAC contributions.                 The union

17   certainly makes it much easier to opt in to PAC

18   contributions than it makes it to opt out vis a vis the

19   Hudson packet.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Is it relevant, General

21   Clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the

22   ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on

23   beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union?

24   It seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the

25   election process, because they left the same old Hudson


                                         20

 1   in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have

 2   to do with elections.

 3               MR. CLEMENT:         That's absolutely right,

 4   Justice Ginsburg, and I think the way we look at it is

 5   that this whole debate about the purpose of the

 6   provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at

 7   the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid.                  If you look

 8   at the text, it's hard to understand how it does not

 9   have at least the effect of protecting workers.                  On the

10   other hand, you're absolutely right that it doesn't

11   address the entirety of germane, of non-germane

12   expenses.   It addressed a subset that have the most

13   direct impact on the election process.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Or even nongermane

15   political expenses.

16               MR. CLEMENT:         That's true.           That's true, I

17   mean, for example, a nongermane lobbying expense which

18   you might consider to be political in some broad sense,

19   is not covered by the opt-in and remains subject to the

20   Hudson opt out right.

21               But I don't think that there is certainly

22   anything problematic about that.               It's not like the

23   interest in protecting electoral integrity is some sort

24   of forbidden government interest that makes this a

25   suspicious piece of legislation.               And I think at the


                                       21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   end, if you again put the text of the relevant provision

 2   together with the overall purpose, it's clear that it's

 3   trying to protect the rights of workers but it's doing

 4   so in service of a broader intent of improving electoral

 5   integrity, and I could suggest where maybe the

 6   Washington Supreme Court went awry in its analysis, it

 7   focused almost exclusively on the three stated purposes

 8   that were included in the text of Initiative 134, which

 9   were all focused more on electoral integrity.

10              That's not surprising, because there were 36

11   sections in Initiative 134 that dealt with the whole

12   manner of different campaign finance initiatives.

13   Before this initiative was passed by the voters of

14   Washington there weren't any campaign contribution

15   limits in the State of Washington.

16              So this initiative is doing a lot more work,

17   just besides Section 760.         I think 760 isn't unrelated

18   to those broader purposes because it does make sure that

19   the contributions of the workers here are voluntary, and

20   I think that is certainly something that's very similar

21   to what Federal law accomplishes through the separate

22   segregated fund requirements.

23              If I could make just one note about the fact

24   that this targets unions and not other entities, I think

25   two points are relevant.        The first is that argument was


                                      22
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   very clearly waived, and if you look at footnote 6 of

 2   the Washington Supreme Court opinion which is at 25a of

 3   the -- of the State's petition appendix, it's clear that

 4   any argument about the, the disparate treatment of

 5   unions versus corporations or other entities was not

 6   before that court.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, are there any other

 8   such entities that are given the power by the State to

 9   collect money from people against their will?

10              GENERAL CLEMENT:               You've anticipated my

11   second point, which is the power that's being -- I mean,

12   it's no accident that they targeted this particular

13   power or this particular issue because it has always

14   been understood to be an anomaly in this area.                   That the

15   unions have a right to effectively take a claim on the

16   paycheck on people who are nonmembers of the union.

17   These are individuals who have already opted out of

18   union membership, and that is a sufficient anomaly and

19   sufficiently unlike any other context that I think there

20   is nothing that prevents the State of Washington from

21   targeting that problem and that problem alone.

22              If there are no further questions, thank

23   you.

 1                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. WEST,

 2                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 3                MR. WEST:       Thank you, Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief

 4   Justice, and may it please the Court:

 5                Our submission that Section 760

 6   unconstitutionally burdens the union's First Amendment

 7   right to engage in political advocacy rests on three

 8   points.    One, the statute before the Court is a campaign

 9   finance law that was enacted for the purpose of

10   protecting the public's interest in the integrity of the

11   electoral process.      Two, it is a content-based

12   restriction on speech, which cannot be justified by the

13   State's authority to limit agency fees in the first

14   place.    Three, the statute does not serve a compelling

15   State interest both because it is overbroad in

16   restricting, restricting speech on ballot propositions

17   and because it's underinclusive in regulating the

18   campaign speech of unions but not of other comparably

19   situated entities.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Are the First Amendment

21   rights of the union members, of the workers who are

22   non-union members relevant?

23                MR. WEST:       Uh, the First Amendment rights --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I mean, you -- you begin

25   by talking about the First Amendment but you, you

 1   proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of

 2   workers involved at all.

 3                MR. WEST:      The -- the -- the nonmember

 4   employees certainly have a First Amendment right not to

 5   be compelled to finance, help finance political,

 6   ideological and other nongermane expenditures over their

 7   objection.   And that right is fully protected

 8   independently of 760 by the Hudson process, and as the

 9   Washington Supreme Court held, when there is the

10   availability of a ready means for opting out of that

11   participation in, in financing those causes, there is no

12   compelled speech.    And this is what the, what the First

13   Amendment gives to the nonmember fee payers.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I take it States

15   have considerable discretion in determining how to

17                MR. WEST:      The States --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And absent some direction

19   that we have to consider this as only being for a, for

20   purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that

21   Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use

22   this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First

23   Amendment constitutional rights.

24                MR. WEST:      Well, what the State is

25   protecting, Justice Kennedy, is not the First Amendment

 1   right itself which by definition is protected through

 2   the Hudson process.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, why can't the State

 4   protect it more?    I mean the fact that Hudson would be

 5   adequate -- it --

 6               MR. WEST:       The State --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:             -- from that it does not

 8   follow that the State is not protecting the rights.

 9               MR. WEST:       The State can certainly protect

10   the interest that is protected by the First Amendment

11   right more, or to a greater degree, but if it does so,

12   it can only do so if it does not infringe on other

13   constitutional rights.        And if it does then the question

14   is whether the State's regulation that infringes on

15   other constitutional rights, in this case the union's

16   First Amendment right of political advocacy, whether

17   that infringement is justified by a compelling State

18   interest.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:             And your claim as I take

20   it, that there is an infringement with the union's right

21   of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme

22   restricts the union's use of its own funds?

23               MR. WEST:       The scheme restricts the, the use

24   of funds that are, are properly collected from agency

25   fee payers by the union and --

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            All right.       You agree that

 2   the union could segregate these funds as opposed to

 3   commingling them, and that would cure, that would in

 4   effect answer your, your constitutional objection?

 5               MR. WEST:      Well, it wouldn't, because then

 6   the question is what do you do after you've segregated

 7   them.   If the statute --

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it's clear from the

 9   statute that, that what you would do would be leave them

10   subject to the opt-in determination, but all other

11   funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally

12   entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.

13               MR. WEST:      Certainly Justice Souter, but

14   then the question is, for those fee payers, and

15   certainly there are going to be some out of three or

16   four thousand that do not give affirmative

17   authorization, then what do you do with their funds?

18   And the, the --

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you think that would

20   create an independent constitutional problem assuming

21   that you did segregate the funds?

22               MR. WEST:      Justice Souter, the --

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That would, that would

24   create an issue?   You know, what if they say:               Nothing?

25   Maybe, maybe the statute does not deal adequately with


                                       27

 1   that.   But does that raise a constitutional problem that

 2   in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the

 3   one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the

 4   dissenting workers?

 5               MR. WEST:      Justice Souter, the reason it

 6   raises a constitutional problem is because of the

 7   content discrimination issue.             What the State is saying

 8   is that you have a right to collect an agency fee that

 9   is the full equivalent of union dues, but if you choose

10   to spend any money from your treasury for electoral

11   advocacy, you may spend whatever you want from your

12   treasury for -- for legislative lobbying, for public

13   relations, for all kinds of other issues, forms of

14   speech that are not chargeable to objectors.                     But if you

15   choose to spend any for one particular type of speech,

16   namely electoral advocacy, then you must segregate and

17   refund a portion of the --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that's, under --

19               MR. WEST:      -- to the fee payers.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Under the Federal law you

21   can't even have this opt-in system.                     You have to have a

22   separate organization as I understand, for the election.

23   So there would be no, no possibility that the nonmember

24   of the union, that funds would go to election financing.

25               MR. WEST:      Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that's much harder on

 2   the union, I would think, isn't it?

 3               MR. WEST:      Well, it's much harder on the

 4   union in that respect but not in the respect that's

 5   critical here, and that is the Federal law as well as

 6   the laws of all the other States who have, have required

 7   separate segregated funds limit that requirement to

 8   candidate elections.

 9               The, the reason this statute is

10   unconstitutional, the reason it does not consist of a

11   compelling, does not provide a compelling governmental

12   interest in regulating elections, is because it goes far

13   beyond the permissible realm of regulating expenditures

14   on candidate elections, and prohibits the union without

15   affirmative authorization from spending its funds for

16   ballot propositions.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            You're -- you're back to

18   its funds again.

19               MR. WEST:      Whether they're --

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:            And you're saying, first

21   you said well, segregating the funds does not answer the

22   problem.   And I thought the reason it didn't answer the

23   problem was that the, that it was, that the purposes of

24   the, of the act were underinclusive.                    And now you're

25   responding to Justice Ginsburg by going back to making


                                       29
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the assumption that the segregated funds would be the

 2   union's funds.

 3              MR. WEST:      Justice Souter, if they are

 4   segregated, if the union segregates them, assuming they

 5   don't -- for those for whom they don't receive

 6   affirmative authorization, they keep them in escrow

 7   indefinitely, or they put them in a locked box and never

 8   do anything with them, certainly the union would satisfy

 9   the statute in -- in that way.

10              But what, what the statute says as

11   interpreted by the trial court, if then the union puts

12   those funds back into its general treasury, or even if

13   it doesn't, and spends them in some way for some purpose

14   whatever, that it's violating the statute.                And the only

15   way that the union can comply is by not only segregating

16   the funds, but then if affirmative authorization is not

17   received, by rebating a certain portion of the fund to

18   the individual fee payers.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And I thought that

20   approach was exactly what we held was required in the

21   Street decision, the International Association of

22   Machinists versus Street, so that you can't get around

23   this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the

24   objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use

25   the others for that.

 1                MR. WEST:      Sure.        Exactly.        And that's --

 2   and that's why I think that that interpretation of the

 3   statute may be correct.         But the problem we have here is

 4   this is a statute, and why it's unconstitutional is this

 5   is a statute that is saying this only with respect to a

 6   particular kind of speech.           It's saying the union may

 7   collect a hundred percent of dues and it may spend them

 8   in whatever way it deems appropriate for --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Doesn't that

10   objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?

11                MR. WEST:      No, it doesn't, Mr. Chief

12   Justice, because the -- the -- in -- in the Street and

13   Abood decisions, the Court has -- has said that there is

14   -- all -- has talked in terms of expenditures that are

15   not germane to collective bargaining.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is it content

17   discrimination which subjects legislation to strict

18   scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a

19   State designates certain funds for use by school

20   districts to teach patriotism, American history,

21   something like that?       Is that subject to strict

22   scrutiny?

23                MR. WEST:      No, because this is Government

24   funding.    This is --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.       Now let's assume

 1   it's not Government funding.              Instead of doing that the

 2   Government says, you will have authority to collect

 3   money from certain people only for a particular purpose.

 4   Is that content discrimination which calls into play

 5   strict scrutiny?

 6                MR. WEST:       I believe it is, Justice Scalia,

 7   because --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't see why the one is

 9   any worse than the other.            The Government has a

10   particular purpose in mind and in one case it gives out

11   money with that purpose in mind, which discriminates of

12   course; in the other case it allows this extraordinary

13   power to exact funds from people, but only for certain

14   purposes.    That's not the kind of content discrimination

15   that they calls strict scrutiny into play, it seems to

16   me.

17                MR. WEST:       It's strict scrutiny if it's not

18   the Government acting as the speaker, and the Government

19   is acting here as --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Here is the Government

21   acting as a coercer.        It's because of the Government

22   that you're allowed to get this money from these

23   non-union members.

24                MR. WEST:       Well, I don't believe the Court

25   has ever put it quite that way in the Government speech

 1   cases, the Government funding cases.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question on

 3   your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument?

 4   Supposing the statute was broader and said the union may

 5   not use any non-member agency fee collections for any

 6   non-germane purpose at all without affirmative consent?

 7   Would that solve all the constitutional problems?

 8                 MR. WEST:     I think the problem here -- let

 9   me say two things in response to that, Justice Stevens.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Could you just tell me yes

11   or no, and then explain?

12                 MR. WEST:     Certainly.            Well, the answer is

13   yes and no.    The answer is, if you're talking about --

14                 (Laughter.)

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           At least insofar as your

16   argument under inclusiveness, the answer would have to

17   be that was, that statute would be okay.

18                 MR. WEST:     If -- if the -- if you're -- if

19   what you're doing is talking about the, an election

20   statute like --

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           I'm talking about a

22   statute that the individuals say I don't want to spend

23   any more money, give any more money to the union than I

24   absolutely have to.       And the legislature decides to

25   protect the right, that right by saying you cannot use

 1   agency sock fees for any non-germane purpose.                     What's

 2   wrong with that?

 3               MR. WEST:       That, Justice Stevens, if this is

 4   what the state is saying with respect to the public

 5   sector employees as to which it has the authority to

 6   regulate the agency fee.          This is perfectly

 7   constitutional.    This is the kind of --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:             If that's perfectly

 9   constitutional, this is a fortiori okay.

10               MR. WEST:       It's not --

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:             And it's less of a burden

12   on the union and there's less protection to the

13   employee.

14               MR. WEST:       No, it's not.                It's a different

15   case for two reasons, Justice Stevens.                     First of all,

16   because it's content discriminatory.                     It's not saying

17   the -- it's not saying you -- we limit the agency fee to

18   the nonchargeable, the non-germane, or to the purposes

19   that are germane to collective bargaining.                     The State

20   can permissibly do that because it's making --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why isn't that a

22   content-based restriction?           You've got to look at it and

23   see if it's germane.

24               MR. WEST:       The purposes that -- the purposes

25   for which the -- that are being excluded in that case


                                        34

 1   are a wide variety of different kinds of speech and

 2   non-speech activities, not only political speech but

 3   public relations.    Many courts have interpreted

 4   organizing activities to be non-germane to collective

 5   bargaining.    Membership benefits that are not available,

 6   non-members are put in that category.                    Donations to

 7   charities.    International activities.                  There's a whole

 8   variety of union expenditures that the courts have held

 9   are not germane to collective bargaining and cannot be

10   charged over a non-member's objection, and a State would

11   be perfectly free, as several states like Pennsylvania

12   and New Mexico have, to say our judgment is that our

13   interest in labor peace does not extend further than in

14   authorizing an agency fee that includes purposes germane

15   to collective bargaining.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm just curious below in

17   the opinion, I didn't notice in footnote 6, which I

18   hadn't taken in, that the court explicitly says that you

19   did not make any argument about underinclusiveness and

20   overinclusiveness with respect to other organizations,

21   corporations and so forth.

22                 Now, did -- I can't recall, I just don't

23   recall.   What you're saying now, I take it, is that the

24   word "election," you can't use it for elections, and

25   elections involve candidates and they also involve

 1   ballot issues.

 2               MR. WEST:      Correct.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            And you're saying that the

 4   real problem with this statute is that it throws in

 5   ballot issues along with candidate elections.

 6               MR. WEST:      Well, there are two problems.

 7   There's the concept -- I mean, there's --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            But on that first one, did

 9   they discuss that at some length in the lower court

10   opinion?   I don't --

11               MR. WEST:      The lower court, no, did not

12   discuss the --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            So this is really a ground

14   that they haven't considered.

15               MR. WEST:      What the Washington Supreme Court

16   held is that the -- what was argued in the Washington

17   Supreme Court generally is that this is a violation of

18   the union's right to engage in political advocacy.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            But this thing about the

20   ballot issue is not there.

21               MR. WEST:      And the reason -- this is a

22   reason I think the Washington Supreme Court took note of

23   the fact of what the funds were spent on, on balloting

24   initiatives solely, not on candidate elections.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            In fact, you want to us

 1   decide that question, and was there another one that --

 2   you just said there were two reasons basically.

 3               MR. WEST:       Well, the two reasons why the

 4   statute fails to constitute a compelling Government

 5   interest are the overbroad extension to ballot

 6   propositions, unlike the Federal law and any other State

 7   law.   And secondly, the underinclusiveness that this is

 8   a statute that is ostensibly intended to protect the

 9   integrity of the elections by ensuring that the funds

10   that organizations spend for political electoral

11   purposes represent the views of the people from whom

12   those funds were derived.           And the -- what the State has

13   chosen to regulate to advance that interest is solely

14   people who already have the opportunity to prevent the

15   use of their funds for purposes they disagree with,

16   while not regulating at all other entities in which --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That's the argument

18   that the State Supreme Court in footnote 6 expressly

19   said you did not raise.

20               MR. WEST:       I think that would be a valid

21   argument if we were attempting to raise an equal

22   protection claim here, Mr. Chief Justice.                  That's not

23   what we're doing.    What we're saying, we are making an

24   argument based on what the State Supreme Court held,

25   namely that this is a violation of the -- the union's

 1   right to engage in political speech, and this is one of

 2   the reasons for it.       Granted, that particular

 3   justification for the ruling was not argued below, but

 4   this is not like we were attempting to argue equal

 5   protection, a totally new basis.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            On which -- on what you

 7   were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say

 8   funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished

 9   from what's in a corporate treasury or -- there is

10   something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by

11   saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants

12   it back, the non-member would be entitled.               So it's not

13   like money in the corporate till.

14                 MR. WEST:     Well, it is, Justice Ginsburg, if

15   the -- this is why the purpose of the statute is so

16   important.    If the purpose of the statute is to protect

17   the integrity of the elections by ensuring that what

18   organizations spend for political purposes represents

19   the views of those who contributed the money, then it's

20   very much to the point that there are other

21   organizations.    For example, the Michigan Chamber of

22   Commerce --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You want us to consider

24   this case as if the First Amendment rights of non-union

25   members were not involved?

 1                 MR. WEST:     Absolutely -- absolutely not,

 2   Justice Kennedy.    We recognize --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that's been your whole

 4   argument so far.

 5                 MR. WEST:     Absolutely not.              I'm sorry,

 6   Justice Kennedy, but that's certainly not what I intend

 7   to be saying.    We recognize that the non-members have

 8   First Amendment rights.         We also recognize that those

 9   rights are protected by the Hudson procedures which the

10   union uses.    The non-members have the absolute right to

11   prevent the use of their funds not only for this kind of

12   electoral speech but for any kind of political

13   ideological speech and other nonchargeable activities

14   with which they disagree simply by sending in a letter.

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So it's a First Amendment

16   right that is waived by failing to make a timely

17   objection.

18                 MR. WEST:     Well, it's not that a right is

19   waived.   What it is --

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It's gone under your

21   theory.

22                 MR. WEST:     No.      It's -- Justice Stevens,

23   it's what the right is.         The constitutional right is a

24   right against being required to -- to engage in

25   compelled speech.

 2   you don't make a timely objection.

 3                MR. WEST:     No, you have the -- but that

 4   would be just like -- like the solicitor general on the

 5   -- the license plate case.          Someone who receives in the

 6   mail the license plate that says "Live Free or Die" or

 7   "Taxation Without Representation" and puts it on his car

 8   is not waiving a constitutional right by --

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:         It's not exactly the same

10   situation.   These are teachers who have chosen not to

11   join the Washington Education Association; isn't that

12   right?

13                MR. WEST:     These are teachers who have not

14   joined the Washington Education --

15                JUSTICE ALITO:         Isn't it overwhelmingly

16   likely that they, if you spoke to them and you said

17   would you like to give money to the union to spend on

18   elections, they would say no?

19                MR. WEST:     I absolutely disagree with you,

20   Justice Alito, because keep in mind --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:         Explain to me the thinking

22   of somebody who chooses not to join, the 5 percent who

23   choose not to join, and yet they would like to make this

24   contribution.   Now maybe there's some, but what would be

25   the thinking of such a person?

 1              MR. WEST:       It's not asking them to make a

 2   contribution.   It's asking them, is it okay with you if

 3   your money is used for this purpose.                    But keep in mind

 4   what the money is being used for here.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:           What's the difference

 6   between that?

 7              MR. WEST:       The money is being used --

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:           What's the difference

 9   between saying would you like to make a contribution,

10   and would you like to allow us to use money that we

11   possess for our purposes rather than returning it to us?

12   What's the difference between those two?

13              MR. WEST:       Well, whether there is a

14   difference or not, Justice Alito, the point is the union

15   here is using this money for purposes that it has every

16   reason to believe is in the interest of the vast

17   majority of teachers, including --

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well surely, they

19   get to make that decision, don't they?                   Under the

20   statute, it's their decision whether or not -- you don't

21   get to say, well, this is in your interests, or whether

22   you'd want to spend the money or not.

23              MR. WEST:       No, but I'm responding to the

24   suggestion that there should be some kind of presumption

25   that they would, would decline to authorize this.

 1   That's -- the question you raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is

 2   exactly the question before the Court, whether the State

 3   can, constitutionally can insist that the union obtain

 4   affirmative authorization for this particular type of

 5   speech and for no other type of speech.                 Let me -- let

 6   me suggest --

 7              JUSTICE ALITO:          I still don't understand the

 8   thinking of these hypothetical people.                 If I'm a union

 9   member, I get various benefits.             If I choose not to be a

10   union member, I don't get those benefits.                Why would I

11   choose to give up the benefits of union membership and

12   yet want to allow the union to spend my money for its

13   political purposes?

14              MR. WEST:       Well, maybe Mr. -- Justice Alito,

15   if you knew that what the union was spending its money

16   for was to improve, to increase cost of living

17   adjustments for teachers or to reduce class size for

18   teachers, or to enact tax levies in local school

19   districts --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is this all hypothetical,

21   Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what

22   the people who are non-union members, if they had their

23   druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the

24   union till than we are forced to put there?                Is there

25   any empirical evidence that divides up the universe of

 1   people who don't, deliberately don't join unions?

 2               MR. WEST:      No.      Justice Ginsburg, there's a

 3   lot of speculation on both sides.                I don't think there's

 4   any empirical evidence, but there is plenty of reason to

 5   think that there are many reasons that people choose not

 6   to join the union, whether from a free rider motivation,

 7   whether from just not being a joiner, any variety of

 8   reasons.   Some of them may be --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you're free

10   under this system to send them the same sort of

11   materials you send about your PAC and say we do all

12   sorts of good things with the money from people who opt

13   in, you should opt in.

14               MR. WEST:      Yeah.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But you want to do

16   it without giving them that opportunity.

17               MR. WEST:      Well, the question is whether the

18   State can compel us to, to obtain that authorization for

19   this limited type of speech.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Only if the State has given

21   you the power to exact the money from these people.

22   That changes everything.         If this was money that they

23   had contributed themselves, you'd have a different

24   argument, but the State compels them to give you that

25   money and the State says however, you will not use this

 1   money for this purpose without their consent.

 2              MR. WEST:       It doesn't change everything,

 3   Justice Scalia, precisely for the reasons that you

 4   discussed in your opinion for the court in RAV versus

 5   St. Paul, the St. Paul cross-burning case, where you

 6   pointed out that, that the greater includes the lesser

 7   argument does not apply where you have content

 8   discrimination.   The State could justifiably ban all

 9   symbols and displays that involve fighting words, but it

10   could not single out a particular --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That brings us back to the

12   question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to

13   that I don't think it's content discrimination of the

14   sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government

15   gives money for a particular purpose only and not for

16   other purposes, and I also don't think it's content

17   discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny

18   when the government allows a private organization to use

19   governmental power to exact money from people for a

20   particular purpose only.         That's a different ball game.

21              MR. WEST:       Justice Scalia, imagine, if I may

22   take a little bit starker example, imagine that what the

23   government said in the statute that the union must

24   obtain affirmative authorization if it is going to use

25   agency fee funds to support Democratic candidates, but


                                       44

 1   not if it's going to support Republican candidates.

 2   Obviously it couldn't do that.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            And I see that you've put a

 4   lot of weight on this argument.

 5               MR. WEST:      And that -- it goes further than

 6   this.   That's viewpoint discrimination.                But this is

 7   content discrimination and the Court has held in

 8   Consolidated Edison and a number of other cases that

 9   that is also a constitutional problem.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            What you're saying right

11   now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the

12   word "election."

13               MR. WEST:      Exactly.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            And that has a lot of

15   implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that

16   has nothing to do, I think, with unions.

17               MR. WEST:      Exactly.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            And the lower court didn't

19   consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back

20   for other things such as the State Constitution, for

21   them to consider this matter on remand?

22               MR. WEST:      I think it would be open to them

23   to consider.   I also think it's a matter that when we

24   get to that point at least --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            And I don't know, perhaps

 1   you don't know, what the implication of a decision say

 2   in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign

 3   finance law or California's or some other.

 4              MR. WEST:      Perhaps, but it's certainly true

 5   that on this, at least on this point of the lack of any

 6   compelling justification for restricting entities'

 7   contributions and expenditures in support of or in

 8   opposition to ballot propositions, the law, this Court's

 9   law, is fully clearly on that point.

10              It's our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, that

11   what you have here is a content-based restriction on

12   WEA's ability to engage in political speech on issues of

13   educational policy that are of vital importance to the

14   70,000 teachers that it represents.

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Could the State have a

16   restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all

17   union expenditures that fall within the Abood-Machinist

18   line of cases?

19              MR. WEST:      Yes.        If this were --

20   particularly if this were --

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If this were across the

22   board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting

23   member has, then the statute would be void -- would be

24   valid, rather?

25              MR. WEST:      Certainly if this were done in

 1   the statute that authorized the agency fee in the first

 2   place.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, it's done in this

 4   statute.

 5                MR. WEST:     If it's done in this statute, the

 6   problem that would remain, Justice Kennedy, is this is

 7   an election law that presumably has to be justified on

 8   the basis of whether it promotes the integrity of

 9   elections.   And when you have --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, my hypothetical is

11   that there's a Washington statute or a Washington

12   constitutional referendum provision, initiative

13   provision, which says that as to all protected speech

14   for non- union members who have moneys taken out, there

15   must be affirmative authorization.

16                MR. WEST:     The State could do that, at least

17   if it limited it to the public sector, where the State

18   has the authority to authorize the amount of the agency

19   fee.   I believe the State could do that.               The State

20   could certainly -- some people have talked about the

21   size of the Hudson notice.          The State could impose

22   requirements that the notice be clearer, that it be

23   shorter.   The state could impose that affirmative

24   authorization requirement.          The State could limit the --

 1   the political party saying you can't use it for

 2   Democrats, what if they said, as they might have in the

 3   1940s, you can use it for anybody except communist

 4   candidates?

 5                 MR. WEST:     Well, I think that would be a

 6   problem, too.    And that's --

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Okay.

 8                 MR. WEST:     That would be viewpoint

 9   discriminatory, but here we have a legislative statute

10   that, that it's content discriminatory, that can't be

11   justified as a compelling State interest to promote the

12   integrity of the elections, and we believe the judgment

13   of the Washington Supreme Court should be affirmed.

24   refer to a hypothetical, but allow me to address the

 1   joint appendix at 210-212.           These are the pages covering

 2   the permanent injunction that was entered by the trial

 3   court.    Under that permanent injunction, the WEA shall

 4   return to all agency fee payers who have not

 5   affirmatively authorized the use of their fees for

 6   expenditures, and it lays out the means of doing that.

 7   For the first 2 years there's an agreed-upon amount.

 8   For the next 3 years of the injunction there's another

 9   amount.   But they do get their money back under that

10   injunction.

11                 Referring to the issue of whether they waive

12   or not, under the current process used by the WEA,

13   referring to JA-198, which is the letter sent out on

14   September 15, 2000, by the WEA to the non-members,

15   you'll note the statement, quote:                 "If such written

16   objection has not been postmarked by October 16, 2000,

17   you will waive your ability to object."                  The State of

18   Washington's position is that non-members should not be

19   required to say no twice.           They said no when they chose

20   not to join the union.        The union's position now is,

21   well, we get to use your money for political purposes

22   unless you say no a second time.                That does not seem to

23   be a reasonable default position to take and certainly

 1   Washington seems to think that's fine for everything

 2   other than election expenses.

 3                MR. MCKENNA:          Yes, Your Honor, in terms of

 4   Section 760 the State of Washington does think that's

 5   fine because of the purpose of the statute and the

 6   purpose of Section 760, the purpose being to protect the

 7   integrity of the elections by several different means

 8   involving protecting --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, do you see an

10   underlying constitutional problem as to non-election

11   expenditures that are still political expenditures?

12                MR. MCKENNA:          We don't take a position on

13   whether there's a constitutional problem with regard to

14   non- germane expenditures, Your Honor.                    But we do

15   believe --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Didn't we take one

17   in Abood?

18                MR. MCKENNA:          I'm sorry?

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Didn't we take a

20   position in Abood?

21                MR. MCKENNA:          What I meant was --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I suppose the way

23   the statute works, you have to opt in for the election

24   expenditures, but you have to have a right to opt out

25   for other non-germane.

 1                 MR. MCKENNA:         Yes.       Your Honor, the Chief

 2   Justice is correct, of course.                What I thought the

 3   question was about was the question of whether or not

 4   all, all non-germane expenses must be opt-in, must be

 5   provided.     That's all I meant.             You're absolutely

 6   correct.     Of course, in your decisions opt-out is

 7   satisfactory, and we're not saying that opt-out is not

 8   satisfactory here as far as the State's position is

 9   concerned.     But what we are saying is that the State has

10   the right to impose this additional requirement of

11   affirmative authorization.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            What do you say about his

13   hypothetical involving Democrats versus Republicans?

14                 MR. MCKENNA:         Well, Your Honor, that would

15   certainly seem to be viewpoint discrimination, and it

16   would implicate --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, he says, well, this

18   is content discrimination.            Is that --

19                 MR. MCKENNA:         Your Honor, we do not agree

20   that this is content, content discrimination.               This is

21   content neutral.    760 establishes a procedure, that is

22   to say a requirement that must be met before the money

23   may be used.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, but it's content in

25   the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively

 1   authorized.

 2                 MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, Your Honor, that

 3   additional affirmative authorization does apply to this

 4   category of speech, influencing an election or operating

 5   a political committee.         But we don't believe that it is

 6   problematic constitutionally any more than the argument

 7   of Taxpayers With Representations in the Reagan case

 8   was, where they argued that they had a constitutional

 9   right to receive tax deductible contributions and use

10   them for lobbying.      The Court found to the contrary.

11   And indeed, Initiative 134 is about protecting

12   individuals.    It's about protecting individuals in

13   Section 760.    It says in the intent section --

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can I just go back to, you

15   mentioned my question.

16                 MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, sir.

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Your point of your answer

18   to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint

19   discrimination would be impermissible, but the content

20   discrimination is permissible?

21                 MR. MCKENNA:         If it is content

22   discrimination, Your Honor, we believe it is

23   permissible, yes, sir.         And if it were viewpoint -- in

24   the hypothetical, if there were viewpoint discrimination

25   that would not implicate any constitutional right of the

 1   union, but it may very well implicate the Southworth

 2   interests of the non-member fee payers.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is it content?   I

 4   mean, it doesn't say which way you're trying to

 5   influence the election.

 6               MR. MCKENNA:         We don't believe it is

 7   content-based, Your Honor.          As I said, we don't believe

 8   it is, because it's any election of any kind.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, the content means a

10   category of speech as opposed to what is the political

11   position you're taking.

12               MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, that is it's only in

13   regard to influencing elections or operating a political

14   committee, which is a second.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But I thought that that

16   was content.   You could do it, say, in the press, but

17   you couldn't do it over the air.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's my understanding,

19   too.   I think you got to get out of it some other way.

20   I mean, you've got to say it's content but it doesn't

21   apply when it's the government contributing money or it

22   doesn't apply when you're applying it to money that's

23   being coerced by the government.

24               MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, Your Honor.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            If that's yes, then the

 1   category here is election speech.                  If you're going to

 2   call a statute that treats election speech especially,

 3   then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in

 4   that category.   And if you're going to use that

 5   distinction to say strict scrutiny applies, then strict

 6   scrutiny would apply to all campaign finance regulation.

 7   And courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny

 8   to campaign finance regulation because there are speech

 9   interests on both sides of the equation.

10              MR. MCKENNA:            Yes, Your Honor.        Of course,

11   we believe that --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:               I'm glad you said yes to me

13   because that implies a no to the last question.

14              (Laughter.)

15              MR. MCKENNA:            Yes, Your Honor, I understand

16   your question.

17              (Laughter.)

18              MR. MCKENNA:            And we believe that -- we

19   believe of course that Section 760 is not subject to

20   strict scrutiny, it is subject at most to a rationale

21   basis; and that clearly there is a rationale basis for

22   the State in this case to require the affirmative

23   authorization of non-member fee payers.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Can you get to the point

25   you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing

 1   is?

 2                MR. MCKENNA:        Well, yes, Your Honor.          Your

 3   Honor, the Supreme Court of Washington found a purpose

 4   of the entire law, Initiative 134, to be to protect

 5   election integrity.     But 760 is one means of achieving

 6   that purpose by means of protecting individual

 7   interests.   Similarly, Section 680 of this law, which, I

 8   apologize, is not in the joint appendix, but it's RCW

 9   4217-680, which requires positive checkoff before an

10   employer may deduct PAC contributions for any employee.

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:           May I just -- I'm sorry.

12   May I just take you back to the point of the objective

13   being protection of election integrity.                 As I understand

14   it, so far as the protection of election integrity is

15   concerned, with respect to these contributions, that is

16   simply the obverse side or the flip side, if you will,

17   of protecting the right of the dissenting union member

18   or the non-joined -- strike that -- the non-union

19   worker, to control the use of the funds that would be

20   used for the political purposes.               The one is simply the

21   obverse of the other.      Do you agree?

22                MR. MCKENNA:        Yes, Your Honor.         We believe

23   they are two sides of the same coin.

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So by articulating that the

25   election integrity is a purpose, the Washington Supreme


                                       55

 1   Court should not be understood as excluding the

 2   protection of the non-member workers' interests?

 3              MR. MCKENNA:         Yes, Your Honor.          I would

 4   agree.

 5              Thank you.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, General.

 7              The case is submitted.
