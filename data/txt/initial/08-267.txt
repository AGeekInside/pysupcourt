 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll hear argument

 4   this morning in Case 08-267, United States v. Denedo.

 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. SHAH:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,

11   or CAAF, held that military appellate courts possess

12   open-ended jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to

13   entertain a coram nobis challenge to the merits of a

14   final court-martial conviction.               This Court should

15   reverse that decision, both because the All Writs Act

16   cannot supply jurisdiction that Congress chose not to

17   confer and because Respondent is a civilian who may no

18   longer invoke the military court system.

19               As this Court explained in Clinton v.

20   Goldsmith, military courts, as Article I courts, are

21   strictly limited to the bases of jurisdiction conferred

22   upon them by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or

23   UCMJ.   Three related aspects of the UCMJ make clear that

24   it does not confer jurisdiction over Respondent's coram

25   nobis petition.

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 First, as noted in Goldsmith, the UCMJ

 2   narrowly circumscribes military appellate jurisdiction

 3   to the findings and sentences of a court-martial

 4   conviction.    That is a direct review jurisdiction.              UCMJ

 5   Articles 66 and 67, which define appellate jurisdiction,

 6   do not contemplate any further review within the

 7   military appellate courts.

 8                 Second, once direct appellate review is

 9   complete and the military authority executes the

10   judgment, UCMJ Article 76 affirmatively forecloses any

11   further military court review.               As this Court has

12   recognized on two prior occasions, UCMJ Article 76 marks

13   the terminal point of proceedings within the

14   court-martial system.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Shah, how does that

16   differ from the general rule that a judgment becomes

17   final and has preclusive effect once the appellate route

18   has been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired?

19   It seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule

20   that applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil

21   cases, stating when a judgment becomes final for

22   preclusion purposes.

23                 MR. SHAH:     Your Honor, yes, Article 76 does

24   that, but it does more than that.                 As this Court

25   recognized in Gusik and in Councilman, it marks the end


                                         4

 1   of proceedings within the military court system.

 2              Now, beyond the text, what this Court looked

 3   at in Gusik -- in Gusik, it was a Petitioner seeking

 4   habeas review.    One of his alternative arguments in

 5   Gusik was that Article 76 essentially violated the

 6   Suspension Clause because it -- it marked the end of --

 7   no further proceedings within the military court system

 8   as well as within the Article III court system.                  The

 9   Court agreed with the Petitioner that Article 76 marked

10   the end of any further proceedings within the military

11   court system.    It disagreed that it also effected a

12   repeal of Article III habeas jurisdiction, but there was

13   no disagreement between the Petitioner, the government,

14   and this Court in Gusik that it did mark the end of

15   proceedings within the military court system.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:               So therefore one could say

17   that that point wasn't decided in the case, right?

18              MR. SHAH:        Well, Your Honor, one could say

19   that, but this Court again in Councilman ratified that

20   line that the Court drew in Gusik.                  It -- it reiterated

21   the reasoning that Article 76 forecloses any further

22   proceedings within the military court system.                  So I

23   don't think it's just dicta.             It was relevant to its

24   denial of the Suspension Clause claim, and the Court

25   reiterated that in Councilman 25 years later.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Where in your view, in

 2   that the government is putting forward, can this -- can

 3   Denedo go?   He said, I was misinformed by my counsel.                 I

 4   never would have entered a plea if I had known I would

 5   be subject to deportation.           And he said, I never found

 6   out about it until what, 8 years later, when the

 7   government -- 8 years after his conviction, the

 8   government said, you're subject to deportation.              Where

 9   can he go with that plea?

10                MR. SHAH:      Your Honor, it appears that

11   Respondent no longer has any further remedies to -- to

12   pursue.   But we think the important point is that in a

13   general -- in the general case, Petitioner is bringing

14   -- the exact same claim the Respondent is bringing is

15   normally going to have several avenues of remedy outside

16   --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             We're assuming now,

18   because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that

19   he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in

20   failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by

21   the government's action, so he was unaware and,

22   therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier.                 You

23   have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just

24   out of any court.

25                MR. SHAH:      Well, Your Honor, I think it's

 1   important to note that the UCMJ marks the high-water

 2   mark of process within the military justice system.

 3   What the UCMJ did is it took the prior system, which

 4   didn't even allow for real direct review within the

 5   military court system, and it made that direct review

 6   system much more robust.         It added an intermediate court

 7   of review.   It took administrative review that was

 8   embodied within boards of tribunals that had typically

 9   been under the Judge Advocate General.                   It moved that

10   out and gave it greater independence to provide more

11   robust intermediate appellate review.                   It added an

12   entire level of a new court, the Court of Appeals for

13   the Armed Forces, which provided additional -- a new

14   level of review.   And then it said still --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, part -- part of

16   independence is the assurance that the court has the

17   ability to do justice in the case before it, and I think

18   the purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect

19   the integrity of the court, and that's all this court is

20   asking.   So that's quite consistent with what you've

21   just said.

22                MR. SHAH:     Well -- well, Your Honor, in

23   enacting the UCMJ, Congress was balancing several

24   values.   On the one hand, it was balancing the rights of

25   service members, but at the same time, it was balancing


                                        7

 1   the important value of maintaining good order and

 2   discipline within the armed -- within the armed forces,

 3   mindful of the military's primary mission in fighting

 4   wars and defending the nation.

 5                Now, given those competing values, it was --

 6   it was reasonable for Congress to draw a line at some

 7   point and say it, the conviction is final and to the

 8   extent you want to seek further collateral review you

 9   have to go to the civilian system to seek that review.

10   That -- that line is reasonable not only from a

11   historical standpoint, but also from a practical

12   standpoint, given the institutional limitations --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But is there collateral

14   review available in the civilian system in your view?

15                MR. SHAH:     Yes, as a general matter there's

16   --

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I mean in this case.

18                MR. SHAH:     In this case, Respondent no

19   longer has any reviews because the time has passed.

20   2241 would --

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:           So the answer is no in

22   this case?

23                MR. SHAH:     No, there is no further review,

24   Your Honor, in this case.          Now, as a general matter

25   there are ample avenues of review within the civilian

 1   court system.   For the entire time that a Petitioner

 2   would be confined, he can seek 2241 habeas relief in the

 3   Federal court system.        Even after --

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. Shah, you just said

 5   something about -- you answered my question and Justice

 6   Stevens' question:      This person is out because it's too

 7   late for him.   He was convicted in what, was it --

 8              MR. SHAH:         1998, Your Honor.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Yes.          And the government

10   never said anything about deportation until 2006?                      And

11   they went through -- he twice applied for

12   naturalization, is that correct?

13              MR. SHAH:         That is correct, Your Honor.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                And he was turned down on

15   grounds that had nothing to do with deportation.                      The

16   government never alerted him to the possibility that he

17   would be deportable.        They turned down his application

18   with no hint of that, and you say that he is -- he's out

19   of time, but nothing counts against the government

20   because of that 8-year lapse?

21              MR. SHAH:         Right.         Your Honor, in the

22   denials I agree with you that they did not alert him to

23   deportation, but it based its denials on his military

24   court convictions.      So to that extent he was somewhat on

25   notice that the military court convictions were posing a

 1   problem to his citizenship, potential citizenship

 2   status.

 3                Now, it is true, you're absolutely right,

 4   that the government did not begin deportation

 5   proceedings until October 2006, and until that time he

 6   was not on notice, but the fact that this particular

 7   claimant -- that the time has run should not be

 8   dispositive.    For example --

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, the time -- I mean,

10   the time may very well run in the civil system, and yet

11   I take it that under -- you accept Morgan and in the

12   Article III system this -- in comparable circumstances,

13   this Petitioner could seek coram nobis.

14                MR. SHAH:      Right.         There are two reasons,

15   Your Honor --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            And I take it you also -- I

17   don't think there's any dispute that the All Writs Act

18   applies to the Article I court as well as to the Article

19   III court.   And I take it -- and I would like your

20   response to this.    I take it you accept the fact that in

21   testimony before the House, at least, at the time the

22   present system went into effect the general counsel for

23   the Department of Defense, Mr. Taft, testified to a

24   House committee that coram nobis would be available in

25   the -- in the Article I courts.               And if that is so,

 1   isn't the kind of the most reasonable way to construe

 2   the statute, including Article 76, as allowing for this?

 3                MR. SHAH:     No, Your Honor.              Mr. Taft's

 4   testimony that you're referring to was not given at the

 5   time of enacting of the UCMJ.

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:           What was the occasion for

 7   it?

 8                MR. SHAH:     That was during a subsequent

 9   amending process of the act.

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:           What were they amending at

11   the time?

12                MR. SHAH:     It was I think it was in terms of

13   the 1983 amendments to the UCMJ.               There have been

14   several --

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:           You're way ahead of me

16   because I don't know what the '83 amendments would refer

17   to.   What was the subject matter?

18                MR. SHAH:     Okay.        Well, what Mr. Taft was

19   testifying to, we believe, are -- he was -- the specific

20   testimony that Mr. Taft was giving was related to the

21   boards of correction, I believe, and whether that the

22   boards of correction should retain jurisdiction review

23   of final court-martial judgments, so his testimony was

24   related to that distinct issue.

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Now, with respect to the


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   boards of correction, I take it there's nothing

 2   specifically in the statute that says there's coram

 3   nobis jurisdiction?

 4              MR. SHAH:       Nothing specific in the UCMJ?

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

 6              MR. SHAH:       There's nothing specific in the

 7   UCMJ --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Now, if he was right about

 9   that, that would undercut your argument that, with

10   respect to a special court-martial and subsequent

11   proceedings, there could be no coram nobis because

12   there's no specific reference in the statute in either

13   case?

14              MR. SHAH:       No, Your Honor.             What Mr. Taft

15   was testifying to was the state of the prevailing law in

16   1983 before the CAAF.      The fact that Congress did not

17   amend the UCMJ in light of Mr. Taft's testimony -- this

18   Court has said on multiple occasions that we don't read

19   into congressional silence --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Oh, I quite agree.        The

21   premise of my -- sort of my argument to you a second ago

22   was that if we accept the proposition that Mr. Taft was

23   making a correct statement of law --

24              MR. SHAH:       Right.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- then the logic would in

 1   effect answer your argument that because there is no

 2   specific grant of coram nobis jurisdiction with respect

 3   to special court-martials and subsequent proceedings,

 4   there couldn't be any.        That's the only point that I was

 5   trying to make.

 6                MR. SHAH:      Your Honor, I don't think we can

 7   read that into the silence, and here's why.              We have

 8   much more precise legislative history on this very

 9   point.    At the time the provision was enacted, at the

10   time the UCMJ was enacted, there was Article 73 of the

11   UCMJ provides one means of collateral review within the

12   military justice system once a court-martial conviction

13   is final, and that's a new trial petition, which is

14   limited to certain subject matter and certain time

15   limits.

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            It is pretty limited.   What

17   is it, it's limited to fact and fraud.

18                MR. SHAH:      To fraud on the court and newly

19   discovered evidence.

20                The person who drafted that provision --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is it available to

22   someone who enters a guilty plea?

23                MR. SHAH:      It does not appear it would be

24   available to someone who has entered a guilty plea.                The

25   government is not aware of any cases where the military

 1   has granted an Article 73 petition to someone who has

 2   pled guilty.

 3                 But the important point is at the time that

 4   provision was enacted, the person who drafted that

 5   provision testified before Congress and said, we've

 6   considered the universe of post-conviction remedies, and

 7   specifically named coram nobis relief, and said that

 8   we've looked at it and we think the only circumstances

 9   that warrant appeal within the military court system

10   beyond coram nobis are those stated within or including

11   coram nobis are those stated within Article 73

12   specifically.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I ask you just -- and

14   I'm doing this from memory, so my premise of the

15   question may be wrong.         But I do recall the quotation of

16   testimony in the brief, and I -- if I recall it

17   correctly, the person testifying said that the 73 was

18   sort of a combination of coram nobis and new -- and new

19   trial motion practice.         But my recollection was that

20   there was no statement, or at least it wasn't quoted in

21   the briefs, to the effect that this is all there is.

22                 Now, there was -- it was explaining what 73

23   did, but it was not an explanation to the effect that if

24   you didn't get under the tent flap in 73 you were out

25   completely.     Am I correct about that?

 1               MR. SHAH:       Well, I'll read the testimony to

 2   you, Justice Souter.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

 4               MR. SHAH:       And this appears on pages 25 to

 5   26 of the government's brief, and it says:                   "What we did

 6   was to combine what amounts to a writ of error coram

 7   nobis with a motion for a new trial on newly discovered

 8   evidence.   We have provided for both of them and to our

 9   minds they are the only additional circumstances over

10   and above the appeal that need a remedy."

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay, I see.

12               MR. SHAH:       So I think that's conclusive on

13   this point and provides a firm ground on which to

14   distinguish this Court's decision in Morgan, which you

15   referenced earlier, that applies coram nobis in the

16   Article III system.      Congress considered it for the

17   Article I system and rejected it in the military courts.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:           Does that mean that your

19   argument boils down to the proposition that the relevant

20   provisions of the UCMJ were intended to eliminate coram

21   nobis, or is there more to your argument than that?

22               MR. SHAH:       I don't think it's to eliminate

23   coram nobis.    It was never available within the military

24   court system.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:           All right.          Well, then I'm

 1   not quite sure I understand your argument.                       Maybe you

 2   can explain why you contend that if the Respondent had

 3   been convicted in a Federal district court and

 4   everything else was the same, he would be able to

 5   petition for a writ of coram nobis, but he can't in the

 6   military courts.     What is the basis for that?                    Both a

 7   Federal district court -- a Federal district court is a

 8   creature of statute.        It has the jurisdiction that

 9   Congress gives it and no greater jurisdiction.                       It has

10   certain what's been termed inherent authority.                       The All

11   Writs Act applies to it.           All of those things are true

12   of the military courts as well.                So what is the basis

13   for the distinction?

14                 MR. SHAH:      There are two distinctions, at

15   least two distinctions, Your Honor.                       The first is in the

16   Federal court system there is an independent basis of

17   jurisdiction when someone is bringing a Federal

18   constitutional challenge, collateral challenge to their

19   conviction.     That separate independent basis of

20   jurisdiction is 1331.        There is -- there is independent

21   basis of jurisdiction.         The All Writs Act does not

22   confer jurisdiction.        The Court made that very clear in

23   Goldsmith.    What it requires is an independent basis of

24   jurisdiction.     That exists in Article III courts.                    It

25   does not exist in the military court system.                       That's the

 1   first distinction.

 2                 The second distinction, Your Honor, even if

 3   this Court wasn't convinced by that jurisdictional

 4   argument, is that Congress specifically considered

 5   whether to -- to allow coram nobis petitions within the

 6   military court system.         The All Writs Act was designed

 7   to be a residual source of authority to fill gaps within

 8   the system.    It is not --

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well -- well, that, as I

10   understand, was the argument I started out with:                That

11   the --Your argument is that the UCMJ was intended to

12   eliminate coram nobis if it had been previously

13   available.    That's your -- that's the argument you're

14   making now?

15                 MR. SHAH:      Well, again, I would -- I would

16   quibble with the characterization to -- to -- that it

17   was previously available.            As of the enactment of the

18   UCMJ in 1950, coram nobis relief had never been

19   available within the military justice system.

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what is the difference

21   on the face -- on their face between the relevant

22   provisions of the UCMJ and the provisions that govern

23   the ability of a criminal defendant in Federal district

24   court to get relief after being convicted?                There are

25   limited avenues that are provided under the Rules of

 1   Criminal Procedure and under the statutes --

 2                 MR. SHAH:     Right.         Right.

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:         -- just as there are in the

 4   UCMJ.   What -- what is the difference?

 5                 MR. SHAH:     The difference is significant,

 6   Your Honor.    In the -- in the military court system

 7   there is only one avenue for post-conviction relief.

 8   That is, after your -- and I'm speaking after your

 9   direct review -- appellate review process has been

10   complete, there's only one, and that is the Article 73

11   new trial petition.       Of course, in -- in the Article III

12   system there are several independent grants of

13   jurisdiction, the habeas jurisdiction --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought the Morgan

15   case said that coram nobis was not dependent on any

16   independent basis of jurisdiction.                  Didn't the Court say

17   that a coram nobis application challenging a conviction

18   is a step in the criminal case and not like habeas,

19   where relief is sought in a separate case and record,

20   the beginning of a separate proceeding?

21                 MR. SHAH:     Right.         In -- in Morgan, Your

22   Honor, the Court was refuting the argument that 2255,

23   section 2255, occupied the field and, therefore there

24   wouldn't be a coram nobis petition.                      It rejected that

25   argument.   But I don't think the rejection of that

 1   argument means that coram nobis, which is still a

 2   residual source of authority, is available when Congress

 3   has specifically rejected its application within the

 4   Article I system.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but -- but you're

 6   shifting ground a little bit.              The tenor of the

 7   questions from Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg really

 8   is to the effect:    Does coram nobis require an

 9   independent source of -- of jurisdiction?                And I should

10   think not.

11                MR. SHAH:      Well, your --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The whole idea of coram

13   nobis is to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction

14   the court already has.

15                MR. SHAH:      Your Honor, this Court could not

16   have been clearer in Goldsmith.               It says the All Writs

17   Act requires an independent basis, an existing

18   independent basis of jurisdiction.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I -- I acknowledge that.

20   But there is a source of jurisdiction here.               Coram nobis

21   is to ensure the accurate exercise of jurisdiction that

22   the court has earlier asserted.

23                MR. SHAH:      With respect, Your Honor, I would

24   argue that the past jurisdiction in this case does not

25   constitute an existing basis of jurisdiction.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But suppose -- suppose that

 2   the problem was a professional soldier convicted a

 3   certain number of years ago of a particular crime, a few

 4   years later through some amazing mistake they wrote the

 5   wrong number down.      The clerk just wrote the wrong

 6   number of the code provision.               That's all.

 7                 MR. SHAH:      Okay.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And it made it a felony

 9   instead.   It was actually a misdemeanor.                 What's he

10   supposed to do?     I mean, normally you go back to the

11   Court and say:    Judge, you know, they just made --

12   everyone admits it's a simple transcribing error.                     Would

13   you please correct it?         Now, how -- how is that supposed

14   to work in the military?

15                 MR. SHAH:      If he is still within custody --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      No, he's -- he's

17   finished his sentence.         This is several years ago.             They

18   just now discovered it, and it could affect him in the

19   future that it happened in fact to be a misdemeanor he

20   was convicted of.     But the -- the code section they

21   wrote down is a felony.

22                 MR. SHAH:      Well, if the military isn't

23   willing to correct that sort of error on its own as an

24   administrative matter and that he needs some judicial

25   forum to --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      Yes, that's right.

 2               MR. SHAH:      -- to get relief, he can go to

 3   the Court of Federal Claims and bring a Tucker Act

 4   action.   There is a 6-year statute of limitations.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, this is 7 years.

 6               (Laughter.)

 7               MR. SHAH:      Well -- well, then, Your Honor,

 8   he probably wouldn't have a judicial forum.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            He can't even do that.         So

10   nobody in the military, in fact, once their thing is

11   final -- then it has nothing to do with it, in your

12   view, that he has left the military?

13               MR. SHAH:      Well --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            You are saying -- you are

15   saying, whether you are in the military, whether you are

16   out of the military, no matter how egregious, no matter

17   how obvious, there is no route for a military person, a

18   professional, to go and get an obvious error corrected

19   if -- if he has missed the statute, that there was an --

20   the civil statute of limitations, it's hard for him to

21   go to the Tucker Act.      He's been in the Philippines the

22   entire time.

23               MR. SHAH:      Justice Breyer, to make your

24   hypothetical work he has to no longer be in custody.                  He

25   has had to have discovered this error 6 years after the

 1   conviction has happened.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, it happened.       It

 3   really happened.

 4                MR. SHAH:     The military would have had to

 5   deny this -- correcting his --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           What I'm trying to do is

 7   suggest that I think you -- I can't quite decide what

 8   stool you want to rest on.          Part of this you say, well,

 9   he's a civilian that has left the military.                 And then I

10   read that.   It seems to have nothing to do with it.                   But

11   your other argument seems to be that doesn't matter.

12                MR. SHAH:     Well --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           No military soldier can

14   correct an error, no matter how egregious, even a

15   technical -- you know, they just wrote the wrong thing

16   down, because Congress didn't want them to.                 Now, I

17   doubt that Congress thought about that.                 I'm just not

18   sure they didn't want them to.

19                MR. SHAH:     Well -- well, Your Honor, once

20   again, your hypothetical, I think there would be an

21   administrative recourse there.              And, of course, there's

22   always the fail-safe of a presidential pardon if the

23   obvious -- if the error is that obvious and that

24   egregious.

25                Now, you did refer to a second argument,


                                       22

 1   which is an independent argument, which is that the

 2   military courts lack jurisdiction for the independent

 3   reason that Respondent -- it's an independent reason,

 4   Your Honor, that he lacks any remaining connection to

 5   the armed forces and, therefore, cannot invoke the

 6   military courts.    This Court held in Toth v. Quarrels

 7   that Congress lacks power under Article I to extend

 8   military court jurisdiction over a civilian.

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I know, but that's --

10   that's a different -- that's a different issue from --

11   from whether it -- it may retain some residual

12   jurisdiction to correct an error with respect to someone

13   over whom it has had jurisdiction.

14                MR. SHAH:      Your Honor, once again, that

15   would be relying on the long-expired past jurisdiction.

16   It is --

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, you -- you made that

18   point before.    And I -- I want to follow up with one

19   question on that.    As I recall, it was in response to

20   the -- to the Morgan argument.               The -- the Morgan

21   analysis was, well, this isn't a -- a new ground or a

22   new assertion.   It is jurisdiction as would be the case

23   in habeas.   It, in effect, is -- is kind of a

24   metaphysical continuation of the -- the jurisdiction

25   that existed before.


                                        23

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               And your response to that was, in effect, a

 2   Goldsmith response.       And -- and you said past

 3   jurisdiction doesn't mean present jurisdiction.                  The

 4   past jurisdiction is over, and that's under -- under the

 5   statute and under Goldsmith that's -- that's the end of

 6   it.

 7               Couldn't that same argument simply have been

 8   made, however, in -- in Morgan?                In other words, Morgan

 9   was a case in which the point of finality had been

10   reached.   There was no specific statute in Morgan saying

11   there's coram nobis jurisdiction, and yet the Court's

12   analysis -- I -- I called it metaphysical a second ago

13   -- was that this really was simply a continuation of the

14   past jurisdiction.      If that was a sound argument in

15   Morgan, why isn't it a sound argument with respect to

16   the -- the military code here?

17               MR. SHAH:        Well, because the military --

18   Congress specifically contemplated that possibility, and

19   now I'm going back to my Article 73 argument, Your

20   Honor, and to the legislative history which shows what

21   Congress was trying to do in Article 73.                  That is, to

22   encapsulate whatever post-conviction remedy it's

23   intended to be available within the military court

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           It -- it did do that, and

 2   there's -- there is no question that it certainly made

 3   finality provisions in Article 76.                  But in the civilian

 4   system, so far as express provision is concerned, there

 5   are limits.    There are statutes of limitations, and it

 6   seems to me that the same argument could be made there

 7   that was made here --

 8                 MR. SHAH:     Well, I think this --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- that was made there.

10                 MR. SHAH:     Your Honor, I think the structure

11   of the military court system is different than the

12   civilian system, and -- and that goes back to --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Outside of 1531, is there

14   any structural difference?

15                 MR. SHAH:     Yes, Your Honor.             In the military

16   court system, Article 76, even though it was first

17   enacted in 19 -- in 1950, there were other provisions

18   analogous to it.    It's always been understood within the

19   military system that once a conviction was final and the

20   military authority executed the judgment, that was it in

21   terms of review within the military justice system, save

22   for a presidential pardon.           Any further relief to be

23   obtained was through an Article III habeas petition in

24   the Federal courts.       That's the understanding that

25   Congress had when it enacted the UCMJ, and that's the


                                        25

 1   understanding --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:               You could say the same

 3   thing, that when the statute of limitations is passed in

 4   a habeas case or, indeed, after habeas has been fallen,

 5   so far as the statutes governing Article III courts are

 6   concerned, that's the end.            And yet Morgan says, no, it

 7   isn't the end.     There's this coram nobis jurisdiction.

 8              MR. SHAH:         Well, the difference is in

 9   Morgan, the Court specifically said that Congress did

10   not intend to occupy the field when it passed 2255

11   governing habeas relief for Federal prisoners.                      That's

12   not the situation here.          We know that Congress intended

13   to occupy the field when it passed Article 73.

14              So regardless of the jurisdictional

15   arguments, Your Honor, there's no right of action,

16   there's no right of coram nobis relief within the

17   military courts.

18              Your Honor, if there are no further

19   questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my

20   time for rebuttal.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

22              MR. SHAH:         Thank you.

 1               MR. FREEDUS:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3               Because there are courts, appellate military

 4   courts must have coram nobis power to protect the

 5   integrity of their judgments.              The court of appeals

 6   correctly asserted the same coram nobis power that

 7   Article III courts have.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             What do you mean, "they

 9   must"?   Do you think it's unconstitutional to deprive

10   them of that?

11               MR. FREEDUS:          No, Your Honor.        We believe

12   that they were given the All Writs Act authority as a

13   birth right in 1950, and that includes all prerogative

14   writs, including coram nobis.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's what you mean by

16   "they must have"?

17               MR. FREEDUS:          And also, Your Honor, they

18   must have the ability to protect the integrity of their

19   judgments just like other Federal courts have.                The

20   superior court in D.C. has the power to issue coram

21   nobis to protect its judgments.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's fine, but -- but is

23   it unconstitutional for Congress to say military courts

24   are different, they've always been different, the need

25   for finality is greater there, and we're conducting a


                                        27

 1   different rule for there?

 2              MR. FREEDUS:         I think Congress has the

 3   authority to legislate very broadly in the area of

 4   collateral remedies, and Congress could take away the

 5   writ of coram nobis if it left in its place an adequate

 6   and effective substitute, like it did in 2255.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, oh, oh, so it would be

 8   unconstitutional if they did not leave in its place an

 9   adequate and effective substitute --

10              MR. FREEDUS:         Our view is that if --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- which would cover every

12   situation no matter how fanciful, right?

13              MR. FREEDUS:         No, Your Honor.          We believe

14   there has to be reasonable opportunity to bring a

15   colorable constitutional claim for which there is no

16   other avenue of relief, which we believe is the case

17   here.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What -- which case

19   of ours establishes the proposition that there always

20   has to be an available avenue of relief?

21              MR. FREEDUS:         The best authority we have for

22   that, Your Honor, is Webster v. Doe, which we believe

23   stands for the proposition that courts should read

24   statutes so as not to preclude judicial review of a

25   constitutional claim absent an express congressional


                                      28

 1   intent to do so --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, that's

 3   different than saying there always has to be available

 4   relief.    That's saying you think Congress usually

 5   intends there to be available relief.                     And that would be

 6   a doubtful assumption here, given the rather clear

 7   expressions of finality that -- that are -- that are in

 8   the UCMJ statutes.

 9                MR. FREEDUS:          On -- well, if I could make

10   two points, Your Honor.          On the first, we don't believe

11   that there is square authority for the bedrock

12   constitutional proposition that Congress can wipe away

13   all avenues of relief for a claim.                   We believe that we

14   were --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You don't -- you

16   don't think there's authority for the proposition they

17   can do it?

18                MR. FREEDUS:          Correct.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I'm looking for

20   authority that says they can't do it.

21                MR. FREEDUS:          I'm not aware of any, Your

22   Honor.    We would -- I think we are --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Did -- did coram nobis

24   relief -- you say it has to be there.                     Was it ever used

25   before in the military courts?

 1               MR. FREEDUS:          Yes.       I would like to -- yes,

 2   Your Honor, it has been used since 1966.                 I assume you

 3   may be asking about before 1950.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Indeed, yes.

 5               MR. FREEDUS:          Yes.       Well, the reason it

 6   hasn't happened before 1950 is that the UCMJ was created

 7   in 1950, and that was the first time there were military

 8   courts.   There were no courts, so therefore no All Writs

 9   Act authority prior to 1950.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Worse still.     My goodness.

11   So you were --

12               MR. FREEDUS:          Absolutely.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- convicted by a

14   court-martial and had no basis for -- for getting that

15   revised, and that -- that lasted for a couple of hundred

16   years, right?    And that was okay or it wasn't okay?

17               MR. FREEDUS:          That was -- I think that's the

18   impetus behind the UCMJ, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, that's fine.     I mean,

20   you can patch it up and say that they thought it wasn't

21   a good idea to have just military courts.                But it's very

22   hard to make the constitutional argument you're making

23   when for a couple hundred years in military, in military

24   courts, which are different, there -- there was no

25   relief at all.

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Will you clarify something

 2   for me.    Are you contending that the result you seek is

 3   constitutionally compelled?             I didn't think you were.

 4                 MR. FREEDUS:        Not -- no, not -- we aren't,

 5   Your Honor.    I was more responding to the Chief

 6   Justice's --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you were saying it is.

 8   Just say, no, it's not constitutionally compelled and

 9   I'll be happy.

10                 (Laughter.)

11                 MR. FREEDUS:        No, Your Honor.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You might say that there

14   is a lurking constitutional question and that we ought

15   to interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional

16   concern.

17                 MR. FREEDUS:        I think, Your Honor, that's

18   the best answer that I should have given.

19                 (Laughter.)

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I don't like it very

21   much.

22                 But what is -- your argument is that the

23   Constitution does not require that this person have,

24   right now, an available avenue of relief, your position?

25                 MR. FREEDUS:        We don't have square authority

 1   from this Court to support that proposition.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So then it comes, as

 3   Justice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not

 4   we should read the statutes here in a particular way to

 5   avoid confronting that question?

 6                MR. FREEDUS:        Yes, Your Honor, I think

 7   where -- we're comfortably in that neck of the woods and

 8   we really don't need to get closer to the scarier

 9   question that was alluded to.             I think --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           When you say it's lurking,

11   you're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional

12   avoidance?

13                MR. FREEDUS:        Yes, Your Honor, we are.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Okay.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't think it's much of

16   a lurk when for 200 years this was going on.                It's not

17   lurking to my mind.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you are making -- I

19   thought that the core of your argument is that the All

20   Writs Act applies to all courts established by Congress,

21   the military courts are included in that definition, and

22   there is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it

23   doesn't apply to the military.              But the All Writs Act

24   requires that the writ be in aid of the court's

25   jurisdiction.   So if you would spell out how the writ

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   here is in aid of the military court's jurisdiction.

 2              MR. FREEDUS:          Yes, Your Honor.            We believe

 3   it does it in a very similar way that this Court

 4   explained in the United States v. Morgan, and that is

 5   the writ of coram nobis aids the past appellate

 6   jurisdiction that the Navy court had when it affirmed

 7   and reviewed Mr. Denedo's conviction.                   It had

 8   jurisdiction there.

 9              And the coram nobis writ by its very nature

10   allows a court to correct an error in a case that was

11   before it, but it failed to perceive that error while it

12   had the case before it.        And had it known the facts we

13   now know after all the remedies are no longer available,

14   the Court would not have issued the judgment that it

15   issued.

16              That's the -- in that sense, that's how the

17   writ aids the jurisdiction the Court had in the past.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, if that's so, then I

19   guess you can have courts reviewing the civilians.                  They

20   will review after the event the court-martial

21   jurisdiction, the court-martials of people while they

22   were in the military.      That will become a matter of

23   course anytime.   I mean, there are many, many errors.

24   We have approximately 5,000 petitions a year claiming

25   some kind of constitutional error, and sometime they're

 1   right.

 2              MR. FREEDUS:         Yes, sir.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            So that's what you foresee?

 4              MR. FREEDUS:         I would -- yes and no.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            What way is it no?

 6              MR. FREEDUS:         No is when the individual is

 7   not in custody and the six-year statute of limitations

 8   has expired for all the types of claims that are

 9   available for collateral tactic of a court-martial

10   conviction, a declaratory judgment attack, a mandamus

11   attack, Court of Federal Claims attack, all those --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            Why -- in other words, in

13   the case I posed, he would -- he -- in your view, he

14   wouldn't have any remedy, you would agree with the

15   government about that, if it's seven years later you

16   find a clerical error?

17              MR. FREEDUS:         We agree.              But we don't think

18   it's necessary, actually, to decide the issue here.                    The

19   issue here really is whether coram nobis is --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if, in fact, you're

21   waiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all

22   jurisdiction because the statute of limitations has

23   expired, why do you need this?             Why can't they just go

24   -- I mean, why do you need this special thing that

25   hasn't existed for 200 years?            Why don't they just go to

 1   a civil case?   And moreover, why doesn't your client

 2   fall within that situation?

 3              You're claiming that if all the statutes

 4   have run and everything, there is no coram nobis

 5   jurisdiction, I thought in your case they had all run.

 6              MR. FREEDUS:          This gets to the other piece

 7   of the answer I was trying to give, and that is a

 8   petitioner from the military system could not file a

 9   coram nobis petition in the Article III courts or the

10   Court of Federal Claims because there's no authority

11   that supports the proposition that you can take a coram

12   nobis petition and attack a judgment from a different

13   jurisdiction.   Coram nobis has to allow the court that

14   issued -- that -- that --

15              JUSTICE BREYER:             Then you're saying that

16   what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis,

17   indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was

18   in it can bring constitutional challenges?

19              MR. FREEDUS:          Yes, Your Honor, in the

20   military justice system.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes, okay, and we see those

22   every day, don't we?      But there is one difference.           The

23   difference is that often, though not always, a person in

24   habeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system

25   conviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the

 2   retried.     So in fact the difference would be, in your

 3   view, the civilians who bring this would never be

 4   retried if they're right.

 5                 MR. FREEDUS:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And so they would have in

 7   that sense greater protection in the military system

 8   than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in

 9   habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not

10   always there.    Now, why would Congress have intended

11   that?

12                 MR. FREEDUS:         I think it's the very nature

13   of the coram nobis petition, Your Honor, and that is

14   coram nobis petitioners have already served their entire

15   sentence, so the societal interest to seek a retrial is

16   much lesser than in the habeas case where there's a

17   lengthy sentence less -- left, and if someone gets out

18   of jail --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but the

20   collateral consequences of the conviction are pretty

21   dramatic.    In this case they decide whether the guy

22   stays in the country or is deported.

23                 MR. FREEDUS:         Yes, Your Honor.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, so I think

25   Justice Breyer's question is still on the table.                     Why

 1   would Congress intend to afford greater relief and

 2   remedies to somebody who's outside -- was within the

 3   military system and is now outside, than to an ordinary

 4   civilian under Article III jurisdiction?

 5                 MR. FREEDUS:        I think there is a classic

 6   distinction between the habeas and the coram nobis

 7   petitioner.    In a coram nobis petitioner under 2255, if

 8   they were to file a successful petition long after a

 9   statute of limitations had expired, they would be in no

10   different position than a coram nobis -- a successful

11   coram nobis petitioner in the military.

12                 We would say, we do believe there's a -- a

13   colorable argument for -- the ability to retry Mr.

14   Denedo, but it's not pivotal to our case.                    Our view is

15   that the inability --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Where?        Colorable --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In the civilian courts or

18   the military courts?

19                 MR. FREEDUS:        The military courts, Your

20   Honor.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I think you have a good

22   answer to what my question was.               I thought that was a

23   good answer.    It's helping me.             And -- but where I'm

24   slightly -- and maybe this is just not relevant to this

25   case or maybe it's for the future.                  Coram nobis, I

 1   thought, was a writ that means really like technical

 2   clerical errors or something really unusual.                Is this --

 3   I mean, it's hardly ever there.               I've not really seen

 4   more than a handful of cases.

 5              So -- so is this writ supposed to be

 6   available for what you're claiming is what I call a

 7   typical error of inadequate representation?               And I don't

 8   know the answer to that question, but I think it's --

 9   maybe you could say that's not presented.                Maybe that's

10   for a later case.    I don't know how to treat it.             That's

11   why I'm asking.

12              MR. FREEDUS:           I think Morgan is helpful on

13   that, Your Honor.    Morgan is a violation of the right to

14   counsel, and it's this Court's --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But was -- that question

16   wasn't resolved, was it?          I thought we were just talking

17   about the authority of the military courts to issue this

18   writ, and the question that Justice Breyer has raised,

19   well, is this ineffective assistance of counsel adequate

20   grounds to issue the writ?           I thought that question was

21   certainly not raised before this Court.

22              MR. FREEDUS:           Well, the government hasn't

23   urged that there's no ineffective assistance of counsel.

24   It's not in their opening --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, let's assume it

 2               MR. FREEDUS:         Yes.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- and I would be

 4   interested in the answer.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            I knew it was.

 6               MR. FREEDUS:         Yes, Your Honor.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            I thought it might be your

 8   answer:   Well, that isn't raised.               And that would be a

 9   perfectly good answer.

10               MR. FREEDUS:         That's -- that's why --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm telling you my honest

12   problem which I'm trying to think through:               Where are we

13   going with this?

14               MR. FREEDUS:         I think --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            What's going to happen one

16   way or the other way?      That's why I asked the question.

17   So all I'm asking is your best thought on it.

18               MR. FREEDUS:         Yes, Your Honor.        I think

19   United States v.   Kwan and United States v. Castro are

20   two court -- two cases that give the answer to your

21   question and both of those indicate that ineffective

22   assistance of counsel in very similar factual

23   circumstances to this is a basis for coram nobis relief

24   after -- after the ineffective assistance is discovered.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Military courts now since

 2   1950 have quite a record of saying coram nobis is

 3   available in these courts.          However, they have routinely

 4   thrown out the cases on the merits.                     Is there any case

 5   within the military where the military has said anything

 6   like inadequate assistance of counsel qualifies as a

 7   reason to grant the writ?

 8               MR. FREEDUS:         Aside from this -- this case

 9   below, Your Honor, I don't know of a case that raised

10   ineffective assistance of counsel.                 And you are correct

11   that the vast majority of these cases are thrown out of

12   court in the most -- in the briefest of orders.                     There

13   are cases where relief has been granted.                     They are few

14   and far between.   Del Prado is one.                    It involved a

15   compositional jurisdictional error to the -- to the

16   court.   An individual failed to elect military judge

17   alone in writing and waived the right to have a -- a

18   member's jury trial, and that was deemed a

19   jurisdictional defect.       And long after the case was

20   final the conviction was set aside, and I would note the

21   Court in that case observed the personal jurisdiction

22   was no obstacle to granting the coram nobis relief.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Was that person retried, do

24   you know?

25               MR. FREEDUS:         I do not know, Your Honor.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Was he still in the

 2   military?

 3               MR. FREEDUS:           I do not know.         He was -- the

 4   relief -- the decretal paragraph of the -- of the

 5   decision indicates that he was restored all rights and

 6   benefits, but it stops shy of saying, you know, here's

 7   your uniform back.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Do I understand correctly

 9   that since 1989 there were a total of 30 coram nobis

10   petitions filed, and of those only 4 were granted?

11               MR. FREEDUS:           The statistics that we cited

12   in our brief, Your Honor, were ten coram nobis petitions

13   at the court of appeals within the last 10 years --

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes.

15               MR. FREEDUS:           -- and 176 writ appeals from

16   the lower courts up to the court of appeals that don't

17   break out the category of writs.                 They could be habeas,

18   they could be coram nobis, mandamus, so we don't know

19   what percentage of the 176.              But even if it was a -- a

20   significant percentage, it's still a tiny percentage of

21   the court's overall docket.

22               But they are rarer than hen's teeth, Your

23   Honor.   These cases, one a year maybe would be the

24   average of a coram nobis --

 1   jurisdiction of the military court in the circumstance

 2   where the individual is still in the military, he's been

 3   convicted, and he is in custody?                So he wants to get out

 4   of custody.    Now, what's the theory of that?                He can --

 5   I take it it's accepted, is it, that they can, that such

 6   a person can ask the military justice system -- I don't

 7   know which court -- for release on the ground that he

 8   didn't -- wasn't adequately represented or some other

 9   ground?

10                 MR. FREEDUS:        That would be a habeas case,

11   Your Honor.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       It's a habeas

13   case.   Now, do you have -- can you do that in the

14   military?

15                 MR. FREEDUS:        Yes.       There are --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And what's the theory of

17   the jurisdiction that the military courts have over

18   that?

19                 MR. FREEDUS:        It's similar in that it's All

20   Writs Act authority aiding the --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Aiding what jurisdiction?

22                 MR. FREEDUS:        The direct review authority of

23   the military --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But they've already

25   directly reviewed it.

 1                 MR. FREEDUS:        Correct.          And that's --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So there is no more direct

 3   review to be had?

 4                 MR. FREEDUS:        That's correct, Your Honor.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So how does this aid the

 6   direct review that is to be had, since there is none?

 7                 MR. FREEDUS:        It aids it in the same way

 8   this Court recognized it can do so in Goldsmith, where

 9   it acknowledged that a mandamus writ could issue after

10   finality --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I see.

12                 MR. FREEDUS:        -- to compel adherence to the

15   military system?

16                 MR. FREEDUS:        Yes, Your Honor, within the

17   military justice system.          In that -- in Goldsmith it was

18   a situation where Goldsmith was out of the -- you know,

19   out of the military.       He had a final -- I guess he was

20   in custody, Cut he had a final court-martial conviction,

21   and this Court indicated that a writ of mandamus could

22   issue to aid past appellate jurisdiction to compel

23   adherence to the --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                All within the

25   system.   I mean, the difference with this case is that

 1   you're talking about somebody who is, I guess that's the

 2   issue, out of the military system.

 3              The problem with your position is that it

 4   would dramatically expand the jurisdiction of the

 5   military system.    It would sort of follow everybody

 6   they've dealt with around for their life, right?

 7              MR. FREEDUS:           The fact --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   At any time somebody

 9   who is out of the military system, whose judgment is

10   supposedly final under the provisions that Congress has

11   established, he could come back and knock on the door 20

12   years later and say, I want to review my conviction.

13              MR. FREEDUS:           That's correct, Your Honor.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And he would be

15   within the military system.

16              MR. FREEDUS:           He would be a civilian, former

17   service member --

 2   they're an appellate court and they have to find out if

 3   coram nobis was --

 4               MR. FREEDUS:           Yes, Your Honor.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Or do they use district

 6   courts as special masters?

 7               MR. FREEDUS:           They --

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              In this case, the court

 9   had to invent a procedural device:                   There's going to be

10   a new court-martial, which is a little odd because it's

11   a new court-martial sitting in judgment on somebody who

12   isn't even in the military any more.

13               MR. FREEDUS:           It's not a court-martial, Your

14   Honor.   It's what's called a DuBay proceeding, and what

15   happens is -- and this in the decretal paragraph of the

16   decision below.   A remand is for further factual

17   development, and if the case can be disposed of on

18   declarations, if the government came forth -- it didn't

19   do so below -- but if it did so on remand and provided

20   affidavits that blew our affidavits out of the water,

21   the court could dismiss the petition out of hand.

22               If they couldn't do that or if there is a

23   credibility contest that needed to be resolved, what

24   would happen is the court would order what's called a

25   DuBay hearing, where a judge is appointed.                  And it's

 1   just like an evidentiary hearing.                  Witnesses are

 2   presented and they're cross-examined and then findings

 3   of fact and conclusions of law are drawn.                       And then that

 4   is put into a record, added to the record of trial, and

 5   reviewed in the coram nobis petition.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But all of that is

 7   extra-statutory in your -- this instance?

 8              MR. FREEDUS:            We don't believe so.              We

 9   believe the court -- the Navy court here has decisional

10   authority under Article 66 to do factfinding.                       It's a

11   very unique court.      Congress created these courts with

12   factfinding power, which is different than I think

13   virtually all appellate courts, save maybe one or two

14   unusual situations.       But these courts have factfinding

15   power, so it's right in Article 66.                       And these courts

16   also have rulemaking authority.                And so does the court

17   of appeals, and it has exercised that to provide for

18   these procedures.     So we don't believe --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Where are -- where are the

20   procedures set out for -- for military habeas?

21              MR. FREEDUS:            They're not, and actually that

22   -- that -- this Court pointed that out in Noyd v. Bond.

23   It said that military appellate court have habeas power,

24   but the court of appeals hadn't provided rules, and

25   Congress could facilitate with rules but hadn't, but

 1   that didn't stop this Court from saying habeas power

 2   existed.   The absence of the procedure --

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Are you -- are you arguing

 4   then that if it has habeas power without a -- a textual

 5   basis, there's no reason to argue that it lacks coram

 6   nobis power because there's no textual basis?

 7               MR. FREEDUS:         I think the answer to that is

 8   yes.   The negative in there caught me.                 But, yes, I

 9   think that's what we're saying.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But this Court has never

11   held that the military courts have habeas jurisdiction?

12               MR. FREEDUS:         Yes, it has, Your Honor.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             In what case?

14               MR. FREEDUS:         In Noyd v. Bond this Court

15   squarely held that military -- the Court of Appeals at

16   the time has habeas authority.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 For someone still

18   within the military system?

19               MR. FREEDUS:         That was the case where the

20   individual was pending appeal, I believe.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the answer --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that was --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- to Justice

24   Ginsburg is that we have never held that with respect to

25   a situation like the facts here, where you're dealing

 1   with somebody who is outside -- long departed from the

 2   military system?

 3               MR. FREEDUS:          Well, I would -- I would

 4   direct the Court's attention, if I could, to footnote 11

 5   of Goldsmith, where this Court says:                     "And of course,

 6   once a criminal conviction has been finally reviewed

 7   within the military system, and a servicemember in

 8   custody has exhausted other avenues provided under the

 9   UCMJ to seek relief from his conviction" -- citing Noyd,

10   the six pages therein which refers to the military

11   court's habeas power -- this Court in Goldsmith put

12   habeas power in the context of a -- a final case, so

13   habeas authority after final relief.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's talking about somebody

15   still within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote

16   correctly, right?

17               MR. FREEDUS:          An individual is out of the

18   military if they -- if their dismissal has been executed

19   -- or their discharge has been executed and they're in

20   Leavenworth.   They could even be moved to another

21   Federal penitentiary and still in custody.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The --

23               MR. FREEDUS:          So they're not really in the

24   military.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The quote you referred to

 1   from Goldsmith says:       "And a servicemember in custody."

 2   So I think Goldsmith, in that footnote that you're

 3   citing, is presenting a service member still in custody,

 4   having exhausted all other areas, can come to a Federal

 5   district court and seek habeas.               It's not talking about

 6   someone who is out of the military.

 7                MR. FREEDUS:         I read it differently, Your

 8   Honor.    I read it -- the next clause in that sentence is

 9   referring to habeas outside.             I read this sentence as

10   clearly saying that there's direct review.                There's

11   habeas after direct review within the military.                  And

12   then there's of course collateral review in the Article

13   III courts, if -- if everything misfires within the

14   military justice system.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, what am I missing?

16   I thought that the footnote reads once a criminal

17   conviction has been finally reviewed within the military

18   system a service member, having exhausted all other

19   areas, can petition in a Federal district court for a

20   writ of habeas corpus.        I don't see anything that talks

21   about someone who is no longer a service member.

22                MR. FREEDUS:         Right.        I -- I see the

23   in-custody and exhausted avenues provided in the UCMJ as

24   referring to a phase before you get to the Article III

25   courts.   Obviously, if I'm reading it wrong, the Court


                                        49

 1   will let me know, but I read that as prior to Article

 2   III review.

 3                 If I could talk briefly about the 1983

 4   legislation -- it came up in opposing counsel's opening.

 5   I think it sheds a lot of light on the availability of

 6   coram nobis relief.       When Mr. Taft testified, he wasn't

 7   simply giving his -- he wasn't simply stating the state

 8   of the law.     He was providing the state of the law as a

 9   premise for legislative action, in particular stripping

10   collateral review authority from the correction boards,

11   which used to be able to review collaterally, after

12   final judgment, military convictions.                      And that existed

13   before the UCMJ was enacted.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 This is -- this is

15   at a hearing.    This isn't a Member of Congress,

16   obviously, that we're talking about.                      It's not even a

17   single Member of Congress?

18                 MR. FREEDUS:         This is the chief counsel for

19   the Department of Defense proposing the legislation and

20   offering the only premise there was for the particular

21   legislative change that I'm referring to, which is

22   stripping the -- the correction boards of this

23   collateral review power and saying, when we do that,

24   don't worry, Congress, because it will channel these

25   collateral -- post-final collateral attacks into the

 1   military courts, and -- and they can have habeas.                  He

 2   says habeas -- I'm sorry --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under the specific

 4   --

 5                MR. FREEDUS:         -- coram nobis.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under the specific

 7   provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by

 8   very strict finality provisions.

 9                There's no suggestion in his testimony that

10   the availability of the relief that he's talking about

11   continues after the individual is outside the military

12   system.   He's channeling -- he says these are channeled

13   through a specific provision applicable only within the

14   military system.

15                MR. FREEDUS:         I don't read it that way, Your

16   Honor.    I read it as channeling apt post-final attacks

17   within the military -- within the courts in the military

18   justice system, even though the person is -- is -- a

19   final judgment typically happens before an individual is

20   no longer in the service.           A final judgment is final

21   because the discharge has been executed.                 So what he's

22   referring to is, once you have a final judgment, you

23   then can seek collateral relief in the military the way

24   you used to be able to do it in the correction boards in

25   the military courts.       And he was saying, now that we're


                                        51
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   getting rid of this one collateral remedy in the

 2   correction boards, we're giving you this other one.

 3   We're not giving -- we're just channeling all of them

 4   into the military appellate courts, which is a more

 5   appropriate judicial forum.             And he says clearly it

 6   would denigrate the courts to have administrative bodies

 7   overturning their judgments, once again showing that

 8   these are final judgments that we're talking about.              And

 9   the only -- that was the only premise he offered to make

10   the change.

11                 So stripping away one remedy while leaving

12   another intact was the single premise, which is

13   reflected in the House -- the Senate report on page 52

14   of our brief, where Congress adopts the exact language

15   out of his sworn testimony with, you know, a tiny

16   variation, but that's the premise for the change in the

17   legislation.

18                 I'd also note that, in that legislation,

19   this is the Department of Defense proposing to open the

20   door to this Court's jurisdiction for the first time in

21   -- in 28 U.S.C. 1259.       And when it did that -- it had to

22   survey the whole landscape of military justice

23   jurisdiction, and when it did that, it saw there were

24   direct review cases, which are reflected in 1259

25   paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and this other category that is


                                        52

 1   defined by what's not in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and

 2   that's the All Writs Act cases.               The government

 3   acknowledges --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry.   I've had

 5   the chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and

 6   like Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in

 7   there that the relief he's talking about continues after

 8   someone is out of the service.

 9                MR. FREEDUS:         I think that's implicit in

10   final judgment, Your Honor.             If there's a final

11   judgment.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, a final

13   judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts

14   within -- in the military system, just like you have --

15   a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review

16   in our system.

17                MR. FREEDUS:         Your Honor, the -- the key

18   difference is that -- two things:                 He's referring to

19   post-finality, which means that the discharge or the --

20   you know, the sentence has been executed.                  The person is

21   out.   They're a civilian at that point.                 And coram

22   nobis, by its very nature, is someone who is not in

23   custody.    So I don't think it's too much of an inference

24   to read that what he is saying here is --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you have


                                        53
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   review in the appellate system.                Someone is -- the

 2   judgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek

 3   review.    Are they discharged while the review is going

 4   on?

 5                MR. FREEDUS:          No, on direct review, you're

 6   right, Your Honor.      They're -- they remain within the

 7   service, and it's interesting that the government cites

 8   Mr. Taft's testimony as authoritative on that point.

 9   And that -- that makes good sense.                   Keep the person in

10   for a direct review so that if the sentence is set

11   aside, we can retry.

12                                    But there has been decades of

13   military justice authority that says even if someone is

14   discharged before their conviction is set aside -- so

15   they're on direct review, their conviction is set aside,

16   after they're already out in their civilian world, you

17   know, doing whatever they're doing -- if the government

18   wants to retry them, they do.               And the government is --

19   is the party that asserts continuing jurisdiction to

20   re-prosecute.

21                                    And that's why this case is so

22   distinguishable from Toth v. Quarles, because in Toth

23   there was no conviction while the individual was on

24   active duty.    And that's why there couldn't have been a

25   retry.    Here there was conviction on active duty, which


                                         54
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is where jurisdiction attaches.               It cements in.     And if

 2   the government wants to invoke that to retry Mr. Denedo,

 3   it can try that.

 4                                   I would say, though, that if --

 5   if there were a personal jurisdiction loophole here,

 6   like there was for the MEJA, the Military

 7   Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, Congress could fix it

 8   in a heartbeat.    But we're talking about, you know, ten

 9   cases in ten years.      So even if someone, you know, got

10   away without retrial --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You -- you don't

12   think that if you prevail in this case, we're going to

13   see a lot more coram nobis petitions than we did before?

14                MR. FREEDUS:         I -- I think there would be an

15   uptick, and there may actually have been an uptick while

16   this case has been up here at this level, because it has

17   -- it has gotten a lot of visibility in the military,

18   just like there was an uptick after Noyd v. Bond when

19   this Court declared for the first time that military

20   courts had All Writs Act power.

21                So I think there could be an uptick.                 But

22   once the novelty of it wears off, I think we will see

23   level off.   And you will see the same trend that we have

24   seen since 66 when it was available the first time.                     I

25   mean this isn't new.       The only thing new here is the

 1   government's interpretation of Article 66.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 3              MR. FREEDUS:           Thank you, Your Honor.

 4              Mr. Shah, you have three minutes remaining.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Shah, could you tell us

 6   what the government's position is on whether, when

 7   somebody has been discharged from the service and then a

 8   conviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in

 9   the service is set aside, can he be retried in military

10   courts?

11              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

12                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13              MR. SHAH:        Not if he has passed his

14   enlistment period, no, Your Honor.                  The government's

15   view is they would not be able to retry him.

16              I would just like to make four quick points

17   in response.    First, to the Chief Justice's question,

18   could someone be in custody after finality?                     Of course,

19   yes, that -- that could be the case.                     The military

20   doesn't have to issue a bad conduct discharge as part of

21   its sentence.    He could still be in confinement within

22   the military during the post finality period.

23              The second point I would like to make is

24   that Noyd v. Bond is clearly distinguishable.                     That

25   dealt with habeas review within the military while the


                                        56
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   person was still pursuing his direct appeal.              So there

 2   was a clear, independent basis of jurisdiction in the

 3   Noyd v. Bond type situation, and that's the Article 66

 4   and 67 direct review jurisdiction, and that --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:               What has direct review got

 6   to do with habeas?

 7              MR. SHAH:         Well -- well, Your Honor, the --

 8   the habeas would be in aid of the direct review

 9   jurisdiction.   In -- in Noyd -- in the Noyd v. Bond --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:               In the civil system we

11   regard it as -- as entirely a separate proceeding.

12              MR. SHAH:         Well, what was going on in Noyd

13   v. Bond, Your Honor, is he was pursuing a habeas

14   petition for release pending the -- the resolution of

15   his direct appeal.      So the military courts just referred

16   the petition to the same court reviewing his direct

17   appeal on the merits, and it became part and parcel of

18   that jurisdiction.

19              The third point I would like to -- to make

20   is in response to Justice Kennedy's question, which

21   shows the incompatibility of coram nobis relief within

22   the military justice system.              That they've had to create

23   this DuBay procedure where -- where a new court-martial

24   -- and DuBay sets this out.              The new court-martial does

25   have to be convened, and then they would have a


                                         57

 1   factfinding tribunal in which new -- a new military

 2   judge would have to be assigned to govern it.

 3               None of that is specified within Congress's

 4   scheme.   That has all been created.                    It shows the

 5   incompatibility of the practical burdens that this

 6   procedure places on the military, and nothing in Article

 7   66(c) which governs the jurisdiction of the military

 8   appellate courts, the intermediate courts, references

 9   any independent factfinding power.                 It says in a case

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why don't you

22   Military Review and seek correction of that error.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.
