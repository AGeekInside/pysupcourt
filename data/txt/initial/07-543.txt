 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 5   Hulteen.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. PHILLIPS:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               When Judge Wood on the Seventh Circuit

12   addressed precisely the same issue that's before this

13   Court, I think she correctly observed that the

14   distinction between an ongoing violation that arises

15   with each new use of a seniority system and the present

16   effect of a past discrimination is a distinction that is

17   subtle at best.

18               But it is the line that this Court has asked

19   the lower courts to draw, and I think the majority of

20   those courts have actually drawn that line

21   appropriately, although you could actually probably

22   argue that it's more a scatter plot than it is a line.

23   And I think it's a scatter plot that essentially looks

24   to three primary factors in evaluating whether or not

25   this is a case that is more like Evans and Lorance and


                                         3

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Ledbetter, or a case that is more like Bazemore.

 2               And those three factors are the stale nature

 3   of the claims, whether or not there is a seniority at

 4   stake, and whether or not the employees have fair and

 5   adequate notice at the time of the action of the

 6   employer.

 7               Let's look at the staleness of the claim.

 8   In this particular case, we are talking about maternity

 9   leaves that were taken by -- taken by the Respondents

10   between 1968 and 1976.         The information that's available

11   to AT&T today is simply whether or not these particular

12   individuals were paid for periods of time.                      There is

13   nothing more than that.

14               We have no way of knowing whether or not

15   these were maternity leaves or not maternity leaves,

16   whether these were leaves to go to school, leaves to

17   take care of -- of parents, or leaves for any other

18   particular purpose.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But at the time -- at the

20   time of the original reduction of credits, was there any

21   right claimed that any of these women had?                      I mean,

22   nothing had happened to them except there was a

23   bookkeeping entry.      They wouldn't be hurt until they

24   sought retirement or sought some other benefit that

25   increased seniority would give them.                      But could they

 1   have come into court just from, on the books of AT&T,

 2   they were docked X number of days?                 Nothing has happened

 3   as a consequence of that.

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:         Justice Ginsburg, they not

 5   only could have, but they did.              If you look at the

 6   Eighth Circuit's decision -- and, indeed, Respondents in

 7   this case did -- in the Communications Worker case out

 8   of the Eighth Circuit, which is 602 F.2d 304, they

 9   specifically alleged that one of the Bell operating

10   companies, one of the subsidiaries, had, in fact,

11   refused to grant these -- these exact service credits,

12   sued on that basis pre-PDA, and alleged that they were

13   entitled to relief.

14                The Eighth Circuit in that case looked at

15   this Court's decision in Gilbert and looked at this

16   Court's decision in Satty, and said specifically this

17   case is more like Gilbert than it's like Satty, but

18   never remotely questioned that that was an actionable

19   claim at that point in time.            And, candidly, it seems to

20   me clear that that's an actionable claim because there

21   -- there is very little that is quite as critical in

22   this process -- in the employment relationship as

23   seniority.   And -- and we are not talking about simply

24   benefits seniority here.         We are talking about

25   competitive seniority.

 1                 So whether you have a -- a better claim to a

 2   cushier job or -- or to better working conditions, all

 3   of those are determined on the basis of -- of seniority,

 4   which is being decided on an individualized basis.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it hadn't been

 6   applied in any of those situations yet.                  At -- at the --

 7   at the point when the person returns from leave and is

 8   docked a certain number of days, it hasn't been applied

 9   to any of the situations you mentioned.                  I grant you the

10   case would be totally ripe if there was a better job to

11   bid for, if there was an early retirement opportunity.

12   But here there was nothing -- nothing to be done.

13                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, I --

14   I question the premise that there was nothing to be

15   done.   I think the average person told that they have

16   less seniority today than they had yesterday, and if

17   they were told that on the basis of -- of gender-based

18   discrimination or race-based discrimination, would say:

19   I am entitled to go to court today.

20                 Not only do I think that that's the way most

21   people would react to it, but the reality is if you look

22   at the way the litigation arose in the Eighth Circuit

23   case that I alluded to earlier, these very -- the same

24   union here made exactly that claim prior to the passage

25   of the PDA.   So the notion that the employees, one,


                                         6
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   didn't have notice -- they clearly did have notice --

 2   and, two, didn't have an incentive to act, they clearly

 3   did have an incentive to act.

 4                 And I think this is not much different from

 5   what the Court said in Ricks, which is that obviously

 6   you have more of an incentive when you feel the true

 7   pain of a -- of a discriminatory act, assuming the act

 8   was in -- was, in fact, discriminatory, but the

 9   obligation to respond more -- to respond sooner remains

10   on the plaintiff.

11                And, again, to go back to the point I was

12   trying to make initially, these are all claims that

13   arose -- these are all actions taken between 1968 and

14   1976.    And one of the --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you -- you have to, I

16   think, recognize that there's a big difference between

17   Evans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have

18   to resign -- a definite act that had immediate

19   consequences -- and this, where there -- there is a

20   potential for future consequences but no immediate

21   consequence of the kind that existed in your model case,

22   Evans.

23                MR. PHILLIPS:          I mean, Justice Ginsburg,

24   there's -- there's no question that the impact in Evans

25   is -- is stronger than the impact here.                  I will readily


                                         7
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   concede that.    But what I won't concede is that the

 2   importance of seniority is so far down the pecking order

 3   or so de minimis in its impact that it would be

 4   reasonable to assume that the average employee, told

 5   that I'm am taking away your seniority on the basis --

 6   on the basis of your race, would then sit back and say:

 7   I'm not going to do anything; I'm going to wait until

 8   the impact of that is felt.

 9                  To the contrary, you would expect, given the

10   -- the centrality of seniority as a term of employment,

11   that any employee under those circumstances would

12   respond, you know, almost immediately under those

13   circumstances.

14               The -- the second factor in this case that,

15   it seems to me, this Court has relied upon significantly

16   in the prior decisions that have come out on the side of

17   not allowing this kind of litigation to go forward is we

18   are talking about a seniority system here.                And the --

19   as I said a minute ago, it's not just the rights of the

20   individual and what benefits she might be entitled to.

21   The seniority system obviously affects the rights of all

22   members of the -- of the seniority plan and all of the

23   pension plan and the entire system that the seniority

24   operates on.    And so there are third-party interests

25   that are involved here.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               And, again, both Congress and this Court's

 2   decisions have consistently recognized that when that

 3   situation arises, the resolution of the question ought

 4   to be to say, no, these are present effects of past

 5   discriminatory acts; we should be loath to try to

 6   interfere with those -- with that seniority scheme under

 7   these circumstances.

 8               And then the third factor that it seems to

 9   me the Court has been concerned about -- and it's one we

10   have been discussing -- which is the -- the -- you know,

11   the adequacy of the notice, where the employee is put on

12   notice at the time that actions were being taken.

13               Now, we can quarrel about how serious the --

14   the actions were, how detrimental they might have been.

15   But it seems to me there is no question that the -- that

16   the injury here is real and that the average employee

17   being told that you are being deprived of seniority on

18   -- on a race-based or sex-based or any other condition

19   that is protected would act immediately.

20               Now, it seems to me that the only argument

21   that the -- that the Respondents offer on the other side

22   -- and it's almost a mantra-like exposition by them and

23   it was certainly the basis for the Ninth Circuit, and I

24   think it's where the mistake arises -- is this claim

25   that this is -- is a facially discriminatory policy.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    And their argument is if it's facially discriminatory,

2    then you can apply it now, and all of the reasons why

3    this Court has not applied these -- these kinds of

4    claims in the past in Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter is

5    -- is -- are off the hook in this circumstance.

6                 But the truth is this is not a facially

7    discriminatory policy.       In the first place, this exact

8    same policy was looked at in "SAH-tee" or "SAT-ee."                I

9    don't know exactly how to pronounce it.                 And the Court

10   said these kinds of arrangements where you don't give

11   service credit for people who take pregnancy leave is

12   not facially discriminatory.            So --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that was when Gilbert

14   was prevailing.   Certainly, we would not regard it that

15   way today.

16                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I don't know whether it

17   would be regarded as facially discriminatory today.                I

18   think it would be regarded as illegal today.                Whether it

19   would be facially discriminatory I think is a -- is a

20   trickier question, because again it seems to me that --

21   that the other side relies heavily on the statement in

22   Lorance about facially discriminatory plans.

23                But what the Court described as a facially

24   discriminatory plan in that day was it was -- in that

25   case, was a situation where every day a male worker is


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    credited with a full day of work for a day's -- a day's

2    effort, and a woman is credited with half a day's work

3    for a day's effort.       And -- and the Court said, quite

4    rightly, that's a facially discriminatory plan.

5                 Well, we don't have anything like that in

6    this case.   This plan was changed in the wake of the

7    passage of the PDA to bring it completely in compliance.

8    So the plan, as it operates today, is -- is not only not

9    facially discriminatory; it is in no way discriminatory

10   --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:             Btu you -- what about --

12   I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree

13   with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is.                      But

14   if I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large

15   number of employees.        And if you look at a complicated

16   thing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that

17   salary structure systemically paid black people less

18   than white people.      And at the time, for whatever

19   reasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that

20   was lawful at the time.

21                MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:             Then later it turns out

23   that they are keeping that salary structure, although

24   not for racially motivated reasons.                       They are keeping it

25   simply because that's what it was.                   And the Court says,


                                         11
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    you've taken that complex structure, and you are

2    administering it now, and the administration of it now

3    is what is unlawful.

4                Then, look at your case.                      We had a

5    complicated structure involving seniority, really.                     And

6    part of that old seniority system was this rule which

7    was legal at the time.         It is no longer legal.

8                Now, we move that structure over until now,

9    and we see we are administering the same complex

10   structure today in the same kind of way that was at

11   issue at Bazemore.      It's a complicated set of rules that

12   you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled

13   to what, just as they did that in Bazemore.                     So I began

14   to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very

15   much like Bazemore?       What is your response?

16               MR. PHILLIPS:            Justice Breyer, I -- I -- in

17   looking at this case, I have long thought of it as kind

18   of an M.C. Escher picture, where you look at it from one

19   direction and it looks one way, and then you turn it and

20   you look at it the other way, and it looks completely

21   different to you.

22               But I think the right answer to -- to your

23   analysis is that the way to look at Bazemore is that

24   every day after the statute was enacted, every employee

25   who showed up to work who was black was paid less than


                                         12

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1    every employee who showed up to work who was white.                 And

2    that, it seems to me, as the Court said in Bazemore,

3    unanimously and without a whole lot of fanfare, is just

4    something simply illegal under Title VII under those

5    circumstances.

6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but why can't you make

7    exactly the same kind of analysis here?                  People here are

8    not showing up for work.          They are staying home and

9    getting retirement benefits.             And every day a person who

10   was out for 90 days because of a physical illness other

11   than pregnancy is getting a retirement benefit with an

12   extra dollar.    And everybody who was out -- who was out

13   for 90 days for maternity is only getting an extra 33

14   cents.   And -- and why isn't the payment of the

15   retirement benefit exactly on par with the payment of

16   the salary in Bazemore?

17               MR. PHILLIPS:           I -- I mean, I think the

18   answer to that, Justice Souter, is that's not -- that's

19   certainly not an implausible way of trying to look at

20   this problem, but if you look at the language of this

21   Court two terms ago in Ledbetter, and I'll quote it for

22   you:   "The fact that pre-charging period discrimination

23   adversely affects the calculation of a neutral factor

24   like seniority" -- which is what we are talking about

25   here -- "that is used in determining future pay" --

1    which is the benefits from this program -- "does not

2    mean that each new paycheck constitutes a new violation

3    and restarts the EEOC charging period."

4                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, do you -- do you see

5    Ledbetter in effect as -- as overruling Bazemore?

6                MR. PHILLIPS:          No, I think Ledbetter deals

7    with Bazemore in the context of a -- of a true seniority

8    system and an arrangement in which what you are looking

9    at -- because our case is a fortiori from -- from Evans

10   and -- and Ledbetter because, remember, we are talking

11   about a situation where what we did at the time, in our

12   judgment, was perfectly legal.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            And -- and at the time, in

14   Bazemore, that the private employers discriminated for

15   racial purposes, that was not unconstitutional or

16   illegal, either.

17               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right, I understand that, but

18   --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             At that time, even --

20               MR. PHILLIPS:          And then --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- even more so.    You --

22   you've said several times that it was perfectly legal,

23   but isn't it true that the law in all of the circuits

24   was the other way, and it wasn't until this Court

25   decided the Gilbert case that the law changed?               But if

1    you were -- if you were an employer and you were

2    advising a client in, say, 1975, look to see where the

3    circuits were, the circuits said, yes, discrimination on

4    the basis of pregnancy is surely discrimination on the

5    basis of sex.   It wasn't until this Court decided first

6    the Aiello case and then Gilbert that -- that that law

7    changed.   But --

8                 MR. PHILLIPS:          I mean, I understand that,

9    Justice Ginsburg, and obviously we don't quarrel with

10   that.   The problem obviously is the Court did decide

11   Gilbert; the Court didn't say the law changed.             It was

12   the way the Court interpreted the statute at the time,

13   and under the interpretation of Gilbert and Satty, what

14   we did was perfectly legal, and when the statute

15   changed, what we did was to bring ourselves into

16   assiduous compliance with that position, Justice Souter,

17   which is what I think distinguishes --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but I mean, that --

19   with respect, I think that sort of begs the question

20   because if Bazemore is the right template for analyzing

21   this case, then you're not in compliance when you --

22   when your payment of the pension benefit reflects the

23   pregnancy differential.

24               MR. PHILLIPS:           Justice Souter, there's no

25   question that you can read Bazemore that way.             I just

1    think that the way this Court has read Bazemore and

2    Lorance and Ledbetter suggests that, in the context of

3    the case we have here, the right answer is this is more

4    like present effects of past allegedly discriminatory

5    acts and, therefore, not actionable at this time.

6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me just be sure I

7    understand one thing:      Are you contending that the plan

8    is not unlawful or that the claim is untimely?

9                 MR. PHILLIPS:         We are -- well, both,

10   actually.   We say it's not -- we say it's untimely, but

11   we also say that if --

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            At the time it was

13   adopted, it was lawful.

14               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right, exactly.        And that

15   otherwise it would have to be retroactive application of

16   the PDA.

17               I would like to reserve the balance of my

18   time.

1    and may it please the Court:

2                The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case

3    impermissibly imposes retroactive liability on

4    Petitioner, and Respondents' claims are in any event

5    time-barred.

6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Miss Blatt, that was not

7    the position of the only representative of the United

8    States in the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, the EEOC,

9    the brief in the Ninth Circuit.             We don't hear from the

10   EEOC in this Court, but I think it was not just that

11   brief but in the EEOC manual, they are taking a position

12   that is 180 degrees opposite yours.                    Am I right in --

13               MS. BLATT:      You are absolutely correct.                You

14   are absolutely correct.       And Ledbetter -- this Court's

15   decision in Ledbetter, which was issued after both the

16   compliance manual and after the EEOC filed their brief,

17   explained that the EEOC is entitled to no special

18   deference on the interpretation of this Court's cases.

19   And the EEOC's interpretation is based on a conclusion

20   whether this case is governed by Evans or Bazemore, and

21   the EEOC hasn't purported to even discuss the

22   retroactivity -- or the retroactive imposition of

23   liability because the pregnancy leaves in this case were

24   taken before the PDA and, as the EEOC acknowledged in

25   that compliance manual, that denial of service credit at

1    the time was lawful under this Court's decision.

2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Would you -- would you --

3    excuse me -- would you agree that if -- well, let me be

4    less rhetorical about it.         What if Congress passed a

5    statute providing that, starting one year from the

6    effective date of the statute, no pension plan will

7    differentiate in computing pension benefits on leaves

8    taken between -- as between leaves taken for -- for

9    conventional sickness and leaves taken for pregnancy.

10   Would that statute be unconstitutional?

11              MS. BLATT:       Unconstitutional?

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

13              MS. BLATT:       I think -- I mean, the way I

14   understand your case is that Congress can speak in clear

15   language to impose retroactive --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:            To make it retroactive.

17   Yes.

18              MS. BLATT:       Retrospective liability.       It's

19   just there's nothing in the PDA that indicates that

20   retroactive liability was imposed.                And --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:            So your -- your argument

22   simply is a -- a purely statutory construction argument:

23   That isn't what Congress had in mind.

24              MS. BLATT:       Right, and your hypothetical

25   statute would seem inconsistent with --


                                      18
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           If Congress would have had

2    in mind, then there would be a question whether Congress

3    could do it, and you agree that it could.                So the

4    question is simply:      Did it or didn't it in this case?

5                  MS. BLATT:      That's right, and I think the --

6    the seniority system provision, 703(h), would just be

7    completely counter to that hypothetical provision

8    because Congress has taken special care to make sure

9    seniority systems can continue to exist, even though

10   they incorporate pre-Act discrimination.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Was this statute effective

12   180 days after its -- after signature?

13                 MS. BLATT:      With respect to fringe benefit

14   programs, I think it was effective on the date it

15   passed.   And there's no question -- everyone concedes --

16   that AT&T immediately came into compliance on the

17   effective date of the Act.

18                 And the -- our key point on retroactivity is

19   the way to look at this is what the statute prohibited

20   and that is discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.

21   And the pregnancy discrimination occurred in this case

22   based on the discriminatory leave policies, and those --

23   those were all taken in the '60s and '70s before the PDA

24   was passed.   And what the Ninth Circuit's decision does

25   is it orders Petitioner to restore service credit taken

1    for the pregnancy leave before the passage of the -- of

2    the PDA.   And I --

3                   JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you -- do you think

4    Ledbetter modified or overruled Bazemore?

5                   MS. BLATT:       No.       It just put it in context,

6    and I don't think that Bazemore deals with the

7    retroactivity point, and let me explain why:                 The -- the

8    employer in Bazemore who continued to pay African

9    Americans less than whites was ordered prospectively to

10   start paying equal wages for equal work, but

11   specifically not ordered to make up for past wage

12   differentials.    And I think it's for three reasons.

13   What this does is much -- much more prejudicial and

14   upsets expectations in three ways, and this is some of

15   the things that Mr. Phillips talked about.                 And at the

16   time the pregnancy leaves were taken, the Petitioner was

17   entitled and probably required to make planning and

18   funding decisions for its pension liabilities.

19               Second, the Petitioner should not, 30 to 40

20   years after the fact, have to defend claims about

21   whether these women were disabled and actually unable to

22   work due to pregnancy, when medical records and

23   personnel records are probably missing and memories long

24   since faded.

25               And, third, the retroactive scrambling of a


                                          20

1    seniority system upsets the vested rights of other

2    employees.

3                 And I just don't think you have any of that

4    in Bazemore.    The employer said --

5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, why does it upset --

6                 MS. BLATT:       -- you me to pay out money

7    prospectively.

8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            So far as pension benefits

9    are concerned, it doesn't upset any employee's

10   expectations.    The ones who don't have a pregnancy

11   background are going to get the same pension that they

12   -- they bargained for.

13                MS. BLATT:       Well, I think of a pension plan

14   as a zero-sum game.      There's a more limited amount.         But

15   more specifically, there --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, but that -- I mean,

17   that's -- that's an issue that you touched on, on your

18   second point.    I don't know if it is a zero-sum game.

19   And if -- if I were faced with -- with a problem, and I

20   may be, in which I really have two choices -- I've got

21   two analogies in our cases, I can take either one, and

22   there were evidence in here that the -- that this was

23   going to be so traumatic to the pension system that it

24   would be manifestly unfair and perhaps endanger benefits

25   for others to force these benefits to be paid, that


                                        21

1    would be a good reason to go one way.                   But I don't think

2    we have that in the case.          And --

3                MS. BLATT:       Well, I --

4                JUSTICE SOUTER:            And if we don't have it in

5    the case, then this isn't a zero-sum game.

6                MS. BLATT:       Well, we don't know what we have

7    in the case, because it was -- it was -- liability was

8    imposed on summary judgment.            The class allegations are

9    15,000.

10               But my point on vested seniority rights is

11   that the class includes current employees.                  The

12   Respondent Porter is a current employee.                  The order in

13   this case is to restore seniority credit, I assume for

14   current employees, which will give them greater

15   seniority rights vis-a-vis other employees who have

16   planned their own issues about job bidding and

17   retirement and seniority based on 30 to 40 years of

18   expectations.   So I --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But this is not a

20   situation like Evans, somebody who was out of the

21   workforce for 4 years and then is going to come back and

22   bump some people who -- who filled in while she was not

23   working, and get that credit.             This is quite different.

24   This is just a question of weeks.

25               MS. BLATT:       No, I think some -- some of


                                       22

1    these people had very significant disabilities, over 6,

2    7 months.   But in terms of the fairness here, I mean,

3    the -- the female flight attendant was discharged on a

4    facially discriminatory policy of forcing married female

5    flight attendants to resign.            Here, the two Supreme

6    Court cases have said that the decision -- as

7    inexplicable as it was, the decision not to treat

8    pregnancy as a disability was not on its face a

9    discriminatory policy.

10               Now, the PDA immediately overruled that, but

11   applied it prospectively, and now we are here 30 to 40

12   years later basically litigating the complaint that was

13   brought in the Eighth Circuit as well as the complaint

14   that was brought in the Second Circuit by the Respondent

15   here.   They brought this case twice in the Second -- and

16   these are all cited on the Petitioner's brief and the

17   reply brief on page 17.

18               In the Second Circuit case, it was granted,

19   vacated, and remanded in light of Gilbert.              And then in

20   the Eighth Circuit case, they actually lost on the

21   merits under Satty.

22               Now, the only thing that has changed is the

23   passage of 30 years and the PDA, which doesn't apply

24   retroactively.   So I just think that --

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do I correctly understand


                                       23

1    that -- that you would agree that if this plan were

2    adopted today it would be unlawful, but because it was

3    -- that at the time it was adopted, and the statute uses

4    the word "adopted," it was lawful?

5                 MS. BLATT:      Let me be very clear on this.

6    The seniority system in this case is facially neutral;

7    it just accords seniority to men and women on an equal

8    basis depending on whether they took disability leave or

9    personal leave.   The leave policy that forced women to

10   take pregnancy leave as personal leave would be illegal

11   if it were adopted today, because the PDA says you can't

12   treat -- women affected by pregnancy have to be treated

13   for the same purposes.

14                So the seniority system is always just the

15   same.   It says, based on total years of service, you get

16   pension benefits, men and women the same.               In the

17   accrual policy, men and women were treated identically.

18   Just like in Evans, men and women were denied seniority

19   or service credit if they were terminated for -- for

20   charge, and there was a separate unlawful policy that

21   basically defined -- cause -- excuse me -- if you were

22   terminated for cause -- and a separate policy that

23   defined "cause" to say, well, if you were a female

24   flight attendant and you married, then you were forced

25   to resign.   So obviously that policy was always


                                       24
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    unlawful.   It would be unlawful today.                   And similarly,

2    if AT&T hadn't had changed its leave policy, someone

3    could sue immediately.         I mean, these women -- the

4    immediate --

5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Before you -- do I

6    understand your answer to Justice Stevens's question to

7    be yes, it would be legal to adopt this seniority policy

8    today?

9                 MS. BLATT:        Yes -- the seniority system is

10   their seniority system, and it's completely neutral and

11   completely lawful.      AT&T's pre-PDA leave policy.               That

12   if you were a woman and you take pregnancy --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I understand, but

15               MS. BLATT:         -- that's unlawful today.            That

16   would be facial discrimination on the basis of

17   pregnancy, and it would be unlawful.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But even adopting

19   the policy today -- which I thought was

20   Justice Stevens's question, and maybe it's not -- that

21   would be acceptable?        In other words, it's not simply

22   the fact that this -- the leave policy -- the seniority

23   policy was adopted during the time prior to Gilbert?

24               MS. BLATT:         I -- AT&T could not adopt their

25   leave policy today, and --

1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  They couldn't adopt

2    the leave policy.    Could they adopt today a leave -- a

3    seniority policy today based on -- today, based on the

4    pre-Gilbert situation?

5                MS. BLATT:        Oh.       Then I think you would have

6    a -- well, you would have an unlawful policy that

7    someone could sue on immediately, and it would be facial

8    discrimination, and we wouldn't be up here making a

9    retroactivity argument because no court would be

10   ordering them to undo decisions that were made before

11   the passage of the Act.         They today would be making

12   decisions and there were nothing -- there would be no

13   retroactive imposition of liability.

18                ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN RUSSELL

19                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20               MR. RUSSELL:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22               The distinction between Evans and this case

23   turns on the difference between discrimination outside

24   of the seniority system which affects an employee's

25   ability to provide service to the employer, and

1    discrimination within the seniority system itself that

2    gives unequal credit for equal service.

3                  Congress drew that line, adopting one that

4    this Court had referred to in Lorance, when it passed

5    section 706(e)(2) of Title VII, which provided that a

6    facially discriminatory seniority system can be

7    challenged, not only when --

8                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask a question?   If

9    there is a facially discriminatory system, are you

10   saying this is a disparate impact case or a disparate

11   treatment case?

12                 MR. RUSSELL:        This is a disparate treatment

13   case.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           When did the -- when did

15   the intentional discrimination take place?

16                 MR. RUSSELL:        It took place when AT&T

17   applied an accrual rule to my clients' disability leave,

18   and said --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You do not -- you do not

20   contend that the plan was unlawful at the time it was

21   adopted?

22                 MR. RUSSELL:        We think that it was, but it

23   doesn't matter.   Ultimately under 706(e)(2), what

24   matters is that the plan discriminated on its face.              And

25   the insight beyond that -- and that doesn't turn on

1    whether it is unlawful or not.               A plan that

2    discriminates against short people discriminates on its

3    face, intentionally discriminates on the basis of height

4    every time it's applied; and when it does, whether it's

5    lawful or not, is applied in accordance with the law

6    that existed at the time of the application.

7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, let me ask you this

8    question:   At the time the plan was adopted,

9    discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not

10   discrimination on the basis of sex, according to the

11   majority in Gilbert.

12               MR. RUSSELL:          That's correct.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Which I happen to disagree

14   with.

15               So as a matter of law, it seems to me at the

16   time the plan was adopted it was a lawful plan.

17               MR. RUSSELL:          Well, we think it was unlawful

18   for two reasons, and one is that it was unlawful under

19   Satty.   Now, I acknowledge --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Under what?

21               MR. RUSSELL:          Under Satty, under the Court's

22   decision in Satty that said discrimination with respect

23   to seniority had an unlawful discriminatory impact on

24   the basis of sex.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That was -- that was

1    coming back to work and having all of your seniority

2    stripped.   Is that --

3                MR. RUSSELL:           That is correct, but we don't

4    think that there's a distinction because what the Court

5    said was that the injury is cognizable because it

6    affects employment opportunities.

7                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes, but I thought the

8    question was whether it was unlawful at the time, before

9    the later statute.

10               MR. RUSSELL:           Yes, and we think --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              And -- and you say that,

12   even though discriminating against pregnancy leave was

13   itself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you

14   credit for the time of that pregnancy leave was

15   unlawful?

16               MR. RUSSELL:           No.      Let me be clear.   We

17   think that at the time our clients took their leave, it

18   was unlawful under Title VII and under Satty to

19   discriminate on the basis of pregnancy with respect to

20   seniority, whether it's the right to retain accrued

21   seniority or the right to accumulate it in the first

22   place.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              And you say Gilbert had

24   nothing to do with it?

25               MR. RUSSELL:           Gilbert said that it wasn't

1    intentional discrimination on the basis of sex.                   Satty

2    said it had an unlawful disparate impact on the basis of

3    sex.     But ultimately none of this matters, because under

4    section 706(e)(2), the question is whether the system as

5    a whole, which includes the accruable, discriminates on

6    its face, whether it's intentionally discriminatory; and

7    the insight behind that rule was, as I said before with

8    the example of a height discrimination, a rule that

9    discriminates on the basis of height intentionally

10   discriminates on the basis of height every time it's

11   applied.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Could you -- could I

13   pause?    I'd just trying to understand your earlier

14   answer.    It just took me a little while before you got

15   off on the other point.

16                 You're saying it was lawful at the time to

17   deliberately discriminate on the basis of pregnancy --

18   Gilbert -- but that that was somehow unlawful if in fact

19   your deliberate discrimination had a disparate impact?

20                 MR. RUSSELL:         Had a disparate impact on the

21   basis of sex, yes.      That's what Satty held -- that's

22   what Satty held clearly with respect to accrued

23   seniority.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, maybe I'm

25   missing it.    Isn't it a bit unusual to say it's

1    perfectly all right to discriminate intentionally, but

2    if it has a disparate impact, that's not all right?

3                  MR. RUSSELL:        That's every disparate impact

4    case.    It's not that it's all right.                   It's just that

5    it's not --

6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I -- I don't

7    think it's every disparate impact case.                     In a disparate

8    impact case, it's because you can't show, typically,

9    deliberate discrimination, so you look at what the

10   impact was.   But I guess I've never heard of a case

11   where it's okay to do something intentionally, but it's

12   illegal -- to discriminate intentionally, but it's

13   illegal if that has a disparate impact.

14                 MR. RUSSELL:        Let me just be clear about the

15   terms.   Gilbert said it was not unlawful intentional sex

16   discrimination, but Satty said that it constitutes --

17   that pregnancy discrimination with respect to seniority

18   credits constitutes -- has an unlawful disparate impact

19   on the basis of sex.       In that sense --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but Gilbert

21   said it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex,

22   because it said that discrimination on the basis of

23   pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex;

24   and yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on

25   the basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    base of sex.

2                MR. RUSSELL:         Let me try one more time.           And

3    maybe -- it's just to say that sometimes, intentional

4    discrimination on the basis of pregnancy can have a

5    disparate impact on the basis of sex.                   That's what Satty

6    said -- Satty said.     But --

7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is your -- is there

8    any other -- can you cite a case to me where we have

9    held there is discriminatory treatment, but that's

10   lawful, but the discriminatory impact of that is

11   unlawful?

12               MR. RUSSELL:         Well, I think a height

13   requirement would be intentional discrimination on the

14   basis of height that could have an unlawful disparate

15   impact on the basis of sex.            I think it's a parallel

16   construction.

17               But, ultimately, I -- I don't want to waste

18   too much time on this, because I don't think it matters

19   because the insight behind section 706(e)(2) is that

20   every act that implements a facially discriminatory

21   system constitutes a fresh act of that intentional

22   discrimination.   And so there's no question --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But does the statute use

24   the term -- does the statute use the term "facially

25   discriminatory system"?

                           Alderson Reporting Company

1                 MR. RUSSELL:        No.      It uses the term

2    "intentionally discriminatory system."

3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Right.

4                 MR. RUSSELL:        And there's no dispute that a

5    facially discriminatory system discriminates

6    intentionally.   And so --

7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It is also clear that --

8    is it also clear that a statute -- that -- that a plan

9    that does not intentionally discriminate may,

10   nevertheless, discriminate facially?                    I think the two

11   things --

12                MR. RUSSELL:        Well, again, it's -- it's the

13   predicates that change.        It's a -- it can be a plan that

14   doesn't intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex

15   at the time, in the past.          But when it -- but it's clear

16   that it intentionally discriminates on the basis of

17   pregnancy.

18                And so then the question -- so then under

19   706(e)(2), under this Court's insight in Lorance, the

20   current application of that system constitutes a present

21   act --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes, but that was the

23   current application of a system that was plainly

24   discriminatory, intentionally discriminatory.                    Lorance

25   was.   They intentionally discriminated against women.

1                  MR. RUSSELL:        Yes.       The -- the intent behind

2    the system is imbued in every application of the system.

3    So a system that is intentionally discriminatory on the

4    basis of pregnancy discriminates intentionally on the

5    basis of pregnancy every time it's applied.              And the

6    question --

7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Go on, finish.   I --

8                  MR. RUSSELL:        And, under Section 706(e)(2),

9    the question is simply whether that discrimination is

10   unlawful at the time of application --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't understand why you

12   say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory

13   now.   You contend that right now it's facially

14   discriminatory.

15                 MR. RUSSELL:        Yes, it's --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It seems to me what the

17   retirement plan says is that there is deducted from your

18   seniority, for purposes of calculating what you get

19   under the plan, all periods in which you -- you were

20   lawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the

21   company.   Now, that doesn't seem to be facially

22   discriminatory at all.

23                 MR. RUSSELL:        I think it's -- the system is

24   facially discriminatory -- there are several parts.                One

25   is:    What set of rules constitutes a relevant seniority


                                        34

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    system?   And we think that the rule that says pregnancy

2    leave doesn't get full credit is as an accrual rule,

3    it's part of the seniority system.                   And that rule

4    discriminated on its face on the basis of pregnancy.

5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             No, but it didn't.       Not --

6    not during the period for which it is used in -- in the

7    retirement system.

8                 MR. RUSSELL:          There's no --

9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             After the new legislation

10   was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority.

11   But -- but during the period before that occurred, it

12   was not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was

13   lawfully not counted towards seniority.

14                So what you have is a retirement plan that

15   says all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work

16   are -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited

17   to the -- to the employees.              I don't see how that is

18   facially discriminatory.

19                MR. RUSSELL:          It facially discriminates on

20   the basis of pregnancy and then does so whether the

21   pregnancy discrimination was unlawful at the time or

22   not.   And under 706(e)(2), that -- that facially

23   discriminatory intent to discriminate on the basis of

24   pregnancy is carried forward today in every application.

25   And the whole point of the rule was simply to say that

1    we don't want to force employees to have to run into

2    court every time there's some discrimination --

3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is -- is there a difference

4    between "facially discriminatory" and "discriminatory

5    impact"?   I mean I can see how you could say it has a

6    discriminatory impact, but to say that on its face, when

7    all it says is that you are credited with all of the

8    periods in which you were lawfully working for the

9    company and you are not credited for periods in which

10   the company lawfully deemed you not to be working for

11   the company, I don't see how that is facially

12   discriminatory in -- in any sense.

13               MR. RUSSELL:         Well, that scenario, I think,

14   is indistinguishable from what happened in Bazemore.

15   Recall, in Bazemore, that the basic rule is you get paid

16   now today what we paid you before Title VII, plus a

17   nondiscriminatory raise.         And this Court said that that

18   is simply perpetuation of the pre-Act intentional race

19   discrimination, which wasn't unlawful at the time.           But

20   if you apply that system today, that constitutes a

21   present act of racial discrimination subject to the

22   present requirements of Title VII.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did it say it was facially

24   discriminatory?   I'm -- I'm just talking about your --

25   your assertion that it's facially discriminatory.           Did

1    Basemore more say it was facially discriminatory?

2                 MR. RUSSELL:        No, Bazemore did not use that

3    term.   But this Court, in Ledbetter, assumed that the

4    rationale of Bazemore was the rationale this Court gave

5    in Lorance, which was that it involved a --

6    intentionally a systematic system of discrimination

7    that, even though it was lawful when it was instituted

8    -- was first instituted, its carrying over into the

9    present era subjects it to the requirements of Title VII

10   now.

11               And I don't think it's -- it's fairly

12   distinguishable because what the employer in Bazemore

13   did is -- is simply what AT&T has done here.            At the

14   time Title VII took effect, the employer in Bazemore

15   stopped giving discriminatory base salaries and stopped

16   giving discriminatory pay raises, but it just added to

17   that base salary in a nondiscriminatory manner, in the

18   same way that AT&T stopped discriminating in the amounts

19   that it added to accrued seniority.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, but in Bazemore each

21   paycheck was discriminatory.

22               MR. RUSSELL:         It was discriminatory in the

23   sense that it paid unequal wages for equal work.            And

24   here our pension checks give unequal compensation for

25   equal amounts of service to the company.

1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the reason for that is

2    because they adopted a plan a long time ago that was

3    lawful.

4                 MR. RUSSELL:         Well, the same thing was true

5    in Bazemore.   They had adopted --

6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            They're not applying a

7    plan in Bazemore.    They're paying a current salary.

8    They're paying black people less than whites just

9    because they are black.

10                MR. RUSSELL:         They were applying a pay

11   structure that was adopted --

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, they were still

13   paying -- each paycheck was a discriminatory paycheck.

14   It didn't depend on history; whereas, a pension plan --

15   they always look at the formation of the plan.             At least

16   under subsection (h), I think you do.

17                MR. RUSSELL:         The paychecks were in -- in

18   Bazemore were intentionally discriminatory only insofar

19   as you look back to the pre-Title VII --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:            And that's what I disagree

21   with.   It seems to me if you look at the present in

22   Bazemore, you find they are getting different salaries

23   because of the difference in -- one is of one race, and

24   the other is of another race.

25                MR. RUSSELL:         And the same is true here.

1    Our clients are giving --

2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           The -- the point that is

3    not true that -- that Justice Stevens is bringing out is

4    that, in this case, you had a plan which was established

5    at a time when the plan was -- was lawful.                    And, in

6    effect, you are saying there is -- there is no value to

7    be given to any reliance interest on the part of the

8    company that established the plan when it funded

9    according -- prior to the passage of the Act, when --

10   when it -- it calculated it's funding on the basis of

11   what was, in fact, lawful conduct.                 And you are saying

12   that is irrelevant.     You didn't have that factor in

13   Bazemore.

14               MR. RUSSELL:        It's not irrelevant.              It's

15   simply something that this Court has traditionally taken

16   into account at the remedial stage.                    The Court has --

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, how would it do that?

18               MR. RUSSELL:        Well, the -- in Florida v.

19   Long -- there's a long line of cases where this Court --

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, you're -- you're not

21   asking the Court to do that, are you?                    You -- you're

22   saying, look, pay -- pay pension benefits to these

23   people exactly as they would have been calculated if, in

24   fact, their pregnancy had been treated as whatever the

25   regular sick leave was, so that they would get full

1    credit for the time they were out.                  You're -- you're not

2    asking for any remedial order that gives them anything

3    less than 100 percent of what they want.

4                  MR. RUSSELL:        We're not asking for that

5    because we don't think that there are substantial

6    reliance interests that are -- with respect to the --

7    the liquidity of the -- the pension plan that are

8    affected here.    My point is simply that --

9                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           How -- how do we -- you

10   think that?   How do we know that?

11                 MR. RUSSELL:        Well --

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           How do we know -- maybe --

13   maybe I can put the same question in a different way.

14   Let's assume -- and this isn't a bizarre assumption here

15   -- that we've got two lines of cases, and we could rely

16   on either of those lines of cases, go one way if -- if

17   we rely on line a, and go another way if we rely on line

18   b.

19                 What are the good reasons, apart from simply

20   statements of the cases themselves, to go with the one

21   line or the other line?         One reason would be reliance

22   interests in setting up a pension plan to distinguish

23   this from Bazemore.      How are we in a position to make

24   that judgment?

25                 MR. RUSSELL:        I don't think you are, which

1    is why I do think that it's perfectly appropriate for

2    this Court to do what it did in cases like Manhart,

3    which is to say there's one definition of

4    "discrimination" under Title VII, and it's not going to

5    vary depending on whether we're talking about the

6    pension plan or something else.

7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but doesn't the

8    risk or the potential of a fixed-fund pension plan where

9    employees who are not parties to this action receive

10   less?   Isn't there at least that possibility?

11                MR. RUSSELL:        There's only that --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And shouldn't that

13   possibility be weighed in the decision of this Court?              I

14   think that's the line of questioning here.

15                MR. RUSSELL:        And my suggestion is, number

16   one, that there's no realistic possibility of that here.

17   But, number two, that that's a --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And there's no realistic

19   possibility that some pensions are based on a fixed fund

20   which has been established already?

21                MR. RUSSELL:        I don't think so.      If you are

22   talking about a defined benefit plan, which is what we

23   have here, any increases in liability simply mean that

24   the employer has to --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I take it that this

1    decision you want us to write applies across the board

2    to all plaintiffs.

3                 MR. RUSSELL:          I think that it does, but I

4    think that it could quite possibly apply differently,

5    for example, through a 401(k) plan where the

6    discrimination would have occurred at a time when people

7    are making running contributions.                  But ultimately, I

8    mean, I think that this Court has taken into account

9    those kinds of things at the remedial phase, where you

10   have an opportunity to look at the facts about how this

11   would affect the pension in this case or pensions

12   generally.

13                There's simply no evidence here to suggest

14   that there are those kinds of problems, because very few

15   employers as far as we can tell continue this kind of

16   discrimination.   Most have eliminated it decades ago.

17   And we're talking about a small subset of employees and

18   relatively small amounts of money with respect to each

19   of them.   So I think --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Russell, what do you

21   say to Mr. Phillips' argument that you brought -- you

22   brought essentially this case way back when, that the

23   union said that this retirement plan is in violation of

24   Title VII?

25                MR. RUSSELL:          Well, first of all, I mean, my

1    individual-named clients didn't bring those claims back

2    then; and they lost, the union that brought this claim.

3    And then there were -- if I recollect correctly, they

4    were challenging at that moment the denial of their

5    disability leave payments.            They weren't coming in and

6    saying simply, you know, the only harm we're facing now

7    is the prospect in the future of a lower pension.

8                 And that's the kind of hypothetical future

9    harm that we don't think Congress would have intended to

10   be the basis of a lawsuit, not -- one of the -- when the

11   entire purpose of enacting 706(e)(2) was that Congress

12   was concerned not to require employees to run to court

13   every time there is some discrimination that affects the

14   amount of their seniority, because that causes a

15   disruption to the employment atmosphere, it creates work

16   for the EEOC and the courts, and in many, many cases the

17   marginal difference in the amount of the seniority

18   credit we are talking about here will make no big

19   difference at all to anything.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, when you say there's

21   relatively little amounts of money, can you tell us what

22   amount -- what the maximum amount would be involved?

23   Are you --

24                MR. RUSSELL:          I think -- and we haven't had

25   discovery on this.      I think there is a fairly linear

1    relationship between the amount of leave and the

2    percentage of the pension check, and so we're talking in

3    between --

4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would it be less than

5    $100,000?

6                  MR. RUSSELL:         Per person?

7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would it be -- for the

8    whole suit?

9                  MR. RUSSELL:         No.      It would be more than

10   that.   It would be about half of a percent to maybe two

11   and a half percent per person.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would that be a million --

13   a million dollars?

14                 MR. RUSSELL:         It could be millions of

15   dollars.    And the plan that --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that -- that's a small

17   amount of money, a million -- millions of dollars?

18                 MR. RUSSELL:         It's a small amount of money

19   to a plan that has tens of billions of dollars in it.

20   AT&T's last report to the SEC said they had a

21   $17 billion surplus in that fund.                  There's no question

22   that this is going to bankrupt this particular fund.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what do you do

24   about section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we

25   have held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona

1    fide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of

2    pre-Act discrimination?

3                MR. RUSSELL:        The distinction between 703(h)

4    and this case is that, in this case, we challenge a

5    system, a seniority system that is itself facially

6    discriminatory, and 703(h) says that doesn't apply --

7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That hinges -- that hinges

8    on your "facially discriminatory."

9                MR. RUSSELL:        It does.          And in addition, we

10   also have the argument that the Ninth Circuit accepted,

11   but -- that the PDA on its own terms says, that 703(h)

12   doesn't apply to permit discrimination that the PDA

13   itself would forbid.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, yes, that's -- that's

15   rather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination

16   and even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover

17   pregnancy discrimination.         I mean, I --

18               MR. RUSSELL:        You may think that, but --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You need pretty clear

20   language to persuade me of that.

21               MR. RUSSELL:        I think that in the end, I

22   mean, it's worthwhile to focus on the consequences of

23   accepting AT&T's view.      On the better view, it depends

24   mightily on whether an employer keeps a running tab on

25   seniority, in which case they can avoid the application


                                      45
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    of the PDA because it made the calculation beforehand,

2    and an employer who, at the end of an employee's career,

3    simply tabulates the term of employment, which I think

4    under their view subjects that employer to the current

5    requirements of the PDA.           And we respectfully suggest

6    that Congress wouldn't intend Title VII to turn on such

7    trivial distinctions.

8                   Moreover, under their view, an employer

9    who -- an employer would be able to pay black workers

10   today smaller pensions than white workers who provided

11   exactly the same amount of service, if those black

12   workers started working for it before Title VII was

13   enacted, at a time when the employer had no pension

14   system for blacks and didn't give them any seniority

15   credit.   That employer could say the same thing AT&T

16   says here, which is that the present disparity in

17   pension benefits is simply the present effect of

18   discrimination that was lawful when it occurred.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You mean there are a lot

20   more suits coming behind this one --

21               MR. RUSSELL:           Well, I don't think --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- for any kind of

23   discrimination that preceded Title VII?                   When was Title

24   VII enacted?

25               MR. RUSSELL:           1964.

3                MR. RUSSELL:        There are.             There are, but

4    it's very unlikely that there are very many of them

5    subject to this kind of --

7                (Laughter.)

8                MR. RUSSELL:        Well, let me reassure you,

9    because I think most employers, unlike AT&T, have --

10   don't make those kinds of distinctions with respect to

11   their employees who were hired before and after the

12   effective dates of the relevant provisions of Title VII.

13   And I think it's --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:           I take it you are not

15   saying anything that is in effect and is still there,

16   you do retro, you win.       I take it -- maybe I am not

17   right, but I take it that what -- what the point is here

18   is that you -- you took a complicated superstructure of

19   rules that was creating boxes and those boxes were

20   created on the basis of discrimination.                  Then you move

21   it, whole cloth, into the post-new world.                  And it's the

22   administration of that complicated system of rules that

23   was created out of the discrimination, but it's

24   administration today that makes it like Bazemore.

25               MR. RUSSELL:        Yes, that's -- that's right.

1    That the present implementation of the system subjects

2    it to the present-day requirements of Title VII.

3                JUSTICE BREYER:              It does that, but what I

4    can't figure out is does that have a lot of implication

5    for other areas or not?          And the other thing I'm not

6    sure of is how it squares with Ledbetter.

7                MR. RUSSELL:           Well, the difference between

8    Ledbetter and this case is Ledbetter involved

9    discrimination entirely outside of the seniority system,

10   and as a result, it didn't -- 706(e)(2) didn't apply;

11   this Court's decision in Lorance didn't apply.                 And

12   Congress enacted this 706(e)(2) to provide a very

13   special rule to displace the rule of evidence.                 It was

14   -- it was unambiguously intended to displace the rule of

15   evidence with respect to intentionally discriminatory

16   seniority systems.

17               MR. RUSSELL:           Evans isn't a problem because

18   the rule they were administering in Evans is whoever is

19   hired is in fact hired at low seniority.                  Now, it's hard

20   to say that that's a complicated system of rules that

21   had a pre-existence, even though this individual was

22   where she was because of that earlier system.

23               MR. RUSSELL:           Again, I think the distinction

24   between Evans and this case is discrimination that

1    and discrimination within the seniority system that

2    gives unequal credit for equal service.                    And Congress

3    said of that kind of discrimination -- we're not going

4    to make you challenge immediately.                  We're going to let

5    you wait until the reduced seniority has a concrete

6    effect on your compensation or other terms and

7    conditions of employment, and then you can raise it

8    then.

9                  And the underlying thought of the provision

10   is that if you are subject to intentional discrimination

11   with respect to seniority accrual, we are going to

12   impute that intent to the subsequent applications of

13   that seniority system when it's applied to injure you.

14   And if --

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I still want to go back to

16   assure that I've given you a fair opportunity to answer

17   this.    You are relying on Nashville v. Satty, which was

18   a discriminatory impact case, and now you are arguing

19   that the key is the -- is the intent.                    Which is it?

20                MR. RUSSELL:         We make alternative arguments.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Oh, okay.

22                MR. RUSSELL:         We argue that to the extent it

23   matters whethers this was lawful at the time our clients

24   took their leave, it was not unlawful, and we point to

25   Satty.   But we say ultimately that doesn't matter

1    because under section 706(e)(2), so long as they

2    implement, so long as they rely on the diminished

3    seniority in the present, that constitutes a present act

4    of pregnancy discrimination, intentional pregnancy

5    discrimination, which is unlawful under the PDA.

6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, as soon as you get

7    back to the intentional, you get away from Satty.

8                 MR. RUSSELL:        Yes, I agree with that.

9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Oh, okay.

10               MR. RUSSELL:         But I don't think there can be

11   any dispute that when my clients had their seniority

12   reduced, it was an act of facial pregnancy

13   discrimination; and under 702 -- 706(e)(2), that intent

14   to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy is --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But it was not unlawful at

16   the time it was done.

17               MR. RUSSELL:         I do think it was unlawful,

18   but it doesn't matter with respect to 706(e)(2).

19               If I could turn briefly to the retroactivity

20   argument:   It's important to be clear what the Ninth

21   Circuit held and what it didn't hold.                   It did not hold

22   that AT&T was liable for anything it did prior to the

23   effective date of the PDA.          It didn't, for example, hold

24   that it was liable simply because it moved the NCS dates

25   or because it relied on them in any way before the


                                       50
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    effective date of the PDA.           All it said was that AT&T is

2    precluded from relying on that discriminatory measure of

3    service in the future.

4                 And in that sense, this case is quite like

5    this Court's decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Company,

6    where the Court said Title VII prohibits employers from

7    relying on the results of discriminatory employment

8    tests.    Now, nobody thought that that meant that Title

9    VII subjected to liability employers who administered or

10   relied on those tests before the effective date of Title

11   VII, but everybody understood that they couldn't rely on

12   those results after the effective date of Title VII, and

13   nobody thought that that gave the statute a retroactive

14   effect.

15                And that's all that the Ninth Circuit

16   interpreted the PDA to do here, is to prohibit AT&T from

17   engaging in the post-Act reliance on those pre-Act

18   discriminatory measures, that AT&T had every opportunity

19   to conform its -- to conform its conduct to the -- to

20   the requirements of the PDA, and a statute that simply

21   tells an employer how it has to treat past events for

22   future employment decision purposes is simply not a

23   statute that has a retroactive effect.

24                Finally, I'd like to -- if I have time, I'd

25   like to address this suggestion from the Solicitor

1    General's Office that this doesn't involve seniority

2    discrimination at all because what we are talking about

3    here is discrimination that occurred with respect to the

4    personnel policy about the classification of leave, as

5    opposed to discrimination within the seniority system

6    itself.

7                And this Court was clear in California

8    Brewers that an accrual rule that says how time counts

9    for seniority purposes is part of the seniority system.

10   And under AT&T's system, it's true you have to apply a

11   two-part rule.   You have to know whether -- if you are

12   asked, does this pregnancy leave count, you have to ask,

13   well, is it personal leave?            But that doesn't tell you

14   anything until you apply the second part of the rule

15   that says pregnancy leave counts as -- as personal

16   leave.

17               And because you need to know the answers to

18   -- to both of those questions, both parts of the rules

19   are properly considered to be part of the accrual rule

20   and part of the seniority system.

21               Finally, if I -- if I could return once

22   again to this alternative argument that we have, that

23   even setting aside Bazemore and section 706(e)(2), this

24   is not -- our clients weren't required to challenge this

25   discrimination before because it wasn't an completed,

1    unlawful employment practice at the time.

2                 And, again, the point is that discrimination

3    with respect to a small amount of time going towards

4    seniority doesn't affect even the worker's actual

5    seniority, that is, her place in the seniority

6    hierarchy.   A worker who is 2 years' junior to the

7    person who is next in line above her and 2 years' senior

8    to the person next in line below her -- 6 weeks of

9    service credit aren't going to make any difference with

10   respect to her place on the seniority hierarchy.                     It's

11   not going to make any difference with respect to her

12   ability to bid for jobs.         And it's not necessarily even

13   going to make any difference with respect to her

14   pension, because at the time that these leaves are taken

15   typically, the person is years away, perhaps decades

16   away, from even vesting in their pension benefit.

17                And Congress reasonably would have thought,

18   I think, that that kind of harm is too speculative to

19   warrant immediate -- to warrant the requirement that the

20   employees have to immediately challenge that kind of

21   discrimination at the time it occurs.                   That's why

22   Congress enacted section 706(e)(2), to give employees an

23   opportunity to wait until the discrimination has a

24   concrete effect on their employment status, on their

25   compensation or terms of employment.                    And AT&T's view of

1    the statute --

2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Are you -- are you making

3    a claim that they had the choice or that the claim

4    wasn't ripe until they felt the impacts of it?

5                  MR. RUSSELL:        I think they don't have a

6    choice.    They can't bring the claim until it has a

7    concrete impact.

8                  Now, if 706(e)(2) applies, they can

9    challenge the system as of -- when it's adopted or when

10   it's applied to them, but otherwise they have to wait

11   until it injures them within the meaning of section

12   706(e)(2).   And that's a perfectly sensible rule.

13                Remember, we're talking here about facial

14   discrimination, and the concerns about stale evidence

15   are not particularly strong here because -- and, as a

16   result, we are able to stipulate to the underlying

17   facts.    Everybody knows what the system was and what it

18   did.   And there's no reasonable dispute about whether

19   the reduction in our clients' leaves was as a result of

20   pregnancy versus something else.                And in any event, this

21   is simply a consequence Congress must have intended when

22   it said that discriminatory seniority systems are open

23   to challenge whenever they apply to injure a worker,

24   even if that means that so long -- if an employer

25   implements a plan for 30 years, Congress understood that

1    that meant that they were subject to suit for 30 years.

2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr.

3    Russell.

5               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

6                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8                 I'd just like to make a couple of points:

9    Justice Ginsburg, you asked a question about the earlier

10   litigation, and let me just quote from the first page of

11   Judge Bright's opinion where it says the appellants in

12   the class action allege that Southwestern Bell

13   discriminates against women by, quote, "refusing to

14   extend full seniority credit to female employees on

15   maternity leave."    That is precisely the claim that's

16   being litigated in this particular case.

17                And contrary to my brother's position just a

18   few minutes ago, that these don't have any impact and

19   why would anybody act on the basis of them, it seems to

20   me that that lawsuit belies that fact.                   They recognize

21   the impact on seniority, and they acted immediately as a

22   consequence of that.

23                Justice Souter, I do agree with you.                  I

24   think the reason that Bazemore is not the -- I wouldn't

25   say "line" -- more the point of authority to be as the


                                        55
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    departure in this particular case is because of the

2    implications for the seniority system.

3                 Justice Kennedy, the problem here is we

4    don't know exactly what the impact's going to be.                   What

5    we do know is that all plans are funded on a set of

6    actuarial assumptions, and, candidly, if they say we

7    were overfunded a couple months ago, given to what has

8    happened to my pension plans in the last couple of

9    months, I would worry a little bit about what the

10   situation is.

11               But the -- but the most fundamental point is

12   you don't know.   And in that context, what we do

13   understand is that Congress routinely says protect the

14   seniority systems, protect the pension plans.                   You know,

15   my colleague says, well, but this is all form over

16   substance because what if they come back at the end and

17   decided to do all these calculations?                   That

18   fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the pension

19   process.   You have to fund these in advance.                  You make

20   actuarial assumptions.       No one is in a position where

21   they're going to allow the determination of seniority to

22   be made at the tail end without making assumptions about

23   what they are going to be like going in.

24               And, Justice Breyer, I think that is the

25   answer to your question because we are not taking this


                                       56

1    complex system wholesale and just dumping it post-PDA.

2    What we did is we retained the specific rules with

3    respect to the accrual and the seniority, and we

4    eliminated the underlying distinctions between pregnancy

5    and other kinds of disabilities.                And that's how we

6    apply it, and that, frankly, is fundamentally different

7    from Bazemore because we are not discriminating every

8    day in a way that harms them.              We made a seniority

9    decision, like a pay decision, pre-Act; now we are

10   acting -- it's not a pay decision post-Act.                 And it's --

11   to my mind in that sense it is just like Evans and that

12   line of cases.

13                Finally, you asked the question, Justice

14   Souter, could Congress have done -- have done exactly

15   what the Respondents ask?           And the answer to that is

16   yes.    Congress could say today we're not going to allow

17   this.   It would upset a lot of pension plans.                It would

18   upset a lot of expectations.

19                Congress could have done it.                Congress

20   didn't do it, or at least if it were going to upset all

21   of those reliance interests, Congress would have done so

22   in language that was much more explicit than what it has

23   done in the PDA and 706(e)(2).

24                If there are no further questions, Your

25   Honor, I urge you to reverse the judgment below.
