 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               GEN. KNEEDLER:           Mr. Chief Justice and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo

12   Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same

13   action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's

14   approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in

15   the mid-1980s. The Court held there that in order for

16   the United States to be held liable under the Tucker Act

17   or the Indian Tucker Act, the claimant must specify at

18   the threshold a specific rights-creating or

19   duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription that

20   the government has allegedly violated.

21               The Court found no warrant in any relevant

22   statute or regulation to impose liability on the United

23   States.   In particular, the Court concluded that the

24   approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was

25   governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or


                                         3

 1   IMLA.   Looking at IMLA's framework, the Court held that

 2   there was no, quote, "textual basis," close quote, in

 3   any pertinent statutory or regulatory provision that

 4   required the Secretary to insist that the tribe

 5   negotiate for a higher rate.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it said

 7   "pertinent or relevant," but surely that's limited to

 8   the statutory provisions that we examined in the case.

 9               GEN. KNEEDLER:          But I think the way to look

10   at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant

11   in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed

12   not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which

13   did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the

14   economic terms of leases, but --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the question --

16               GEN. KNEEDLER:          -- didn't govern.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the question

18   presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the

19   Mineral Leasing Act.

20               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That was the government's

22   question presented.

23               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Two things about that.         The

24   government's question presented was that the Court could

25   not find the United States liable or -- was whether the


                                        4

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court could find the United States liable without

 2   finding a violation of IMLA.             And therefore, the premise

 3   of the question was, without finding a violation of

 4   IMLA, the United States could not be liable, and the

 5   Court found no violation of IMLA.

 6                But beyond that, the tribe's principal

 7   submission in this Court was that the United States had

 8   control through a network of statutes, including the

 9   ones they rely on here.         But the Court also itself on

10   page 30 of its brief in that case identified the

11   relevant statute as being IMLA and the other two that

12   this Court discussed and the general introduction to the

13   Rehabilitation Act.

14                So I think the structure of the Court's

15   opinion, looking at the way the tribe serves it up, the

16   Court said there has to be a specific violation of a --

17   of a statutory regulatory prescription.                  The Court found

18   that the relevant one was IMLA, and it found no

19   violation.   And therefore -- and the Court also said the

20   tribe's claim, not simply arguments made in favor of the

21   claim, must fail.

22                But if the Court concludes that its prior

23   decision did not absolutely foreclose the litigation, we

24   think it's clear that the framework that this Court

25   announced in -- or reaffirmed in Navajo 1 itself does


                                         5

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   foreclose the claim here.           As I said, the Court

 2   concluded that IMLA is the statute that governs the

 3   approval of royalty terms in coal leases.

 4                On remand, the Federal Circuit relied on two

 5   other statutes addressing other subjects, the Surface

 6   Mining Reclamation and Control Act, which has to do with

 7   the regulation of environmental issues and matters that

 8   may arise in connection with a coal lease, and the

 9   Hopi-Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950, which set in

10   motion a general governmental program to rehabilitate

11   and improve the economic life of the Navajo and Hopi

12   Indians.

13                But neither of those statutes had anything

14   to do with the approval of the economic terms of coal

15   leases.    That was governed by IMLA.                    So the fact that

16   the Federal Circuit on remand held the United States

17   liable on the basis of two statutes that have nothing to

18   do with coal leasing, minus the statute that did have

19   something to do with coal leasing, in our view shows how

20   far the Federal Circuit has strayed from this Court's

21   teachings.

22                But beyond that, we think it's a fortiori

23   that the court of appeals erred in its alternative

24   holding, which was that the United States could be held

25   liable on the basis of general common law principles.

 1   The Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act provide that

 2   the United States may be liable only for a violation of

 3   an act of Congress or a regulation.                     And it was for that

 4   reason that this Court stated in Navajo -- in the Navajo

 5   1 case that there has to be a violation of a specific

 6   statutory or regulatory provision.

 7                Even as a general matter, under this Court's

 8   jurisprudence, there is only a very limited role for

 9   Federal common law, but that is especially so when what

10   we are talking about here is liability for damages under

11   a waiver of sovereign immunity, and the usual sovereign

12   immunity principles have to cast considerable doubt on

13   that.   Only an act of Congress or a regulation adopted

14   pursuant to congressionally conferred authority can

15   provide for the payment of money out of the Federal

16   Treasury under our Constitution.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are there cases in the

18   courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the

19   Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way

20   in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect

21   to Indian lands?

22                GEN. KNEEDLER:         Under the Administrative

23   Procedure Act, there could be -- there could be claims

24   brought, but those would not be for money damages.

25   They're --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I -- I recognize that, but

 2   I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal

 3   Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the

 4   Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable

 5   as a matter of administrative law?

 6                 GEN. KNEEDLER:          Not in the Federal Circuit,

 7   to my knowledge, because -- because the Administrative

 8   Procedure Act --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I meant all of the

10   circuits.

11                 GEN. KNEEDLER:          Yes.       No -- in the -- under

12   the Administrative Procedure Act -- I'm not -- just like

13   any party could claim -- could challenge what was done

14   by the Department taking particular administrative

15   action.     And I think there -- I think that was what --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, what I was asking

17   was whether there was some doctrine that the -- that the

18   trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a

19   fiduciary capacity as a trustee.                 If that doctrine were

20   out there, then that might be the basis for saying that

21   it's a sufficient foundation for a money damages.                 I was

22   just asking, is that doctrine there?

23                 GEN. KNEEDLER:          No, not -- not in the way

24   you put it.     But there are cases that certainly talk

25   about this, that the Secretary has trust


                                          8

 1   responsibilities.    But there are a lot of ways in which

 2   that concept can be used.           It can be used in a political

 3   sense in that the United States Government, through

 4   treaties or a general sense of moral responsibility,

 5   should look out for the Indians, and in the day-to-day

 6   administration of Indian affairs, to contemplate a trust

 7   responsibility is simply to mean that the United States

 8   has a special relationship and should deal in that

 9   manner.

10              And under the Administrative Procedure Act,

11   if there is -- if there is an action the United States

12   takes under a statute that governs Indian affairs, that

13   would be -- that would be subject to judicial review

14   under the general principles, is it arbitrary and

15   capricious under normal principles, does substantial

16   evidence sustain the determination?

17              But, particularly in a suit for money

18   damages under the -- under the Tucker Act and where

19   Congress has said there has to be a violation of a

20   money-mandating statute or regulation, general common

21   law principles do not suffice.               As I said, for money

22   damages, only Congress or an executive agency under --

23   acting pursuant to congressional authority under the

24   Constitution can provide for the payment of -- of money

25   out of the Federal Treasury.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I -- this may be a

 2   purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of

 3   liability.   Are you suggesting that the trust principles

 4   do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound,

 5   or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of

 6   sovereign immunity?

 7                GEN. KNEEDLER:         I think it's really both.

 8   The general trust principles, at least -- at least again

 9   under Tucker Act jurisprudence, general trust principles

10   are not what establish the Secretary's duties.                It's the

11   acts of Congress that impose duties on the Secretary in

12   this area as in any other, or regulations the Secretary

13   has prescribed under it.

14                Now under this Court's jurisprudence, the

15   Court has said that the notion of trust is relevant at

16   the second stage of the analysis.                The first stage is

17   the threshold requirement that there be a specific

18   statute or regulation that imposes duties or rights.                  If

19   the Court finds that, then at the second stage, as this

20   Court has held in Mitchell 2 and indicated in Navajo as

21   well, that may be relevant to determine whether those

22   specific duty-imposing statutes in turn also impose

23   monetary liability on the United States for violation.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:         Under both IMLA and the

25   Rehabilitation Act, leases have to be approved by the

 1   Secretary.    Doesn't that impose a duty on the Secretary?

 2                GEN. KNEEDLER:           Well, what the Court said in

 3   Navajo specifically with respect to IMLA, the Secretary,

 4   yes, does have to approve it, but the Court specifically

 5   rejected the proposition that there was any basis for

 6   liability stemming from the Secretary's approval of the

 7   lease.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, under the

 9   Rehabilitation Act, if it applied to this lease, what

10   would the Secretary's duty be?

11                GEN. KNEEDLER:           Section 5 of the

12   Rehabilitation Act for approval of leases is essentially

13   the same as IMLA.     It provides for the Secretary to

14   approve the lease.      But, as this Court held in IMLA --

15   or in Navajo 1, the theory of IMLA is not to have the

16   Secretary be responsible or to take the lead in leasing

17   tribal lands for coal purposes.                It's the tribe, subject

18   to the approval, and the Court concluded it would be

19   inconsistent with that arrangement for the Secretary to

20   second-guess the determinations that the secretary had

21   made.    And the Court -- the argument was made there and

22   expressly rejected that the Secretary was required to

23   insist that the tribe negotiate a higher amount when it

24   renegotiated the lease.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:           The Secretary has to apply


                                         11

 1   some standard, presumably.            What is it?

 2               GEN. KNEEDLER:            What -- what the secretary

 3   has adopted -- has done is by regulation, is to say that

 4   -- that there is a minimum that the tribe cannot go

 5   below.   At the time -- at the time of the renegotiation

 6   of this lease in 1987, from 1984 to 1987, there was a

 7   minimum of 10 percent or 10 cents per ton.                The tribe

 8   was getting 37.5 cents per ton.                This lease was

 9   renegotiated in connection with a clause in the lease

10   that allowed adjustments for reasonable rates, which is

11   not the same thing as maximizing the tribe's -- the

12   tribe's revenues, so the Secretary had a regulation at

13   the time of 10 cents per ton.               The Secretary now has a

14   regulation that says the minimum royalty rate will be

15   12.5 percent, which, as Court pointed out in Navajo 1,

16   is the standard royalty rate for Federal and tribal

17   leases throughout the United States.

18               Now, what is significant, in further

19   response to your question, is that regulation states

20   that that minimum rate is 12.5 percent unless the

21   Secretary determines that a lower rate would be in the

22   best interest of the Indians.               So the way this works

23   then, the way the Secretary has implemented it, it's

24   basically up to the tribe to negotiate something at or

25   above the minimum.      If it's below the minimum that the


                                         12

 1   Secretary's prescribed, the Secretary has to make a

 2   judgment that that going lower, maybe because of a

 3   geological conditions or whatever, is in the best

 4   interest of the Indians.         And that is -- that is borne

 5   out --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is that in IMLA or is that

 7   in the Rehabilitation Act?

 8              GEN. KNEEDLER:           That's in IMLA.     That's an

 9   IMLA regulation.   The general regulations that implement

10   the Rehabilitation Act have a similar provision.            They

11   don't talk about royalties, which I think is telling

12   because royalties have to do with coal leases.            They

13   talk about -- they require it be a fair rental for

14   property, not a maximum rental but a fair rental.            And

15   then it has the same sort of thing, that if it's going

16   to be below the fair market value it has to be in the

17   best interest of the Indians.

18              And I think it's instructive that I know

19   there's been an argument that this lease is governed by

20   -- by the Rehabilitation Act rather than IMLA, and

21   notwithstanding what this Court held in Navajo 1 six

22   years ago, but in 1999 when Secretary Babbitt, who

23   joined the brief arguing this is covered by the

24   Rehabilitation Act, approved the amendments to the lease

25   in 1999, he approved it under the IMLA regulations and

 1   he specifically said that because the minimum royalty

 2   rate is 12.5 percent -- he is quoting the applicable

 3   regulation -- "I do not have to decide whether the

 4   royalty rate is in the best interest of the Indians."

 5   He went on to say:      "But I think it is."

 6               So secretary Babbitt's approval of those

 7   amendments really explains the way the Secretary has

 8   implemented the statutory scheme, and we think that's

 9   certainly well within the Secretary's discretion under a

10   statute that did not impose any limitations.                  With

11   respect to the Rehabilitation Act, the general leasing

12   provision of that act, as we've explained in our brief,

13   does not apply to mineral leases.                  That continued to be

14   governed by IMLA after 1950.              But even if it did, there

15   is nothing in section 5 that imposes any more specific

16   duties with respect to royalty terms or any other terms

17   than IMLA itself.     Section 5 has to do with surface --

18   leases for surface users, business purposes basically.

19   And that was put in there because at the time there was

20   no provision for long-term leases if somebody wanted to

21   bring a surface commercial venture onto a reservation.

22               But the last sentence of section 5 of the --

23   of the act on page 171a of the petition appendix says

24   that:   "Nothing contained in section 5 shall affect the

25   authority" -- "shall be construed to repeal or affect


                                         14

 1   the authority under any other act of Congress."                   So

 2   section -- and the other act of Congress here is IMLA.

 3              I think it's also -- I think it's also

 4   instructive to point out not only did this Court hold

 5   the last time around that the lease was governed by

 6   IMLA, that was the tribe's position in this case.                      Its

 7   proposed findings of fact indeed in the Court of Federal

 8   Claims, pages 524 and 525 of the joint appendix, said

 9   the lease was governed by IMLA.

10              But the textual dispositive point is that

11   the lease couldn't have been entered into under the

12   Rehabilitation Act.     The lease in this case provided

13   that the lease would be for a term of 10 years and then

14   subject to a further extension for as long as minerals

15   are produced in paying quantities.                 That precise

16   language is repeated in the lease, which shows that it

17   was under IMLA.

18              Under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act,

19   the lease could only be for an initial term of 25 years

20   and then a further term of 25 more years.                 It wouldn't

21   have allowed for this sort of lease here and indeed,

22   because the initial lease term here was 10 years and

23   then could have only been 25 more years under the Rehab

24   Act, this lease would have had to expire in 1999, and

25   yet it was amended at that time and continues in effect

 1   and mining continues under it.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:              The other side says that

 3   certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not

 4   exist in this lease.        Is that accurate?

 5               GEN. KNEEDLER:            No.      Well, they said -- I

 6   think -- the only thing I think they say along those

 7   lines is that -- has to do with the form of the lease.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:              With the forms?

 9               GEN. KNEEDLER:            The form on which the lease

10   is used.   I think what they said is there were several

11   provisions that appear in regulations under general

12   statutes that are related to leases.                      One has to do with

13   the property can't be used for unlawful purposes, and

14   I'm forgetting what the second one was.                      But it wouldn't

15   be unusual that the Secretary might borrow or a tribe

16   might borrow provisions from other leases and put them

17   in this lease.

18               This is -- again, IMLA provides for

19   negotiation.     So the parties are free to put in

20   particular provisions of lease.                So that the fact that

21   there might be things that would parallel what were in

22   the other leases we don't think is really dispositive.

23               Also, the other significant thing is that

24   the lease itself incorporates or refers to by reference

25   the IMLA regulations.        So even if somehow the lease were


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   thought to be governed by Section 5, even though that

 2   wasn't what it was issued under, the IMLA regulations

 3   would control, and this Court already held in Navajo 1

 4   that those IMLA regulations, which are in the lease, do

 5   not impose any -- did not impose any -- did not impose

 6   any duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval,

 7   approval of the lease.

 8              I should also point out that when the -- we

 9   cite this in our briefs, that at the time the lease

10   amendments were approved in 1987 the Solicitor's Office

11   did a legal review of the propriety of the lease

12   amendments and that legal review expressly says that the

13   lease was entered into under IMLA.

14              So I think the circumstances are really

15   overwhelming that it was entered into under IMLA and

16   that the Rehabilitation Act lease provision does not

17   have anything to do with this lease.                   And the more

18   general emanation from the Rehabilitation Act that the

19   tribe seeks to rely on here are too general and short.

20   The Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1950 in

21   recognition that the plight of the Navajo and Hopi was

22   very serious, and Congress undertook to study resources

23   and put in the infrastructure and that sort of thing,

24   and part of it was to have programs -- excuse me --

25   studies to determine what the tribe's coal resources


                                      17

 1   were, and that was done, and this lease grew out of

 2   that.   But that doesn't mean that it was in any way

 3   governed by the Rehabilitation Act.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            General Kneedler, the

 5   last time -- the last time around, we remanded for

 6   further proceedings consistent with our opinion.                      Would

 7   you advocate a different bottom line this time?

 8                 GEN. KNEEDLER:         Yes.       I would -- I would

 9   suggest that this case be reversed.                      I mean this -- this

10   concerns a -- outright and with directions to dismiss

11   the complaint.    This -- this controversy arose in the

12   mid-1980's.    The litigation has been going on since

13   1993, and it's been -- this is now the second time that

14   it's been -- that it's been to this Court.

15                 And we think in doing so that the -- that

16   the Court should reiterate the analytical framework that

17   it put forward in -- in its decision the last time

18   around so that there will be no mistaking the way these

19   cases are to be handled in the Federal circuit in the

20   future by requiring that the threshold, a -- as I said,

21   a specific statutory or regulatory provision that

22   imposes duties and not in particular looking at general

23   notions of common law that -- that might arise out of --

24   out of some sort of -- some sort of factual control.

25                 The last thing I wanted to say is that the


                                        18

 1   Federal circuit also relied on the Surface Mining

 2   Reclamation and Control Act.            And that -- and that, as I

 3   said, has to do with environmental issues in connection

 4   with -- with Indian leases.            The Federal circuit relied

 5   on a provision that says that the -- that the Secretary

 6   should include in any Indian leases additional

 7   provisions that were proposed by the tribe.                 But that's

 8   additional provisions in addition to other environmental

 9   provisions extending from the statute that had to be in

10   the lease.   It was -- it was just quite a stretch for

11   the -- for the court to conclude that that somehow

12   controlled the economic terms of the leases.

13                If there are no further questions, I will

14   reserve the balance of my time.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, General.

16                Mr. Phillips.

17                ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

18                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19                MR. PHILLIPS:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

20   and may it please the Court:

21                I think I would like to start with Justice

22   Alito's question because he said:                Doesn't Section 5 of

23   the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the

24   Secretary to approve this lease?               And Mr. Kneedler

25   conceded that it does.       And so then the question is:


                                       19
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Doesn't that create some kind of a duty?                  And it seems

 2   to me clearly it does, just as the Court I think

 3   implicitly said in Navajo 1, the difference between

 4   Navajo 1 and Navajo 2 being that this Court then went on

 5   to examine IMLA, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

 6               It concluded that IMLA very specifically for

 7   the entirety of native Americans and for the entirety of

 8   Indian mineral leasing had a preference to ensure that

 9   the Indian tribes themselves would -- would attain a

10   certain self sufficiency.          And it essentially advocated

11   the responsibility of having to deal with individual

12   negotiations and allowed it for the tribes to take over.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But, Mr. Phillips, I'm

14   looking at the last paragraph, and it says:                  We have no

15   warrant from any relevant statute or regulation, et

16   cetera.   So it wasn't limited to IMLA.                 Do you think

17   that was just carelessness on the Court's part?

18               MR. PHILLIPS:          Oh, I would -- I would never

19   assume that, Justice Ginsburg.              I -- I think -- I think

20   the operative term here is "relevant."                  And that is that

21   the Court for purposes of analyzing the question

22   presented and disposing of it evaluated not only IMLA

23   but the other two provisions that the -- that the

24   government and the Court felt needed to be disposed of

25   at that point.

 1               The Court didn't address the alternative

 2   arguments under either Macrow or the Rehabilitation Act.

 3   To be sure, they were argued.             But I -- I have seen many

 4   instances in which alternative arguments were made, and

 5   --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand your

 7   answer.   If you say that those were not relevant and,

 8   therefore, they were not covered --

 9               MR. PHILLIPS:          Not relevant to the question

10   presented, which is the proper interpretation of the --

11   the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.              And, indeed, if you

12   look at the other two provisions, the opinion of the

13   Court analyzing them through the -- through the prism of

14   the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, it says those don't add

15   to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

16               Our argument here is that Section 5 of the

17   Rehabilitation Act provides a wholly independent basis

18   on which there is a duty imposed, but that duty is then

19   implemented in the regulations that are identified in

20   the -- in the Secretary's --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            In the Rehabilitation Act,

22   the requirements for approval of lease, is -- is that

23   applicable to mineral leases?

24               MR. PHILLIPS:          Is that applicable to mineral

25   leases?

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yes.

 2                MR. PHILLIPS:           Absolutely, it's applicable

 3   to mineral leases.      The -- the language of the statute

 4   is "business leases, including those for the development

 5   of mineral resources."         So clearly it applies to Indian

 6   mineral leases, but --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I'm sorry.     Where is

 8   the specific reference to mineral leases, mineral

 9   resources?

10                MR. PHILLIPS:           Mineral resources.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It says "resources."

12   I don't remember it saying "mineral resources."

13                MR. PHILLIPS:           Yes, the development of the

14   "resources" for the Navajo and Hopi Indians.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That's a big

16   difference, don't you think?

17                MR. PHILLIPS:           I'm sorry.           The development

18   for utilization of natural resources.

19                But the basic point there is, at least as I

20   read section 5, what it's saying is that it grants broad

21   leasing authority.      The Solicitor General is absolutely

22   right about that.     But that authority extends to certain

23   kinds of mineral leasing.

24                And that says -- and that's an authority and

25   it's important to recognize this.                  Because while it is


                                         22
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   true for the run-of-the-mill Native Americans who are --

 2   who are engaged in mineral leasing it may make sense to

 3   say:   Look, we -- we are going to take a hands-off

 4   approach for the most part.            We are going to set a

 5   minimum ceiling or a minimum floor and above that you

 6   negotiate as hard as you want.

 7                But the -- but the Navajo were in a

 8   fundamentally different position in 1950 when this

 9   legislation was enacted.         The -- the median education on

10   that -- on that reservation was less than one year of

11   education.

12                The resources were $400 per year annual

13   income.   This was a tribe in horrible condition.           And so

14   it would make perfect sense for Congress to say:            Look,

15   for -- for most tribes we want to go ahead and have the

16   approval be based with the -- with the Secretary taking

17   a hands-off approach above a certain minimum, but when

18   you deal with the Navajo --

19                JUSTICE ALITO:         Is it your -- is it your

20   position that it would be -- that it -- it is not lawful

21   for coal on the Navajo Reservation to be leased under

22   IMLA, that the lease would have to be solely under

23   section 5 of the Rehabilitation --

24                MR. PHILLIPS:         No, I don't think it would

25   have to be solely under it.            I -- I think that's a -- a


                                       23
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   false dichotomy.     I don't think this is an either/or

 2   proposition.    I think there are parts of IMLA that can

 3   reasonably be applied here, and -- and section 5

 4   specifically says no authority from other statutes,

 5   which would include IMLA, is meant to be superseded by

 6   the passage of section 5.            So I think there is a rule.

 7         And I think that the lease -- if you read the

 8   lease on its face -- Justice Scalia asked the question:

 9   Does this lease conform to the form lease that you get

10   under IMLA?    The answer is clearly not.

11                 This is a mix and match between some

12   provisions, it seems to me, that clearly provides

13   additional protection for the Navajo and other

14   provisions that --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:          But the lease -- the lease

16   doesn't follow the -- the requirements of section 5 of

17   the Rehabilitation Act in -- in respect to its term.

18   But what is your -- is it your position that in entering

19   into a lease the tribe has the authority to decide that

20   we want this to be under IMLA; we want this to be under

21   the Rehabilitation Act?          When it comes up to the

22   Secretary for approval, does the Secretary have the

23   authority to say, I'm going to approve this under IMLA;

24   I'm going to approve it under section 5?

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:          I think the Secretary has to

 1   approve it under both of those provisions.                 It is just

 2   that IMLA in this particular context would impose a

 3   10-cent minimum over time.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What do you do about the

 5   fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be

 6   permitted under the Rehabilitation Act?

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:          I think it would be permitted

 8   under the Rehabilitation Act because the last sentence

 9   of section 5 specifically says that this is not meant to

10   limit any other authority provided under any other

11   statute.   And since IMLA provides additional time and

12   durational protections for the tribes under these

13   circumstances, that provision would definitely allow you

14   to use IMLA's time limits rather than the Rehabilitation

15   Act.

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       Explain to me the --

17   the relevant scope of IMLA and the Rehab Act.                 The --

18   the argument that you made, that you just made, makes

19   perfect sense if the Rehab Act applies to some kinds of

20   -- of leases or contracts that the -- that the IMLA does

21   not.

22               And yet I -- I thought you were saying a

23   little bit earlier that the Rehab Act applies to all

24   mineral leasing, because that would be the development

25   of the natural resource.         And if that is so, then there

 1   seems to be a pretty clear conflict, even on your own

 2   argument, between the term provisions in the Rehab Act

 3   and the term provisions of IMLA with respect to -- to

 4   mineral leases.    How do -- how do we get out of that

 5   problem for you?

 6              MR. PHILLIPS:            Yes.      I think the -- the key

 7   distinction is to look at the -- at who is being

 8   regulated, and under the Rehabilitation act it's the

 9   Navajo and the Hopi.       And -- and Congress said, look, we

10   are going to take special care to protect and to try to

11   put them into a position where they can even just catch

12   up to other Native Americans.

13              And so it seems to me that there is --

14   that's a special protection with a special duty, and

15   that duty is enforced through the 162 regulations.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But it's a special

17   protection and special duty that applies to every one of

18   the mineral leases, including this one, that the Navajo

19   may be involved in.

20              MR. PHILLIPS:            Correct.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:              So I -- what -- maybe --

22   maybe I missed the point, but would you go back to

23   justice Scalia's question:           How is it that there is not

24   a conflict here between this lease and the Rehab Act?

25              MR. PHILLIPS:            Because the last section


                                        26
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   under section 5 says that, notwithstanding anything

 2   else, this provision doesn't preclude -- doesn't --

 3   doesn't limit the authority that would otherwise exist.

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But that, in effect -- but

 5   that, in effect, is saying this -- this provision will

 6   never apply to a mineral lease with the Navajo or the

 7   Hopi.   I mean, you are reading it right out of the act

 8   with respect to these two tribes.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Which is all that the

10   Rehabilitation Act -- I'm sorry.

11               MR. PHILLIPS:           I'm sorry, it's because the

12   provision applies to a lot of other leases, too.             Are

13   you asking when the 20 or 10 and 10.

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:             With respect -- my point is

15   with respect to every mineral lease of the Hopi and the

16   Navajo, you are saying the term provision never applies.

17   Am I correct --

18               MR. PHILLIPS:           No, I understand.    Right.    I

19   have the answer your question which is this provision in

20   section 5 applies not just to mineral lease, it applies

21   to all business site leasing.

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But it only applies to

23   those two tribes.    And there is something very, very

24   strange, it seems to me, in saying that the -- that the

25   kind of -- the saving sentence at the end of section 5


                                        27

 1   reads its very term limit provisions out of every -- out

 2   of every possible application for mineral lease by these

 3   two tribes.    And that's what you are saying.

 4                 MR. PHILLIPS:         But -- but -- but the

 5   important distinction -- and I hope I can articulate

 6   this -- is that section 5 applies beyond mineral leases.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I realize that.

 8                 MR. PHILLIPS:         So that all -- so the time

 9   limitation of 10 years and 10 years, if you bring a

10   barber shop, you want to build a barber shop on those

11   lands, you want to lease the space in order to do that,

12   you would be subject to the section 5 time limitations,

13   unless for some reason there is another authorization

14   somewhere.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       But that, in effect,

16   means that -- and I don't want to overdo your barber

17   shop analysis or example, but that, in effect, says --

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I need a haircut.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- on -- on trivial lease

20   contracts there are term limits, but on the ones that

21   really count, where the real money is, doesn't apply at

22   all.

23                 MR. PHILLIPS:         There is a -- way beyond that

24   there is an entire defense plant on the Navajo tribe --

25   on the Navajo reservation right now that would obviously


                                        28

 1   be subject to precisely these same limitations.                 So it's

 2   not just trivial, it's all business lease citing that is

 3   covered why that.

 4                 So it seems to me not at all unreasonable to

 5   think that Congress, in its -- in its very protective

 6   effort here under section 5 would say, here are all the

 7   leases that you are allowed to enter into.                 You have

 8   broad leasing authority, we are going to protect you

 9   against overreaching by restricting how long you can go,

10   but if there are other provisions of law that allow

11   these to be modified in a particular area, we will allow

12   those to be modified in that way.

13                 And in this context, what that last sentence

14   would, in my mind, say is there is no reason to try

15   and -- to say that IMLA or the Rehabilitation Act.                 It

16   seems to me much more sensible to say that Congress

17   would have intended multiple protections for the Navajo.

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Let's assume that, and I --

19   I -- I think your argument is well taken.                 But assuming

20   that, don't we also have to assume that the stress in

21   IMLA on placing primary responsibility on the tribes,

22   not on the Secretary should, in fact, also be imported

23   to the application of the Rehab Act as you say it should

24   be applied.

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.        But you see I don't

 1   think that's an authority.          I would say -- I would not

 2   read --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:             What's not an authority?

 4              MR. PHILLIPS:           The notion that the Navajo

 5   tribe would be in a position to better -- to better --

 6   to -- I'm sorry, to achieve self-sufficiency.

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.       You made a good

 8   argument a few moments ago for the fact that it would

 9   have been at least at one time inappropriate to thrust

10   that responsibility on the Navajo, but there was no

11   Navajo exception in IMLA.          That responsibility was

12   thrust on the Navajo --

13              MR. PHILLIPS:           I'm sure there isn't --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:             -- and this Court

15   recognized that.

16              MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.        But that's exactly

17   why the Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950 does modify

18   IMLA.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              With respect to that --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Expired --

21              MR. PHILLIPS:           I'm sorry?

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- the opinion in the

23   last time around not only contained the statement that I

24   read before, that is, any relevant statute, but in the

25   very beginning it says, "We hold the tribe's claim for


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   compensation from the federal government failed," and

 2   there is a well known distinction between a claim at

 3   issue and attributing to the Court that kind of

 4   carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as

 5   distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA.          I

 6   think the Court was conscious of that distinction when

 7   it used the word that the claim failed, not just the

 8   issue.

 9              MR. PHILLIPS:           Obviously, Justice Ginsburg,

10   you are in a much better position to judge what was

11   intended here.   On the other hand, my experience with

12   the Court generally is that when you analyze a case,

13   that you analyze it in terms of the specific question

14   that is presented, and if you are posing to go beyond

15   the question presented, you say so expressly, not simply

16   by the use of the word "claim" or "argument."

17              So while I recognize that the Court -- that

18   the government has an argument to be made that has

19   pre-decided that, I think, frankly, one, the Court

20   didn't decide this issue; and two, the Court should

21   decide the question that was presented here as to the

22   scope of section 5, because it's obviously of

23   extraordinary importance to not only section 5 but also

24   to section 8 as well.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Phillips, the


                                       31

 1   government says that by the time this lease was

 2   executed, the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter.

 3   That it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the

 4   Navajo reservation, and there were funds appropriated

 5   for that purpose and that all had been played out by the

 6   time this lease was entered into.

 7                 Is there something wrong with that?

 8                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Yeah, the government's wrong

 9   about that.    I believe -- the program itself is for the

10   overall rehabilitation of the Navajo and the Hopi.

11   There are a series of projects that the -- where the

12   statute says such programs shall include the following

13   projects.   It doesn't say it's limited to the following

14   projects, and those projects have been set out over

15   time.

16                 But the program itself is not limited that

17   way and more fundamentally, it is completely

18   inconsistent with that kind of time limitation on the

19   statute overall.    Congress would have repealed certain

20   sections of this act, sections 9 and 10 after the

21   10-year period that expired if the statute didn't have

22   any continuing implication.

23                 It also would have meant that the leasing

24   protections in section 5 had expired after 10 years,

25   which seems to me quite inconsistent with the overall


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   purpose here to accomplish that.                 So I think the

 2   temporal argument doesn't get the government

 3   particularly far.

 4                I would like to take a second to talk about

 5   sort what I think is an important distinction between

 6   635 and other provisions, which is that 634(a) imposes a

 7   duty that the Secretary's brief, I think, evidently sets

 8   out, that duty means that you have to make sure there is

 9   fair market value, that those are reasonable rates, and

10   that was not done.      So that's the violation that took

11   place.

12                Then the question is, is there a

13   money-generating, money-mandating obligation imposed

14   here.    And there it seems to be the distinction between

15   635(a), which said nothing about liability, and 635(b)

16   and (c), which expressly -- expressly excludes the

17   possibility of liability, suggests clearly why 635(a)

18   ought to be viewed by this Court as a sufficient -- as

19   creating a fair inference, is what the Court said in

20   Mitchell two, a fair inference under these particular

21   circumstances.

22                The other issue that we have put on the

23   table that the government didn't actually address in its

24   opening, although I have to suspect --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:             So you are saying that


                                         33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates a

 2   fiduciary duty?

 3               MR. PHILLIPS:           No, 635(a) creates the

 4   fiduciary duties.    The juxtaposition of (a) to (b) and

 5   (c) demonstrates that that duty is a money-mandating or

 6   rights-creating duty that's enforceable under the Indian

 7   Tucker Act, Justice Breyer.

 8               The other duty, it seems to me, that the

 9   Secretary breached there is the duty embedded in section

10   8 of this statute, which requires him to make

11   disclosures as part of this program.                     And the one thing

12   that is absolutely clear that the Court of Federal

13   Claims --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             That's the part that I'm

15   not getting. You are saying -- the question, I guess,

16   basically is, does the language of 635(a) that says with

17   the approval of the Secretary, the Indians can, among

18   other things, for business purposes lease the land.

19   Right?   That's what it says?

20               MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.        And then --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:             And that doesn't seem much

22   different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me.

23   It doesn't seem different at all.                 But now you are

24   saying, no, it's really different because look at (b)

25   and (c), that's your basic argument?


                                        34

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:           I look at (b) and (c) and

 3   it says -- when you lease something under (b) and (c)

 4   which is not (a) -- (b) and (c) -- you have to have this

 5   all supervision, and so forth, or it has to be at a fair

 6   value, something like that; is that right?

 7                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, it doesn't -- it

 8   doesn't --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER: (B) and (c) say that land is

10   owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't

11   want to delay you on this.          I thought that (b) and (c),

12   you were saying, create an obligation -- create more of

13   a trust obligation.

14                MR. PHILLIPS:         No, just to read (b) which

15   unfortunately isn't reproduced I don't think in any of

16   the papers, but it says notwithstanding any other

17   provision of law, land owned in fee simple by the Navajo

18   may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of by the sole

19   authority of the tribal council in any manner that a

20   similar land in this State is situated may be leased,

21   sold or otherwise disposed of by other private land

22   owners, and the -- such disposition shall create no

23   liability on the part of the United States.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           So why does that -- why

25   does that mean that this Act creates a trust

 1   relationship?

 2                MR. PHILLIPS:         No, that -- the -- the trust

 3   relationship doesn't come out of the PNC; the money

 4   creating component of it, it seems to me comes, out of

 5   PNC.   The trust relationship comes from the fact that

 6   the entirety of the statute was enacted to implement the

 7   treaties, that these are all lands that are held in

 8   trust, and that -- and that there is a specific duty

 9   embedded in (a) that requires that the Secretary approve

10   what is otherwise basically controlled as a trust

11   arrangement, and that is implemented through regulations

12   that require the Secretary to do this under a fair

13   market value standard.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, give me an -- an

15   instance in the statute that is in opposition brief of

16   the orange brief at page 5.            Give me an example of why

17   the last clause "and such disposition shall create no

18   liability on the part of the United States," what

19   contingency was that directed to if not the one that is

20   before us?

21                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, that's for the sale of

22   fee simple lands, so you are dealing with a very

23   different set of -- of circumstances.                   Which is talking

24   about -- it's aimed clearly at a different set of

25   properties that were being held and therefore they said,


                                       36

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   when you engage in leases for that kind of property,

 2   there is no liability.

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But your -- your argument

 4   is that simply because there isn't that kind of an

 5   exclusion in (a), there must have been an intent to

 6   permit liability.

 7              MR. PHILLIPS:            A fair inference, I think is

 8   all I have to demonstrate --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:              Thank you, but now what of

10   course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see,

11   if this -- is this statute stronger for you than the

12   statute we already considered?               And I start with some

13   suspicion, because I think if it is a stronger statute

14   for you, you would have argued it the last time.                 So I

15   wonder why you didn't.

16              MR. PHILLIPS:            I wasn't here then.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:              So somebody thought maybe

18   it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that

19   suspicion aside.

20              MR. PHILLIPS:            Can I ask you --

21              JUSTICE BREYER:              So anyhow that's the

22   fundamental question in my mind.                I look at the language

23   and so forth, but the language doesn't seem any stronger

24   for you, at least at first blush.

 1   are two answers; I was being facetious as to why we

 2   didn't push this argument the last time.                 It was largely

 3   because the Federal Circuit concluded the last time

 4   based on IMLA alone that there was in fact a sufficient

 5   right-creating provision.           And therefore we depended --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So did you, Mr. Phillips.

 7   Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease

 8   was governed only by IMLA.           That -- those words were

 9   from your brief last time around.

10                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I don't know if those were

11   from the brief.    I know there was a statement of

12   undisputed facts in the first round of litigation.                But

13   there is no question in the Court -- if we are right,

14   that the Court remanded to -- from consideration

15   consistent with this.       We then went down upon remand

16   from the Federal Circuit; we took additional discovery;

17   and we obtained the information that we got.                And also,

18   remember, the United States' brief in the Ninth Circuit

19   specifically says that this was approved pursuant to the

20   Rehabilitation Act --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought -- you are

22   really saying that you were wrong in make that

23   concession.

24                 MR. PHILLIPS:         That was an overstatement,

25   there's no question.       Based on what we knew at the time,

 1   we thought it was in fact an IMLA lease, but in truth --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                In -- IMLA --

 3              MR. PHILLIPS:             -- is it's not IMLA, anyway.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But it is the statute

 5   that seems most closely on point, because it's the only

 6   one that talks about mineral leases exclusively.

 7              MR. PHILLIPS:             Yes, but this is the only one

 8   that deals specifically with the Navajo Reservation and

 9   deals with leasing for business purposes for the

10   development of resources.            And so while I -- I agree

11   with you in one sense, the other one has a -- some

12   superficial closeness here.              It seems to me that the

13   closer one is actually the provision that deals with

14   this specific reservation and this specific type of a

15   lease arrangement.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But you knew all of

17   that -- that's not -- that's not something you

18   discovered on remand.        You knew all that before.

19              MR. PHILLIPS:             Well, we -- we obtained

20   additional information, certainly, you know.                   We have

21   the Udall declaration that specifically said that when

22   he negotiated this lease he negotiated it as the

23   centerpiece of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of

24   1950.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And that affidavit

 1   was before or after our decision the first time around?

 2               MR. PHILLIPS:          It was after the first time

 3   around.   I mean, there is no question that if we had won

 4   the first time around, we would have stood by that

 5   statement, but having lost it --

 6               (Laughter.)

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:          -- there is a tendency to

 8   focus the mind elsewhere, and we did.                   But the reality

 9   is that if you look at the parties, the -- Secretary

10   Udall specifically says this was adopted pursuant to the

11   Rehabilitation Act.     Peabody Coal Company in briefing in

12   the Arizona courts has specifically said that this was

13   approved under the Rehabilitation Act, and the United

14   States Government itself in briefing in other courts has

15   said that this was approved pursuant to the --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You bring in Federal

17   officials to testify years after the fact as to what

18   basis they acted earlier?          That's very strange to me.             I

19   don't know what -- what motive Secretary Udall has today

20   that might induce him to say that.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:          Obviously --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            If there was some statement

23   at the time, I could understand it, but bringing him in

24   how many years after -- 40 years after?

25               MR. PHILLIPS:          He has a good memory,

 1   Justice Scalia.

 2               (Laughter.)

 3               MR. PHILLIPS:          No, Justice Scalia, I

 4   understand that, but the -- the bottom line here is, the

 5   question is, is this, you know -- is it absolutely clear

 6   that this is exclusively an IMLA lease?                 And the answer

 7   to that is there is a lot of evidence that suggests no.

 8   It's not in the form of IMLA; there are a lot from other

 9   statements that say yes, and more fundamentally it seems

10   to me is the Court should not view it as an either/or

11   proposition.   It could be adopted under IMLA or it could

12   be adopted separately.       So the section 8 argument --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          I thought that your argument

14   earlier was that all leases of mineral rights on the

15   Navajo-Hopi land are governed by the Rehabilitation Act,

16   and it's not a factual question as to which statute

17   anybody chose at the time of the negotiation of the

18   lease.   But recently, in the last few minutes, you seem

19   to be arguing that it was a factual issue that was --

20   that was unearthed only through later discovery.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I don't know that it's

22   a factual question; it is that candidly, we obviously

23   focused more on IMLA because the Federal Circuit --

24   first of all, the Court of Federal Claims in the first

25   go-around adopted IMLA as the test and just said you


                                       41
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   lose because you don't have an IMLA lease here; and we

 2   had argued here that it's not just an IMLA lease.                Then

 3   we went to the Federal Circuit and we won on the grounds

 4   that it was an IMLA controlled error and we should

 5   prevail on that basis.      When it was sent back down and

 6   we obviously didn't have IMLA available, since the

 7   Federal Circuit specifically precluded us from any

 8   further reliance on IMLA, we looked at the other

 9   provisions; we tried to understand their context, and

10   then that -- all I'm trying to do is explain why it is

11   that we would suddenly focus more on the Navajo act, not

12   to say that you couldn't read the statute and say it

13   would necessarily apply in that circumstance.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:            That isn't really my

15   question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any

16   suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last

17   time; and looking at it straight afresh, I think when

18   the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would,

19   the first thing they do is look at the words of the old

20   statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try

21   to figure out if the new statute that you cited is

22   somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one

23   was.

24              MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So what have we got


                                      42
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   here in that respect?        What we seem to have is two later

 2   provisions that say the government shall have no

 3   liability when it enters into leases.                     I mean, maybe

 4   that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly

 5   escaping it.     And then I guess there is some regs that

 6   were promulgated after the lease was entered into and

 7   seem on their face to deal with other matters.                     Okay,

 8   now, what am I missing?

 9              MR. PHILLIPS:             I'm not sure I understand the

10   last part about --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:               Well the regs you didn't

12   emphasize, so forget them.            If you don't want to rely on

13   them we won't.

14              The -- but I've looked for everything I

15   could find that would support you on this basis --

16              MR. PHILLIPS:             Right.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:               -- and there you are, so I

18   want to you add something to explain --

19              MR. PHILLIPS:             Well, I would go back to

20   Justice Alito's first question that was posed to Mr.

21   Kneedler, which was is this provision has a duty --

22   because it has an approval requirement; and the answer

23   is yes, this Court in Navajo I looked further at IMLA,

24   at that specific statute, and concluded that that

25   statute overall had a very significant limitation


                                         43
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   embedded in that duty; and the question is, is there

 2   anything in the Rehabilitation Act that has that same

 3   limitation?

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.

 5                 MR. PHILLIPS:         And my answer to that is no,

 6   there is nothing in it; and contrary to the overall

 7   intent of IMLA, which was to guarantee self-sufficiency,

 8   the overall intent of this statute was to allow the

 9   Navajo to come somewhere in the area of those standards.

10   In addition to that, I do think there are regulations

11   that do require the Secretary to invoke a fair market

12   value assessment of the rates that are embedded in this

13   lease, and that he did not -- he clearly did not do

14   that.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if you are

16   right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a

17   little about the money-mandating aspect, the second

18   stage of the analysis under Navajo I.

19                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I -- I think the key to

20   that is -- is sort of two-fold.               One, I think when you

21   -- in the absence of some clear statement in this

22   statute akin to the one that existed in IMLA, that

23   reduces the duty of the United States, that the Court

24   ought to then simply examine this against the background

25   of the trust principles and say you have a duty; you


                                        44
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ought to exercise your duty consistent with your role as

 2   a trustee; and you ought to -- you ought to be acting in

 3   the best interests of the Navajo Nation.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Before we find a

 5   waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of

 6   the United States, we usually insist on something a

 7   little more specific than general trust principles.

 8                MR. PHILLIPS:         And then the second -- I

 9   mean, if you are not prepared to accept the general

10   trust principles, although, again, they go through the

11   context of a specific imposed duty that -- that 635(a)

12   has in the first instance.          But even if you want to go

13   beyond that, then I go to 635(b) and (c), where Congress

14   clearly seems to have in mind the possibility of not

15   having liability imposed in certain circumstances and

16   yet left 635(a) there without a similar protection for

17   the United States, which, again, may not be the

18   compelled inference, but it certainly seems to me to

19   create a fair inference.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that's not how

21   the Secretary reads 635.         Isn't he entitled to Chevron

22   deference?

23                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, unless you are saying

24   that -- I don't know what context Mr. Chief Justice was

25   talking about.   I mean -- but to be sure, lawyers don't


                                       45

 1   want to read it that way because they are in litigation

 2   right now.   But I don't see anything in the statutory

 3   scheme or in the regulatory scheme that would say that.

 4   And certainly, if you go back and look at the

 5   Secretary's brief, in their analysis of the regulatory

 6   scheme, the -- let me see if I can find this -- page 25

 7   to 26, where they point out that there was a gap where

 8   -- where the Secretary did not exclude mineral leasing

 9   from the 635 --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What did Secretary Udall

11   think about this?

12                MR. PHILLIPS:          He's fully on board, Justice

13   Scalia.

14                (Laughter.)

15                MR. PHILLIPS:          It's not in the brief.

16                I'll just conclude with the section (a)

17   argument, which is to recognize that the Secretary did

18   owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section

19   (a).   That program did not end.              That disclosure

20   responsibility did not end.             What the measure of damages

21   for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is

22   still open on remand.       But the notion that the Secretary

23   can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which

24   is to know that he was not going to take personal

25   jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no

 1   decision be made, leave the Navajo in a state of

 2   distress under those circumstances, force them to

 3   negotiate with one hand tied behind their back at a

 4   minimum, and then handed up an agreement that was half

 5   what the fair market value would have been for the

 6   quality of coal is an outrage, and the Court ought to

 7   allow the damages action to go forward.

 8                 If there are no further questions, I urge

 9   the Court to affirm.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr.

11   Phillips.

12                 Mr. Kneedler, you have nine minutes

13   remaining.

14        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

15                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16                 GEN. KNEEDLER:          First, Mr. Chief Justice,

17   with respect to the text of section 5, it doesn't -- it

18   doesn't by any means suggest that it covers mineral

19   leases.     The pertinent phrase is that they -- that the

20   tribe or members of the tribe "may lease" -- "with the

21   approval of the Secretary, may lease for various

22   religious, recreational, or business purposes, including

23   the development" of utilization -- "or utilization of

24   natural resources in connection with the operations

25   under those leases." It's not a free-standing mineral


                                         47
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   lease or resource lease provision.                  It says, "including"

 2   and "in connection with operations under such leases,"

 3   referring back to business leases or the other things

 4   there.    So I think, on its face, it doesn't suggest it

 5   covers mineral leases.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, that --

 7                GEN. KNEEDLER:          But --

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it says "the

 9   development or utilization of natural resources."

10                GEN. KNEEDLER:          "In connection with

11   operations under such leases."               And -- and what's above,

12   a recitation of things that don't include mineral

13   leases.   It's educational, recreational, and business

14   leases.   And as we explained, there are specific --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, why isn't it a

16   public purpose to develop Indian minerals?                 That

17   benefits the Indians and whole country.

18                GEN. KNEEDLER:          It says "business"

19   purposes," and as such --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, it says "public."

21                GEN. KNEEDLER:          "For public, religious" --

22   "public" would be like for a school, if a State was

23   going to put a school on or something, but -- but the --

24   but as we explain in our brief, there was a specific

25   reason why Congress enacted this.                 There was a gap in


                                        48
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the authority to lease for these types of purposes at

 2   the time this was enacted.

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And why didn't --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, even if -- if I may

 5   have just one minute, Justice Souter.

 6              If you get revenue from the natural

 7   resources, why isn't that a public, religious,

 8   educational purpose?      They get revenue from leasing.

 9              GEN. KNEEDLER:           The -- the example would be

10   --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I just -- I just think you

12   give too cramped a reading to section 5.

13              GEN. KNEEDLER:           Well, the example would be,

14   if you -- for example, if you were going to use water --

15   this is a Navajo reservation -- if you needed water for

16   a business and sink a well, you would be utilizing or

17   developing the natural resources in connection with a

18   surface lease.   But -- but the last section of -- the

19   last sentence of section 5 says, "Nothing in this

20   section shall be construed to repeal or affect the

22   provision that is IMLA.        The regulations --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:             May I just supplement

24   Justice Kennedy's question?            Why can't the development

25   of the mineral leases be regarded as an adjunct to a

 1   business enterprise?

 2              GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:            I mean business purposes.

 4   I --

 5              GEN. KNEEDLER:          I -- I suppose they could,

 6   but in -- in the terminology, mineral leasing, as we

 7   explain in our brief -- that the categories of leasing

 8   that are -- have always been handled differently.

 9   "Mineral leasing" is the term that is used for minerals.

10   Business, grazing, farming -- we explain this in our

11   brief, that those are different.              The regulations that

12   were utilized to implement section 5 had never included

13   specific provisions for mineral leases.                They have

14   always been under other -- other provisions.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do the regs specifically

16   address the scope of business purposes?

17              GEN. KNEEDLER:          They -- they -- not beyond

18   basically repeating them, but the -- but they, for

19   example, talk about rental value, which is not the way

20   you describe mineral leases, which are -- which are

21   royalties, not rental value.

22              If I could also address the argument about

23   sections (b) and (c), sections (b) and (c) of this Act

24   provide -- first of all, were enacted after section (a),

25   so I don't think much of an inference could be drawn.

 1   But there are situations -- special types of conveyances

 2   that the tribe was going to make:                 One was for fee land

 3   that it was -- that it was transferring.                 There would be

 4   no reason to think the United States should be liable

 5   for that, for what it did with the tribe did with its

 6   own fee land, and Congress wanted to make sure of that.

 7   The other was that the tribe could convey trust land to

 8   municipalities and that sort of thing, and what the

 9   statute says thereafter the United States won't be

10   liable.    The United States was just making sure it was

11   washing its hands of it.

12                Under section (a), we aren't saying that

13   there could be no lease under which it could conceivably

14   be for a business purpose in which the United States

15   could be liable.    If there was a regulation establishing

16   a minimum floor and the lease terms went below that,

17   then that might be a circumstance in which liability

18   could be imposed.

19                But otherwise, Justice Breyer is completely

20   correct:    This statute on its face imposes no more of a

21   duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval of

22   whatever leases are covered than IMLA imposed on the

23   Secretary with with respect to -- with respect to

24   mineral leases.

25                And -- and another important point is, as


                                        51

 1   this Court pointed out in the Cotton Petroleum and

 2   Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, the IMLA was enacted to

 3   bring uniformity to mineral leasing.                    And the notion

 4   that Congress would have implicitly wanted to

 5   specifically carve the Navajo and Hopi out of that

 6   general authorization and that preexisting set of

 7   regulations and cover it by -- by a provision like this

 8   we think is just not consistent with the way Congress

 9   has dealt with mineral leases over the -- over the

10   years.

11               I also just wanted to come back to this idea

12   of -- of imposing liability on the basis of the common

13   law, because the example of what the Federal Circuit did

14   in this case, with all respect to that court, we think

15   strayed so far from what this Court laid down in Navajo

16   I, that it's important for this Court, however it thinks

17   it disposed of this case before, to make clear that

18   liability cannot be imposed unless, as this Court said

19   in Navajo, there is -- there is a specific

20   rights-creating or duty-imposing language in the statute

21   itself.   The theory that has been adopted in some lower

22   courts -- Federal circuit court decisions, which you can

23   look at -- a hodgepodge of statutes, one dealing with

24   environmental concerns, one dealing with rights-of-way,

25   one dealing with this -- add them all up and say the


                                       52

 1   United States has control and, therefore, out of that

 2   sort of bucket of statutes, you can impose trust

 3   responsibilities.    That's fundamentally inconsistent

 4   with the Tucker Act, which requires that the liability

 5   be based on the statutes themselves, and you have to

 6   look at each statute and each regulation that governs

 7   the United States in Indian affairs in the same way,

 8   under the Tucker Act, you would look at the --

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:             General Kneedler --

10               GEN. KNEEDLER:           -- United States elsewhere

11   to decide whether it was --

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Can I ask one question?           I

13   probably should have asked earlier.                      But there is no

14   dispute as the case comes to us.                I know the government

15   has taken the position that there was no breach of

16   trust.   But do we -- we do have to decide it on the

17   assumption that there was a breach of trust that caused

18   all this damage?

19               GEN. KNEEDLER:           No, no.             I think that's not

20   at all correct.    With respect to the approval of the

21   lease terms in 1987 -- under a provision that provided

22   for "reasonable" lease adjustments, the Secretary

23   approved leases negotiated by the tribe at 12.5 percent.

24   The tribe entered into two other leases at the very same

25   time, although not the subject of this case, for 12.5


                                        53
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   percent.   That's the standard royalty rate.                And the

 2   tribe got other benefits from this as a package.                 With

 3   respect to the arguments about what the Secretary did on

 4   -- on appeal, it's even clearer that all this

 5   information about the Secretary meeting with Peabody's

 6   lobbyist, it was before the Court before, and the Court

 7   found no violation of any statute or regulation.                 But

 8   it's even clearer on remand, as we point out on page 22

 9   of our reply brief, that the tribe was fully aware that

10   the Secretary was not going to -- had -- had said the

11   appeal was not going to be acted on and had sent the

12   parties back to negotiations.             In fact, when Chairman

13   Zah of the tribe opened the negotiations on August 30 of

14   1985, he said, "It appears that the Secretary wants us

15   to take another shot at negotiating the lease."                 He knew

16   what --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm not sure that's

18   responsive to justice Stevens's question.                 I mean, you

19   are arguing the merits, but those haven't been decided.

20               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well, what the -- what the

21   Court of Federal Claims said along those lines was a

22   legal conclusion, not a factual conclusion.                 And the --

23   the facts as described are really what they were before

24   when the Court found no violation.

25               And -- and as we say, it's clear factually


                                       54
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   on remand that the tribe knew.               But again, that was just

 2   -- it's not a factual determination that has to be taken

 3   as true.   For one thing, it was summary judgment, not

 4   factual findings.    But it does -- it was just a legal

 5   conclusion.    And at that, it was the sort of legal

 6   conclusion drawn from general notions of fiduciary

 7   responsibility, nothing that has been channeled or

 8   embodied or codified in a statute or regulation.

 9                 And we think to unleash the law to regulate

10   the day-to-day operations of a vast agency, like the

11   Interior Department, which has to operate by statutes

12   and regulations would be -- under Vermont Yankee and

13   this Court's other jurisprudence, would be -- would be

14   unwarranted for the courts to do and especially in a

15   waiver of sovereign immunity under the -- under the

16   Tucker Act to impose damages liability for the violation

17   of a procedural regulation.             And, of course, the Court

18   pointed out the last time that there was no prohibition

19   against ex parte contracts for this sort of informal

20   adjudication, as there isn't across -- across the board

21   for government -- government activities.

22                 If there are no further questions --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, general,

24   the case is submitted.
