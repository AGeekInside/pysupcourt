 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:              The Court will hear

 5        Mr. Phillips, whenever you're ready we will be

 6   happy to hear you?

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. PHILLIPS:            Thank you, Justice Stevens,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               Six years ago, this Court in Buckman

12   recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies

13   is hardly a field the states have traditionally

14   occupied.   Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman

15   struck down a novel State tort that was based on the

16   whole concept of fraud on the FDA.

17               And the Court concluded that that tortious

18   analysis as a matter of State law would inevitably

19   conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud.

20   A responsibility that the Court recognized was

21   essentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law.                It

22   arises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal

23   law and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law.

24               Michigan has adopted a unique product

25   liability statute, and on the one hand confers a very


                                          3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   broad immunity of defense against all product liability

 2   claims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's

 3   requirements.

 4              But then on the other hand, withdraws that

 5   immunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the

 6   manufacturer intentionally withholds from or

 7   misrepresents to the United States Food and Drug

 8   Administration information concerning the drug that is

 9   required to be submitted pursuant to -- and then it goes

10   and lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug,

11   and Cosmetic Act -- and the drug would not have been

12   approved or the Food and Drug Administration would have

13   withdrawn approval.

14              It is difficult for me to imagine a statute

15   that would more consciously and openly tread into

16   exactly the same territory that this Court declared in

17   Buckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not

18   available to the states to regulate.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Phillips, what if the

20   statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you

21   can bring a State tort action when the conditions

22   approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have

23   not been complied with?        That's all it says.      Now, would

24   you knowledge that that -- that that suit could be

25   brought?

 1                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I will acknowledge that's a

 2   fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because

 3   there you are talking about what duties are owed to the

 4   public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are

 5   enforceable by the states as well.

 6                 But here we're talking about duties that are

 7   owed from the manufacturer exclusively --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's a duty that is defined

 9   by the FDA.    And I didn't hear your answer.                Would that

10   suit be allowable or not?

11                 MR. PHILLIPS:         That suit would not be

12   barred, I don't think, by Buckman.                  I think the question

13   there will really go to what the Court is going to

14   decide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have

15   FDA approval of certain activities that that has the

16   effect of --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't seem to me --

18   what I worry about is that if we say in this case it

19   treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say

20   what material should have been provided to the FDA, it

21   seems to me the next what could be more central to the

22   FDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the

23   conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the

24   drug have indeed been observed?               That's central as well.

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I don't think it is an


                                         5

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step

 2   that has to be taken.      Because what this Court decided

 3   in Buckman -- and it's central and candidly we are here

 4   seeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when

 5   you're defining the relationship between the

 6   manufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in

 7   terms of the disclosure of information to that entity

 8   and the determination both whether that information is

 9   adequate to allow the agency to perform its business and

10   then, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is

11   acting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to

12   decide how to proceed --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:              But one can also reason in

14   the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know

15   from the medical devices portion of the FDA that

16   Congress has no objection to private tort actions

17   that -- where the medical device manufacturer has not

18   observed the requirements that the FDA's approval

19   impose, right?   We know from that section that Congress

20   has no objection to that there.

21              You can probably guess that Congress has no

22   objection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as

23   the medical devices field.          And if I make that guess,

24   what is so different about having a jury second-guess

25   the provision of information portion?

 1                MR. PHILLIPS:          It seems to me that the same

 2   argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led

 3   the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because

 4   what's the -- you know, if Congress didn't care about

 5   allowing State tort law to be -- to serve as the

 6   enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them

 7   to do that in that context as well?

 8                And this Court said the reason is because

 9   there is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care

10   of the business and the relationship between those two

11   entities.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, It is -- it is more

13   of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to

14   create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the

15   Federal Government, which is what was at issue in

16   Buckman.    The very cause of action was providing false

17   information to the FDA.         Here the cause of action is a

18   standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective

19   product.

20                MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, when you say "here"

21   what we're talking -- what we're talking about here is a

22   very unique State statute that is the sole basis on

23   which the tort liability is set aside.

24                We're not -- we're not pre-empting the

25   underlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at


                                         7

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   issue in this case.       The State statute pre-empts the

 2   common law court claims.           That first portion of the

 3   defense wipes those out.           So it's not pre-emption of the

 4   traditional State law cause of action, as the Second

 5   Circuit wrongly evaluated it.               What we're talking about

 6   here is a provision that in the most exquisite terms

 7   says:    Allow the State, either by the court or the

 8   juries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that

 9   the FDA required.

10                And it's important to understand how that

11   plays out, because what it says is pursuant to those

12   statutes.    It specifically identifies provisions in the

13   statutes.    It doesn't say anything about how the FDA --

14   how the FDA interprets those statutes.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Phillips, isn't --

16   isn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no

17   Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a

18   drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the

19   market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance,

20   right?

21                MR. PHILLIPS:           Yes.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And so the State of

23   Michigan has said:      Drug dealers -- I'm sorry -- drug

24   sellers --

25                (Laughter.)

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- drug manufacturers, we

 2   are going to give you an invigorated defense.                Instead

 3   of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're

 4   going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you

 5   didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld

 6   information or misrepresented information.

 7              It seems to me that what -- you could say

 8   this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this

 9   is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory

10   compliance defense.

11              So why shouldn't it be looked at as the

12   second, rather than the first?

13              MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I think what you're

14   basically arguing for is an argument I think one of the

15   amici made on the other side, which is:                Does the

16   greater power include the lesser power?                That is, if we

17   had the authority not to give you a defense in the first

18   place, don't we have the authority to use this as a

19   lever in order to allow us essentially to undertake to

20   regulate in precisely the same way the FDA would?

21              And the answer is:              No, because this is not

22   a situation --

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You're arguing an

24   unconstitutional condition, in effect.

25              MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I think it is an


                                       9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   unconstitutional condition.             But I think the bottom line

 2   is it's not a question of us taking the bad with the

 3   good.   The problem here is that the Federal Government

 4   has an independent interest, and it is the Federal

 5   Government's independent interest that is being

 6   essentially wiped away.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              If you're right in your

 8   argument, the Michigan statute provided two things:                 One

 9   good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a

10   qualification on it.       It seems to me that those two

11   can't be unstuck.     So to strike out one, as was done in

12   the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly

13   not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these

14   two things together.

15               MR. PHILLIPS:           Justice Ginsburg, that's

16   clearly a question of State law.                I mean, that's a

17   severability issue to be sure.               And I -- but I think

18   it's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit

19   analyzed this case.

20               What the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still

21   available to the State to come in after the FDA has both

22   found that there has been a material deception of one

23   sort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw

24   the product as a consequence of that, and that -- and

25   then State law is allowed to come in and enforce product

 1   liability claims under those circumstances, that the

 2   legislature would have been perfectly satisfied with

 3   that arrangement.

 4               And, candidly, that is precisely what we

 5   have asked for before both the Second Circuit and this

 6   Court.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Mr. Phillips, May I ask

 8   this question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but

 9   not the same.    You are saying that the defense is not

10   pre-empted; the response to the defense is what is

11   pre-empted here.

12               MR. PHILLIPS:            Correct.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:              What if you didn't have a

14   statute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in

15   which you defended on the ground of compliance with the

16   Federal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack

17   of negligence.     And then it then came back with the

18   rebuttal:   Yes, but your compliance was tainted by

19   fraud, the same kind of thing.                Would that response be

20   pre-empted in a common law lawsuit?

21               MR. PHILLIPS:            I think the question goes to

22   how far that response goes.              If you in fact instructed,

23   if the trial judge instructed the jury that if it found,

24   and then just quoted the language of the statute that

25   there's no, then I'd say, yes, that is pre-empted in


                                         11

 1   precisely the same way.

 2               And the language the Court used in Buckman

 3   was "critical element."         If the FDA's regulatory

 4   authority is a critical element of the case, then, yes,

 5   it is pre-empted.

 6               Whether or not -- whether evidence by itself

 7   would be a critical element is harder to tell.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Let me just finish with

 9   one other thought before --

10               MR. PHILLIPS:           Sure.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:             In one of your arguments

12   and the government's argument, this is very burdensome

13   to the FDA because we have all this litigation.             In all

14   the years we have had this kind of tort litigation, has

15   this issue ever proved to be burdensome to the

16   government in any of these -- these attempts to make out

17   this charge and this defense?

18               MR. PHILLIPS:           I mean, the government is

19   probably in a better position to evaluate that than I

20   am.   But, you know --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Because It seems to me

22   that we have three or four States that have these

23   statutes.

24               MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:             But most States don't have


                                        12

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   these statutes.   I wonder if the problem is really as

 2   serious as everybody --

 3                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I think what the Court

 4   said in Buckman about that probably applies equally

 5   here, which is that, rather than look to see whether

 6   there is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought

 7   to recognize that this is a territory that is locked off

 8   exclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we

 9   shouldn't -- and there shouldn't be that external pull,

10   the extraneous pull, that State law provides under these

11   circumstances.

12                And the same logic obviously applied here

13   would say:   We don't wait until there's a serious

14   interference with how the FDA is trying to do its job;

15   we try to prevent that because there's no -- there's no

16   legitimate State interest to be served here.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do you think there can

18   also be the same argument for pre-empting the section,

19   the subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery

20   exception?

21                MR. PHILLIPS:         No.      I think there's a

22   difference between the bribery statute, because again

23   that doesn't go to the direct relationship between the

24   manufacturer or the seller or the regulated entity and

25   the FDA itself.   That goes to the relationship


                                       13

 1   between -- that -- that is governed by a different set

 2   of laws.

 3              And I think it's traditionally been the case

 4   that States are in fact entitled to enforce laws against

 5   bribery of Federal officials.              So I don't think the same

 6   -- as I say, what I'm looking for here is an extremely

 7   narrow ruling from this Court.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:              What about the defense

 9   itself, which says that the defense is available if not

10   only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but

11   also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance

12   with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the

13   control of the manufacturer?

14              MR. PHILLIPS:            Well, I think --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is it wrong to say that

16   that's -- you know, that that's interfering with the

17   FDA's bailiwick?

18              MR. PHILLIPS:            Well, I think when the --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Are you going to let a jury

20   decide that?

21              MR. PHILLIPS:            No, I'm not going to let a

22   jury decide that.

23              (Laughter.)

24              MR. PHILLIPS:            What the district court found

25   here, obviously, was that there was compliance, because


                                        14
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the other side didn't challenge the compliance.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Uh-huh.

 3                 MR. PHILLIPS:         And, candidly, I think that

 4   is going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because

 5   that's not going to be the issue.

 6                 But, you know, could it eventually be a

 7   problem if a State jury -- if a State court were to

 8   decide that there hasn't been compliance?                It seems to

 9   me that's much closer, again, to what you're going to

10   take up again next term in Wyeth.

11                 I think that is a legitimate issue, but it's

12   a very different one from the question of how do you

13   regulate the relationship between a -- the regulated

14   entity and the FDA in terms of the information flow that

15   goes between those two entities.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It seems to me what you

17   are saying is:    We're going to win this case even if

18   there were no pre-emption.

19                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Even if there is no

20   pre-emption on -- on the -- well, I hope I win this case

21   regardless.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Because they have such a

23   burden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have

24   been withdrawn and so forth.

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right, well -- you mean I

 1   would have won this case on the merits of it?

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes.

 3               MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I mean, clearly we know

 4   that the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of

 5   fraud.   So in that sense, I suppose you're right, but --

 6   but the reality is that the more fundamental problem

 7   remains, whether or not these kinds of statutes are

 8   still out there, are going to create this -- as the

 9   Court said -- extraneous pull.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            Let's just say you use

11   something like primary jurisdiction said that they

12   actually have to -- to withdraw it.                     Now, if the FDA --

13   this is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring

14   opinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it --

15   that if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it

16   and found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing

17   wrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.

18               MR. PHILLIPS:          We don't have any problem

19   with that, Justice Breyer.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            You don't have any problem.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:          No, we were very --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's not --

23               MR. PHILLIPS:          If the Court wanted to go

24   that way, that's fine.       I don't think it's presented in

25   this case, but that wouldn't present any problem for us.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER,

 7               ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 8                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 9                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

10              MR. JOSEFFER:            Justice Stevens, and may it

11   please the Court:

12              The Michigan statute presents the same

13   conflict this Court found in Buckman, because it

14   requires the determination of fraud on the FDA as a

15   necessary predicate for establishing liability.             And as

16   this Court explained in Buckman, the relationship

17   between a Federal agency and the entities it regulates

18   is inherently Federal.        And that's --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Does your argument carry to

20   the point of the same argument when regulatory

21   compliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory

22   violation is raised as a ground for liability?

23              MR. JOSEFFER:            It could depend, because in

24   our view what's pre-empted here is a State court

25   determination -- under Buckman, what's pre-empted is a


                                        17
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   State court determination of whether the FDA was

 2   defrauded as part of FDA's approval process.             So, for

 3   example, under any circumstance, if a jury is being

 4   instructed to find whether FDA was defrauded as part of

 5   the approval process, we'd say there's pre-emption.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, whenever you --

 7   whenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the

 8   potential for a response that they -- they defrauded the

 9   FDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and --

10   you know, vice versa, when -- when it's raised on the

11   other side.

12                 So you always have the potential there for

13   -- for just what concerns you, don't you?

14                 MR. JOSEFFER:         Well -- and what we would say

15   is not pre-empted -- I mean, it's hard to analyze this

16   in the abstract without a record as to what a jury was

17   actually being asked to do.             But if you had a situation

18   where it was, say, a design defect claim, and the jury

19   was being asked to decide whether this design is

20   defective, and that's what it's looking at, and in

21   connection with that the jury is instructed that two

22   relevant things it can consider are, first, the fact of

23   FDA's approval determination and, second, the

24   circumstances surrounding that approval determination,

25   then that by itself, we would say, is not pre-empted by


                                        18
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Buckman, really for two reasons.               One is that

 2   pre-emption normally applies to legal theories, such as

 3   claims or defenses, not the mere admissibility of

 4   evidence; and the second is that FDA's core prerogatives

 5   here, as the administrator of its own drug approval

 6   process, are to determine whether it has been defrauded

 7   and what to do about that.          And if the jury is not being

 8   asked to find those things, but instead is just

 9   considering evidence in connection with something else,

10   we would say that that is what's not pre-empted.

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So it's the withdrawal

12   element, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?

13                MR. JOSEFFER:         That's part of it but not all

14   of it.   I mean, in our view, FDA, as the administrator

15   of its own approval process, needs absolute discretion

16   to determine what must be submitted to it as part of its

17   own approval process, whether it is misled as part of

18   its own approval process; whether as you said it would

19   have made a different determination in the absence of

20   any fraud.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But if you get beyond the

22   element of what the FDA would have done if it had known,

23   then it seems to me you get into an issue which is

24   likely to arise by -- whenever, by one side or the

25   other, the question of regulatory approval is -- is


                                       19
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   offered as a mere matter of evidence.

 2               MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, if it really is a mere

 3   matter of evidence, and that's not what the jury is be

 4   asked to find -- and by the way, it's not at all clear

 5   that there's -- that there's -- it's settled common law

 6   tradition in this type of litigation, because the

 7   context here, where a Federal agency does a

 8   product-specific approval based in part on a submission

 9   of information from a manufacturer, that's not a --

10   that's a question that, first, is of relatively modern

11   vintage and, second, is not terribly common.            So there's

12   not really a uniform, deeply rooted common law tradition

13   here.   But if all we were talking about was the mere

14   admissibility of evidence, we would agree that that was

15   not pre-empted.   But if you look at --

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but that's what you've

17   got here, except that the mere admissibility of the

18   evidence turns in part on what the -- the FDA would have

19   done.

20               MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, no --

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But essentially -- I mean

22   you -- the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is

23   made admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact

24   may be admitted is subject to the -- what is it --

25   clause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question of admissibility.

 2                 MR. JOSEFFER:          Well, it's not because the

 3   statute expressly requires, as a predicate for

 4   liability, a finding that the information disclosure

 5   requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act

 6   were violated.     The jury has to find what was required

 7   to be submitted to FDA, was it submitted to FDA and was

 8   FDA misled?    And if you had a State administrative

 9   agency that was set up to tell companies what they must

10   or must not submit to FDA, as part of FDA's own approval

11   process, the conflict with FDA's ability to administer

12   its own approval process would be manifest.                  And it's no

13   different -- as in Regal, the juries instead of agencies

14   would be making those determinations in individual

15   cases.

16                 And if I could illustrate the concern which

17   this Court explained in Buckman, it's that -- just two

18   FDA regulations.    The first explains that the technical

19   section of a new drug application must provide

20   information and data in sufficient detail to permit the

21   agency to make a knowledgeable judgment.                  Now, because

22   that is an extremely subjective standard, another FDA

23   regulation -- and by the way, these are on pages 142a

24   and 186a of the petition appendix -- the second goes on

25   to explain that the type and quantity of information


                                         21

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that must be submitted to FDA necessarily depends on the

 2   particular drug.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I ask this sort of

 4   general question?    Apart from Buckman itself, which

 5   describes a very serious theoretical problem, as I

 6   understand it, there must have been a fair amount of

 7   litigation over the years where the regulatory

 8   compliance defense was raised or challenged or so forth.

 9   Is there -- are there any reported cases describing the

10   magnitude of the problem to the government, when the --

11   as the result of debate about these issues?

12              MR. JOSEFFER:            Nothing that -- that that's

13   beyond the --

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:              The whole theoretical

15   problem.

16              MR. JOSEFFER:            Well, it's also a relatively

17   new problem, and what -- because -- because it's --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:              The litigation is not, not

19   new.

20              MR. JOSEFFER:            Right, but the

21   product-specific approvals, and the desire to probe into

22   the circumstances surrounding a product-specific

23   approval, is of relatively modern vintage.                  And Buckman

24   itself stands for the proposition that that was not a

25   traditional State inquiry at that time.                  And Buckman


                                        22
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   certainly has not encouraged a significant increase in

 2   such litigation since then.            So this is something that

 3   there's not been a whole lot of.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Leaving aside Buckman,

 5   what's your strongest case in support of your position?

 6   Besides that it is a new problem.

 7              MR. JOSEFFER:           Well, it is.          It's a novel

 8   type of situation where you're -- where you're talking

 9   about the Federal Government's prerogatives to

10   administer its own approval processes.                  There hasn't

11   been a lot of State court litigation on this, in part

12   because it's so obviously a Federal matter.                  I mean, if

13   a State supreme court wanted to tell litigants, private

14   litigants before this Court what they could and couldn't

15   say in their briefs to this Court, the conflict would be

16   obvious and therefore the State supreme court would

17   never do it.   And you have a similar problem here where

18   the State is essentially telling companies what they

19   must or must not be telling FDA, and there's just an

20   obvious intrusion there with FDA's ability to administer

21   its own approval process.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Joseffer, let's

23   assume that -- that you're right.                The Second Circuit,

24   because it thought your position it was wrong, never got

25   to the severance question.          It had been decided by some


                                       23
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   intermediate appellate court.               But would it not be

 2   appropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on

 3   remand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification

 4   process to say, well, we want to find out from the

 5   Michigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet

 6   stays, but the bitter goes?

 7              MR. JOSEFFER:             Right.        And, I mean, as you

 8   know, we don't have a position on the State law

 9   severability question, because our concern here is

10   protecting FDA's prerogative to administer its own

11   process, not with whether the plaintiff or defendant

12   ultimately wins.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It was decided by the Sixth

14   Circuit, wasn't it?

15              MR. JOSEFFER:             It was.         And one of the

16   things that that brings up, in the Sixth Circuit it was

17   actually the plaintiff who was advocating Federal

18   pre-emption there, because she thought that she would

19   then win on severability analysis and would thereby

20   knock out the entire State statute.                       What that

21   underscores is that the unusual Federal pre-emption

22   question here is not necessarily one that is even bad

23   for plaintiffs.     It just protects the important Federal

24   prerogative of FDA's ability to administer its own drug

25   approval process.

 1                But -- but to answer your question, I mean,

 2   we don't have a question -- a position on that analysis,

 3   but I mean, among the procedural options that are

 4   available, as you said, I mean, you're right.                     Michigan

 5   does have a State certification process that, if people

 6   thought appropriate, could be used.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           This -- this tracks

 8   somewhat Justice Stevens' question.                     Do we know in this

 9   case, would this have taken two or three days of

10   testimony?   Was there discovery?              Was it a thousand

11   documents?   Or three documents?

12                MR. JOSEFFER:         Right.        I mean, this case was

13   resolved promptly on a motion to dismiss.                    But if you

14   were going to seriously litigate the question, you would

15   have to know -- in order to put this in context, to

16   determine things like withholding and materiality --

17   you'd have to know everything that FDA had before it,

18   what FDA thought was required as part of that process.

19   You would then have to, I suppose, depose FDA witnesses

20   as to what they would have found to be misleading and

21   what decisions they might have made in hypothetical

22   circumstances.

23                And those are incredibly intrusive inquiries

24   that, one, distort manufacturers' incentives in dealing

25   with FDA in the first place; two, if this was seriously

 1   going to be litigated would require, I assume, quite a

 2   lot of discovery from FDA, which we would resist, but

 3   that's not to say that we would necessarily succeed in

 4   our objections.

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask would you -- is

 6   the bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?

 7              MR. JOSEFFER:           That's a -- there's a very

 8   different analysis there.

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:             I understand.       Do you

10   think --

11              MR. JOSEFFER:           But we do think that that

12   would be pre-empted because -- for a slightly different

13   reason, which is that the relationship between -- the

14   bribery of a Federal official in connection with his

15   Federal duties is obviously a matter of paramount

16   Federal concern, and when the -- especially when the

17   State is looking at that for purposes of essentially

18   second-guessing the validity of a regulatory

19   determination that FDA had made --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Supposing the -- supposing

21   the official pleaded guilty to bribery.                 Would it be

22   pre-empted then?

23              MR. JOSEFFER:           Obviously, it still gets much

24   closer, and at that point, I'm not sure that it would

25   be.

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:              It seems to me we've got a

 2   lot of theoretical litigation out here without much

 3   actual experience with any of these cases.

 4              MR. JOSEFFER:            You know, what I was going to

 5   say is there are a lot of interesting issues surrounding

 6   this case, but none of them actually seem to be

 7   presented in this case, because here -- I mean, the

 8   statute clearly requires a determination of fraud on the

 9   FDA, including all the elements I mentioned, as a

10   necessary predicate for recovery; and, two, FDA has not

11   made such a determination.

12              Thank you.

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Thank you very much.

15                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

16                        ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17              MS. ZIEVE:         Justice Stevens, and may it

18   please the Court:

19              Warner-Lambert marketed a defective product.

20   It withheld information about the injury the product

21   could cause, and the product caused injury to a great

22   many patients, including Respondents.                    They sued

23   Warner-Lambert alleging traditional State law claims,

24   such as product defect and failure to warn.                      I'd like

25   to begin by explaining why the misrepresentation


                                        27
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exception to the Michigan defense does not implicate the

 2   concerns that were raised by the Court in Buckman.

 3   Specifically, the Court in Buckman identified three

 4   problems or concerns that it thought warranted

 5   pre-emption in that case:           That the claim alleged would

 6   cause companies to submit too much information and slow

 7   down the 510(k) process; that the claim alleged might

 8   cause companies not to submit products for approval

 9   because of concern about off-label use; and that the

10   claim would cause an unwarranted intrusion on the FDA's

11   decisionmaking about how to police and enforce fraud

12   against it.

13                 So the question is:             Does the Michigan law

14   implicate these three concerns any more than traditional

15   State tort litigation against a drug company?

16                 I'll start with what I think are the easy

17   ones.   For three reasons, the Michigan statute creates

18   no incentive for manufacturers to submit unnecessary

19   information to the FDA.         Unlike the streamlined 510(k)

20   clearance process that was at issue in Buckman, in this

21   case we have a drug approval.              Drugs are required to go

22   through a comprehensive pre-market approval process.

23   The regulations require submission of, "all available

24   information about the safety of a drug, including

25   demonstrated or potential adverse effects."               I was


                                        28

 1   quoting from 314.50(b)(5).          As Warner-Lambert points out

 2   in its brief, a typical new drug application can be

 3   thousands of pages long.         So there's not really -- not

 4   only is there not evidence that this 12-year-old statute

 5   will lead companies to submit information that the FDA

 6   doesn't want and doesn't need; but it's really unclear

 7   what such evidence would be because, after all,

 8   companies are required to submit all safety information

 9   to the FDA, and it's safety information that would be

10   relevant to a finding under the Michigan exception.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The converse of that is

12   that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome.

13   I mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's

14   thousands of documents here; they won't be submitting

15   anything else.   But, on the other hand, that cuts

16   against you when we're talking about the intrusiveness

17   on the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal

18   regulators go back through all of this stuff again.

19              MS. ZIEVE:        No, Your Honor.               The discovery

20   in a case like this -- there is no evidence to suggest

21   it would be any broader or more burdensome than

22   discovery in a typical product liability case against a

23   drug company.

24              In that regard, Mr. Joseffer is wrong that

25   there was no discovery in this case.                    These cases are

 1   part of a multidistrict litigation and there was a

 2   significant amount of discovery.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All that makes -- makes it

 4   worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me

 5   anyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that

 6   all of the three things that you mentioned are only

 7   aspects of something much more fundamental that

 8   underlies all these cases --              Medtronics, drugs, all of

 9   them.     You came up and began and said this drug has side

10   effects that hurt people.            And that's a risk when you

11   have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts

12   people.

13                 There's a risk on the other side.              There are

14   people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't

15   get the drug to them they die.                So there's a problem.

16   You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time

17   the drug can't hurt them.

18                 Now, who would you rather have make the

19   decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going

20   to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people?                  An

21   expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled

22   randomly for a jury role who see before them only the

23   people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need

24   the drug to cure them?

25                 Now, that it seems to me is Congress's


                                         30

 1   fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the

 2   agency.   And that's why we're here --

 3               MS. ZIEVE:         Well --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:              -- because you want the

 5   jury to do it.     And it seems to me, reading Buckman,

 6   that Buckman says the agency should do it.                So that's

 7   what underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as

 8   well get it right out so that you can answer.

 9               MS. ZIEVE:         Well, I think I have a -- State

10   law torts suits aren't seeking to make a determination

11   about whether the product should have gone on the

12   market.   The purpose of the State law tort suit is to

13   compensate injured patients.              That's a fundamentally

14   different role.    It's complementary to the FDA's role,

15   but it's different.       And I think your question, though,

16   really goes more to the broader issues that the Court

17   will consider next term.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              Ms. Zieve, it doesn't

19   object to a system where the -- a court -- the State

20   would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really

21   true that the agency would withdraw this drug.               But what

22   you want is to be able to convince the jury that there

23   was fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say

24   there was fraud.    So what you're doing is removing a

25   drug from the market that they want out there.

 1               Now, that's the theory of Buckman.                     The

 2   theory of Buckman is --

 3               MS. ZIEVE:       But that is not --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- they want to save people

 5   whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't

 6   be there.   I overstate it slightly.                    So, explain to me

 7   why.

 8               MS. ZIEVE:       Well, this case doesn't seek to

 9   pull Rezulin from the market.             Well, first of all,

10   Rezulin was pulled from the market seven years ago.                      But

11   that is not the goal of this case.                 The goal of this

12   case is to pay -- to get compensation for people who

13   suffered serious liver damage, every single one of them.

14   About a third of the patient-respondents died from the

15   liver damage caused by Rezulin, and what they're seeking

16   here is not a regulatory remedy; they're seeking damages

17   and compensation for that.

18               And the -- the place where we started with

19   the --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Your premise still is, is

21   that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that

22   your premise?

23               MS. ZIEVE:       Well, under Michigan law, the

24   plaintiffs can only --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I know your purpose is


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   different, but the premise on which you operate is that

 2   the drug should not have been sold.

 3              MS. ZIEVE:        The -- if I can just back up to

 4   -- to the structure of the Michigan statute --

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You can back up as long as

 6   you want as long as you come forward and answer.

 7              (Laughter.)

 8              MS. ZIEVE:        I promise will.

 9              (Laughter.)

10              MS. ZIEVE:        The Michigan statute takes as

11   its starting point the notion that Federal approval is

12   reliable evidence that a drug company has satisfied the

13   duty -- State law duties of care owed to patients, and

14   then it says:   But there are a couple of situations

15   where that reliability is drawn into question.

16              So, if the company bribes the FDA or the if

17   the company misrepresented important information to the

18   FDA, then the approval is no longer a sufficient basis

19   on which we can just say that approval in and of itself

20   means that the manufacturer satisfied State law duties.

21              And so, the -- the purpose of the finding

22   about whether there was misrepresentation and what the

23   results of it might have been is not to police

24   enforcement with FDA requirements, and it is not to

25   force the drug off the market.              It is only a hurdle that


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the plaintiff has to get past so it can litigate -- he

 2   or she can litigate her State law claim the same way

 3   plaintiffs will be litigating those claims, and did

 4   litigate those claims, with respect to Rezulin in States

 5   across the country.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Aren't you going to tell

 7   this jury that the drug should not have been on the

 8   market?

 9              MS. ZIEVE:        Yes.      In Michigan they will have

10   to present evidence that if the company had been honest

11   with the FDA, the product wouldn't have been approved.

12   The discovery in this case shows that it doesn't -- at

13   least in this case, that wouldn't present a big problem.

14              First of all, there is evidence in this

15   case, testimony from the medical officer who reviewed

16   the information, that Rezulin would not have been

17   approved as a standalone therapy, that it is infused

18   without insulin or another drug, if the company hadn't

19   lied about -- withheld adverse event reports.

20              But certainly in the typical case a lot of

21   the information that comes out with respect to what went

22   on before the FDA, not only is it submitted in product

23   liability cases in the first instance by the

24   manufacturer to show all of the hurdles they had to go

25   through to get on the market, doesn't that show our

 1   product was safe, but a lot of it you can get in

 2   discovery from the company, themselves, as happened in

 3   this case.   A lot of --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I thought under the

 5   Michigan scheme you don't have to show that.            You just

 6   show approval, and that's the end of the case in

 7   Michigan.

 8                MS. ZIEVE:      There are no Michigan cases

 9   explaining just what you need to show to satisfy the

10   defense, so it is unclear whether you have to show that

11   you met -- if it is the right chemical formula, with the

12   label originally approved, or does compliance with

13   approval mean that you also had to show -- one of the

14   terms of approval is that you continued to update your

15   label when you become aware of new safety information;

16   would you have to show -- a manufacturer have to show

17   that to show that the defense was satisfied.

18                There's no cases under Michigan law which

19   tell us --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:           It seems to me that you

21   could prove that the -- an exception to the defense

22   applies and still lose your lawsuit?

23                MS. ZIEVE:      Absolutely, we could.       Showing

24   that the exception applies is just the first step to

25   being able to litigate this case the way plaintiffs


                                       35

 1   litigated these cases in California, and Illinois, and

 2   New York, and other States.

 3                 There was Rezulin litigation throughout the

 4   country.     And, again, the point about discovery is that

 5   the broad discovery that was done, a lot from

 6   Warner-Lambert, some from the FDA, that was no different

 7   discovery really than would be required under Michigan.

 8   It's all there.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Would you explain why you

10   think Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having

11   a jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the

12   drug or would have withdrawn it from the market if

13   additional or different information had been supplied is

14   incorrect?

15                 Doesn't that -- wouldn't that very seriously

16   interfere with what the FDA is doing?

17                 MS. ZIEVE:       Well, of course, in the specific

18   facts of this case it wouldn't, because Rezulin is off

19   the market and unapproved.            But even as a general matter

20   it doesn't affect FDA's regulation because, as I said in

21   response to Justice Stevens, the effect of making that

22   showing and the jury agreeing that the product wouldn't

23   have been approved is -- there's no regulatory effect.

24   The effect is that the plaintiff can then go ahead and

25   litigate her case like she could in any other State.

 1                 And that's why -- that's because what

 2   Michigan is doing is not policing enforcement.                     It is

 3   just defining the parameters of the compliance --

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:         There wouldn't be discovery

 5   of internal processes within the FDA?                     There wouldn't be

 6   experts testifying about what the FDA would or would not

 7   have done?

 8                 MS. ZIEVE:      Well, the parties may seek

 9   discovery.    There hasn't been enough Michigan litigation

10   for us to know exactly how it would work; but,

11   certainly, the courts in Michigan should be trusted to

12   use their discretion to keep discovery under control as

13   they do in every case.        The Rezulin litigation --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Wasn't -- in this case

15   one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner

16   had recommended against approval for this drug, and then

17   something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was

18   taken off the matter, and another one who approved it

19   was put on?

20                 Isn't that the kind of thing that the FDA

21   would want to police itself and not have State courts

22   look into?

23                 MS. ZIEVE:      Well, those are some of the

24   background facts that happened here.                     But I don't think

25   those are the facts that go to a showing of what the FDA

 1   would have done if Warner-Lambert had made honest

 2   disclosures, because actually those facts tend to

 3   suggest that the FDA did know what was going on.

 4                 But later the second medical officer, the

 5   one who did recommend approval -- the approval came in

 6   two stages.    One was for use as a combination therapy

 7   with insulin and another drug called Metformin, and

 8   later there was an approval for use of Rezulin on its

 9   own.

10                 That is the use that happened to affect all

11   of my clients, and that's the use where we already have

12   a medical officer who testified that the agency would

13   not have approved for that use if the company hadn't

14   withheld safety information.

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, what evidence would

16   you introduce to prove the -- to prove the exception if

17   the Second Circuit's decision stands?

18                 MS. ZIEVE:      Deposition testimony from that

19   medical officer, for example.              There are e-mails.   We

20   cited a couple of e-mails in the red brief of things

21   that were stated at the time:              One an e-mail to

22   Warner-Lambert and one from a medical officer to his

23   superior talking about the way in which Warner-Lambert

24   made it harder -- to be kind to -- for them to assess

25   what the true safety profile of the drug was.

 1              There is -- as I said, there was a very

 2   large amount of Rezulin discovery done in the MDL, most

 3   of which is under a protective order.                  So I don't know

 4   everything that's in there, but --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The question is:        Would

 6   we be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of

 7   examiners to find out what went on at the FDA?

 8              MS. ZIEVE:       No more so than product

 9   liability litigation in any other State.                  As I said, the

10   deposition that happened in this case, the plaintiff's

11   committee asked -- they negotiated discovery with the

12   FDA in the Rezulin cases in general, not looking at

13   Michigan specifically at all.            They got some discovery

14   from the FDA and the deposition of the medical officer.

15              There's also a lot of information about

16   approved drugs that the FDA posts as a matter of course

17   on its website, including the medical officer reviews

18   that form the basis for the approval decision.

19              But even in other cases, for instance, the

20   Vioxx MDL that was pending in Louisiana, the -- in that

21   case the FDA wasn't as interested in negotiating, and

22   there was motions to suppress and a motion to compel.

23   And the judge had to decide whether to allow an FDA

24   medical officer to be deposed; and in that case, did.

25              There are other cases where the FDA has not


                                      39
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   wanted discovery and has successfully opposed it.                      The

 2   FDA has regulations about that, and there's no evidence

 3   that it's burdening the FDA to cooperate to some degree

 4   in discovery or the judges are allowing plaintiffs to

 5   overrun the FDA with requests they can't handle.                   But,

 6   more importantly --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I assume -- I assume -- you

 8   don't stop between sentences, so I hate to interrupt

 9   you.

10                (Laughter.)

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I assume that if this drug

12   were still on the market, you could bring forward the

13   information that you have alluded to about the

14   withholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the

15   FDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide

16   whether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the

17   drug was necessary.

18                In this case, the drug has already been

19   withdrawn.   So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced

20   incentive to go into these questions.                   I guess they

21   still would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were

22   really a bad actor.     They could impose some sanctions,

23   couldn't they, even though the drug was already

24   withdrawn?

25                MS. ZIEVE:      I don't know if they still


                                       40

 1   could, but presumably sometime in the past they could

 2   have.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you think we could have

 4   two different rules:     One for drugs that are still out

 5   there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn?

 6   Because I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you

 7   know, to go back over past mistakes.                   The drug now

 8   having been withdrawn, it doesn't matter.

 9              But if the drug was still out there, it

10   seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much

11   less sympathetic to what you're trying to do.                   You could

12   trust the FDA to do the job.

13              MS. ZIEVE:       Well, the job the FDA is going

14   to do, even if it agrees with a plaintiff, is to

15   sanction the company, perhaps, or to ask it for

16   different information.      It does have the ability to

17   withdraw approval --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, but once it sanctions

19   the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument

20   you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA.

21              The FDA would have said:                    You didn't give us

22   information that was necessary; and had we known this,

23   we wouldn't have gone ahead.

24              MS. ZIEVE:       There's no way for a plaintiff

25   to compel the FDA to look into a situation of a


                                      41
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   manufacturer being dishonest for the -- or to -- even if

 2   the FDA starts a process for a plaintiff to compel the

 3   agency to make a finding that the company

 4   withheld material information, and we would not have

 5   approved it otherwise.

 6              And even if the agency chose to do that, it

 7   wouldn't be of any help to the plaintiff because the

 8   plaintiff's family is seeking compensation because the

 9   breadwinner is dead, or the person is impeded in their

10   ability to make a living in the future and has huge

11   medical bills now.

12              And the FDA's finding that, yes, the company

13   really acted badly isn't going to do anything to help

14   that -- that family.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:               Yes, but it will lead to

16   the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be

17   just as many people on the other side who are dying,

18   dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get

19   a necessary drug.     And that's why what worries me is

20   what happens if the jury is wrong?

21              You are absolutely right when you say you

22   cannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a

23   drug; and they are absolutely right when they say we

24   cannot promise you that juries will be right.

25              MS. ZIEVE:          But, again --


                                         42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            So the the question is:

 2   Who is more likely to be right?

 3               MS. ZIEVE:       With respect, I don't think

 4   that's the question, because if the jury -- if a

 5   Michigan jury is wrong about what would have happened if

 6   Warner-Lambert hadn't acted so badly, the result is that

 7   Ms. Kent and the other Plaintiffs get to litigate their

 8   claims.   The result is not -- there is no regulatory --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            Then you think they should

10   be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a

11   drug.

12               Now, is that the law in most places?                   Where

13   the FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor

14   follows the label and the label is all okay, is it the

15   case that somebody can come in and say, despite that,

16   this drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation?

17               This is a serious question.                   I'm not sure

18   how it works.

19               MS. ZIEVE:       That is the law in every State.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            So --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's been contested,

22   and we are going to hear that case next term.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the next issue.

24               MS. ZIEVE:       That's right.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Right.        But it's been --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I see.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- at least since the

 3   1930's, State tort litigation of the very kind that

 4   Justice Breyer has described has gone on.                     Isn't that

 5   so?     That you -- even though the FDA has approved a

 6   drug, an injured party can say this was a defective

 7   drug, and the manufacturer says regulatory compliance.

 8   That's a defense.     And you would say it's a defense, but

 9   not a conclusive defense.

10                 MS. ZIEVE:       Absolutely.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's how -- that's how

12   --

13                 MS. ZIEVE:       Yes.       The FDA approval, Federal

14   approval, and State tort actions have co-existed since

15   1938.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?      That's where I am

17   missing you.    Why, then, does Michigan even have this

18   thing?    In other words, why -- you are saying if they

19   didn't have it at all, you would go ahead and bring your

20   tort action.

21                 MS. ZIEVE:       That's right.              Michigan chose --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Thank you.

23                 MS. ZIEVE:       -- to -- not to create a new

24   claim as the plaintiffs tried to do in Buckman, but,

25   rather, to take a traditional claim and restrict

 1   plaintiff's ability to prevail on it.

 2               This is not an expansion of State tort law.

 3   It is a considerable narrowing of State tort law.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, would you say that

 5   my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was

 6   presenting his case, that this is an invigorated

 7   regulatory compliance defense, that it is more

 8   favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than

 9   the standard regulatory compliance because it says that

10   the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless --

11   and then the exception that we are debating here.

12               But it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer

13   measure.   It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the

14   regulatory compliance defense does not.

15               MS. ZIEVE:       And I would go even further.

16   It's not just pro-manufacturer.              This statute is the

17   most deferential to the FDA of any State tort law in the

18   country.   Other States will allow a manufacturer to

19   present evidence of compliance to show the product

20   wasn't defective, and that's non-dispositive evidence in

21   almost every State.

22               And then a plaintiff can come back and say:

23   Oh, but look, they didn't comply in these ways.              And

24   that wouldn't be dispositive either in most States.

25               But only in Michigan not only is the


                                       45

 1   manufacturer's compliance defense dispositive in the

 2   majority of cases, but the evidence of non-compliance

 3   isn't even allowed as a rebuttal unless the plaintiff

 4   can show that it actually was a material non-compliance

 5   that would have made a difference.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And in your view could a

 7   State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant

 8   that the drug was approved by the FDA?

 9                 MS. ZIEVE:      Only to the extent that they

10   simply thought it wasn't relevant.                  And there are

11   States that --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And all they say in the

13   statute:   We just think -- they just think this is

14   irrelevant.

15                 MS. ZIEVE:      Sure.        And there are States that

16   don't allow compliance --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I don't think that's

18   consistent with your position.               There's no doubt about

19   that.

20                 MS. ZIEVE:      There are States that don't

21   allow compliance evidence if the plaintiff shows

22   material misrepresentation, "material" being that it

23   could have -- could have influenced the agency without a

24   finding that it did or would have influenced the agency,

25   but just that it was pertinent information.

 1               And in those cases, this is discussed in

 2   common -- either the restatement.                In such a case some

 3   States would say that the compliance evidence then can't

 4   come in.   And it is sort of the same theory as

 5   Michigan's, but just not as strict against the

 6   plaintiffs, that if you can't trust the -- the

 7   compliance evidence isn't relevant.                     It's not meaningful

 8   if you can't trust it.       Because the --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            So to me, which is a good

10   answer, is you are saying:          Look at the basic tort

11   system here.   And if you can do that, you can do this.

12   Is that -- do you see where I'm --

13               MS. ZIEVE:       If -- if the traditional tort

14   system as it exists in most every State is not

15   pre-empted, then Michigan's statute is not pre-empted.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Ms. Zieve, how many

17   States have a statute like Michigan's?

18               MS. ZIEVE:       The Michigan statute is unique

19   with respect to the finding -- the requirement that

20   there be a finding of how the FDA would have acted if

21   the manufacturer had not made certain representations.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No other State does that?

23               MS. ZIEVE:       Texas has a similar statute

24   except it doesn't have that last element.                    And one of

25   the questions on severability is whether -- if you think


                                       47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   just that element is pre-empted, whether you can --

 2   whether Michigan would want to sever that one element.

 3                 And then there are a number of States that

 4   limit punitive damages liability but along the lines of

 5   Texas, not Michigan.        So, again, that last element is

 6   not required.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But was there any

 8   experience with this in Michigan?                  How many years was it

 9   in operation before the Sixth Circuit decision?

10                 MS. ZIEVE:       I believe it went into effect in

11   March of '96.     So, seven years.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Have there been many

13   trials to test this theory that it would be disruptive,

14   that --

15                 MS. ZIEVE:       We were unable to find any

16   reported cases or Westlaw discussion of --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What's the Sixth Circuit

18   case?     It must have involved this, no?

19                 MS. ZIEVE:       Well, in the Sixth Circuit the

20   plaintiff said:     We can't prove the exception, but it is

21   pre-empted and not severable.               So we -- so that the the

22   statute would fall.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I see.           What is your

24   position on severability?            Why shouldn't we -- you know,

25   we usually accept the circuit court's determination as

 1   to what the State law is.            Michigan is in the Sixth

 2   Circuit.     And I think it's overwhelmingly likely that

 3   the Second Circuit would defer to the Sixth Circuit's

 4   view.     Don't you think?

 5                 MS. ZIEVE:       Well, in footnote 4 of the

 6   Second Circuit's decision, Justice Calabrezze points out

 7   that certification to the Michigan Supreme Court would

 8   also be an option, and an option that the court doesn't

 9   --   that court didn't even get to.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The discussion in the

11   Sixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on

12   this --

13                 MS. ZIEVE:       No, it wasn't.               And this Court

14   has no -- has no practice with respect to deferring to

15   State law questions that were decided by courts of

16   appeals in a different case.              That is, this case didn't

17   come to the Court from the Sixth Circuit.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I want to be sure I

19   understand something.        In the other case, the plaintiff

20   is the one who argued there was pre-emption, and the

21   whole statute was invalid, and not the defendant.

22                 MS. ZIEVE:       That's right.

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I see.          I missed that.

24                 MS. ZIEVE:       Yes.       It was a good try.          But I

25   think that the severability argument is very closely

 1   tied to the reason --

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So the defendants kind of

 3   take the risk when they make the argument they are

 4   making.    They have a chance to either lose or win.

 5                 MS. ZIEVE:      Well, that's right.         I mean, I

 6   think the fact that Michigan is such a pro-manufacturer

 7   State --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           If there is no

 9   severability, the defense is gone, period.

10                MS. ZIEVE:       That's right.

11                The -- and the reason for severability,

12   though, was quite tied to the whole reason why we think

13   there's not preemption in the first place, which is that

14   the statute really needs to be looked at as a whole.

15   You can't -- you can't understand what the exception is

16   trying to accomplish without putting it in the context

17   of the statute.    After all, it is -- it's subparagraph

18   (8) of subsection (5) of the Michigan statute.

19                     If the Court has no further questions,

20   thank you.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Thank you.

22                Mr. Phillips, you have five minutes.

 2   can get to lunch.

 3               Justice Kennedy, I think the best case for

 4   us without Buckman would have been Hoyle versus United

 5   Technologies.   That's a case involving again a uniquely

 6   federal interest.    And the advantage of that particular

 7   case is it also reflects that pre-emption is not an all

 8   or nothing proposition.         You can preempt out the

 9   specific parts that is offensive and retain the part of

10   State law that is not offensive.                And that's precisely

11   what we're trying to do in this case.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             There was special

13   consideration because of military considerations.

14               MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, I think that's what

15   made it a uniquely Federal interest.                     But I don't know

16   that it's any more a uniquely Federal interest than this

17   one.   At least this is the way the Court has analyzed

18   both of them in Buckman.

19               Justice Ginsburg, with respect to

20   severability, I think, frankly, the Second Circuit

21   already answered the question.               They said that we would

22   defer to the Sixth Circuit under Factors and then

23   analyze certification.        And it concluded that, given the

24   clarity of the Sixth Circuit's decision in Garcia, that

25   there's nothing left to be decided on that issue.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I didn't think that the

 2   Second Circuit discussed severability, but I can go back

 3   and check.

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, if you -- if you --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought that it had

 6   been raised there, but they didn't get to it because

 7   they --

 8                MR. PHILLIPS:           I would suggest you read the

 9   Petition Appendix 14a, where it says on the one hand,

10   under Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's

11   conclusions as to questions of Michigan State law, and

12   then the footnote reflects that the Sixth Circuit in

13   Garcia had clearly decided the severability issue here.

14   So, frankly, if --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In a very, very quick --

16   it isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion.                    It's a

17   is very -- it's just one paragraph.

18                MR. PHILLIPS:           To be sure.          But on the other

19   hand, it does seem to me that it spoke specifically to

20   the issue and recognized the right outcome.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I mean, because it is

22   odd -- I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that

23   says:   Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity,

24   but there's an exception.            They seem so tied together

25   and it really would be a case of letting one side keep

 1   the sweet and get rid of the bitter.                      And it seems to me

 2   that there is -- that there was no discussion of that in

 3   the Sixth Circuit.

 4              MR. PHILLIPS:             Oh, but there is a discussion

 5   of that in the Sixth Circuit decision.                     Garcia

 6   specifically deals with that, because it says the bitter

 7   that you have to take is if the FDA in fact makes all of

 8   the very specific and intricate findings that are

 9   required by the exception and concludes that the product

10   should be withdrawn for fraud, then in fact you get the

11   bitter, which is that the lawsuit goes forward under

12   those circumstances, and that that's the reasonable

13   compromise that the State legislature had in mind or

14   would have been satisfied with.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But the question is

16   whether the legislature would have passed the statute

17   that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer

18   could have the immunity without the exception.

19              MR. PHILLIPS:             All I'm saying is I think the

20   Court addressed that in Garcia and specifically

21   concluded that the legislature in fact would have passed

22   that; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would

23   defer, as would this Court.

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                It would be -- it would

25   be open to the Second Circuit on remand because it's not

 1   foreclosed.

 2                 MR. PHILLIPS:         No, clearly it's not

 3   foreclosed.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, unless they choose

 5   not to change their mind.           I mean, they did say that

 6   they're bound by this by Garcia as to questions of State

 7   law.

 8                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Exactly.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           They said that:        We are

10   bound by Garcia as to questions of State law.

11                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Exactly.

12                 Justice Scalia, I'd like to answer your

13   question about if we were going forward with respect to

14   withdrawal as opposed to looking back.                   I mean, the FDA

15   still has the authority to order disgorgement, to order

16   restitution for victims.          I think the notion that the

17   FDA is indifferent to claims of fraud is just -- is

18   flatly offensive.    The reality is --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Does restitution for

20   victims include damages?

21                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, whatever injuries --

22   yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of

23   restitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would

24   certainly provide a mechanism for providing --

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, you're not talking


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   about profits when you have an injured -- a patient who

 2   died as a result of malpractice or something.             That's

 3   not disgorgement of profits.            That's damages.

 4               MR. PHILLIPS:          I understand that.     All I'm

 5   suggesting, Justice Stevens, is that there are remedial

 6   mechanisms still available to the FDA if in fact it

 7   concluded that there was some problem, and that those --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It couldn't give recovery

 9   to a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who

10   were injured, could it?        No such remedy under the FDA,

11   or am I wrong on that?

12               MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, as I understood the

13   FDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial

14   authority and that it extends to some form of

15   restitution to the victims.            So I --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The government told us in

17   its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing

18   public complaints -- this was in their brief at page

19   24 -- because that would divert attention from their

20   primary mission.   So there's no action for fraud that

21   one can bring to the FDA.

22               MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I mean, there is a

23   provision for citizen petitions that exists, that's

24   cited.   So, yes, there is a mechanism.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But The FDA doesn't have


                                       55

 1   to do anything about it?

 2                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, no.            It entertains it.

 3   In point of fact, there was a petition filed by Public

 4   Citizen to withdraw Rezulin in this specific case, and

 5   it was reviewed and it was rejected for exactly the

 6   reason Justice Breyer identified, because if you took it

 7   off the market, people would die.                 That was the concern

 8   that drove the FDA to say:           We're not going to do that

 9   under these circumstances.

10                 If there are no further questions, Your

11   Honors.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           The case is taken under

13   advisement.

14                 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
