 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We will hear

 4   argument next in Case 08-7621, Sullivan v. Florida.

 5                 Mr. Stevenson.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                MR. STEVENSON:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10                 Joe Sullivan was 13 years of age when he was

11   arrested with two older boys, one 15 and one 17, charged

12   with sexual assault, ultimately convicted, and sentenced

13   to life without parole.

14                 Joe is one of only two children this age who

15   have ever been sentenced to life without parole for a

16   non-homicide, and no child has received this sentence

17   for non-homicide in the last 18 years.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Stevenson, there's a

19   serious question before we get to the particulars of

20   this case.    Justice Kennedy suggested it in the last

21   argument.    This -- the time ran out for postconviction

22   relief in 1993, and this petition is brought in 2007.

23   There's a 2-year statute of limitations.               Florida

24   said there's a procedural bar; we don't get to the

25   merits of this case.

 1                MR. STEVENSON:         Yes, there are two

 2   responses.   I mean, first of all, with regard to

 3   challenges to sentences, Florida law, under Rule 3.850,

 4   makes it very clear that a challenge to a sentence can

 5   be brought at any time.      What the trial court --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          They said there's a

 7   question whether that means an illegal sentence, like

 8   the judge gave more than the maximum punishment.              Do you

 9   have any indication in Florida law that correcting a

10   sentence any time overtakes the limitation on

11   postconviction relief?

12                MR. STEVENSON:         Yes, we cite in our brief

13   Summers v. State, which is an example of someone

14   challenging their sentence after this Court's decision

15   in Apprendi long after the time would have run.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Except the court there

17   applied 39(a) and said:      Yes, it's a change in law, but

18   it hasn't been made retroactive.

19                MR. STEVENSON:         That -- that's correct.      But

20   the propriety of that determination is exactly what can

21   be -- is engaged in by the State courts, and that's

22   what we simply sought here.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But isn't that what the

24   court said here?   It said, first of all, Roper doesn't

25   command the results you are seeking; and, second, it


                                     4

                                    Official


 1   didn't make its application retroactive.            So wasn't it

 2   really consistent with 39(a), the Florida court?

 3                  MR. STEVENSON:         No, Justice Sotomayor.     The

 4   only thing the judge said here was that I don't

 5   think the reasoning of Roper can be applied to someone

 6   serving life in prison without parole.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, that's an unfair

 8   characterization.     What the judge said was Roper didn't

 9   say that it applied to life without parole.            That's a

10   very -- vastly different thing than saying that the

11   reasoning shouldn't be applied.            It said that we are not

12   choosing to, but that's not what Roper said.

13                  MR. STEVENSON:         But our argument -- and I

14   accept that.     Our argument was we recognized that Roper

15   dealt with the death penalty as opposed to life without

16   parole, but our argument was that the reasoning of Roper

17   is similarly applicable to someone sentenced to life

18   imprisonment without parole.

19                  The trial judge could not evaluate the

20   procedural question without analyzing Roper, and that's

21   what the trial court did.         The trial court conceded that

22   if Roper applies, Joe Sullivan is entitled to review.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         But Roper was decided under

24   a regime, which I -- I think still exists, that death is

25   different.     How could it possibly be thought to apply to


                                       5

 1   this case, which is not a death case?

 2                 MR. STEVENSON:         Well, because -- because

 3   what the Court said in Roper categorically for the first

 4   time is that kids are different, and in this context we

 5   were arguing --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         It said kids are different

 7   for purposes of the death penalty, which is different.

 8                 MR. STEVENSON:         Well, I think our argument

 9   was that they are different for the purposes of

10   sentencing.   And what triggered this -- and this is why

11   this is relevant to this procedural question -- was that

12   the State of Florida did apply Roper to juveniles who

13   had been sentenced to death after this Court's decision.

14                 And the case we cited to the Florida appeals

15   court, Bonifay v. Florida -- it's on page 38 of our

16   joint appendix -- was a case where Florida implemented

17   that law, and the law under Florida was that death row

18   prisoners sentenced at the time of Joe Sullivan --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Let me -- let me --

20                 MR. STEVENSON:         -- had their sentences

21   reduced to life in prison with parole.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But this judge said:

23   Yes, there's a Federal question in this case:            Does

24   Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for

25   juveniles?    He answered that question: no.          And then he


                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   said:    There is no other Federal question in the case; I

 2   do not reach the question that you are raising, that is,

 3   life without parole being cruel and unusual.              All -- the

 4   only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is,

 5   does Roper cover this case?           No.    Anything else is

 6   procedurally barred.

 7                 What was wrong with that?

 8                 MR. STEVENSON:         Well, because under your

 9   precedent, if the question -- if the judgment of

10   procedural default is dependent on an analysis, an

11   assessment of Federal law, in any context, then it is

12   not an independent and adequate State ground, and that's

13   the basis on which we --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, suppose arguendo we

15   assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not

16   establish a rule that applies in this case.              Then what

17   position are you in with reference to the procedural

18   bar?    Do you have any other arguments that overcome the

19   procedural bar?

20                 MR. STEVENSON:         Yes, that is the rule would

21   still allow us to challenge the sentence under the no

22   time restriction as it relates to the sentence --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         No, no.     The only Federal

24   question in the case now -- or at least the preliminary

25   Federal question, the threshold Federal question, is


                                      7

 1   simply whether the State court was right about what

 2   Roper did.    And if we agree with the State court about

 3   what Roper did, then the State's bar automatically

 4   applies and that's the end of the case.

 5                 MR. STEVENSON:         Well, yes, but if you agree

 6   with the State court about Roper did, then we don't --

 7   we are not entitled to relief under -- under either

 8   theory, under a merits theory or a default theory, but

 9   the point is --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Oh, I don't -- I don't know

11   about that.    We -- is the argument here that, unless

12   Roper mandates this result, you don't urge that the

13   Constitution requires it?        I don't think so.

14                 MR. STEVENSON:         No.   Our argument simply is

15   that the question that the trial judge dealt with here

16   was, in part, dependent on an assessment of the Federal

17   Constitution, whether the Eighth Amendment does

18   constrain a sentence like this.            We relied on Roper.

19                 The court found that Roper was not available

20   to Mr. Sullivan when his case was on appeal, prior to

21   1993.   Based on that determination, the court then

22   engaged in an analysis.       And, again, what triggered

23   this -- and I just want to make this really clear, that

24   death row prisoners after Roper in Florida got a better

25   sentence than Joe Sullivan.


                                      8

 1                  They got life with parole eligibility after

 2   25 years.     The argument was that that established a

 3   reasonable basis for Joe Sullivan ­-

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought -- I thought

 5   Simmons got life without parole.             I thought that

 6   Simmons's sentence was life without parole.

 7                  MR. STEVENSON:         Simmons did, Your Honor, in

 8   Missouri.     But in Florida, at the point at which these

 9   sentences were being imposed, there was no life without

10   parole for capital murder.            People convicted of capital

11   murder could -- could only be sentenced to life in

12   prison, with parole eligibility after 25 years.

13                  And so the question was generated by this

14   Court's decision in Roper, how is it constitutional

15   under the Eighth Amendment for the death sentence

16   prisoner to get life with parole after 25 years, and Joe

17   Sullivan at 13, convicted of a non-homicide --

18                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Your argument is that

19   because the -- the State judge had to decide whether

20   Roper dictated or required the result that you were

21   asking for, that -- that it's not an independent State

22   ground.     That's the argument?

23                  MR. STEVENSON:         My argument is that if Roper

24   applied -- if Roper is relevant -- because what the

25   State courts of Florida have said is that when you are


                                       9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   looking at this question there are three things.              One,

 2   is it a rule from the Florida Supreme Court or United

 3   States Supreme Court?

 4                  Two, is it a rule of constitutional -- of a

 5   constitutional nature?       Which, obviously, this would be.

 6   Three, is it a rule of fundamental significance?              That's

 7   all.   We don't have to establish that --

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:       No, but I'm -- I'm

 9   interested in how we decide whether it's independent.

10   If you had cited -- if you said Marbury v. Madison

11   dictates this result, well, the judge would have to

12   decide what Marbury v. Madison required.           That's a

13   Federal -- that can be characterized as a Federal

14   question.     That would make the -- that would make it --

15   the State law ground not an independent ground?

16                  MR. STEVENSON:       No, Your Honor.   I mean, we

17   could say that -- that some rule that has to do with

18   antitrust applies, but the judge wouldn't have to

19   consider that, wouldn't have to evaluate that; it

20   wouldn't be determinative.          Here, the judge could not

21   reject our claim without an analysis of Roper.

22                  The judge engaged in that, and let -- let

23   me just point out, this is not a case of procedural

24   default, State court ruling, we are now in Federal

25   habeas.     This is a question about jurisdiction.


                                      10

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1                  The question that the State is raising is:

 2   Does this Court have jurisdiction to review the Federal

 3   question that was presented below, when the trial court

 4   itself engaged in an analysis of Roper?             This Court

 5   doesn't lose its jurisdiction to deal with a Federal

 6   question when the State court analyzed that question to

 7   reach its --

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, that's true, but once

 9   we analyze the question, if we decide, as the trial

10   court decided, that in fact Roper does not demand the

11   result in this case and, therefore, there is no

12   exception to the procedural bar of Florida, which makes

13   an exception where the fundamental constitutional right

14   asserted was not established within the period provided

15   for, once we decide that in fact Roper didn't establish

16   it, you're out of court, it seems to me.

17                  Then -- then, automatically, the -- the

18   procedural bar of Florida applies.

19                  MR. STEVENSON:       No, Justice Scalia.     The

20   other provision of 3.850 would still allow us to

21   challenge this sentence because it is a challenge to a

22   sentence, and Florida says that there is no time

23   limitation on the challenge of a sentence.

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Then that would

25   completely overtake the specific provision.             I mean, if


                                      11

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   you say the catchall illegal sentence, open to

 2   challenge at any time, then there's nothing left to

 3   the specific provision that says 2-year statute of

 4   limitations, unless three things.

 5                  MR. STEVENSON:       That's correct, Justice

 6   Ginsburg.   Florida applies the provision, the construct

 7   that, with regard to challenges to sentences, at least,

 8   there is no time limitation.

 9                  We contend that the more relevant challenge

10   is generated by this Court's decision in Roper.              But,

11   even without that, we are entitled to merits review, and

12   no one has argued against that.

13                  I mean, it's worth stating here that there

14   was no responsive pleading filed by the State in the

15   trial court.     There was no responsive pleading.           No one

16   asserted an affirmative defense arguing that these

17   procedural defaults be --

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And you say the -- under

19   Florida law, the question is not whether the right was,

21                  MR. STEVENSON:       That's correct.

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the right is whether

23   or not -- it had -- what was your phrase?              "A

24   significant bearing"?

 1   from Summers v. State, which is cited in our brief,

 2   Justice Kennedy, where the court has made it clear,

 3   because they have to sometimes engage in these questions

 4   about what's retroactive, how does it apply?

 5               They have done that with regard to Apprendi.

 6   They have done that with regard to some of this Court's

 7   other decisions in a vast array of areas.            Eighth

 8   Amendment questions come up all the time before the

 9   Florida Supreme Court under that analysis.            And with

10   that in context, I don't think there is any real

11   question that this Court has jurisdiction, and that's

12   the issue here:   Do you have jurisdiction to review the

13   Federal question that was considered below?

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Can I --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Did -- did you raise below

16   your assertion that the exception -- that there is an

17   exception for challenging -- for vacating sentences,

18   that there is -- that that is an exception to the normal

19   rule of 2 years' limitation?            Did you make that

20   argument below?

21               MR. STEVENSON:        No, because at no point did

22   the State make any argument that we were barred or

23   precluded in any way.     On appeal, we did reference the

24   provision in the -- in Bonifay v. State, which was a

25   case that talked about how these provisions can be


                                    13

 1   challenged, how these sentences can be challenged at any

 2   time.

 3               That was the way the case was presented,

 4   Justice Scalia, because at no point did the State ever

 5   argue an affirmative defense of procedural default.                 And

 6   that's how the case gets here.         It gets here in the

 7   posture of a very rare sentence.

 8               And I do want to respond to the notion that

 9   we are uncertain about what will happen.              There's no

10   uncertainty about what will happen to Joe Sullivan if

11   this Court rules in his favor.         Florida law clearly

12   states what the next sentencing option is.              He could

13   only be sentenced to 40 years in prison with good time

14   and credits available.    That's what Florida law says.

15   Under 775.082, anyone not sentenced to life in prison

16   can only receive a maximum sentence of 40 years.              And

17   that --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why won't the next

19   case we get be an argument that for a juvenile,

20   particularly one as young as -- as your client, 40 years

21   is too long; 40 years doesn't recognize his capacity for

22   moral development within a reasonable period?

23               MR. STEVENSON:       Mr. Chief Justice, you may

24   get that case and this Court will have to evaluate that.

25   But I think here what we haven't resolved, which I think


                                   14

 1   we have to resolve, is the question of whether life

 2   without parole is unconstitutional, whether that's

 3   excessive.   And I think there's a great deal of

 4   evidence to support that this Court should make that

 5   finding, in part because of its lack of consensus.

 6                There are only nine kids in the entire

 7   country that have been sentenced to life without parole

 8   for any crime.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, but -- I mean,

10   you look at the Federal Government allows this sentence,

11   right?   Thirty-eight States allow this sentence.              I just

12   don't understand how you can say there is a consensus --

13                MR. STEVENSON:       Yes.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- that this type of

15   sentence is unconstitutional.

16                MR. STEVENSON:       I think with regard to very

17   young kids, I -- I don't think we can say that the

18   States have adopted or considered or approached this

19   kind of sentence, in part because --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:        All you have established is

21   that there is a consensus that that sentence should be

22   rare, not a consensus that that sentence should not be

23   available, because most States make it available.

24                MR. STEVENSON:       I -- I think, Your Honor,

25   that -- that the judgment that they have made it


                                    15

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   available in some conscious way can't really be

 2   defended, because no one who has set the minimum age for

 3   imposing a sentence of life without parole has set it as

 4   young as -- as 13.    When States have taken up this

 5   question, they have never said that a child of 13 should

 6   be subject to life without parole.                What they said is --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So it would be -- it

 8   would be reasonable under your approach to have

 9   a different result in these two cases?               A difference in

10   terms of consensus or when sentencing is allowed would

11   result in a different result in your case than in

12   Mr. Graham's case?

13                MR. STEVENSON:        It would be conceivable.           It

14   wouldn't be desirable.      I'll concede that.            But, yes,

15   it's conceivable only in the sense that we know that

16   States like Florida that have created no minimum age for

17   trying children as adults, but have created life without

18   parole for these adult sentencers have created this

19   world where these things are possible.

20                But if you accept that Florida has adopted

21   life without parole for a child of 13, you also have to

22   accept that they have adopted it for a child of 6 or 5,

23   because --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It seems to me, once

25   -- excuse me.

 1                MR. STEVENSON:        Sorry.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It seems to me that

 3   one way to take that into effect is through our normal

 4   proportionality review and in a case by case.                Your ­-

 5   your client -- his crime is horrendously violent.                At

 6   the same time, he is much younger than in the typical

 7   case.   And it seems to me that requiring under the

 8   Eighth Amendment consideration of his age, as I said

 9   earlier, I guess, avoids all these line-drawing problems

10   which seem -- the arbitrariness of the line-drawing

11   seems inconsistent with the notion of the Eighth

12   Amendment.

13                MR. STEVENSON:        I understand your point,

14   Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think that's the way the

15   Court should proceed, for two reasons:               One -- one is

16   that that kind of case by case analysis hasn't worked

17   well for children.    It is in part because these kids are

18   so vulnerable, are so at risk in this system, that

19   they end up --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, I thought -- I

21   would have thought your argument that this is so rare

22   suggests that maybe that analysis, to the extent it's

23   permitted under State law, has worked well for children.

24                MR. STEVENSON:        Well, but -- but I -- I

25   think in many ways it -- it hasn't.               I mean, Joe

 1   Sullivan never had his case reviewed, never had his

 2   sentence reviewed.    The lawyer filed an Anders brief on

 3   direct appeal.    He's been in prison for 20 years and

 4   wouldn't be in this Court but for this Court's decision

 5   in Roper that created some new categorical exemptions.

 6               And I think the problem with the

 7   individualized review, as Justice Kennedy wrote actually

 8   in Roper, is that in this context, age can actually be

 9   an aggravating factor.      I mean, the Court could have

10   said in the death penalty context, let's deal with this

11   on a case-by-case basis.       We actually have a

12   proportionality review that's enshrined in our capital

13   jurisprudence.   States have to do that.

14               But we didn't, because we recognize that

15   there are distinctions between kids and adults that have

16   to be respected by our Constitution, that have to be

17   reflected in our constitutional norms.               And I think --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that's because

19   death is different, is what we said, and because death

20   is reserved, as this Court said in Roper, for the worst

21   of the worst.    And we know that life without parole is

22   not reserved for the worst of the worst.

23               MR. STEVENSON:         But I think it is, Your

24   Honor, for -- for -- for the kinds of crimes that we are

25   talking -- for non-homicides, life without parole is


                                     18

 1   reserved for the worst of the worst.               That's what this

 2   Court effectively created with its decision in Kennedy.

 3                And in that context, the same difference

 4   that can be made between kids and adults in the death

 5   penalty context, we believe, needs to be made here.              To

 6   equate the crime of a 13-year-old with a 25- or a

 7   30-year-old, particularly one like Joe Sullivan --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:          There are a lot of

 9   murderers who get life without parole.              Not every

10   murderer gets -- gets executed.            So how can you say that

11   these are worst of the worst?             Murderers are the worst

12   of the worst, and they get life without parole.

13                MR. STEVENSON:         Yes, they do,

14   Justice Scalia.   But my point is that, with regard to

15   non-homicides, life without parole occupies the same

16   kind of end-of-the-line status that the death penalty

17   does with homicide.     And to fail to make a distinction

18   between --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Call them the "worse of the

20   worse" maybe, but they are not the worst of the worst.

21                MR. STEVENSON:         Well, that's one way of

22   characterizing it.     I think, though, whatever we say

23   about children and adults, we know that there are

24   distinctions, and those distinctions that were

25   articulated in Roper are applicable here.

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:        What is the categorical rule

 2   that you would like us to adopt?

 3                 MR. STEVENSON:        I would like you to adopt

 4   a rule that bans life without parole for any child

 5   under the age of 14.      And I think that would be

 6   supported by the judgment -- that ruling wouldn't

 7   actually invalidate a single State law.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But that would leave out

 9   Graham, then?     Your rule, you say under the age of 14,

10   so you are distinguishing your case from Graham's?                   You

11   are not saying all juveniles, just -- you are setting

12   the line at 14?

13                 MR. STEVENSON:        Well, I support -- my client

14   is 13, and there are differences between kids who are 14

15   and younger and kids who are older.                But I support a

16   line that actual draws the line at 18.                I think that

17   that distinction can and should be made.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Why not Thompson, where

19   the line was 16?

20                 MR. STEVENSON:        Well, I mean, the difficulty

21   of course, is that -- and Thompson was a plurality

22   opinion.   We don't -- you could draw the line anywhere.

23   And we briefed our case recognizing that this Court has

24   discretion.     There could be distinctions that could be

25   made between younger kids and older kids, but we

 1   certainly support a judgment that all children should be

 2   shielded from this age difference.

 3                The reason why we make that distinction is

 4   because that there are legal distinctions.           There are

 5   States that have set the minimum age for trying kids or

 6   imposing these sentences of life without parole at 16 or

 7   17.   We do recognize long traditions on the age of 14.

 8                In the Court's opinion in Stanford v.

 9   Kentucky authored by Justice Scalia -- you referenced

10   this earlier -- at common law we recognize that there

11   was a rebuttable presumption that children 14 and

12   younger could not be tried for felonies, that they were

13   incapable.   And so, we are just arguing that these

14   distinctions can be made.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What -- what about a

16   homicide, a 13-year-old?

17                MR. STEVENSON:       It's our position that,

18   based on the incidence of these sentences, that even

19   between non-homicide and homicide, no child of 13

20   should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

21   That is, only -- in 44 States, no child for any kind of

22   crime has received that kind of sentence.           And this

23   notion that we -- we have to think about who children

24   are in the context of this -- for the crime of rape, the

25   median sentence in this country is 10 years.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But you -- you are

 2   differentiating your position based on young age from

 3   Graham's counsel, who said for murder, even in the case

 4   of a youthful offender, life without parole is an

 5   appropriate -- is an available sentence?

 6                 MR. STEVENSON:        That's -- that's right, Your

 7   Honor.    That -- that is, we think that the data, that is

 8   the consensus, would support both from an age

 9   perspective and from a consensus perspective an absolute

10   ban on life without parole for any child of 13.                   It --

11   it has been rejected by virtually every State in terms

12   of its application.     It has been rejected by many States

13   in terms of its even concept.             I mean, there are a lot

14   of States in this country where you can't get any kind

15   of adult sentence for a crime at 13.                We don't --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So your line is 13,

17   and for obvious reasons.        Another line is going to be 16

18   for obvious reasons.      When the 15-year-old comes in, he

19   is going to say 15, the 17-year-old -- and that it seems

20   to me is why drawing the line on the basis of the Eighth

21   Amendment -- there's certainly nothing in the Eighth

22   Amendment that suggests there is a difference between 16

23   and 17.    Everybody with a different client is going to

24   have a different line, which suggests to me that it

25   ought to be considered in each individual case.

 1                  MR. STEVENSON:       I guess we make these

 2   categorical distinctions in lots of contexts, not just

 3   in the death penalty context.             We appended to our brief

 4   hundreds of laws that draw lines, that say if you are 14

 5   you can't drive, you can't enter into a contract.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but that's

 7   because that's a policy judgment by the legislature.

 8   Here we are talking about the dictates of the Eighth

 9   Amendment.     And the idea that the Eighth Amendment draws

10   those kinds of arbitrary distinctions is one that I

11   don't understand.

12                  MR. STEVENSON:       Well, it is this Court's

13   history.     That is, in Thompson you drew a line between

14   15 and those who are younger.             In -- in -- in Roper you

15   have drawn the line at 18 and 17.             In other contexts, we

16   wrestle with this all the time.            In Atkins, you had to

17   draw a line of defining mental retardation in some

18   sphere.

19                  What we are ultimately arguing is that there

20   are people who are vulnerable, that there are people who

21   need protection, and children are some of those people.

22   Their diminished capacity, their diminished culpability,

23   their inability to be responsible, their vulnerability

24   to negative peer pressures, and their capacity to change

25   and reform is what we think generates this question, and

 1   we think it's an honest question.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It depends on how horrible

 3   the crime is that they've committed, doesn't it?           But

 4   you say it doesn't.     It doesn't depend upon how horrible

 5   it is and how much retribution society demands.

 6               MR. STEVENSON:          I think for -- for a child

 7   of 13 with regard to a sentence of life imprisonment

 8   without parole, that is correct, Justice Scalia.

 9               I think in our construct, where we don't

10   always impose these sentences even for those horrible

11   offenders, to not recognize the difference between a

12   child and an adult is cruel and unusual.           To say to the

13   13-year-old in this case that you get life without

14   parole, but to the 17-year-old you get 4 years and

15   you are released in 6 months, or to the 15-year-old

16   you get juvenile treatment, speaks to the kind of

17   difficulty we have with the absence of a categorical

18   ban.

19               We make these bans all the time.           And I

20   think that the States are capable of implementing them.

21   We cite Gerstein v. Pugh as an example where this Court

22   found time between arrest and presentation to be

23   violative of constitutional norms, and the States were

24   empowered to implement that.

25               With regard to Joe Sullivan, we don't have


                                      24

 1   to speculate.   We know what the sentence will be.          If he

 2   is returned and resentenced, he will be sentenced up to

 3   40 years, or actually the points that were applied to

 4   him would recommend a sentence between 27 years and

 5   40 years.   And we don't contend that that would be

 6   violative of the Constitution, because there is --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could you go back

 8   through the statistics for me?          For children under 14,

 9   how many are in prison for life without parole for

10   homicide and non-homicide cases?

11                MR. STEVENSON:       There are 73 children 14 and

12   younger who have been imprisoned for life without

13   parole.   They can be found in only 18 States.         For the

14   age of 13 and younger, there are only nine kids, and

15   that's including both kids convicted of homicide and

16   non-homicide.

17                For non-homicide, there are only two.          They

18   are both in Florida, and Joe Sullivan is one of them.

19   So the universe of children under 14 and younger is

20   very, very small, smaller than what this Court was

21   dealing with in Roper in terms of the number of death

22   sentences, smaller than what this Court was likely

23   dealing with in Atkins.      It's what this Court has looked

24   at generally to find consensus.          And here, where only 18

25   States have imposed these sentences, a judgment that


                                    25

 1   this is rejected, this is outside the norms, would be

 2   consistent with this Court's precedents in Roper and

 3   Atkins and Coker and Kennedy and the other cases.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:        Can you do what you have

 5   just done with the category non-homicide cases?

 6                MR. STEVENSON:       Yes.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:        Life without parole?

 8                MR. STEVENSON:       Yes.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:        Under the age of 18 when

10   committed?

11                MR. STEVENSON:       Yes.     That would be 111.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:        One hundred and eleven.      Of

13   those 111, how many are in Florida?

14                MR. STEVENSON:       Seventy-seven.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:        Seventy-seven.      And of the

16   remaining,   how many States are they in?

17                MR. STEVENSON:       Six.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:        Six.

19                MR. STEVENSON:       And with regard to children

20   younger, we're also talking about just the universe of

21   six, 14 and younger, all in Florida.             And so it is this

22   absence --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:        This is non-homicide.       Six

24   --

25                MR. STEVENSON:       Non-homicide, yes, sir.

 1   Yes, sir.   And so it is this absence of a categorical

 2   rule that has created some of these results.               There are

 3   some other arbitrary features about this population that

 4   we've raised in our brief that are concerning.               They are

 5   disproportionately kids of color --

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:        What is your response to the

 7   State's argument that these statistics are not

 8   peer-reviewed?   And these are statistics, am I right,

 9   that you generated yourself?

10               MR. STEVENSON:        Well, these statistics come

11   from the States' Departments of Corrections, Your Honor.

12   I mean, we -- we gave the State -- the State doesn't

13   contest our data, at least in their pleading, and we

14   don't control these numbers.            The Departments of

15   Corrections control these numbers, and where these data

16   are within their power of the State to present, we

17   don't think there's any real question about the

18   reliability of the data that we are relying on.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            There's a certain

20   number of States that didn't respond at all.

21               MR. STEVENSON:        There are very few.         In one

22   study, there were only two States.               In the report that

23   we generated, we got the information from all States.

24               I see my white light is on.               I'd like to

25   reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 4                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR

 5                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 6                 MR. MAKAR:      May it please the Court:

 7                 As to the data, in our view, the data is

 8   unreliable.    The data -- unlike the death penalty

 9   context, where there is a rich literature of data that's

10   been generated over years on mitigating factors and so

11   forth and there's full regard, the data here is suspect

12   --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:         You say it's suspect.         What

14   is your opinion, so far as you can do it, following

15   category:     Non-homicide, life without parole, under the

16   age of 18 when committed?

17                 MR. MAKAR:      Justice Breyer, we have no data

18   on --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Not in your own system?

20                    MR. MAKAR:     Oh, I'm sorry.

22   people in Florida --

 1   parole, under the age of 18 when committed.

 2                MR. MAKAR:    One hundred and fifty.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:        And they say 77?

 4                MR. MAKAR:    They say 77.            That's correct.

 5   The reason being is that the study they're relying upon,

 6   which was generated this summer while this case was

 7   pending ­-

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:        What?        Sorry.

 9                MR. MAKAR:    I'm sorry.            The reason it's --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:        You are speaking too fast.

11   I can't understand you.

12                MR. MAKAR:    I apologize, Your Honor.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Maybe if you raise the --

14   raise the lectern a bit -- no, the other way.

15                MR. MAKAR:    The reason why is that the

16   Annino study upon which they rely, which was generated

17   just this past summer, doesn't count a non-homicide

18   offense that happens to also be bundled with a homicide

19   offense.

20                So, for example, if someone went down the

21   street, committed an armed burglary as Graham did, but

22   then they went across the --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.        Let's -- let's count

24   it their way.   Let's say that a -- non-homicide --

 1   understand what he's saying.              Can I understand this

 2   first?     He's there for the homicide offense or for the

 3   non-homicide offense?

 4                  MR. MAKAR:    This is an individual that they

 5   don't count.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.

 7                  MR. MAKAR:    And this is a person who

 8   committed, for example, an armed burglary.

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Right.

10                  MR. MAKAR:    And then -- and put in jail and

11   sentenced to life without parole.

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        For the burglary, not for

13   the --

14                  MR. MAKAR:    Right, non-homicide.        But they

15   happened, as the course of a crime spree, to commit a

16   homicide offense down the road at a different location.

17   They don't count that sentence for the non-homicide

18   offense in their data.       They undercount the data

19   dramatically.

20                  And in addition, the States -- this is not

21   an easy issue.     The States have primary offenses and

22   secondary offenses.

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:        So -- so in your example,

24   Mr. Smith was sentenced to life without parole for a

25   robbery.    Then you said Mr. Smith also killed someone.

 1   Now, was he convicted of killing someone?

 2                 MR. MAKAR:    Yes, and he was --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes.    Okay.     And so did the

 4   judge have in front of him the conviction for the

 5   killing of the person as well as for the burglary or

 6   whatever?

 7                 MR. MAKAR:    Yes, sir.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes.    Okay.     So I think I

 9   could count that as a homicide offense.               I understand

10   your point.

11                 Now, let's suppose that we take those out of

12   it; in other words, for argument's purpose, concede

13   that where there is also a homicide offense, it counts

14   as homicide, not in the set I am asking you about.

15                 I'm asking you about the set of those

16   non-homicide offenses, life without parole, and they

17   were under the age of 18 when committed.               How

18   many in Florida?

19                 MR. MAKAR:    By our number, it's 150.           They

20   say 77.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Even though you gave --

22   said that the reason for the difference was a set of

23   instances that I just asked you to put to the side.

24                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, okay.           If you are asking

25   me to accept their number, if they use that definition,

 1   that is correct.     It would be 77 individuals that would

 2   be life without parole.        That's correct.           And --

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Which of these cases

 4   is worse?     A 16-year-old committing the crimes that

 5   Graham committed; a 13-year-old committing the crimes

 6   that Sullivan committed?

 7                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, worse in which sense?               I

 8   mean, under the Eighth Amendment, which would be --

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              My point is, if you

10   had to consider youth as one of the factors that we

11   consider under proportionality analysis, how do you come

12   out?

13                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, I think certainly in this

14   case we are at the far extreme.             We're off the charts.

15   This is one of those unfathomable --

16                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Off the charts on

17   age or off the charts on violence?

18                  MR. MAKAR:    Violence, I'm sorry.            The

19   violence meaning that this is one of the most severe

20   violent acts that any human being could perpetuate upon

21   anyone else.     It was done twice; there was two counts.

22   So in that regard --

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I'm sorry, which one?

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What do you mean it was

25   done twice?     I thought he raped only one person.

 1               MR. MAKAR:    Two different -- the woman --

 2   there was two counts of -- of sexual battery in the --

 3   he committed the offense in two different ways upon this

 4   woman, and --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So your adversary

 6   provided statistics to show that other people who have

 7   committed rapes have gotten much smaller terms of

 8   imprisonment, the average being, I think we were told,

 9   10 years.

10               So explain to me why someone who commits a

11   rape is getting 10 years and this 13-year-old -- it's

12   the most heinous crime for a 13-year-old that justifies

13   life without parole.

14               MR. MAKAR:    Well, when we look at the data

15   for sexual battery, there's a distribution, and there's

16   all kinds of factors underlying each of those

17   sentences, and we have hundreds of sexual battery

18   sentences in Florida.    Each one is unique, and each one

19   is presented to the trial judge who makes the

20   determination about the sentence.

21               And there are very harsh sentences,

22   certainly, for some offenses and not for others.           But to

23   take the notion that one could average them together and

24   walk into court and say, I'm way above the average, I

25   should somehow get an Eighth Amendment remedy, we

 1   believe is just the wrong methodology.

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              My --

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:        So, what is the right -- go

 4   ahead.

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Go ahead.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:        I mean, I think if you want

 7   to address it, that the basic argument here is we want a

 8   bright line.     And the justification for the bright line

 9   is (a) it's pretty unusual to have this.                   So that is

10   one part of the clause.        And in respect to it being

11   cruel, you go back to what is supposed to be some kind

12   of rough, basic connection between criminal law and

13   generally accepted principles of morality.

14                   And the confusion and uncertainty about

15   the moral responsibility of a 13-year-old is such that

16   it is not -- it is a cruel thing to do to remove from

17   that individual his entire life.             You say we're at the

18   extreme.                     Now that's roughly what's

19   perking around in my mind, and I would like you to reply

20   to that.

21                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, certainly -- and I've got,

22   Mr. Chief Justice, questions about how does age play a

23   role in proportionality and so forth.                And I think here

24   that a 13-year-old can commit the most heinous of

25   crimes.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:        That wasn't my point.     I

 2   guess I wasn't clear.      My point was, of course, there

 3   can be cases in any set which go in all kinds of

 4   different directions.      But, as a general matter, human

 5   beings are uncertain about how much moral responsibility

 6   to assign to individuals in a particular category, and

 7   that category roughly corresponds with an age of

 8   maturity.

 9                 So you get into arguments when you get to

10   10, no; 11, no; 17, yes maybe; 16, yes maybe.            But

11   as long as we are around 3 years old, 5, 7,

12   9, 12, and they want to say certainly 14, we are in

13   that area of ambiguity.       And not just we, people all

14   over America, some thinking one way, some thinking

15   another.    And that's enough to cut the connection with

16   morality, a strong enough connection that could justify

17   taking the person's entire life away.

18                 You see, I'm trying to make a general

19   argument, and maybe I haven't stated it perfectly.             But

20   if you can get the drift of what I'm talking about, I

21   would like to hear your reply.

22                 MR. MAKAR:    Sure.        Well, I think what you

23   are getting to, Justice Breyer, is that --- two things:

24   One is that the distribution as a function of age.             We

25   know that at younger ages the crime occurrence, the


                                     35

 1   incidence, goes down.       And that goes to the second

 2   point, which is that this is a good thing.                It's -- it's

 3   a lawful sentence that can be imposed, but it's rare.

 4   And we are -- we should be proud of that, that it

 5   doesn't occur with a -- with a great regularity.                It's

 6   an unfortunate thing that it happens, that we have these

 7   gross acts of depravity that would justify it even for

 8   someone that's very young.

 9                  Sullivan is not here to tell the Court:                I

10   should not be punished.        He has told the Court:          I can

11   be in jail for the rest of my life.                All he is asking

12   for is this opportunity to get out, this parole

13   opportunity.     That's what -- what we are talking about.

14   And this issue that he has presented obviously was not

15   one the Florida trial court could have addressed

16   whatsoever.

17                  Justice Ginsburg, you hit the nail on the

18   head.   To interpret the rules the way they are

19   interpreting our rules in Florida would swallow the

20   3.850(b)(2) exception that says --

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Can you tell -- tell us

22   something about that catchall that says an illegal

23   sentence can be reopened at any time, illegal

24   sentence?     What -- Mr. Stevenson said that is not

25   limited to just -- the maximum is 15 years and the

 1   defendant got 20.

 2                  MR. MAKAR:     Well, that's incorrect.         The two

 3   rules he is citing to at this point -- one raised in the

 4   reply brief -- deal with motions to correct a sentence

 5   that exceeds limits provided by law -- that exceeds

 6   the limits provided by law.            And the Florida courts have

 7   held that this is -- in these situations, it's the law

 8   in effect at the time of the sentencing.               In other

 9   words, if -- and -- and then there's the exception

10   under 3.850(b)(2) that says --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That wouldn't apply to the

12   Eighth Amendment?

13                  MR. MAKAR:     No, because 3.850(b)(2) -- well,

14   I think if, for example, at the time of sentencing --

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We're talking about the

16   first sentence of (B), I take it?

17                  MR. MAKAR:     Right.         That's the one they're

18   relying upon:     A motion to vacate a sentence that

19   exceeds the time limits provided by law may be filed at

20   any time.     That has been interpreted in the Florida

21   courts not to allow a new constitutional right that has

22   been applied retroactively to be raised.               It's applied

23   to say:     At the time of your sentencing, on the face of

24   it, can -- was there an error that was made?

25                  Okay.   And -- and to interpret it their way

 1   would swallow the exception.             Florida is entitled, like

 2   every other State, to create a limited exception under

 3   its postconviction rules to say:            We are only going to

 4   consider new fundamental constitutional rights that are

 5   applied retroactively.

 6                 I think, simply put, the Florida trial court

 7   couldn't answer the question they want this Court to now

 8   answer.    It was beyond the trial court's jurisdiction.

 9   The court below couldn't create a new right, extend one,

10   or make it retroactive.       The trial court did what we

11   would expect the trial court to do here, is

12   take a quick look:    What are you asking me to do?          Do

13   you want me to apply Roper in a context that it doesn't

14   state?    I can't do that.     The rule 3.850(b)(2) says I

15   can't do that.

16                 And the judge said it on the record here,

17   Joint Appendix 56, 57, and 58:            The claim does not fit

18   into the limited category of claims allowed to be

19   brought after the expiration of the 2-year period.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Now, what -- during the

21   -- during the time, the postconviction period, would he

22   -- he had an appointed lawyer at trial.            Then we know

23   that he has a lawyer in 2007.            In between, was counsel

24   available to Sullivan?

25                 MR. MAKAR:     Not as a matter of right, and he

 1   did file, I believe, a habeas --

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           No, I mean -- I mean, he

 3   does -- he had representation in 2007.              He didn't for

 4   his first postconviction motion.              I'm not asking as a

 5   matter of right, but did he, in fact, have counsel

 6   during this stage, this --

 7                  MR. MAKAR:    Not -- not that I am aware of,

 8   Justice Ginsburg.     I mean, he did file a pro se State

 9   postconviction challenging the -- the failure to have a

10   semen sample taken and the failure to examine one of his

11   -- his codefendants at trial.              And that was a pro se

12   pleading.   I have looked at it, and it -- it is

13   actually not bad.     It was one, I guess, that was

14   probably done while -- along the -- in the --

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What age was he at that

16   point?

17                  MR. MAKAR:    He would have been

18   approximately, I think, 16, somewhere late teens,

19   I believe; it was a few years after, '89, or '90.              It

20   was about 4, so he was about 17, I think, or

21   thereabouts.

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Do you want to comment on

23   the district court, the -- the -- what -- what the --

24   your opponent says is that this Florida rule is a rule

25   as the district court applied it that said the

 1   following:     You have to file a challenge within 2

 2   years.     There are three exceptions to that.                 One and

 3   three clearly don't apply.             And as to two, Roper isn't

 4   clear enough to make it apply.

 5                  Their response to that is there is no

 6   Florida law that says you have to challenge a sentence

 7   within 2 years.        That Florida courts -- and then they

 8   have, like, 14 cases listed here.                And the Supreme Court

 9   of Florida has said that when you are trying to correct

10   an illegal sentence, that whole part of the statute does

11   not apply.     Okay?     What's the response to that?

12                  MR. MAKAR:       That's not what those cases

13   stand for.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.        So what I should do

15   is go look up and see what those cases hold, and -- and

16   you said to the lower court or the court of appeals --

17   you said their argument is wrong.                The 2-year statute

18   does apply.     The 2-year statute does apply.                 There are

19   three exceptions, and you do not fit within section (B)

20   because.     Where did you say that?

21                  MR. MAKAR:       I don't believe there was any

22   State brief filed in opposition to his appeal.                    That the

23   first district PCA --

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:           So the State didn't even

25   deny what he was saying?

 1                 MR. MAKAR:    Didn't deny -- I'm sorry.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:        So the State -- he says

 3   that whole section doesn't apply.            There is no 2-year

 4   statute.    And you say Florida did not reply in a brief

 5   to that argument?

 6                 MR. MAKAR:    No, because I think it was so

 7   obvious from the trial judge's order that he was relying

 8   on the procedural bar of 3.850(b)(2).             The trial court

 9   had no -- the trial court couldn't do anything.             The

10   trial court couldn't say --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:        All right.

12                 MR. MAKAR:    -- I think -- I think Roper

13   applies.    And he said it just doesn't apply here.           It's

14   barred.    I -- I can't do anything more with it.           So --

15   and I think the fact that he took a quick look at the

16   Roper decision and made that determination under Florida

17   law -- this Court said in footnote 10 in Harris v. Reed

18   that the trial court shouldn't be fearful of looking at

19   the Federal issue for -- for fear of having it come up

20   as being a -- establishing Federal jurisdiction.             And

21   then in Tyler v. Cain, this Court had a retroactivity

22   issue presented to it as well.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:        In any case, there is a

24   circularity point here, I guess.            If we were to say in

25   our opinion -- if we were to say that Roper does hold

 1   that there is a fundamental constitutional right which

 2   we extend to this case and it applies here, and it

 3   applies to the -- retroactively to those whose --

 4   certainly those who are raising the issue, then we would

 5   send it back and Florida now would not bar it under this

 6   statute, because it would fall squarely within the

 7   exception.   Is that right?

 8                MR. MAKAR:    That's exactly right, Justice

 9   Breyer.   If in the Graham case you have a categorical

10   rule that says 18 and under, then prospectively that

11   line is established, and Sullivan could file a

12   postconviction motion under 3.850(b)(2) and pursue it.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You did say in -- in your

14   brief that if Graham should prevail in his petition,

15   that Sullivan would get the benefit of that decision.

16   How, if we -- if we say -- just say there was an

17   adequate independent State ground and we have no

18   authority to do anything more, how would -- how would

19   Sullivan get the benefit of the --

20                MR. MAKAR:    Well, he could file -- the next

21   day he could file a --

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          A new -- a new

23   postconviction motion?

24                MR. MAKAR:    Absolutely.           Absolutely.   And

25   that the Florida court would have jurisdiction under the

 1   exception to consider, given that it would

 2   establish a fundamental constitutional right that's

 3   retroactive in application to his situation.              So --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Would -- would

 5   the standards applied in that situation be any different

 6   than the standards that would apply if you prevailed on

 7   his reading of the procedural bar?

 8               MR. MAKAR:     I'm ­-

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm just trying to

10   see if this jurisdictional issue makes any difference.

11   If you are saying -- it sounds to me like you're saying,

12   well, if he wins, he wins, and, if he loses, he loses.

13   I don't think he cares whether it's under the procedural

14   bar or some other basis.

15               MR. MAKAR:     Well, I think that -- but his

16   winning would be hinging upon Graham, rather than

17   winning in this forum today, on a new claim, that the

18   trial court had no jurisdiction to consider in the first

19   instance.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:        If I understand you

21   correctly, you are saying he could lose here on the

22   procedural bar, and then win later in the State courts.

23   Is that right?

24               MR. MAKAR:     But that's premised upon this

25   Court establishing a new fundamental right in Graham, a

 1   categorical rule, that would apply to him in his case,

 2   retroactive application.        That's -- that's possible, and

 3   we -- we acknowledge that.

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What did the Florida --

 5   what do the Florida courts do with that series of cases

 6   in your footnote, in the yellow brief, where it did

 7   apply Apprendi after?       Did it rule that it wasn't

 8   retroactive?     What did it do in those cases --

11   Apprendi challenges?

12                  MR. MAKAR:    My recollection is

13   that the retroactivity was there, so that they would

14   apply it, but, frankly, I cannot, as I stand here, I

15   can't tell you all -- what all the --

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If you are wrong and

17   they did do exactly what your adversary said and

18   considered the issue of the legality of the sentence

19   under Apprendi, does that vitiate your argument here?

20   Is your -- does that make your adversary's argument

21   correct?

22                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, I don't think that a court

23   here or there that may deviate from the rule would

24   establish the precedent.        I think they -- they've cited,

25   in their -- in their brief, the -- the decision of

 1   Carter v. State of the Florida Supreme Court, which I

 2   think has a pretty good recitation of how the rule

 3   operates.

 4               And it may be that there's a Fifth District

 5   case they rely upon, where the -- the language is a

 6   little squishy, but those are -- those are anomalies,

 7   and they are not the rule in Florida.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, if it's not

 9   consistently applied, then it's not an adequate ground.

10   If so -- if the citations are correct and Florida

11   sometimes treats it as rigid and sometimes doesn't,

12   then it's not a consistently applied -- not an adequate

13   State ground.

14               MR. MAKAR:      Well, there is no question that

15   3.850(b)(2) is consistently and regularly applied.

16   These other rules, I would submit, are consistently and

17   regularly applied.

18               The one -- the two Fifth District opinions

19   they cite -- I have looked at them and the language

20   there, it's ambiguous, it's not exactly clear, but I

21   don't think that the lower court, the lower appellate

22   court's rulings would override the Florida Supreme Court

23   who controls the rules.       They set the rules in Florida.

24   They have rulemaking authority.            That, somehow, that

25   would throw out the adequacy of the -- of the State law

 1   ground.

 2                  In conclusion, if there are no other

 3   questions, we ask that the Court dismiss this on

 4   jurisdictional grounds.        Alternatively, we ask, as to

 5   this case and the others, that -- that the questions

 6   presented should be addressed and answered, which is

 7   whether there's a categorical ban and -- that they do

 8   not -- a categorical ban does not exist.                 Thank you.

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You are missing the

 3   point.    What Florida says and what your adversary is

 4   saying is -- you're absolutely right, if you win under

 5   Graham, you could go under 39.a -- if you win under

 6   Graham, and Graham makes its rule retroactive, that fits

 7   right into (b)(2) directly, and so those cases you have

 8   no problems with.

 9                 What he is saying, however, is you can't go

10   in to Florida and ask them to announce the

11   constitutional rule under a case where it hasn't been

12   already held.

13                 MR. STEVENSON:       Well, I -- and that's what I

14   disagree with, Your Honor.         That's exactly what the

15   court is doing in Hughes.        That's exactly what the court

16   is doing in these other cases.           Otherwise, a lot of this

17   Court's rules don't have clear and direct categorical

18   lines.

19                 You have to apply them.             You have to apply

20   them in context.    And it would mean that people whose

21   sentences are now illegal under the law, only when

22   applied, would be so banned, and that's what I don't

23   think the Florida legislature or the Florida courts are

24   saying.

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:       And you address this in


                                     47

 1   footnote 35 of your reply brief, and it would have been

 2   a little bit helpful if you had raised it initially, so

 3   that the State would have had an opportunity to reply,

 4   but you introduced the citation there with "for

 5   example," and then you cite some cases.                Are there

 6   others?

 7                MR. STEVENSON:         Yes -- yes, there are,

 8   Justice Alito, and -- and, again, I just want to

 9   contextualize why this is the way it is.                At no point

10   did the State make any of these arguments in the lower

11   courts.   They did make it at trial.               They did not make

12   it on appeal.     This issue was raised for the first time

13   in this Court.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:         There are -- there are other

15   cases in which the lower Florida courts have used --

16   have said that this particular subsection is appropriate

17   for raising a constitutional challenge.

18                MR. STEVENSON:         That's correct.        There are

19   other situations where they have made Eighth Amendment

20   claims and analyses, and sometimes the petitioners

21   lose; sometimes they prevail.             They have done it in

22   other contexts.    And so I do think that it's quite

23   clear, from the way Florida applies these cases, that

24   this Court has jurisdiction.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought that in your


                                      48

 1   cert petition, which I don't have with me, you raised

 2   the question of the adequate State ground in the second

 3   question.

 4               MR. STEVENSON:          We did -- well, what we

 5   raised was that, without this Court intervening, that

 6   people like Joe Sullivan would likely never get review.

 7   Our point was that, without an intervention from this

 8   Court, people like Joe Sullivan -- there hasn't been a

 9   sentence like --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But there was a question

11   that you raised, and then your opening brief doesn't

12   discuss it at all.     Your reply brief responds to the

13   State and then brings up something in a footnote that

14   the State doesn't have a chance to answer.

15               That doesn't seem, to me, a very sound way

16   to approach a question that you, yourself, raised.

17               MR. STEVENSON:          Yes.     Justice Ginsburg, we

18   read that second question to be should this Court take

19   an interest in a case?       Should this Court be barred?

20   Should this Court intervene where a child of 13 has been

21   sentenced to life without parole, and there may never be

22   another example?     He can't go to Federal habeas corpus

23   because he is time-barred from that.               So this Court's

24   opportunity to review the case is critical.               That's what

25   we thought we were raising in the second question.

 1               Frankly, we thought that the jurisdictional

 2   question was a question that was pretty clear -- plain

 3   on its face because the trial court's disposition of the

 4   this case was completely dependent on its interpretation

 5   of Roper, and I think that's what gives this Court

 6   jurisdiction.

 7               You have said, repeatedly, in

 8   Ohio v. Reiner, in Ake v. Oklahoma, when the analysis of

 9   a State procedural rule does depend on an assessment of

10   the Federal law, you have jurisdiction.

11               And I think that jurisdiction should be

12   exercised in this case to declare that this sentence is

13   unconstitutional.   It is unquestionably unusual to

14   have -- no child of 13 in this country sentenced to life

15   without parole in 44 States makes it clear that this is

16   an unusual sentence.

17               But we also contend to say to any child of

18   13 that you are only fit to die in prison is cruel.                 It

19   can't be reconciled with what we know about the nature

20   of children, about the character of children.                 It cannot

21   be reconciled with our standards of decency, and we

22   believe that the Constitution obligates us to enforce

23   those standards and reverse this judgment.

24               My time is up.        Thank you.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,
