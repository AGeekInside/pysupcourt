 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We will hear

 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8              GENERAL KAGAN:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              The Establishment Clause does not prohibit

11   the sensible action Congress took in enacting Section

12   8121 and thereby divesting the Federal Government of the

13   property at issue in this case.

14              The district court gave Congress two basic

15   options when it found the Sunrise Rock War Memorial

16   unconstitutional.     First, Congress could accede to

17   permanently removing the memorial, ending the dispute,

18   but also doing away with a memorial that for 75 years

19   had commemorated America's fallen soldiers and had

20   acquired deep meaning for the veterans in the community.

21              Or, second, Congress --

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               General Kagan, just as a

23   factual matter, is there any other national memorial

24   that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol

25   and no other?


                                         3

 1                GENERAL KAGAN:           I don't believe that there

 2   is, Justice Ginsburg.         There are national memorials that

 3   have some religious content to them.                     There is, for

 4   example, a statue of a Catholic priest holding a very

 5   large cross, but most national memorials are -- are not

 6   religious.     Some are.

 7                The -- the -- you know, I think that it

 8   would even be possible, for example, to make a church or

 9   a synagogue a national memorial.                 If -- if Dr. King's

10   church were selected as a national memorial because of

11   -- in order to honor Dr. King, I think that would be

12   permissible.    If --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, I was just curious

14   as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if

15   there was any other memorial like that, and your answer

16   is no, but there could be other religiously oriented

17   memorials?

18                GENERAL KAGAN:           Yes, and there is at least

19   one religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which

20   is a priest holding a cross.

21                JUSTICE ALITO:           What are the practical

22   consequences of something being designated as a national

23   memorial?

24                GENERAL KAGAN:           Very little, Justice Alito.

25   In fact, it has no consequences in terms of the


                                         4

 1   government's supervision of the land.                 National

 2   memorials can be on private land or on public land.               If

 3   they are on private land, nothing goes along with the

 4   designation by way of more extensive regulation or

 5   supervision by the National Park Service.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is the -- is the private

 7   property owner who has this designation free to destroy

 8   it after it's been designated a national memorial?

 9              GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, Justice Ginsburg.        The

10   Veterans of Foreign Wars here could in fact take down

11   this memorial once it is transferred to them, if the

12   Court allows that transfer.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could they then

14   substitute whatever other memorial they chose?

15              GENERAL KAGAN:          The --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Or would there have to be

17   some government approval?

18              GENERAL KAGAN:          No, no, no.         The

19   reversionary clause which is at issue, which is a part

20   of the transfer legislation, says that the VFW will have

21   to put up a veterans memorial, but the content of that

22   veterans memorial is entirely up to the VFW.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it wouldn't

24   automatically require acquire a national memorial

25   status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it,


                                      5

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial

 2   status, the government has to approve what you put up.

 3               GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, that's correct.    If the

 4   VFW took down this memorial and substituted a different

 5   memorial, that memorial would not at that point have

 6   national memorial status.

 7               There is a little bit of a dispute as to

 8   whether the -- the VFW could in fact take down the

 9   memorial or whether it's designation as a national

10   memorial would prevent them from doing that.            I think

11   it's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the

12   Section 1369, which is what the Respondents point to,

13   would not prevent the VFW from taking down this

14   memorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only

15   to national memorials which are on public property.               If

16   the transfer were to take place, of course, it would not

17   be on public property, or it would not be under the

18   supervision, in any way, of the Federal Government.

19   So --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            General Kagan, before you

21   go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as --

22   as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of

23   the land.   But is it?

24               What this was was simply an affirmation of

25   the prior injunction.      The court of appeals said the


                                       6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the

 2   transfer of the land.      So isn't really the issue whether

 3   that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed

 4   belong to the government, whether that prior injunction

 5   was valid?

 6                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, there is a question in

 7   this case whether the prior injunction was valid and was

 8   the display itself a violation of the Establishment

 9   Clause.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

11                GENERAL KAGAN:         But the government argued

12   below that that question had been mooted out because of

13   the passage of the transfer legislation.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But didn't the court of

15   appeals say no?

16                GENERAL KAGAN:         The court of appeals did say

17   no, but it remands the government --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So -- so what we have

19   before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the

20   prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public

21   land.

22                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, I think what you have

23   before you, there were of course two stages in this

24   litigation, and the first stage declared the display

25   unconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the


                                       7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   transfer as well unconstitutional or at least a

 2   violation of the prior injunction.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Of course, if I -- if I

 4   thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the

 5   transfer would a fortiori not --

 6              GENERAL KAGAN:            Well, that is correct.       We

 7   do think that the issue before the Court now is the

 8   congressional legislation which has been passed, which

 9   is the transfer legislation, that that has essentially

10   changed the situation on the ground, so that no longer

11   is the question whether the display from the -- whether

12   the display by the government would be constitutional,

13   but only whether the government has the ability to

14   transfer this property and -- and to give up all

15   supervision, all control over it.

16              So that the message --

17              JUSTICE BREYER:              I don't see why that's the

18   issue before us.   Look, procedurally this is a little

19   boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law.

20   I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a

21   bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to

22   name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but

23   Travelers Indemnity, et cetera.               And it seems to me they

24   make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the

25   others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and


                                        8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that

 2   stays in, all those issues that they previously raised

 3   or could have raised are gone; that the only question

 4   left is whether the government has complied with the

 5   injunction.

 6                 So I read the injunction.                    The injunction

 7   says the government is enjoined from permitting the

 8   display of the Latin cross, period.                      Once this law takes

 9   effect and you follow it, you are violating that

10   injunction.     You don't need nine proceedings to see

11   that.     You are violating it.

12                 Now, if you don't like the injunction

13   because you think the statute has so changed the

14   circumstances there is no need for it, there is a

15   remedy.     You go back to the district court and you say:

16   Judge, change the injunction.              But you haven't done

17   that.     And therefore, the only question before us is

18   whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you

19   carry the statute into effect, you are violating this

20   injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.

21                 Now, now, that -- that's a very technical

22   boring issue.     I don't know why we heard this issue, but

23   I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this

24   case.

25                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Justice Breyer, I think we


                                         9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   are in perfect compliance with the injunction and have

 2   been since the day it was issued.               Now, in fact there

 3   were two injunctions issued.           As I said, there were two

 4   stages of this litigation.         The first stage ended in an

 5   injunction that said do not display the war memorial.

 6   In compliance with that injunction, the next day the war

 7   memorial was covered.      So we were in compliance from

 8   the -- from the moment that the decision issued.

 9              Now then, Respondents went back to the

10   district court and asked for additional relief, because

11   what -- during the first court of appeals hearing,

12   Congress had passed this transfer statute.                And so the

13   Respondents went back and said:             In addition to the

14   injunction that you previously gave us, we essentially

15   need a new injunction and that injunction will be to

16   stop the transfer.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:           But that's not what I'm

18   talking about.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought the Respondents

20   asked to have the injunction enforced.                It is typical,

21   you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the

22   government has recognized that that was indeed a final

23   decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit

24   under 1291 as a final decision.             Then the question is,

25   are you complying with the injunction.                One side says,


                                     10
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing

 2   to enforce the injunction that is now final that that

 3   party obtained -- the winner says:                  Court, please

 4   enforce the injunction.         They are not asking for a new

 5   injunction.     They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer

 6   just explained, says, do not permit the cross.                  The

 7   party comes in and says:          Here's my injunction; court,

 8   all I want you to do is enforce it.

 9                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Justice Ginsburg, this is

10   much more than an enforcement action.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           We are talking about the

12   first.     We are talking about the first injunction.                 The

13   first injunction says that the government may not permit

14   display.     You've covered it up, so you are not

15   permitting display.      You are in compliance.

16                 GENERAL KAGAN:          That is correct.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But what the plaintiff here

18   said is that when you comply with this statute, you will

19   not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to

20   the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted

21   it to be displayed.      Now, that I can see is an issue

22   before us.     But I don't see any other issue before us.

23                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Justice Breyer, again, the

24   Respondents had to go back to the district court in

25   order not just to enforce the injunction, which said


                                        11
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   don't display the statue, but to get additional relief,

 2   which was don't transfer the statue.                  If the transfer

 3   had taken place, it would no longer have been the

 4   government's property, the government would not have

 5   permitted or not permitted the display because it wasn't

 6   the government's property to permit or not to permit the

 7   display.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It seems to me unreasonable

 9   to read the injunction to say the government shall not

10   permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter

11   who owns the land.     I assume the injunctions meant you

12   will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel

13   of government land.

14              GENERAL KAGAN:          And the Ninth Circuit

15   specifically said -- when this came to the Ninth

16   Circuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents.

17   In order to rule on the transfer legislation, the Ninth

18   Circuit specifically said:         We are not going to do that;

19   that's a decision for another day, a separate decision.

20   Because of that, the Respondents had to go back to the

21   district court and had to get the district court

22   essentially to modify the injunction and to provided

23   additional relief.

24              Now, there is some question as to whether

25   the standing question here, just the standing question


                                      12
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is precluded, and our view is that it is not preclude,

 2   because the way the government views this is it's one

 3   entire litigation in which all issues are open.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you know, General

 5   Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent

 6   injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible,

 7   where -- and standing was in question, raised,

 8   litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won

 9   the injunction comes to the court and says, court,

10   please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we

11   can go back to square one and argue again about

12   standing?   I don't see how you can revive what has been

13   determined by a final judgment.

14               GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, either this is one

15   litigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or

16   it's too entirely separate litigations, in which case

17   the Court has an obligation to independently consider

18   the standing question.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, we know it isn't

20   that because, as I think you pointed out, the same

21   docket number.   This wasn't a new complaint.           This was a

22   motion to enforce the judgment.

23               GENERAL KAGAN:          It couldn't have been a

24   motion to enforce the judgment because the government

25   was in compliance with the judgment and because the

 1   Ninth Circuit had said that the question that

 2   respondents were raising was an entirely separate issue

 3   for another day, according to the Ninth Circuit.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I would suppose -- I

 5   guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the

 6   same action or it's entirely separate.                  I would suppose

 7   it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and

 8   perhaps standing is one of those.                 Other issues are

 9   completely new, such as the effect of the legislation,

10   which couldn't have been before the district court since

11   it hadn't been passed.

12                 But standing is different.                I mean, once

13   it's been determined that there is standing and that is

14   reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later

15   aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's

16   embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for

17   standing and not the earlier questions of whether he

18   visited it enough or planned to visit enough.

19                 GENERAL KAGAN:         Mr. Chief Justice, we could

20   not have taken the standing question to this Court in

21   the -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at

22   that point.    It would have been really an irresponsible

23   action on our part to ask this Court to address the

24   standing issue after the first court of appeals judgment

25   where -- where we knew that we were going to relitigate


                                       14

 1   the question of the validity of the transfer.                    We

 2   couldn't have come to you, we wouldn't have come to you,

 3   as the Solicitor General's Office and asked you to

 4   adjudicate a decision that was as likely as not going to

 5   be irrelevant.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I don't understand -- I

 7   don't understand that point at all.                    If you thought that

 8   he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all

 9   and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up

10   the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court.

11   It was a permanent injunction.             You were told you have

12   interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment

13   rights.   At any point you could have come and said:                  The

14   order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off

15   this land was just plain wrong.

16               GENERAL KAGAN:          I think, Justice Sotomayor,

17   you are right that we could have, but I don't think that

18   we would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking

19   on this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office

20   discretion, in order to ask you to decide a question

21   that was as likely or not going to be completely

22   irrelevant depending on what happened with respect to

23   the transfer statute.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But interlocutory appeal

25   or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to


                                      15
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   get away from the injunction.              The issue is did you give

 2   up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in

 3   that injunction and you haven't answered why not.                  You

 4   may have a right, and you do, to challenge a

 5   modification of that injunction.                 That's what you are

 6   here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying

 7   the injunction and stopping the transfer.                 Perfectly

 8   legitimate point, because the injunction has been

 9   changed.    But you can't go back and relitigate whether

10   he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of

11   that cross.

12                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

13   appreciate the distinction that you are making between

14   the standing question and the merits question and I

15   think you are exactly right as to that point.                But

16   whatever the question as to whether we have given up the

17   standing question, certainly there is no such question

18   on the merits of this -- of the validity of this

19   transfer.     But with respect, I think that the standing

20   question is -- is not the way you described it.                And

21   it's partly because we couldn't have come to this Court

22   or we wouldn't have come, is a better way to say it.                   We

23   would have thought that it was not the right kind of

24   position to ask the Court to take certiorari on a

25   question that basically was very likely, we thought, was

 1   very likely to go away.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but that -- that's

 3   because -- that's because you assume the act is going to

 4   be valid.   You could have come here and said:            This is

 5   such an important case Congress is taking action, and

 6   therefore, you should hear our standing argument to

 7   avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to

 8   come in.    You could have said that.

 9                GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, but we didn't, because

10   we did think that Congress had acted appropriately and

11   that the congressional act was valid, and continue to do

12   so, continue to think that this --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, but the standing

14   issue was independently important to the government,

15   because the government can face this kind of question

16   again, and if you right -- if you were right on the

17   standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the

18   government would not have had a strong incentive to say,

19   we want to get rid of these cases on the standing

20   ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing.

21                But in any case, you didn't do that, and I

22   think that you started your argument this morning in the

23   right place when you said, let's talk about this law.

24   Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was

25   right, here's a law that cures the constitutional


                                       17

 1   defect.   And that's where you were -- that's where you

 2   started your argument.         Maybe you can pick up with that.

 3   But --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But just I want to just get

 5   this clear procedurally.          I'm sorry.             It'll take one

 6   more second.

 7                 As I read this, there is no modification of

 8   any injunction.     What the -- what the Respondent asked

 9   for, he said:     Judge, either hold that the transfer

10   violates the current injunction, or modify the

11   injunction.    Then what the district court did do is he

12   said the proposed transfer violates the permanent

13   injunction.    The permanent injunction is in the, like,

14   the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says,

15   you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display

16   of the Latin cross.      Therefore, he rejected the need to

17   modify it, and held that --

18                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Justice Breyer.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- this violates the

20   injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed

21   that.

22                 So is there any question in this case of

23   modifying?    Is there any question other than the one

24   that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument

25   about, whether the proposed statute violates the


                                        18
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   July 24th injunction?      That's what the case is about.

 2   Or why am I wrong?

 3               GENERAL KAGAN:          You -- you are incorrect,

 4   Justice Breyer, because in addition to saying this

 5   violates the previously given injunction, the district

 6   court said, you are enjoined from transferring this

 7   property in accordance with this statute.                  And so there

 8   was additional relief, additional relief that the Ninth

 9   Circuit said was additional relief that it wasn't

10   deciding in the first go-round, and that's -- and that

11   places the question, the merits question of the validity

12   of this transfer, directly before the Court.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:           Thank you.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Before we get --

15   before your time expires, we would like to spend a

16   couple of minutes on the merits.

17               (Laughter.)

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And I wonder if you

19   could focus on a particular question.                  What if the

20   government sold simply one square foot, or whatever the

21   area that the base of the cross is -- is resting on the

22   ground?   Would your argument be the same?

23               GENERAL KAGAN:          Mr. Chief Justice, there are

24   certainly limits to the way that the government can

25   transfer property, and I would give you a few of them.

 1   If -- if it was not a bona fide sale, so that there

 2   wasn't proper consideration; if -- if there was only

 3   religious purpose, so that there was no secular purpose

 4   involved; or if after the sale the property was

 5   indistinguishable from government property, so that

 6   everybody naturally thought that this was government

 7   property.    In those cases --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, why isn't that

 9   -- why isn't that the case here?

10                GENERAL KAGAN:          In fact, it's not the case

11   here.    And it's not the case for two reasons.              First,

12   the preserve is riddled with private inholdings.                There

13   are 1800 private landowners with -- excuse me, 1,000

14   private landowners with 1800 plots of land.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But what percentage of the

16   total area do they represent?

17                GENERAL KAGAN:          I'm sorry?

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:            What percentage of the

19   total area do they represent?

20                GENERAL KAGAN:          It's about -- between the

21   State and the private inholdings, it's about 10 percent

22   of the total area.    But they are dotted all over the

23   place.    So tomorrow, 1,000 crosses could go up and

24   nobody would know whether they were on private land or

25   on public land.    Moreover --

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But do you concede there

 2   was a violation at the time the case was decided?

 3              GENERAL KAGAN:          I'm sorry?

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you concede that the

 5   Establishment Clause was violated at the time this case

 6   was decided?

 7              GENERAL KAGAN:          We do not, Justice Stevens.

 8   The government has argued -- argued below that there was

 9   no violation prior to the transfer statute, and that

10   remains the government's position, although, as I said

11   to Justice Scalia, we think that that position has been

12   overtaken by events and that the only question before

13   the Court is the transfer statute.

14              I was going to go on to say to the Chief

15   Justice that, in addition to the fact that private

16   inholdings just riddle the preserve, the government is

17   perfectly happy to put up signs which make clear that

18   the -- the plot in question will not in fact be the

19   government's, but will be the VFW's.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, isn't that an

21   interference or it's singling out someone, private

22   property owner, who's using his property in a particular

23   way, a religious way?     You are going to be putting up

24   signs only for people putting up religious symbols.

25              GENERAL KAGAN:          I don't think that that is


                                     21
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   correct, Mr. Chief Justice.           I think that the preserve

 2   would put up signs for various historic or cultural or

 3   otherwise important --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But it hasn't done

 5   anything like that.      It doesn't say for other property

 6   owners that have maybe something that -- you know, a

 7   ramshackle shack, that they want people to know this

 8   isn't the government's property.               They don't do anything

 9   like that.

10                It's -- under your hypothetical, it would be

11   only religious property that would have these special

12   warning signs.

13                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, I suspect that there

14   are a great many identification signs throughout the

15   preserve, although I don't know precisely what they are.

16   And this would be one of those, saying essentially that

17   there is this war memorial, that it was put up by the

18   VFW, that it is maintained and owned by the VFW.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Who would see it, General

20   Kagan?   Who would see it?        I mean, the Seventh Circuit

21   case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people

22   used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required

23   a fence and a sign.      But here, this cross is high on a

24   cliff in a desolate area.         And if you had a little sign,

25   who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               GENERAL KAGAN:          I actually think, Justice

 2   Ginsburg, that it would be easy to do.                 I was out there

 3   three or four weeks ago.        The superintendent drove me to

 4   the site.   There is virtually nobody who could see this

 5   war memorial in any other way than by going in one of

 6   two directions on Cima Road.            And you could put signs up

 7   on Cima Road that said exactly what you were going to

 8   see, you know, in 100 yards or a mile or whatever it

 9   was.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How is the question

11   of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but

12   briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or

13   aren't valid or required before us in this case?                There

14   are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider

15   whether the statute is valid or not.

16               GENERAL KAGAN:          I think, Mr. Chief Justice,

17   that if we were not going to put up signs, it would

18   still be valid.   So I should make that completely clear.

19               And as I said, there are many, many private

20   holdings within the preserve, people who could put up

21   whatever religious symbols they wanted to.                One simply

22   wouldn't know whether it was on private land or on other

23   land.   But I will say, in addition to that, that the

24   preserve's superintendent himself would like to put up a

25   sign essentially telling preserve users what the war


                                      23
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   memorial was and what its provenance was.              If some --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Isn't there legislation

 3   that requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the

 4   plaque recognizing the donation and what it means?

 5                GENERAL KAGAN:         That's correct, Justice

 6   Sotomayor.   But I have to say that that's more of the

 7   kind of sign that maybe Justice Ginsburg had in mind,

 8   which is, it's smaller and you would have to go right up

 9   to the war memorial in order to see it.

10                I think it would be very easy to put up

11   signs just on the road to make clear that anybody who

12   was in the area would know that this was land --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            This would be on

14   government land, that sign?           It wouldn't be on the acre

15   that you transferred.      I'm a little confused.

16                GENERAL KAGAN:         The small plaque.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            You are talking about

18   putting --

19                GENERAL KAGAN:         The small plaque --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Would go on the cross?

21                GENERAL KAGAN:         That's correct.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            The larger sign you're

23   talking about that you are willing to do is a sign that

24   you would put on government land.

25                GENERAL KAGAN:         That's correct.     And as I


                                      24

 1   said, it's something that the superintendent would like

 2   to do and I think would be consistent with signage in

 3   the area.   If I --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Did you raise that

 5   alternative with the Ninth -- with the district court

 6   and the Ninth Circuit?

 7               GENERAL KAGAN:           I don't believe it ever came

 8   up, Justice Sotomayor.        We did talk about it in our

 9   merits brief to this Court, but I don't think that it

10   ever came up below.

11               If I could reserve the balance of my time,

12   Mr. Chief Justice.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

14               Mr. Eliasberg.

15               ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. ELIASBERG

16                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17               MR. ELIASBERG:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may

18   it please the Court:

19               Justice Breyer, I would like to direct my

20   beginning remarks to you.          I believe you've correctly

21   stated the procedural posture exactly right.                 The only

22   question, point that I would make, is that I don't

23   believe we did -- there was a modification of the

24   injunction here.     Any time a defendant passes a piece of

25   legislation after an injunction is first entered, there

 1   may be a question as to whether that new statute or

 2   legislation is consistent with the injunction.                    But it's

 3   not new relief.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:          I see what the judge did.

 5   He said:   The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction

 6   is granted.    He said:     Buono's motion to amend it is

 7   denied.    Then he did two other things, which he listed

 8   some people and he said they are enjoined from

 9   implementing the law.

10                 Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4

11   are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he

12   granted, not a new injunction.

13                 MR. ELIASBERG:         That's exactly correct.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:          So that's the issue here

15   that we were just possibly debating.                    The issue in the

16   case is whether the district judge might lawfully

17   enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which

18   was to add paragraphs 3 and 4.              That question you

19   concede is here.

20                 MR. ELIASBERG:         I believe that's -- that is

21   here and that is really the only question that is here.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So that under your

23   approach that this is looking to see if the injunction

24   is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an

25   act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard,

 1   not -- not de novo?

 2              MR. ELIASBERG:            That's correct.         But for

 3   this --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Have we ever done

 5   that before?

 6              MR. ELIASBERG:            I --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Have we ever said

 8   that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a

 9   de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?

10              MR. ELIASBERG:            I am not aware of that, but

11   I am also not aware of a situation where the act of

12   Congress is being put forth as the response to an

13   already adjudicated constitutional violation.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Eliasberg, I thought

15   that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken

16   meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the

17   validity of the statute would not be before the Court in

18   the first round.   Judge Kozinski wrote:                 "We express no

19   view as to whether a transfer completed under Section

20   8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this

21   question for another day."

22              That's on page 104a of the petition.

23              And then the district judge said:                   Yes, I

24   recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of

25   that statute, left it for another day.                  The day has

 1   come.   So it is for the first time that the Court is

 2   deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes

 3   constitutional muster.

 4               MR. ELIASBERG:          The only thing I would

 5   disagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is

 6   that the question is whether the act of Congress

 7   remedies the already adjudicated constitutional

 8   violation and is consistent with the injunction.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So when you get to

10   the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it

11   was your position that we should review this question

12   solely under an abuse of discretion standard?

13               MR. ELIASBERG:          It is our position --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Because while the

15   Court did not decide the validity of the act in the

16   first case, it certainly did in the second case, which

17   is why we have the case before us.

18               MR. ELIASBERG:          That is correct.        We

19   believe -- but may I make two points, Mr. Chief Justice?

20               First, we believe in the enforcement context

21   where the question is, is this a violation of an already

22   entered injunction that was part of a final judgment,

23   that that is traditional equity principles that you

24   review for an abuse of discretion.                Nonetheless, we

25   believe that we win even under a de novo standard.


                                      28

 1   So -- and if I could set forth some of the reasons for

 2   that.

 3              I think, Justice Breyer, that you have it

 4   exactly correct, that what the government has done here

 5   by selecting a particular transferee who has been given

 6   preferential access to the land in the past to the

 7   exclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols,

 8   that the government is taking affirmative steps to

 9   permit, through this transfer statute, the display of

10   the cross that they are enjoined from doing.

11              Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is

12   at some point if this is on private land and the

13   government is not making any efforts to further this

14   display, that it couldn't possibly be that the

15   injunction forbids that.       And that may well be correct,

16   but that is not the case we have in front of it.

17              The government in this transfer statute has

18   made a significant number of affirmative steps to ensure

19   that the cross remains up.         It has selected --

20              JUSTICE ALITO:          When this injunction was

21   first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that

22   this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that

23   correct?

24              MR. ELIASBERG:          When the district court

25   entered the injunction, that is correct.


                                     29
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes.       So isn't the sensible

 2   interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting

 3   the government from permitting the display of the cross

 4   on government property, and not on private property that

 5   happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?

 6               MR. ELIASBERG:          I don't believe so, Justice

 7   Scalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of

 8   reasons.   One of the bases for the entry of the

 9   injunction in the first instance was the way that the

10   government had favored one party to come on, contrary to

11   the government's own regulations, and erect a permanent

12   symbol, while not allowing others.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          Wasn't your argument that

14   this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because

15   it was on government land?          Did you make the argument

16   that even if this was on one of the ranches within the

17   Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation

18   of the Establishment Clause?

19               MR. ELIASBERG:          We did not make that

20   argument because it wasn't presented to the Court.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes, it was a totally -- so

22   the situation completely changed and the district court

23   either modified the injunction -- it seems to me

24   modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean

25   something quite different from what anybody contemplated


                                      30

 1   it meant when it was originally entered?

 2                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Well, I think that, as is

 3   traditional equity principles, the district court is at

 4   some level the master of its injunction and that's why

 5   we give an abuse of discretion standard.                The district

 6   court very clearly said:         I see this as an attempt by

 7   the government not to abide by my injunction; they are

 8   favoring the same parties they favored when -- that was

 9   part of the --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, of course, it was

11   that, but the question is whether it was a permissible

12   amendment by the government of the situation.               Of

13   course, I will stipulate that the government was trying

14   to arrange it so that the cross could remain there.                   But

15   that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the

16   injunction.    I mean, that's --

17                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Well, I think it is --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Unless the injunction

19   clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private

20   land that the government had -- had transferred.

21                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Well, but it's not the

22   erection of the cross.        It is the transfer of something

23   where the government has a reversionary interest.                It

24   very much directs the way the VFW is likely to use the

25   land.   It selected a particular transferee who has been


                                       31

 1   favored from the beginning.            They didn't say:         We're

 2   going to neutrally sell the land in order to allow this

 3   constitutional violation to be --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I will -- I will concede

 5   that the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in

 6   violation of the injunction.             But that doesn't mean that

 7   it's invalid.

 8                MR. ELIASBERG:          Well, I believe it's invalid

 9   because I think that the affirmative steps they are

10   taking here really make them -- put them in a position

11   where they are permitting --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can -- can -- what,

13   what -- let's start from the beginning.                   Can -- would it

14   be proper for the government or would the government be

15   alleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on

16   another ranch that cross -- a cross went up?

17                MR. ELIASBERG:          No, they would not.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             All right.       So really

19   your argument is that the reason this Court -- this

20   cross on private land, if it becomes private, is

21   offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the

22   government's prior history with respect to that cross,

23   correct?    That's -- that's your argument?

24                MR. ELIASBERG:          That is one part of my

25   argument.    But there is another part.                 The government

 1   has taken the step of designating this cross one of 49

 2   national memorials in the whole country and the only

 3   national memorial commemorating American service in

 4   World War I, even though it's clear in the record --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So are you alleging that

 6   doing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or

 7   designating a religious symbol as a national memorial,

 8   that that violates the Establishment Clause?

 9               MR. ELIASBERG:         We are alleging that under

10   the totality of the circumstances, which includes the

11   national memorial designation, the government's asserted

12   purpose to make sure that the cross remains up, the

13   government's favoritism of the same parties that it has

14   always favored in this case to the exclusion of others,

15   and the maintaining of the property interest in the land

16   in the form of a reversionary interest, all of those

17   things --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Does that apply to all

19   lands in this preserve?

20               MR. ELIASBERG:         I'm sorry, does what apply

21   to all lands?

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Does the reversionary

23   interest apply to all of lands on this preserve?            Maybe

24   your adversary has to answer that instead of you, but

25   all of the other private property owners.

 1              MR. ELIASBERG:            No, the reversionary

 2   interest specifically says the land reverts to the

 3   government if --

 4              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, no, no.     Are all of

 5   the private owners on this preserve required to give the

 6   land back to the U.S. if they put it to some different

 7   use?

 8              MR. ELIASBERG:            I don't believe that that

 9   is true.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, if -- if --

11   if the government sold this land to a private party, no

12   cross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement

13   and at settlement the private landowner who is going to

14   buy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up

15   on this property once I get it, can the government still

16   sell it to him?

17              MR. ELIASBERG:            Yes, absolutely.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Okay.

19              MR. ELIASBERG:            If the basis for the

20   government's decision to sell the -- sell the land was a

21   neutral basis.    And that's what we are saying here.               If

22   what the government has done --

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So even though

24   before the sale, even though the government knows there

25   is going to be a big cross on the land with the same

 1   situation you have here in the middle of the preserve

 2   and all, that's perfectly okay?

 3                 MR. ELIASBERG:          No, it's --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought you said

 5   before the government sold the land if they find out the

 6   new owner is going to put a cross on it there is no

 7   problem.

 8                 MR. ELIASBERG:          The difference between those

 9   two scenarios, Mr. Chief Justice, is one is a remedial

10   context.     The government has been held to violate the

11   Constitution.     They have to, under Milliken v. Bradley

12   and U.S. v. Virginia, take all steps necessary to erase

13   that constitutional violation.

14                 The situation in the first hypothetical you

15   gave me, there has never been an adjudicated

16   constitutional violation.           It's a very different

17   situation.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But isn't it also a very

19   different case if a condition of the transfer is that

20   the transferee will preserve a memorial that has been

21   designated in the statute as a five-foot-tall white

22   cross.

23                 MR. ELIASBERG:          I think that is --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            So it is a condition of

25   the transfer.

 1              MR. ELIASBERG:          As I was stating to Justice

 2   Sotomayor, that is one of the factors that we believe

 3   separates this situation from the kind of hypotheticals

 4   that you're setting forth.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you disagree with

 6   what she told us, which is that the private property

 7   owner can tear down the cross at any time?

 8              MR. ELIASBERG:          I think that there are very

 9   significant obstacles to their doing that.               One, I don't

10   -- I disagree with the General's -- General Kagan's

11   description of the criminal statute that prohibits the

12   defacement of memorials on private land, because one of

13   the provisions is that we will consider it a situation

14   that is covered by the statute that the land be under

15   the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.               Well, the

16   land -- the statute that designated the Mojave Preserve

17   very clearly says that the land is being transferred

18   from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management

19   to the National Park Service and the Secretary of the

20   Interior, so it is therefore clearly under the

21   jurisdiction of the Federal Government.               So I think that

22   there is -- there are possible criminal violations.

23   There is also a significant question --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You say under the

25   jurisdiction of the Federal Government.               Does that -- do

 1   you just mean they have authority to regulate the land?

 2               MR. ELIASBERG:          That's correct.        But that's

 3   the way the statute is written, under Federal

 4   jurisdiction, so I believe that those two terms --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I suppose they

 6   have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land

 7   that they don't own.

 8               MR. ELIASBERG:          Well I think that in this

 9   case when the government is actually -- there's quite a

10   bit of case law -- we set forth some in our brief --

11   where they talk about the government's power over land

12   that's within a national preserve, so I do think that

13   the criminal statutes may very well apply.

14               It certainly would be a barrier to the VFW's

15   thinking, well, no risk to us if we tear this cross

16   down.   In addition, the government is required, as I

17   believe one of the Justices and I don't remember

18   which -- the government has been required to go back and

19   put up a plaque that says:          This cross erected in honor

20   of the foreign war dead.        It would be very odd indeed, I

21   believe for the VFW --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What else -- what

23   else does the plaque say.

24               MR. ELIASBERG:          The plaque says:        "This

25   cross" -- in big letters -- "erected in honor of the

 1   dead of foreign wars."       I think it would be very --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And that's it?

 3   Nothing else?

 4               MR. ELIASBERG:          Nothing else.          I think it

 5   would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was

 6   free to take down the cross and put up, for example, a

 7   statues of a soldier which would honor all of the people

 8   who fought for America in World War I, not just

 9   Christians, and say:     Well, we were free to do that

10   because even though there's the sign that says, this

11   cross is designated to honor all the --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           The cross doesn't honor

13   non-Christians who fought in the war?                  Is that -- is

14   that --

15               MR. ELIASBERG:          I believe that's actually

16   correct.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where does it say that?

18               MR. ELIASBERG:          It doesn't say that, but a

19   cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it

20   signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to

21   redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that's why

22   the Jewish war veterans --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's erected as a war

24   memorial.   I assume it is erected in honor of all of the

25   war dead.   It's the -- the cross is the -- is the most

 1   common symbol of -- of -- of the resting place of the

 2   dead, and it doesn't seem to me -- what would you have

 3   them erect?    A cross -- some conglomerate of a cross, a

 4   Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and

 5   star?

 6                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Well, Justice Scalia, if I

 7   may go to your first point.            The cross is the most

 8   common symbol of the resting place of Christians.                    I

 9   have been in Jewish cemeteries.               There is never a cross

10   on a tombstone of a Jew.

11                 (Laughter.)

12                 MR. ELIASBERG:         So it is the most common

13   symbol to honor Christians.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          I don't think you can leap

15   from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that

16   that cross honors are the Christian war dead.                    I think

17   that's an outrageous conclusion.

18                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Well, my -- the point of

19   my -- point here is to say that there is a reason the

20   Jewish war veterans came in and said we don't feel

21   honored by this cross.        This cross can't honor us

22   because it is a religious symbol of another religion.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Can I get back to

24   your plaque question?       Am I wrong?            I think the

25   government told us the plaque reads:                    "The cross erected

 2   of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884."

 3                 MR. ELIASBERG:         That is correct, Mr. Chief

 4   Justice, and I apologize.          I forgot --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               That's a big

 6   difference.    I mean, the whole point is that the plaque

 7   tells you, this is not a government memorial, government

 8   structure.    It was put up by members of the Veterans of

 9   Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.

10                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Mr. Chief Justice, the

11   context of your question was would VFW feel constrained

12   to keep the cross up?       And my point was --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The context of my

14   question was what does the plaque say?

15                 MR. ELIASBERG:         Well -- I -- I apologize for

16   not giving the full text, that was not my intention to

17   -- to mislead the Court or to you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               All right.

19                 MR. ELIASBERG:         My only point is that in

20   that scenario, because did I believe we were talking

21   about, is the VFW free to do this, and I was pointing to

22   the criminal statute that I said I believe said that

23   they couldn't -- wouldn't feel free to take this down.

24   But second of all, that it would be odd indeed for them

25   to take it down when there is a big plaque that says

 1   this cross erected.      With all of the --

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:          When the Solicitor General

 3   represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to

 4   modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they

 5   obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any

 6   realistic fear that they will be required to maintain

 7   this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some

 8   way?

 9              MR. ELIASBERG:          Well, I think that there is

10   a real -- well, but -- but I don't think that the cases

11   turn on whether a prosecutor says well, I promise you

12   that we are not going to enforce the statute.         I think

13   we have to look at the words of the statute and the

14   words of the reversionary interest, and I think they

15   both create significant doubt as to whether the VFW

16   would feel free to turn this -- to take it down, in the

17   same way that in a context where you are talking about

18   pre-enforcement --

19              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I thought your

20   argument was that although there was going to be a

21   formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the

22   government was still involved with the maintenance of

23   the cross on this land.        And when the government says

24   that that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't

25   cure the practical problem.

 1               MR. ELIASBERG:            Well, that -- the -- the

 2   question of government -- continued government

 3   involvement with the land, I believe, continues, because

 4   of the reversionary interest and because of the

 5   designation as a national memorial.                      Whatever the --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I think -- I think

 7   General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't

 8   substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a

 9   national monument it has to have the government's

10   approval.   And the only one that has the government's

11   approval is the cross.

12               MR. ELIASBERG:            That is correct, Justice

13   Ginsburg.   I don't want to speak for General Kagan but

14   with respect to the question --

15               JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, I -- I thought the

16   government's position was it had to be maintained as a

17   national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had

18   to be maintained as a cross.

19               MR. ELIASBERG:            That is the government's

20   position.   But Justice Ginsburg, your question is would

21   something else they put up be a national memorial, and

22   the answer is no.     Only Congress has the power to

23   designate a national memorial.               Congress has chosen to

24   designate this particular stand-alone Latin cross as a

25   government -- as a national memorial.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What about the

 2   government's argument that suppose the government took

 3   down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign

 4   Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal

 5   value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was

 6   ours to begin with.      Now the land is ours, so we just

 7   put it back.    If that would be consistent with the

 8   injunction?

 9                 The government now has nothing to do with

10   the cross.    It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and

11   it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally

12   the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the

13   government didn't put it up.

14                 MR. ELIASBERG:         I believe that that --

15   obviously not the facts presented by our case, Justice

16   Ginsburg, but that likely would be consistent with the

17   injunction, that's correct.            But it is not the scenario

18   we have here.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Then we are talking about

20   something that is rather formal rather than substantial.

21   If -- if all the government would have to do is say,

22   Congress, you didn't get it right.                 You should have just

23   made the land swap.      And then the government would take

24   down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and

25   then it goes right back the next day.

 1               MR. ELIASBERG:          Well, I think if there -- if

 2   there were -- I think it's not just formalism, Your

 3   Honor, because one, the reversionary -- I am assuming

 4   that in your hypothetical the reversionary interest is

 5   gone.   That is continuing government ownership, future

 6   ownership in property, and one of the government's

 7   principal arguments is when we sell to it a private

 8   owner everyone presumes that the private owner is the

 9   speaker.

10               But when the government maintains a

11   substantial future property interest, they haven't sold

12   the land.   They've sold part of their interest in the

13   land.   So if you take away the reversionary interest and

14   you remove the national memorial designation and then

15   the VFW independently does choose to put up the cross,

16   it's more than formalism.         It is the --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But there is also the

18   point that I don't think you stressed, that if the

19   reversionary interest was activated -- say they

20   abandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back

21   to the government.     And if I read the -- the designation

22   of the national memorial statute correctly, the

23   Department of Interior would have to rebuild the old

24   cross and put it up.     There's an affirmative duty to

25   replace the cross if there is a reversion.

 1              MR. ELIASBERG:           I believe that that is

 2   correct, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point

 3   that is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary

 4   interest also continues the government's ownership in

 5   the land, when their whole position is, if we privatize

 6   it, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a

 7   private owner, then we don't associate this cross with

 8   the government.   We associate it with the private owner.

 9              But the government hasn't done that.                     It has

10   maintained an important ownership interest in the land

11   through that reversionary interest.                    If there are no

12   further questions, I will --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this question:

14   Do you think the issues in this case would be -- stay

15   the same or different, if this whole scenario occurred

16   on the Mall in -- right out in front of the

17   Washington -- the Lincoln Memorial?

18              Would the -- the issues be any different if

19   it were not an isolated memorial in the desert?

20              MR. ELIASBERG:           Context has always mattered

21   to this Court in Establishment Clause cases.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And which way would it

23   cut, if it is different?

24              MR. ELIASBERG:           Well, I do think that

25   Washington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is,


                                      45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   obviously, a close tie between something that is put on

 2   the National Mall in the seat of government, but I do

 3   think that the designation of a national memorial is

 4   also significant.

 5                 So, even though this may be an area that is

 6   not nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very

 7   significant that Congress has taken the step with this

 8   particular symbol, one of only 49 in the country,

 9   grouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in

10   this country and tied it.

11                 So I don't think that the distinction,

12   although it might have some bearing in the Court, in

13   thinking of the context, I don't think it would change

14   the result.

15                 Justice Kennedy, I want to go back to -- to

16   one question you had asked earlier about the posture,

17   and I just want to reiterate.              You, very clearly, said,

18   when the government was saying, well, we didn't have a

19   good reason to bring this to the Court, and that's why

20   we didn't, I think your question recognized that the

21   government had very good reasons.

22                 But -- but in addition, it's not really

23   important, when you have a final judgment, why a party

24   chooses not to try to take the last step of appeal on a

25   final judgment, and that's the United States v.


                                        46

 1   Munsingwear case.

 2              The government chose not to make that step.

 3   The judgment was final, and there, certainly, is no

 4   basis for this Court to reopen the issues about whether

 5   Mr. Buono had standing in the first instance.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, wasn't -- isn't this

 7   very different from the situation in Toledo

 8   Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the

 9   merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if

10   not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they

11   reached it, because of the passage of the new statute.

12              This wasn't -- they said it's not moot

13   because this is simply the voluntary cessation of

14   conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is

15   typically applied in the situation where there is a

16   legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held

17   to be violating the Constitution may simply return to

18   its bad old ways, once the litigation is over.

19              But, here, you have the intervening

20   enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the

21   Congress of the United States, and I think it would be

22   quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply

23   going to repeal the statute and go back to the way

24   things were, once the litigation is over.

25              So you have a merits issue that's not -- if


                                        47

 1   technically moot, nearly moot.               The real merits issue in

 2   the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth

 3   Circuit.     They say, take that back to the district

 4   court.     And you say that the standing issue goes away

 5   because the government didn't appeal the standing issue

 6   at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not

 7   been decided.

 8                 MR. ELIASBERG:          Well, two points, if I may,

 9   Justice Alito.     First, the first reason that the Ninth

10   Circuit gave for why the case wasn't moot was not

11   voluntary cessation.       The government conceded the land

12   transfer could take up to two years to effectuate, so in

13   the Ninth Circuit, that this case is far from moot.

14                 Two years is more than enough time to file

15   the government to file the petition for certiorari and

16   had a ruling, both on the merits of the land on -- the

17   cross on government property, but more important, as a

18   number of Justices had pointed out, the question of

19   standing to bring an Establishment Clause case, the

20   government always have an interest in saying, this case

21   should never have been brought.                We never should had

22   have had a judgment entered against us.

23                 For the government to say, we didn't really

24   care at that point because, two years from now, the

25   transfer might be effectuated is not basis for them to

 1   argue that there was no final judgment and no reason for

 2   us to appeal.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I think General Kagan

 4   recognized that there isn't an example of a final

 5   injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you

 6   can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the

 7   standing question that's already been determined.

 8              But there was something that I did want to

 9   ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion.                He said,

10   if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in

11   Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross

12   Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right

13   here in Arlington, what happens to them?

14              MR. ELIASBERG:             Going back, Justice

15   Ginsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a

16   cross on government property, I believe that the Argonne

17   Cross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is

18   extremely different.

19              There are, in the national cemeteries,

20   the -- the VA offers, to veterans and their family, a

21   choice of putting up 39 different emblems and beliefs on

22   their tombstones.     In Arlington, there is a cross that

23   is surrounded by a sea of tombstones with symbols of the

24   faith of all of the different service members.

25              In that context, I don't think anyone would

 1   perceive that the government was favoring one particular

 2   religion because of the variety of choices and religious

 3   symbols expressed there.        That's very different from a

 4   stand-alone cross of one religious symbol that is not

 5   surrounded by any other context, other than --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Has the government ever

 7   turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request

 8   to put up a war memorial on --

 9                MR. ELIASBERG:         They did.          There was a

10   request made for -- to put up a memorial on the site,

11   and the government said no and said, our regulations

12   forbid it.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I am talking about -- on

14   this site?

15                MR. ELIASBERG:         Yes.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:          You know, well, I'm not

17   talking about this site, where there already was a

18   memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I

19   don't agree with you, that -- that every time the

20   government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it

21   has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the

22   same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory

23   in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect

24   religious symbols in different places.

25                I don't see why the government is convicted


                                      50

 1   of being discriminatory.

 2                MR. ELIASBERG:         I think the context here is

 3   what has the government done with respect to national

 4   memorials.   The only two national memorials that are

 5   stand-alone religious symbols are of one particular

 6   religious denomination, and that's Christianity.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:          But -- but you don't --

 8   and they -- were both of them proposed by a private

 9   group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?

10                MR. ELIASBERG:         Well, it's Congress -- I

11   don't know that the Veterans of Foreign Wars ever

12   proposed that this be a national memorial.             Congress

13   designated it as one.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, but it was erected by

15   the Veterans of Foreign Wars.            I mean, do you know of

16   any instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is

17   an organization of Muslim war veterans, requested to

18   erect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?

19                MR. ELIASBERG:         As I said before --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I just don't see why they

21   all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order

22   for the government to be impartial.

23                MR. ELIASBERG:         I'm not saying that in --

24   in -- that, in every circumstance, the government has to

25   have lots of different symbols, but what the government


                                      51
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   has done here --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, I think you are

 3   saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a

 4   public forum.   In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your

 5   brief would limit it to religious symbols.              You say it

 6   has to be an open forum.         Right?

 7              MR. ELIASBERG:            Well, Justice Scalia, if I

 8   make one prefatory point, the government didn't bring to

 9   this Court the merits of the question of whether the

10   cross was permissible on government property.

11              There is a final judgment set in this

12   circumstance.   In this context, it is not.             So that

13   question is not properly before us, but context matters,

14   and I do think, in other circumstances, there may be

15   religious symbols.    There may be a myriad of religious

16   symbols and the context of the situation will matter.

17              But I think if, in Arlington, for example --

18   with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question.              If, for

19   example, a foreign government -- let's take the Canadian

20   Cross of Sacrifice, which the government has put in its

21   brief, was donated by a foreign government to honor

22   people -- Americans who fought for Canada and the

23   British Empire, in I believe it was World War I, if the

24   State of Israel made a similar request to the United

25   States, we would like to honor the Jews who fought in


                                       52
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Operation Iraqi Freedom because we believe that that was

 2   an important defense of the State of Israel, and the

 3   United States said, no, we are not interested, I think

 4   that that would create a quite significant

 5   constitutional violation -- or constitutional question,

 6   but it's not the case in front of us.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask a different

 8   question, just based on your understanding of all these

 9   monuments?    Are there any other federal monuments that

10   contained crosses, other than those associated with the

11   cemeteries?

12                 MR. ELIASBERG:         The one national memorial

13   that I am aware of that has a cross, it is of Father

14   Marquette, who was a significant historical figure.              It

15   is not a stand-alone cross.            It is Father Marquette

16   surrounded by a number of various objects that show his

17   role as a historical figure, exploring the middle west,

18   and he is holding a cross.

19                 But, again, I think -- I agree with General

20   Kagan that, if we honored Martin Luther King, who was a

21   priest, or we honored -- we did something with the Old

22   North Church which had significant historical

23   significance, that would create a very different issue

24   than simply a stand-alone cross, where, when the

25   National Park Service asked its own historian to


                                       53
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   determine whether it had historical value necessary to

 2   bring it within the National Register of Historic

 3   Places, the Park Service's own historian said, no, it

 4   did not.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, this

 6   probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but

 7   I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up --

 8   you know, in the middle of nowhere?

 9              (Laughter. )

10              MR. ELIASBERG:          Because the man who

11   originally put up the cross -- not this one, because it

12   has been replaced a number of times, but the man who put

13   up this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in

14   the area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land

15   Management, and I believe was a miner on the land.                  I

16   hope that is correct historically.               I believe it is.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you.

18              General, you have 2 minutes.

21              GENERAL KAGAN:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

22   Justice.

23              To pick up right there, this stand-alone

24   cross was erected as a World War I memorial by veterans

25   of World War I who had gone to the desert in California

 1   to recuperate and to restore their lives.

 2              And it was that situation that the -- that

 3   the Congress was presented with, was when the Ninth

 4   Circuit ruled and said that this memorial was

 5   unconstitutional, Congress had a choice.                And the choice

 6   was to take down that memorial, which meant an enormous

 7   amount to veterans in the community, or to completely

 8   dissociate the government from that memorial.                And what

 9   Congress did was to completely dissociate the government

10   from that memorial while allowing some war memorial to

11   stand.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:            How can you say that when

13   there's a reversionary interest?              How can you say it's

14   completely dissociated?      There is a reversionary

15   interest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the

16   monument, it goes back to the government.

17              GENERAL KAGAN:          Justice Stevens, with

18   respect, the reversionary interest says that the holder,

19   the VFW, has to maintain a war memorial.               It does not --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but the particular

21   memorial described by Congress was this cross.

22              GENERAL KAGAN:          No, the reversionary

23   interest simply says:     A war memorial.             It does not have

24   to be this war memorial.

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but then it doesn't

 1   -- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's

 2   interest to being and preserving this memorial.

 3               GENERAL KAGAN:          To the contrary, Justice

 4   Stevens.   When Congress wanted to say "this memorial,"

 5   it knew to how to say it, because it said it in the 2002

 6   act.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Right.

 8               GENERAL KAGAN:          In the 2004 act, it said

 9   something very different.         That was after the injunction

10   had issued, so it was a completely different set of

11   circumstances.   Congress understood that an injunction

12   against this war memorial had issued.                  Congress said:

13   We are going to give this back to the VFW, but it's

14   going to be the VFW's choice now as to what to do with

15   it, consistent with it being some kind of war memorial.

16   A reversionary interest of a kind that Congress often

17   uses to -- when it transfers land.                Congress -- it's a

18   completely --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you think anyone

20   thought there is the remotest possibility they would put

21   up a different memorial?

22               GENERAL KAGAN:          I think it's left to the

23   VFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice.                  So if tomorrow

24   or ten years from now or 50 years from now the VFW

25   decides, along with Respondents, that a cross is an


                                      56

 1   inappropriate war memorial, then they can take down that

 2   war memorial.    It's no longer the government's message.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:              How can they say it's an

 4   inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated

 5   the national memorial as, quote, "the five-foot-tall

 6   white cross" and so forth and so on?                    That is what is

 7   the memorial.

 8              GENERAL KAGAN:            But there is no -- there is

 9   no prohibition on the VFW taking down this memorial.                      We

10   will just have one fewer national memorials.                   And --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Do you really think there

12   is any possibility that would happen?

13              GENERAL KAGAN:            Again, I think it is

14   entirely up to the VFW.

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:              That is not my question.

16              GENERAL KAGAN:            I don't know, because I am

17   not the VFW.    It is up to the VFW as to what happens to

18   this war memorial.    That's also true of the plaque, that

19   the plaque could -- the VFW could take down the plaque

20   once the -- the VFW gains title to this property.

21              So what the government has done here -- and

22   Justice Stevens, I don't want to -- of course, you are

23   right that Congress started out thinking they --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:              They not only started it

25   out, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in


                                       57

 1   order to replace the very cross they had designated as a

 2   memorial.

 3               GENERAL KAGAN:            Justice Stevens, you are, of

 4   course, right that Congress thought at the beginning,

 5   prior to the injunction, that this war memorial should

 6   not be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in

 7   the local community, and that it was -- that it should

 8   be retained.   Not an unnatural thing for Congress to

 9   want, to preserve war memorials.

10               When the injunction issued and when the

11   court found that the -- when the Congress found that the

12   courts had declared this display of this memorial

13   unconstitutional, Congress said:                 How can we preserve

14   this -- preserve a war memorial, very possibly this war

15   memorial?   How can we preserve a war memorial but have

16   it not be our choice?

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

18   Counsel, counsel.
