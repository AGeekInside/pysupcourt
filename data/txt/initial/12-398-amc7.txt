 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 12-398, Association for

 5   Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.

 6                Mr. Hansen?

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. HANSEN

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. HANSEN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                One way to address the question presented by

12   this case is what exactly did Myriad invent?                        And the

13   answer is nothing.

14                Myriad unlocked the secrets of two human

15   genes.   These are genes that correlate with an increased

16   risk of breast or ovarian cancer.                        But the genes

17   themselves, their -- where they start and stop, what

18   they do, what they are made of, and what happens when

19   they go wrong are all decisions that were made by

20   nature, not by Myriad.

21                Now, Myriad deserves credit for having

22   unlocked these secrets.           Myriad does not deserve a

23   patent for it.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. Hansen, Respondents

25   say that isolating or extracting natural products, that

                                         3

 1   has long been considered patentable, and give -

 2   examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine.                       How

 3   is this different from -- those start with natural -

 4   natural products.

 5               MR. HANSEN:           Well, in -- in essence, Your

 6   Honor, everything starts with a natural product.                       And

 7   this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a

 8   natural product is insufficient.                    For example, this

 9   Court has used the example of gold.                       You can't patent

10   gold because it's a natural product.

11               The examples that you cite all involve

12   further manipulation of a product of nature, so that the

13   product of nature is no longer what it was in nature;

14   it's become something different, and in many instances

15   has taken on a new function.

16               But -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Do you dispute that

18   you can patent, however, a process for extracting

19   naturally-occurring things?

20               MR. HANSEN:           Of course.              I think that is

21   totally acceptable.       And what's interesting in this case

22   is, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is

23   not at issue in this case.               It's a process that's used

24   by geneticists every day all over this country.                       It is

25   routine, conventional science.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So isn't that -- why

 2   isn't that a way to in effect have patent protection for

 3   the product?     Does somebody who wants to use the

 4   product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case have to

 5   find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to

 6   have it available?

 7                  MR. HANSEN:        Well, the -- the process by

 8   which it's extracted is now very routine.

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Oh, no -- yes, I

10   know.   I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this

11   process and it leads to a -- a particular product.                           Does

12   anybody who wants to use the product either have to get

13   a license for the process or find a different way of

14   extracting it?

15                  MR. HANSEN:        I think they have to find a

16   different way of extracting it, in the same way that

17   finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to

18   a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also

19   entitle you to a patent on the use of gold.                        For

20   example, if you find a new way of using gold to make

21   earrings, or if you find a new way of using DNA to do

22   something, you may be entitled to a patent on that,

23   because -

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Can you tell me why

25   their test wasn't given a patent?                        I know the method of

                                         5

 1   extraction wasn't, and why.               Why would the tests -

 2   would the tests be subject to a patent?

 3                  MR. HANSEN:        The tests are also routine and

 4   conventional science, but in this particular case, there

 5   were some method claims that we challenged.               The method

 6   claims in this case involved taking the genes that you

 7   extracted from the woman and the gene that you -- the

 8   way you think it should be, and simply looking back and

 9   forth to see if they're the same or different.               And the

10   Federal Circuit that -- found that that was an abstract

11   idea, and not patentable.

12                  And, in fact, that's -

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I'm curious as to why

14   the methodology of extracting the gene has not been

15   patented.     You say everybody -- everybody uses it.             Why

16   wasn't that patented?

17                  MR. HANSEN:        The original -- the original

18   methodology was patented, and is -- is patentable.                In

19   fact, if they came up with a new process, it would be

20   patentable.     But it has -- but that -- it has been very

21   freely licensed.     In fact, the patent may now have

22   expired.    And so it's used all over the country every

23   day.

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Can I take you back to -- to

25   Justice Ginsburg's question, because I'm -- I don't -

 1   I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that.

 2                 Suppose there is a substance, a -- a

 3   chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of

 4   a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered

 5   that this has tremendous medicinal purposes.                        Let's say

 6   it -- it treats breast cancer.

 7                 A new discovery, a new way -- a way is

 8   found, previously unknown, to extract that.                        You make a

 9   drug out of that.     Your answer is that cannot be

10   patent -- patented; it's not eligible for patenting,

11   because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug

12   is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of

13   the plant.

14                 MR. HANSEN:         If there is no alteration, if

15   we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it

16   and it has some additional value, then I think it is not

17   patentable.    You might be able to get a method patent on

18   it, you might be able to get a use patent on it, but you

19   can't get a composition patent.

20                 But as -

21                 JUSTICE ALITO:             But you're making -- you

22   keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're

23   intended to be.     It's not just the case of taking the

24   leaf off the tree and chewing it.                        Let's say if you do

25   that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the

                                         7

 1   value of this.     But it's extracted and -- and reduced to

 2   a concentrated form.        That's not patent -- that's not

 3   eligible?

 4                MR. HANSEN:          No, that may well be eligible,

 5   because you have now taken what was in nature and you've

 6   transformed it in two ways.               First of all, you've made

 7   it substantially more concentrated than it was in

 8   nature; and second, you've given it a function.                   If it

 9   doesn't work in the diluted form but does work in a

10   concentrated form, you've given it a new function.                      And

11   the -- by both changing its nature and by giving it a

12   new function, you may well have patent -

13                JUSTICE ALITO:              Well, when you concede that,

14   then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA

15   here, because it has a different function.                   Will you

16   dispute that?    Isolated DNA has a very different

17   function from the DNA as it exists in nature.                   And

18   although the chemical composition may not be different,

19   it -- it certainly is in a different form.                   So what is

20   the distinction?

21                MR. HANSEN:          Well, I don't think it has a

22   new function, Your Honor, with respect.                   I believe that

23   what -- Myriad has proffered essentially three functions

24   for the DNA outside the body as opposed to inside the

25   body.   The first is we can look at it.                  And that's true,

                                         8

 1   but that's not really a new function.                   That's simply the

 2   nature of when you extract something you can look at it

 3   better.

 4                 The second two rationales that Myriad has

 5   proffered are that it can be used as probes and primers.

 6   Three of the -- three of lower court judges found that

 7   full-length DNA, which all of these patent claims

 8   include, cannot be used as probes and primers.                   But more

 9   important, finding a new use for a product of nature, if

10   you don't change the product of nature, is not

11   patentable.    If I find a new way of taking gold and

12   making earrings out of it, that doesn't entitle me to a

13   patent on gold.    If I find a new way of using lead, it

14   doesn't entitle me to a new -- to a patent on lead.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             From what you know and

16   from what the record shows, would the process of tagging

17   the isolated DNA be patentable?                  The process of tagging,

18   we just don't know about that or is there a patent on

19   that?

20                 MR. HANSEN:        The very patents in this case

21   include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it

22   can be used as a probe.          We have not challenged that.

23   We are not asking the Court to strike down that.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Under our -- our law, is a

25   patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but

                                        9

 1   invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the

 2   part?

 3               MR. HANSEN:          No, it is not permissible under

 4   patent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing

 5   construction of the -- of the claim.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But if you haven't

 7   challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect

 8   to the tagging?    I don't quite understand.                Because

 9   the -- the entire patent which includes tagging would

10   fail under your argument.

11               MR. HANSEN:          Oh, I'm sorry, no.          I

12   misunderstood.    The claims that we are challenging do

13   not -- are not limited to tagging, are not limited to

14   use as probes.    There are other claims that we are not

15   challenging that are limited to probes.                  Those would

16   remain, but the -- but the claims that we're challenging

17   would in fact be struck down, because they're not so

18   limited.   In fact -

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Then -- then explain

20   when you said you can't narrow.                  You said earlier you

21   can't narrow.

22               MR. HANSEN:          Yes.        If a claim reaches

23   something that is both impermissible and permissible,

24   it -- the claim is invalid, period.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 All right, that

 1   individual claim is invalid.

 2                  MR. HANSEN:        That individual claim.

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But the patent with

 4   respect to claims that are not invalid would still

 5   stand.

 6                  MR. HANSEN:        That is correct, Your Honor.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               The primers and probes

 8   stand.

 9                  MR. HANSEN:        Would -- would still remain.

10   Even if you were to rule for Petitioners, you would not

11   have to rule concerning the use of DNA as a probe or a

12   primer.

13                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Hansen, could you tell

14   me what you think the incentives are for a company to do

15   what Myriad did?     If you assume that it takes a lot of

16   work and takes a lot of investment to identify this

17   gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and

18   what you just said is that discovering uses for that

19   gene would not be patentable even if those new -- even

20   if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this

21   deal?     Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies

22   like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going

23   to do this work anymore?

24                  MR. HANSEN:        Well, we know that would not

25   have happened in this particular case, Your Honor.                    We

 1   know that there were other labs looking for the BRCA

 2   genes and they had announced that they would not patent

 3   them if they were the first to find it.                 We also know

 4   that prior to the patent actually being issued, there

 5   were other labs doing BRCA testing and Myriad shut all

 6   that testing down.     So we know in this particular case

 7   that problem would not have arisen.

 8               But the point of the whole -- the whole

 9   point of the product of nature doctrine is that when you

10   lock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from

11   innovating and -- and making new discoveries.                 That's

12   the reason we have the product of nature doctrine, is

13   because there may be a million things you can do with

14   the BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is allowed to look

15   at it and that is impeding science rather than advancing

16   it.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you still haven't

18   answered her question.        Why?       Why would a company incur

19   massive investment if it -- if it cannot patent?

20               MR. HANSEN:         Well, taxpayers paid for much

21   of the investment in Myriad's work, but -

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're still not answering

23   the question.

24               MR. HANSEN:         But -- yeah.          But I think

25   scientists look for things for a whole variety of

 1   reasons, sometimes because they're curious about the

 2   world as a whole; sometimes because -

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Curiosity is your answer.

 4                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I thought you were going

 5   to -

 6                  MR. HANSEN:        Sometimes, because they want a

 7   Nobel Prize.     Sometimes -

 8                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I thought you were going to

 9   say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped

10   you were going to say something else, which is that,

11   notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this

12   gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various

13   things that you could get a patent on that would make

14   this kind of investment worthwhile in the usual case.

15   But if that's the case, I want to know what those things

16   are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're

17   supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel

18   Prizes.

19                  And I agree that there are those scientists,

20   but there are also, you know, companies that do

21   investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't

22   just shut them down.

23                  MR. HANSEN:        Let me give a specific example

24   that may be helpful in doing a better job of answering

25   the question.     One of the -- one of the amici has

 1   worried a lot about whether a decision for the

 2   Petitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant

 3   DNA.    Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major

 4   innovations in the industry are doing these days.                        It's

 5   DNA where the scientist decides the sequence rather than

 6   nature deciding the sequence.

 7                 There is nothing in our position that would

 8   prevent recombinant DNA from being patented, but there

 9   is -- it is the cases that if the patents are upheld,

10   recombinant DNA is frustrated.

11                 People can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to

12   recombine them and find new treatments and find new

13   diagnoses and find new things that will advance medicine

14   and science as a result of these patents.                       It's a

15   perfect example of what the point of the product of

16   nature doctrine is.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.           But, of course, to

18   profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to

19   not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do

20   something with it afterwards.                So you really haven't

21   given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the

22   gene.

23                 MR. HANSEN:        Well -

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, sure, yes, I can do

25   stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else.

 1   What advantage do I get from being the person that or

 2   the company that isolated that -- that gene.                      You say

 3   none at all.

 4                  MR. HANSEN:        No, I think you get enormous

 5   recognition, but I don't think -

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's lovely.

 7                  MR. HANSEN:        But I think that we know that

 8   that's sufficient.      We know it's sufficient with respect

 9   to these two genes.       We also know it's sufficient with

10   respect to the human genome.

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I'm not sure the

12   Court can decide the case on -- on that basis.                      I'm sure

13   that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief

14   that this investment is necessary and that -- and that

15   makes sense.     To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do

16   it, don't worry, is I think an insufficient answer.

17                  As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions

18   indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are

19   process patents that they can have, that this is

20   sufficient.

21                  MR. HANSEN:        And that's certainly true.

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But I -- I just don't

23   think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't

24   worry about investment, it'll come.                      I -- I just don't

25   think we can do that.         It may be that the law allows you

 1   to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature

 2   and there's nothing new here, but that's quite

 3   different.

 4                  MR. HANSEN:        And it is certainly true, as

 5   Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is

 6   a process patent or a development patent.                        If you -- if

 7   you've isolated the gene and you find a new use for it,

 8   you could get a patent on the new use for the patent.

 9                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's the whole point,

10   isn't it?     The isolation itself is not valuable; it's

11   the use you put the isolation to.                        That's the answer,

12   isn't it?

13                  MR. HANSEN:        That's exactly correct.               Thank

14   you.     Yes, that is the answer.

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And so, that is the

16   answer, which is in isolation it has no value.                        It's

17   just nature sitting there.

18                  MR. HANSEN:        Interestingly, it has one

19   value.     And that is you can look at it to see if there's

20   a mutation in it.     And when you find a mutation in the

21   isolated gene, you write back to the woman who provided

22   the sample and you say to her:                  Because the isolated

23   gene is the same as the gene in your body, I can tell

24   you that there's a mutation in your body.

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's a failure of the

                                        16

 1   patent law.    It doesn't patent ideas.

 2                 MR. HANSEN:        And it shouldn't patent ideas,

 3   and -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene

 4   and the gene in the body are the same.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Can we go to -- can we

 6   go to cDNA a moment?

 7                 MR. HANSEN:        Sure.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That is artificially

 9   created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature.

10   It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in

11   nature.    And yet you claim that can't be patented.                  The

12   introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and

13   they're sequenced together.              Give me your brief argument

14   on that.    I read your brief, but it is not a product of

15   nature; it's a product of human invention.

16                 MR. HANSEN:        There are two big differences

17   between cDNA and DNA.        The first is exactly the one Your

18   Honor just discussed, which is that the introns, the

19   noncoding regions, have been removed.                   That is done in

20   the body, by the body.         That's done in the process of

21   DNA going to mRNA.

22                 What the scientist does who's creating the

23   cDNA is they take the mRNA out of the body and then they

24   simply have the natural nature-driven nucleotide binding

25   processes complement the mRNA.                 So that if the mRNA has

                                       17

 1   a C, the scientist just puts the corresponding

 2   nucleotide in there and nature causes them to bind up.

 3   The scientist does not decide -

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:              I know, but I don't see the

 5   answer, because I gather, if I -- if I've read it

 6   correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA

 7   does not have the same base pairs.                       There's a U or

 8   something instead of an A or whatever it is.

 9                MR. HANSEN:          Yes.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:              So when you actually look,

11   if you could get a super-microscope and look at what

12   they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would

13   discover something with an A, not a U.                       Is it AU?     Is

14   that the one?

15                MR. HANSEN:          Yes.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay.          Okay.     So -- so you

17   would discover something with an A there, you see, and

18   you wouldn't discover something with a U there.                          And

19   there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG,

20   whatever, okay?     It's not there.                 That's not truly

21   isolated DNA.     But you can go look up the Amazon,

22   wherever you want.      Hence the question.                      Now, on that

23   one, how?   How is that found in nature?                         The answer is

24   it isn't.

25                MR. HANSEN:          Well, but I would suggest, Your

 1   Honor, that the question is not whether it is identical

 2   to something in nature.           The question is whether there

 3   was a human invention involved, whether it is markedly

 4   different from what is found in nature.

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But that goes to

 6   obviousness.     That does not in my mind go to the issue

 7   of whether it's patent eligible.                    You may have a very

 8   strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not -

 9   it's creating something that's not found in nature at

10   all.

11                  MR. HANSEN:        The sequence of the nucleotides

12   is dictated by nature.          The order that they go in is

13   dictated by nature.

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, that's a separate

15   question -

16                  MR. HANSEN:        It is true -

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- about whether this

18   claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15

19   nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly.                    But

20   assuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and

21   not the small snippet that they want to capture the

22   whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the

23   introns is just not found in nature.

24                  MR. HANSEN:        It is not -- the -- the exons

25   with the exact same composition and in the exact same

 1   order are found in nature, and the question is whether

 2   when the body removes the introns, has the body made

 3   something markedly different than what is in nature, and

 4   it is our view -

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              When I first looked at

 6   this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind

 7   of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't.                      But my

 8   understanding is that it may have a functionality that

 9   the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et

10   cetera.   That may be incorrect for the record, but that

11   was my present understanding.

12                MR. HANSEN:         It is somewhat easier to work

13   with cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant

14   DNA that is the place where all of the innovation and

15   all the efforts are taking place.                       And if we lock -

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Is all the tagging done on

17   recombinant DNA?

18                MR. HANSEN:         All of the change -- all of the

19   useful things that we are inventing is done -- is done

20   through the process of recombinant DNA.                      And if we lock

21   up the cDNA, it makes it harder to do the recombinant

22   DNA.   So that if someone owns all the cDNA, I can't do

23   recombinant DNA using what the company owns.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Hansen, you answered

25   my initial question by saying they start -- everything

 1   starts with a national -- natural product, but these

 2   others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve

 3   manipulation.   The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as

 4   involving manipulation?

 5               MR. HANSEN:         It certainly -- there's -

 6   there is some manipulation, although it's -- it's

 7   letting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the

 8   scientist manipulating.         But it -- what the other factor

 9   that distinguishes aspirin and the other examples you

10   use from cDNA is that they have -- the alteration of the

11   substance has also altered the function, and cDNA has

12   exactly the same function as DNA with the exception of

13   Justice Kennedy's, that it's easier to use with.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you -- you've really

15   lost me when you say that it's nature that does the

16   alteration rather than the scientist.                     I mean, whenever

17   a scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by

18   some force of nature.

19               MR. HANSEN:         No -

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, he doesn't do it

21   unnaturally, does he?       I mean, there's some -

22               MR. HANSEN:         Well, let me try an analogy,

23   Your Honor, that might be helpful.                     In our view, it's

24   like Funk Brothers in the sense that the five bacteria

25   in Funk Brothers didn't sit together in nature.

 1                  The scientists took them and put them

 2   together in nature.       Here the scientist takes the exons

 3   and lets the natural processes of the body put them

 4   together in -- in the laboratory.                        It's exactly the same

 5   as Funk Brothers.

 6                  If I could reserve the remainder of my time,

 7   Your Honor.

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Can I ask a question, which

 9   I don't think will be taken from your time.

10                  MR. HANSEN:        Sure, of course.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But I have to ask you this.

12   Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason

13   is because of the nature of the claim.                        Okay, I look at

14   their claim.     Their claim says they want "the isolated

15   DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide

16   sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1."

17                  Then we turn to that and the first thing it

18   says right there is it says, "The molecule involved

19   is" -- "Molecule type:          cDNA."          And then it has a long

20   list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay.

21                  So molecule type, cDNA.                     So they say what do

22   you mean they aren't claiming cDNA?                        That's what they

23   say they're claiming.

24                  MR. HANSEN:        No -

 1   "wherein."   So I go back to the "wherein" in Prometheus

 2   and the "wherein" -- you read "wherein" as in context,

 3   and in this context you mean to say that a person who

 4   makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as

 5   well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under

 6   claim 2?

 7                MR. HANSEN:        Yes, Your Honor.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            Is there any support for

 9   that other than the treatise that you cited?

10                MR. HANSEN:        There -

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean, I looked at that

12   and it said read the "wherein" depending on context.

13                MR. HANSEN:        Well, that certainly -

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            And then depending on -

15   okay.   Then you got -- you heard what I said, so I want

16   to know is there anything else I should read?

17                MR. HANSEN:        Yes.        The other support for it

18   is the definition of the DNA in the patent itself, which

19   we cite, which says that whenever we use the term "DNA"

20   we mean both.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, I saw that.          I saw

22   that.

 1              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 2              FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 3                      SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

 4                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Mr. Chief Justice, and

 5   may it please the Court:

 6                  Enforcing the distinction between human

 7   invention and a product of nature preserves a necessary

 8   balance in the patent system between encouraging

 9   individual inventors and keeping the basic building

10   blocks of innovation free for all to use.                  Isolated DNA

11   falls on the ineligible side of that divide because it

12   is simply native DNA extracted from the body.                  The claim

13   that it is a -

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Are we fighting over

15   nothing?     Are you fighting over nothing?               If -- if they

16   can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it

17   matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on

18   the cDNA to be effective?

19                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              I actually think that --

20   I think we're -- we're fighting about something of

21   importance.     That question gets right to it.               I want to

22   answer the question directly, Your Honor.                  I'd like to

23   make a prefatory point before doing so.

24                  The claim that isolated DNA is a human

25   invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no

                                        24

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   longer connected at the molecular level to what

 2   surrounded it in the body.             But allowing a patent on

 3   that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from

 4   using the gene itself for any medical or scientific

 5   purpose.   That is not true about a patent on cDNA.               A

 6   patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for

 7   other scientists and other -- and others in the medical

 8   profession to try to generate new uses.

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen

10   just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to

11   use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated

12   DNA.   Do you disagree with that?

13                GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's not my

14   understanding, Justice Kagan.               My understanding is that

15   you -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant

16   DNA without the step of cDNA.               We do think cDNA is

17   important and the position of the United States is that

18   cDNA is patent eligible.          We disagree -

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, suppose his

20   understanding is correct.           Suppose your misunderstanding

21   -- suppose your understanding is not correct.

22                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Our position, though, is

23   that cDNA is patent eligible because we think, unlike

24   the isolated DNA which is just taken from your body,

25   cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that

                                      25

 1   doesn't correspond to anything in your body.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But Mister -- General

 3   Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief

 4   that your view was that, although the cDNA may be

 5   patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious.

 6                GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's true now, Justice

 7   Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that

 8   the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not

 9   have been true at the time the patents were initially

10   issued.   And -

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I understand -

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But I -- I thought

13   the basic general approach here was we have a very

14   expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we

15   narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness

16   and so on.   Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to

17   address the questions at issue here in the obviousness

18   realm?

19                GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's a little -

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If you got something

21   that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could

22   take a smaller part of it; that the idea -- a smaller

23   part of something that's bigger is obvious.                     Now, yes,

24   you can have a patent on the process of extracting that

25   small part, but I don't understand how a small part of

                                      26

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   something bigger isn't obvious.                  And if it is, I don't

 2   understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at

 3   that stage.

 4                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I think my answer

 5   to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first

 6   to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the

 7   threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility

 8   does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty

 9   test and a specification test do not do; and the work

10   that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to

11   ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature

12   itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly,

13   because if it can be deemed to be a human invention

14   solely as a result of the change that occurs when you

15   extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a

16   practical matter that you have granted a patent on the

17   gene itself because no one else can extract it because

18   extracting it is isolating it; isolating it violates the

19   patent.

20                 And so as a result of that, no one else can

21   try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one

22   else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I'm -- I'm not sure

24   that's responsive to my concern.                   Your answer said well,

25   here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent

                                       27

 1   protection.    My question goes to whether we ought to

 2   focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at

 3   the obviousness stage.

 4                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, the Court

 5   identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo

 6   that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that

 7   question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the

 8   eligibility stage, because the -- because getting the

 9   balance right is of critical importance.

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, the issue here is a

11   very difficult one.      It's one on which the Government

12   has changed its position; isn't that correct?

13                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes, Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:            It seems that there is

15   disagreement within the Executive Branch about it.               This

16   case has been structured in an effort to get us to

17   decide this on the broadest possible ground, that

18   there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not

19   about any other provision of the Patent Act.

20                 Why -- why should we -- why should we do

21   that?   We have claims that if patent eligibility is

22   denied here it will prevent investments that are

23   necessary for the development of new drugs or it will

24   lead those who develop the new drugs, new diagnostic

25   techniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to

                                       28

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the public.    Why -- why should we jump in and -- and

 2   decide the broadest possible question?

 3                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I would -- again, I

 4   would point the Court to what the Court said last term

 5   in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent

 6   eligibility really is a double-edged sword.

 7                 And it may be that in a -- in a particular

 8   case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a

 9   view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the

10   other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and

11   the proposition of whether you can patent the gene

12   itself is a question we think of fundamental importance,

13   and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that

14   led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo.                      And Mayo

15   was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              General Verrilli, there's

17   an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United

18   States would be in a singular position.                      That is, they

19   suggest that in every other industrialized nation this

20   could be subject -- could be patentable.

21                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes, and that -

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is that so?

23                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              No.        I think the picture

24   is much more complicated than that.                      In many other

25   nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is

                                       29

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   different from nation to nation.

 2                I'll give one example I think helps

 3   illustrate the point.       In Germany and France, for

 4   example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA

 5   but only for a particular use.                So you would get what is

 6   the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that

 7   we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too.

 8                If you -- just as with the question that

 9   Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a

10   useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you

11   isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects,

12   you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you

13   can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that

14   no one else can explore it for different uses and for -

15   and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to

16   recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more

17   therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance.                   And

18   that's -

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I understand why you are

20   saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter.                I am

21   looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it

22   says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides

23   long or longer.   The reality is that 15 nucleotides

24   doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between

25   exons.   It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more

                                      30

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sequences long.   So are you arguing that this claim as

 2   written is sustainable?

 3                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Your Honor, as a -- I am

 4   going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this

 5   situation.   I think that's a fight between the parties.

 6   The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual

 7   matter cDNA is patent eligible.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So you are not taking

 9   the position that this claim as written is patentable?

10                GENERAL VERRILLI:              That's right, Your Honor.

11   We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think

12   cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial

13   creation; it's as a general matter patent eligible.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Because as I understand

15   it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature.

16   They get reproduced in that sequence of 15.

17                GENERAL VERRILLI:              That -- that may well be

18   right, Your Honor.     As I said, we're not taking a

19   position on the particulars.

20                But if I -- just to return to the point that

21   Justice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a

22   similar situation in Mayo.             On the one side you had

23   the -- the industry coming in and saying:                Look, we have

24   got a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than

25   150,000 patents here.       You are going to really disrupt

                                      31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   those reliance issues.        On the other side you had the

 2   American Medical Association, as you have here, coming

 3   in and saying:   Actually, these patents inhibit much

 4   more innovation than they incent.

 5                And what the Court said is that -- as

 6   Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not

 7   in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively.                       It

 8   doesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it.

 9   But what the Court is in a position to do is to apply

10   the general principles of law as they were articulated

11   in Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular

12   different set of rules for the biotech industry,

13   Congress can provide that different set of rules.

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:            General Verrilli, could

15   I understand what you said, because I think it might be

16   a little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want

17   to understand your position.              You said that a company

18   can't get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on

19   the uses.   So, if I find this plant, let's say, in the

20   Amazon and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but

21   can I get a patent when I discover that if you eat this

22   plant it has therapeutic effects?

23                GENERAL VERRILLI:              May I answer briefly,

24   Mr. Chief Justice?

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Briefly, please.

 1                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes, you certainly can,

 2   and that illustrates the difference.                       That patent is

 3   just for the use; it doesn't tie up all other potential

 4   uses of the substance and that's the key.

 5                  Thank you.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, General.

10                  MR. CASTANIAS:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

11   it please the Court:

12                  It is now 33 years after Chakrabarty,

13   31 years after the first isolated gene molecule patents

14   issued, and 12 years after the Patent and Trademark

15   Office issued its carefully reasoned Utility Guidelines

16   confirming that new isolated gene molecules are eligible

17   for patents, and it's almost 16 years after Myriad's

18   patents began to issue, Patents which -- yes.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Is that on the basis of

20   a new extraction process?

21                  MR. CASTANIAS:            On a -- a new extraction

22   process, no.     Most of the processes are known.                    But

23   that's not relevant to patent eligibility or, for that

24   matter, patentability.          As the last sentence, Justice

25   Sotomayor, of Section 103A says, "Patentability shall

                                        33

 1   not be negated by the manner in which the invention was

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I -- I have a sort of

 4   analytical problem.     I find it very, very difficult to

 5   conceive how you can patent a sequential numbering

 6   system by nature, in the same way that I have a problem

 7   in thinking that someone could get a patent on the

 8   computer binary code merely because they throw a certain

 9   number of things on a piece of paper in a certain order.

10               I always thought that to have a patent you

11   had to take something and add to what nature does.                        So

12   how do you add to nature when all you are doing is

13   copying its sequence?

14               MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, I guess I'll -

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How do you add to it

16   besides process or use?

17               MR. CASTANIAS:            Sure.           Well, Justice

18   Sotomayor, I guess I'll take issue with the notion that

19   there is nothing additive here.                What Myriad inventors

20   created in this circumstance was a new molecule that had

21   never before been known to the world.                     Now remember,

22   genes are themselves human constructs.                     And this points

23   up some of the serious analytical problems with the

24   Product of Nature Doctrine as the line-drawing exercise

25   that you've asked General Verrilli and Mr. Hansen to

                                     34

 1   engage in has illustrated.

 2               Now, the line-drawing is what is the product

 3   of nature to start with?          Is it me?              Is it the genome?

 4   Is it the chromosome?       Is it the -- and the gene

 5   ultimately -

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Look, I can bake -

 7               MR. CASTANIAS:             -- is what was defined.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I can bake a chocolate

 9   chip cookie using natural ingredients -- salt, flour,

10   eggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie.

11   And if I combust those in some new way, I can get a

12   patent on that.   But I can't imagine getting a patent

13   simply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs,

14   simply because I've created a new use or a new product

15   from those ingredients.

16               MR. CASTANIAS:             And that's -

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Explain to me -

18               MR. CASTANIAS:             Sure.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                -- why gene sequences,

20   whether in the actual numbers, why gene sequences are

21   not those basic products that you can't patent.

22               MR. CASTANIAS:             Okay.           I'll start by -- by

23   showing you how this is actually a different structure.

24   It actually has an entirely different chemical name when

25   you give it the C -

                                      35

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's the cDNA.

 2                MR. CASTANIAS:            No, no, no.      That's

 3   absolutely true with regard to the isolated molecule as

 4   well.   Because if you were to write it out in those -

 5   those interminable chemical equations that we had to do

 6   in high school, it's a "C" very different, "H" very

 7   different.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So I put salt and flour,

 9   and that's different?

10                MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, that is -- that is the

11   combination, yes, of two different things, and that's

12   sort of like -- that's sort of like -

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So if I take them apart,

14   now you can get a patent on the salt and now you can get

15   a patent on the flour?

16                MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, they were apart

17   before, but they were both old.                 But that's the problem

18   with using the really simplistic analogies, with all due

19   respect, Your Honor, about you know, like coal -

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, I guess -

21                MR. CASTANIAS:            -- like leaves and that sort

22   of thing.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:            Why is the chemical

24   composition in the isolated DNA different?                 You were

25   about to explain that.

 1                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Yes, thank you,

 2   Justice Alito.    It -- it's got 5,914 nucleotides.                      The

 3   genome itself has over 3 billion.                       It's arranged in the

 4   way set forth -- as set forth in the SEQ IDs number 1

 5   and 2.    Number 2 is the so-called genomic DNA, SEQ ID

 6   number 1 is the, as Justice Breyer understood, the cDNA

 7   molecule.

 8                 When you look at those particular sequences,

 9   there was invention in the decision of where to begin

10   the gene and where to end the gene.                       That was not given

11   by nature.    In fact -

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, well, well, well,

13   this is something I was going to ask you.                       I -- I assume

14   that it's true that -- that those abridged genes,

15   whatever you want to call them, do exist in the body.

16   That they do exist.      You -- you haven't created a type

17   of gene that does -- does not exist in the body

18   naturally.

19                 MR. CASTANIAS:            But we've -- I'll -- I'll

20   use my own simplistic analogy which we offered in our

21   brief and which we offered to the lower court.                       A

22   baseball bat doesn't exist until it's isolated from a

23   tree.    But that's still the product of human invention

24   to decide where to begin the bat and where to end the

25   bat.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, that's true, but then

 2   you were saying something that I just didn't understand,

 3   because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed

 4   briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the

 5   chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and

 6   it's attached to two ends.

 7               But also in the body, perhaps because cells

 8   die, there is isolated DNA.             And that means that the DNA

 9   strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies,

10   and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very

11   few of them in the world, but there are some, by the

12   laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely

13   the BRCA1 gene.

14               Now, have I misread what the scientists told

15   us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?

16               MR. CASTANIAS:             Well, I will tell you

17   that -

18               JUSTICE BREYER:             I probably misread it.

19   There's a better chance that I've misread it.

20               (Laughter.)

21               MR. CASTANIAS:             Well, no, I think -- I think

22   you may have read some of the submissions correctly,

23   Justice Breyer.   I think that's a question -

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, which one have I not

25   read -

 1                MR. CASTANIAS:            I think that's a question of

 2   some dispute in this record.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            So, in other words, you're

 4   saying that the Lander brief is wrong.

 5                MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, what I will tell

 6   you -

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            I want to know, because I

 8   have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a

 9   matter of science it was correct.                      So I would like to

10   know whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it

11   is correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are

12   disagreeing with it, as a matter of science.

13                MR. CASTANIAS:            What I will tell you is that

14   what are called pseudogenes -

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            I'd like a yes or no

16   answer.

17                MR. CASTANIAS:            Yes.       So the answer -- I

18   would say the answer is no, because there is no

19   evidence -

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            Was the answer no, you do

21   not disagree with it?       I wonder, I disagree or I do

22   disagree?

23                MR. CASTANIAS:            I do disagree with it with

24   the following -

25                JUSTICE BREYER:            As a matter of science.

 1               MR. CASTANIAS:            As a matter of science with

 2   the following -- okay.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.          Very well.   If you

 4   are saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since

 5   neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell

 6   me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell

 7   me that it's wrong.

 8               MR. CASTANIAS:            You want me to tell you

 9   something from a scientist that you should read that

10   tells you that it is wrong?

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, I need to know -

12               MR. CASTANIAS:            I think you could look at

13   the declaration in the -- the Joint Appendix for

14   Dr. Kay, for example.      Dr. Kay's declaration appears

15   at -- starting at page 370.            You'll find an extensive

16   discussion in there of the technology here and -- and of

17   the genetics.

18               But, Justice Breyer, just to explain the

19   finishing thought, what -- what Dr. Lander says in his

20   brief is that these pseudogenes, which are un -

21   undifferentiated fragments, exist in the body.                     What

 2               MR. CASTANIAS:              -- mutations that are likely

 3   to result in cancer.

 4               Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Can I get back to

 6   your baseball bat example?

 7               MR. CASTANIAS:              Sure.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      My understanding -

 9   my understanding is that here, what's involved,

10   obviously through scientific processes, but we're not

11   talking about process.         Here, what's involved is

12   snipping.   You've got the thing there and you snip -

13   snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there

14   you've got it.

15               The baseball bat is quite different.                      You

16   don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch

17   here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a

18   baseball bat.    You have to invent it, if you will.                    You

19   don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of

20   the strand; you just have to cut it off.

21               MR. CASTANIAS:              Well, I -- I guess I'll even

22   take issue with that, because the -- the story of how

23   the SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about

24   is exactly the opposite of that.                   If you look, for

25   example, at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the

 1   declaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shaddick, at

 2   paragraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the

 3   Myriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree

 4   at least on that score with the Solicitor General, is

 5   indeed eligible for patenting.               But then -- and by the

 6   way, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different

 7   patient samples to create what was called a consensus

 8   sequence.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Okay.   You've got

10   the cDNA.

11               MR. CASTANIAS:            And then what the -- what

12   the Myriad inventors then did to create what is called

13   SEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the

14   '282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that

15   further to add in the introns.               It was in -- actually,

16   the inventive process was additive.

17               Now, ultimately, again, going back to the

18   last sentence of section 103, the patentability should

19   not be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an

20   invention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter.                      But it

21   is a -

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I still don't

23   understand what -- in what sense it's different than

24   just snipping along -- along the line.

25               MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, first of all, you

 1   wouldn't even know where to snip until the Myriad

 2   invention.    That's the first problem.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Okay.   So that's a

 4   particular -- where you snip.                We're talking about

 5   though the patentability of what's left -

 6                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Right.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    -- after you've

 8   snipped it.

 9                 MR. CASTANIAS:            And -- and that is indeed a

10   product of human ingenuity and that has substantial new

11   uses.   Now, my friends on the other side have said -

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Castanias, go back to

13   Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right, because it

14   takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually

15   find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a

16   lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on

17   the genetic material.

18                 But are you -- are you saying that you could

19   patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a

20   lot of ingenuity to find it?

21                 MR. CASTANIAS:            The plant itself, I think

22   not, Justice Kagan, but I think the question that was -

23   that was posed was whether I could take an extract from

24   that plant.

25                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, but can you patent the

 1   thing itself?

 2                 MR. CASTANIAS:             The thing itself I would -

 3   in that hypothetical, I would say the answer is no.

 4                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Even though you know you

 5   have to extract the plant itself -

 6                 MR. CASTANIAS:             It's a lot of -

 7                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             -- from the Amazon forest.

 8                 MR. CASTANIAS:             Ah, but you see, now you're

 9   adding the manipulation -

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             I'm not -- I mean, I don't

11   know what manipulation means.                 I mean, you have to take

12   the plant and uproot it, all right?

13                 MR. CASTANIAS:             Okay.

14                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             And carry it away and

15   isolate it.     Can you now patent the thing itself?

16   You've now taken it out of the Amazon forest.                    Can you

17   now patent it?

18                 MR. CASTANIAS:             Well, what I -- what I

19   haven't done is isolated a new thing.                    All I have done

20   is isolate the plant from the forest.                    And that's the

21   distinction I think I'm trying to get across to the

22   Court, not particularly well at least in my colloquy

23   with Justice Breyer, but I'll try again.                    And that is

24   that what -- what was, quote, merely snipped out of the

25   body here is fundamentally different in kind from what

                                        44

 1   was in -- what is in the body.                The most important

 2   reason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used

 3   in the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian

 4   cancers.

 5               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, the plant in the

 6   forest can't be used for any purpose either.                  It only

 7   has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's

 8   uprooted and taken out of the forest.                  But it's still

 9   the same thing.   And I guess what you haven't gotten me

10   to understand is how this is different than that.                  It's

11   still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it,

12   it in fact has lots of great uses.

13               MR. CASTANIAS:             Well, I think there are two

14   ways -- two ways to look at that.

15               First of all, if you want to look at it from

16   the -- the perspective of the so-called product of

17   nature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous

18   consequences if it's not cabined and understood

19   correctly -- but if you look at it strictly from a

20   product of nature doctrine, you could say, well, that's

21   the same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative

22   history of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are

23   unmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for

24   patents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and

25   genetics and that sort of thing.

                                      45

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                But the product of nature doctrine is

 2   troublesome for this reason:              Modern medicine -- go

 3   beyond just the isolated DNA patents here.                      Modern

 4   medicine, particularly the area of personalized

 5   medicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are

 6   administering to individual patients is giving them the

 7   opportunity to mimic the actions of the body.                      And -- so

 8   actually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to

 9   nature, rather than farther away.                      And anything that

10   takes the product of nature doctrine beyond the simple

11   truism that the product of nature is something that is

12   not a human invention, then that's very dangerous, not

13   just for our case -

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But when you -- when you

15   isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as

16   a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals

17   that make it a probe.

18                MR. CASTANIAS:            As a probe, that's true.            As

19   a primer, that wouldn't be required.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So it seemed to me your -

21   your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well,

22   it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer.

23   Neither can the isolate without some additions.

24                MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, since this Court -

25   I'm sorry.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Now, if it's -- if it's

 2   the process or the additions that make it patentable,

 3   fine.   But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's

 4   patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point

 5   of Justice Kagan's question.

 6                MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, I -- I will say that

 7   that is the final inventive act.                  It's not the only

 8   inventive act.   It's the final inventive act.                  If -- if

 9   indeed you were creating it -

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do you concede -

11                MR. CASTANIAS:            I'm sorry.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do you concede at least

13   that the decision in the Federal Circuit, that Judge

14   Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is the

15   Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too?                    That

16   is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments did

17   not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that -

18                MR. CASTANIAS:            No, what -- I think

19   Justice -- Judge Lourie was exactly correct to say that

20   there is nothing in this record that says that isolated

21   DNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body.                   Neither does

22   Dr. Lander's brief, for that matter.                   And for that

23   matter, those isolated fragments that are discussed in

24   Dr. Lander's brief again are -- are what are known

25   not -- not in any way as isolated DNA, but as

                                      47

 1   pseudogenes.     They're typically things that have been

 2   killed off or mutated by a virus, but they do not -

 3                  JUSTICE ALITO:            But isn't this just a

 4   question of probability?            To get back to your baseball

 5   bat example, which at least I -- I can understand better

 6   than perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that

 7   in, you know, I don't know how many millions of years

 8   trees have been around, but in all of that time possibly

 9   someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen

10   into the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves,

11   and then something's been washed up on the shore, and

12   what do you know, it's a baseball bat.

13                  Is that -

14                  (Laughter.)

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:            -- is that what Dr. Lander

16   is talking about?

17                  MR. CASTANIAS:            That's pretty much the same

18   as what he's talking about, is that there might be

19   something that was out there somewhere.                  But -- but

20   that's really -- the search for this sort of thing that

21   might be very similar to the thing but never was known

22   before.   The patent law has taught -- the patent law is

23   all about pushing the frontiers.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.     So, when you

25   are on that, that's good.             A more basic question to me

                                        48

 1   is when you use the word "dangerous."                   I had thought -

 2   and you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that

 3   the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises,

 4   because on the one hand, we do want people to invent; on

 5   the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up

 6   some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that

 7   itself could be used for further advance.

 8               And so that the compromise that has been

 9   built historically into this area is:                   Of course, if you

10   get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the

11   plant in the Amazon, patented.                 Of course, if you get

12   the sap out and you find that you can use it, you

13   manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use

14   it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented.                   But what you

15   can't patent is the sap itself.

16               Now, in any individual case that might be

17   unfortunate or fortunate.            But consider it in the mine

18   run of things.    It's important to keep products of

19   nature free of the restrictions that patents there are,

20   so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers

21   50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers

22   them, although that expedition was expensive, although

23   nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the

24   thing itself.    He gets a patent on the process, on the

25   use of the thing, but not the thing itself.

 1               Now, that's my understanding of what I'd

 2   call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably

 3   understand better than I.

 4               MR. CASTANIAS:             Well -

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             And I would like you to

 6   express your view on that, because that's the framework

 7   that I am bringing to the case.

 8               MR. CASTANIAS:             I -- I will offer the view,

 9   Justice Breyer:

10               First of all, in this Court's decision in

11   Brenner v. Manson, followed repeatedly by the Federal

12   Circuit, it has been hornbook patent law, to use your

13   term, that you do not need to -- to call out the utility

14   of an invention in a particular claim.                     What you do have

15   to do is have utility for the invention itself described

16   in the specification.

17               And that's what the Patent Office looked to

18   in its Utility Guidelines in 2001.                     But ultimately,

19   neither -- I think this case is very -- very easily

20   decided on a straightforward ground that does not

21   require the Court to go making fine distinctions between

22   cDNA and DNA.

23               And that ground is this:                     The reasoned

24   Utility Guidelines issued in 2001 by the Patent Office,

25   who has not, in a very significant decision, joined the

                                      50

 1   brief of the Solicitor General in this case -- and which

 2   they continue to apply under Section 2107 of the Manual

 3   of Patent Examining Procedure, these guidelines not only

 4   tell examiners what to do, but in the Federal Register

 5   they had notice and comment and 23 specific reasoned,

 6   supported by case law, supported by science, responses

 7   to the objectors.     Almost every objection that is made

 8   to our patents here was made there and answered there.

 9                The PTO issued those guidelines to the

10   public.   They have been relied on now for 12 years, and

11   they confirm a practice that has been in place much

12   longer than that.     And if you take -- whether you can

13   call it the Skidmore deference or just giving respect to

14   the agency that sits at the intersection of law and

15   science -- Justice Breyer, as your opinion for the Court

16   in Dickinson v. Zurko pointed out -- those -- that

17   decision by the Patent Office is entitled to respect,

18   the reliance that has been placed -

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Even though -- even

20   though the Government has disavowed it, even though the

21   Government, representing the United States -

22                MR. CASTANIAS:              Even so, and -- and the

23   reason for that is -

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                At least that the

25   strength of the presumption would be diluted.

                                        51

 1                  MR. CASTANIAS:            I think you can dilute it a

 2   little bit, but you can't take away the fact that it is

 3   a 30-plus year practice that the Patent Office, despite

 4   the executive's position in this Court and in the

 5   Federal Circuit, continues to follow.

 6                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Castanias, could I take

 7   you away from the deference point and just ask again

 8   about the -- the kind of law that you would have us

 9   make.   Do you think that the first person who isolated

10   chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that?

11                  MR. CASTANIAS:            I think in theory that is

12   possible, but I should say this:                    Because this case is

13   about Section 101, I'm trying -- I'm answering your

14   question as though it's about 101, patent eligibility.

15                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Yes.

16                  MR. CASTANIAS:            Would it be obvious, would

17   it be novel?     I'm not sure.            Those are different -

18   those are different analytical structures.

19                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Right.

20                  MR. CASTANIAS:            But would it -- and I think

21   really, the -- the statute does the work here.                    It is

22   new and useful composition of matter -

23                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But the first -

24                  MR. CASTANIAS:            -- if it had use.       If it had

25   a new utility, then yes.

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'm sorry, because -

 2   because -- because, like Justice Breyer, I consider

 3   uses -- patents on uses in a different category.

 4               So I'm just asking, could you patent the

 5   isolated chromosome?

 6               MR. CASTANIAS:            Again, I -- I perhaps am not

 7   making myself as clear as I should.                   In Section 101, a

 8   patent claim must be shown to be useful; and that -

 9   that is a utility that it has to be shown -

10               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Yes.       Chromosomes are very

11   useful.

12               MR. CASTANIAS: -- in any case.

13               (Laughter.)

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:            The first person who found a

15   chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that

16   that was a very useful discovery.

17               And the question is, can you then -- can the

18   person who found that chromosome and isolated it from

19   the body, could they have gone to the PTO?

20               MR. CASTANIAS:            If they -- if -

21               JUSTICE KAGAN:            And the PTO seems very

22   patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they

23   have had a good patentability argument?

24               MR. CASTANIAS:            I think if -- to get through

25   the Section 101 gateway, if that chromosome had a

                                     53

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   specific substantial and credible utility, in other

 2   words, it could be used in some -

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Yes, of course it does.

 4               MR. CASTANIAS:            -- diagnostic way in the way

 5   that we're talking about here, then yes, it would pass

 6   through the Section 101 gate.              Whether it would pass

 7   through the Section 102 gate or the 103 gate, I don't

 8   have any opinion on.

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Would -- would -- okay.

10               MR. CASTANIAS:            And then there's the

11   further -

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:            And that's interesting -

13               MR. CASTANIAS:            Sure.

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- because then it's not a

15   question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds

16   or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about.               Right?

17               So, you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not

18   the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you

19   know, we could just go up from there and talk about all

20   kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we?               Couldn't

21   we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?

22               MR. CASTANIAS:            I -- I think -- I think,

23   Justice Kagan, you're really putting your finger on the

24   problem with this, again, I -- I keep wanting to refer

25   to as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I

 1   don't believe that as a separate doctrine it really

 2   exists.    It's just the flip side of the coin of

 3   something that shows a lack of invention.

 4                 And, of course, that's where Section 103

 5   comes into full force as the Chief Justice mentioned

 6   earlier in the argument.           Section 103 allows you to make

 7   comparisons to what was old and what was new.                       I don't

 8   think the organ, the liver, gets past 103 in that

 9   circumstance even if you say, well -

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You are saying it gets past

11   101.

12                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Even if it gets through the

13   101 -

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that's -- that's the

15   problem.    I mean, all parts of the human body?                     Anything

16   from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?

17                 MR. CASTANIAS:            No.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And it gets through 101?

19   Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's

20   bothering me.

21                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Okay.           So let -- let me try

22   to help you with that.         Because -- because the

23   distinction is between the liver or the kidney, which

24   was the one brought up in the federal circuit opinion,

25   but liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your

                                       55

 1   organ.     But it's the same thing.                 It is the same thing

 2   when it's inside the body and it's out.                    That's where

 3   our -

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But you're not

 5   suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a

 6   piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece

 7   patentable.

 8                  MR. CASTANIAS:            No.      Absolutely not.   It's

 9   the same thing.

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So what's the

11   difference?     I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole

12   in the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not

13   patentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece,

14   that is?     What's the difference between the two -

15                  MR. CASTANIAS:            I would say that -- I would

16   say that under -- under your existing decisions in

17   Chakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad

18   understanding of Section 101 and an understanding of

19   what is within the limited exception, then what -- I --

20   I would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103

21   does this work better than Section 101, but to the point

22   of Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different

23   about that piece in the body.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Ah.       Then -- then watch

25   what you're doing.      That's very, very interesting,

 1   because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything

 2   under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've

 3   rejected more often than we've followed it.

 4                  And particularly with a thing found in

 5   nature doctrine, because, of course, it doesn't just -

 6   human kidneys and so forth.               Everything is inside

 7   something else.     Plants, rocks, whatever you want.             And

 8   so everything will involve your vast taking something

 9   out of some other thing where it is, if only the

10   environment.     And it's at that point that I look for

11   some other test than just that it was found within some

12   other thing.

13                  MR. CASTANIAS:            And I think, Justice Breyer,

14   there is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you

15   about the different functions, the different values.                   If

16   you think about patents as economic instruments, the

17   different economic values that come out of this, the

18   different things that patients now have as a result of

19   this human ingenuity, they didn't have the BRCA1

20   isolated gene before the Myriad invention.

21                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, we could have said

22   that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the

23   choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the

24   patent was that we have a uniform rule for all

25   industries.

 1                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Right, but in -

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And -- and that avoids

 3   giving special industries special subsidies, which is

 4   very important it seems to me.

 5                 Let me ask you this, and it's consistent

 6   with my -- my preface.         If we were to accept the

 7   Government's position that the DNA is not patentable but

 8   the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient

 9   protection for innovation and research?                      And if not, why

10   not?

11                 MR. CASTANIAS:            The -- the problem of making

12   that decision now is that so much has happened since

13   these gene patents issued and since the utility

14   guidelines.    I can't tell you for a certainty whether it

15   will hurt the industry as a general matter to not have

16   isolated gene but only have cDNA patents.

17                 But here's what I think it will hurt, and I

18   think it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this

19   Court comes out of this case with.                      Because what you

20   will then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is

21   to draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between,

22   well, how much more manipulation.

23                 My friend on the other side used the term,

24   in response to Justice Ginsburg, "further manipulation

25   is required to take it out of the product of nature."

                                       58

 1   He -- he said no alteration, to Justice Alito, would

 2   make it a product of nature.               But there's no dispute in

 3   this case that there has been some alteration of the

 4   isolated DNA molecules.

 5                 And that brings me back to the utility

 6   guidelines.    This line was drawn.                     It was drawn by an

 7   expert agency that sits at the intersection of law and

 8   science, and it has said, without any apparent -- other

 9   than the declarations and amicus briefs that have been

10   put into this case -- without any apparent effect on the

11   explosion in biotechnology and the successful,

12   economically successful, technologically successful, and

13   life-saving industry that is at the heart of these

14   inventions.

15                 That has not -- those -- that parade of

16   horribles has not happened.              And you don't have to

17   hypothesize at this point because you've got all of

18   these years of experience between the time these patents

19   issued and the time that this -- this challenge

20   belatedly came along.

21                 Justice Breyer, a point about no

22   impermissible preemption before I sit down.                       Your

23   opinion for the Court in Mayo made that very much an

24   important point, but I think what you -- what is

25   important to understand here is that these patent claims

                                       59

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   aren't for methods.     They don't prevent -- present that

 2   problem that the Court identified in that argument and

 3   in the argument in Bilski.            These are for specific

 4   molecules that exist in the physical world.                    That -

 5   that concern that is present with method claims is not

 6   here, these patents cover -- these patent claims cover

 7   only what is claimed and no more.

 8               There is no risk of a natural law or a

 9   physical phenomenon like energy or electricity, neither

10   of which falls within the statutory categories.                       There

11   is no risk of anything being preempted other than what

12   the claims properly claim, which are human-made

13   inventions of isolated molecules.

14               And I think one last point to close on.

15   It's important to note that molecules have been patented

16   for a very long time.      That's what drugs are.                And drugs

17   are often made by taking one molecule and another

18   molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a

19   test tube, which is a very common thing, reactions have

20   been around 100 years just like snipping has been, but

21   they make something new and useful and life saving from

22   that.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, I don't

24   understand how this is at all like that, because there

25   you're obviously combining things and getting something

                                     60

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   new.   Here you're just snipping, and you don't have

 2   anything new, you have something that is a part of

 3   something that has existed previous to your

 4   intervention.

 5                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Well, again,

 6   Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I -- the discussion we had

 7   earlier, the -- in -- in fact, the sequence that's

 8   claimed in Claim 1 of the '282 patent was not created by

 9   snipping.    If I can just conclude with one more

10   sentence?

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Sure.

12                 MR. CASTANIAS:            Only once it was created can

13   a scientist ever know how and where to make the decision

14   to snip.

15                 Thank you.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

19                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HANSEN

20                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21                 MR. HANSEN:        Thank you, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Is there some value to

23   us striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA?

24   If we were to do what the Government is proposing in

25   this case, what's the consequences?

                                       61

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MR. HANSEN:        Of -- of course there would be

 2   value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it

 3   reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more

 4   importantly, the effect of the patents in this case

 5   allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the

 6   human body.    If you uphold the patents in this case,

 7   Myriad can -- has the authority given it by the

 8   Government to stop anyone from doing research on a piece

 9   of the human body.     That would be a significant advance,

10   if you were to -- to make it clear that was

11   impermissible.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Now, how do you

13   understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?

14   I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into

15   cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with

16   the description of that claim because it included 15

17   nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says

18   reoccur in nature.

19                 MR. HANSEN:        Well, and yes, I -- I agree,

20   Your Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6,

21   which are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or

22   longer.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Now, I'm making your job

24   harder.   How could they write it to do what he thinks

25   would be patentable?

                                       62

 1                MR. HANSEN:         Well, all -

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So assuming we believe

 3   that there is some human invention in this process;

 4   whether it's obvious or not, separate question.                      But

 5   he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature

 6   naturally.

 7                So make that assumption.                   Make the

 8   assumption that they can make a claim for it.                      How do we

 9   avoid his problem?

10                MR. HANSEN:         Well -

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I know you are helping

12   your adversary by answering this question.

13                MR. HANSEN:         That's fine, Your Honor.               I

14   think that the -- all of the claims in this case, all

15   nine claims that we are challenging include both

16   fragments and the whole gene.                So I don't think there is

17   anything you can do with respect to these nine claims.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I am putting that aside.

19                MR. HANSEN:         I think by saying that when

20   genes are transformed in such a way that the scientist

21   decides their sequence rather than the nature deciding

22   their sequence -

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Only if they do a

24   recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.

25                MR. HANSEN:         Right, right.            Now I don't

                                       63

 1   think cDNA is recombinant DNA, that's what we've argued,

 2   but that's -- that's at least one plausible way of

 3   looking at it.

 4                The genes in this case, the patents on the

 5   genes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman,

 6   and child in the United States.                   And as I just said, it

 7   gives the -- the government has given Myriad the

 8   authority to stop research on every one of our genes.

 9   That simply can't be right.

10                And I would like to make one other point

11   with respect to Dr. Lander's brief.                       On page 16 of Dr.

12   Lander's brief he discusses specifically that the BRCA

13   genes appear in the body with covalent bonds in

14   fragments.   There isn't any real -- there isn't any

15   scientific dispute about that fact.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Why don't you take

17   another minute.     You weren't afforded an opportunity to

18   use the time you were reserved.

19                MR. HANSEN:          Well, I guess the only other

20   thing I would say, Your Honor, is to respond to what I

21   may have left a misimpression with Justice Kagan's

22   questions.   We agree that you could get a patent on a

23   use of the leaf that is pulled out of the Amazon or a

24   plant that is pulled out of the Amazon.                       We don't

25   dispute that.     We don't think you cannot get a patent on

                                        64

 1   the plant itself just because you pulled it out of the

 2   ground and took it to the United States.
