 5               Mr. Gallagher.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN R. GALLAGHER

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MR. GALLAGHER:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10               The issue before the Court today is whether

11   Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet

12   for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a

13   retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable

14   cause to make an arrest.     Respondent in this case seeks

15   personal money damages against two U.S. Secret Service

16   agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory

17   motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched

18   Vice President Cheney.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           There's just a little bit

20   of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little

21   bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement.

22               MR. GALLAGHER:       Sure.

23               The Respondent in this case seeks personal

24   money damages against three -- against two --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.     Yes.

                                                                          4
 1               MR. GALLAGHER:        -- U.S. Secret Service

 2   agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory

 3   motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched

 4   Vice President Cheney.     There are three reasons why

 5   these agents should not be held personally liable.

 6               First, the absence of probable cause should

 7   be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim.

 8   Thus, this Court is called upon to answer the question

 9   that it left open in Hartman v. Moore.

10               Second, U.S. Secret Service agents acting in

11   their protective capacity should be entitled to a

12   qualified immunity when they make an arrest with

13   probable cause.   Indeed, to view it any other way would

14   be to subject Secret Service agents to the potential of

15   retaliatory arrest claims based upon a mere allegation

16   of retaliatory animus, something this Court has

17   steadfastly refused to do, and for good reason:            Because

18   retaliatory animus is easy to allege and hard to

19   disprove.

20               And, third, regardless of whether this Court

21   decides to extend the Hartman rule, the law in 2006, at

22   the time of the arrest was not clearly established, thus

23   entitling the agents to qualified immunity.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What was the probable --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I don't


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   understand --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What was the probable

 3   cause?    What was the probable cause for the arrest?

 4                 MR. GALLAGHER:       Justice Ginsburg, the Tenth

 5   Circuit found that the probable cause that -- that

 6   underlies its opinion was a 10001 -- a 1001 violation,

 7   lying to a Federal agent.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Explain that to me.

 9   That's a false statement to a government officer, but

10   that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that

11   these officers had to arrest.            They -- there was a

12   question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think

13   that the charge that eventually was made in the State

14   court was harassment.      So, there's no indication that

15   these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds.

16                 MR. GALLAGHER:       Well, two points, Justice

17   Ginsburg:    First of all, under Devenpeck, officers are

18   not required to give all of the reasons behind an

19   arrest.    But, second, and I think perhaps more

20   importantly in this case, when Agent Reichle contacted

21   Mr. Howards and made the arrest, Mr. Howards had lied to

22   him.   That was relevant to a Secret Service agent's

23   assessment of the risk of the situation.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Do they have to give -- at

25   least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was

                                                                        6
 1   probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the

 2   officer stopped the car.

 3                  MR. GALLAGHER:       That's correct,

 4   Justice Scalia.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       There was a broken

 6   taillight.   There existed probable cause, whether that

 7   was the basis on which he acted or not.            Now -- is it

 8   any different when --

 9                  MR. GALLAGHER:       I don't think it's any

10   different --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       With respect to an arrest?

12                  MR. GALLAGHER:       Yes, with respect to an

13   arrest.   This is ­

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       So long as they have good

15   reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter.

16                  MR. GALLAGHER:       Absolutely.    That's an

17   objective --

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:       That -- we've never held

19   that in respect to a claim that the real reason the

20   police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a

21   picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a

22   statement having an unpopular point of view.            That is,

23   this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest

24   where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment

25   action; is that right?


                           Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                              7
 1               MR. GALLAGHER:        That's right, and --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:        All right.      And what you're

 3   saying is your first reason is that we should say that.

 4   And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is,

 5   you make a very strong case where the President and Vice

 6   President are involved, the need to protect them, but

 7   the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply

 8   to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone

 9   anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is

10   that the motive was retaliation against a point of view,

11   that individual will be protected from a Bivens action.

12               So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the

13   remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch.                And

14   so, I'd like your response to that.

15               MR. GALLAGHER:        Justice Breyer, I think it

16   has to do with the determination in the Tenth Circuit

17   and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to

18   extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a

19   cross-appeal.   So, the issue that you -- you posit is

20   not an issue that's before the Court.            It was --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:        I understand that.        I'm

22   just saying if I agree with you on your first that if

23   there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I

24   have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment

 1   with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14

 2   bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his

 3   political disagreement?        And there's nothing to the

 4   contrary, and he says:       Oh, I happened to notice -- at

 5   trial -- that when he left he reached out and snatched a

 6   $5 bill that was in the till.             And so, I had probable

 7   cause to arrest him.

 8                 End of case.      Now, that sounds very

 9   far-reaching, and I don't know that I'm prepared to do

10   that.    So, therefore, is there another way you might win

11   your case, or should I do that?

12                 MR. GALLAGHER:        Well, let me answer both of

13   those questions.   What you've outlined is essentially

14   footnote 10 from the Hartman case.                 That's the footnote

15   that says what do you do if the -- if the person that

16   initiated the prosecution says, I did it for a -- a

17   retaliatory reason?      And the Court side-stepped that

18   issue.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes.

20                 MR. GALLAGHER:        Yes.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:        And, of course, Hartman

22   dealt with prosecutions.        But people all the time don't

23   arrest others.   Policemen frequently don't arrest people

24   for everything they might arrest them for.                I mean

25   jaywalking, to take an example.             Or all kinds of

 1   things where they just normally don't arrest somebody.

 2   You might -- or I'm sure you didn't, but I might

 3   sometimes have driven 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile

 4   zone.   And I shouldn't even admit this.         I hope I get

 5   away with it.

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:       But -- but you see, it's

 8   different arrests and prosecutions.

 9                MR. GALLAGHER:       Well, I ­ it certainly,

10   it's different, but the Devenpeck standard --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Is it different?    You --

12   you acknowledge that prosecutors always prosecute, that

13   they never exercise discretion and say, oh, what the

14   heck, you know?

15                MR. GALLAGHER:       Certainly, Your Honor.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:       All the time.    All the

17   time.   I don't know that it's any less frequent than --

18   than an officer deciding not to arrest.

19                MR. GALLAGHER:       And Justice --

20   Justice Breyer, I think that the difficulty with your

21   hypothetical is, especially with regard to Secret

22   Service agents, who perform -- when they're engaging in

23   their protective functions, they're essentially --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, that --

25                MR. GALLAGHER:       -- in the public eye.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That's exactly what

 2   Justice Breyer is saying.      Okay?      Which is, as I

 3   understand it -- and there's some literature that talks

 4   about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests

 5   different than felony arrests, because there's less

 6   discretion that an officer would have with respect to

 7   arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or

 8   criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't

 9   arrest you for jaywalking unless they're either on a

10   ticket binge or because there's something about you that

11   they don't like.

12               MR. GALLAGHER:       Sure.

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, if that something

14   about you they don't like is that you're wearing an

15   antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not

16   recover, because somehow we need to protect police

17   officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast

18   power they have to arrest that we're going to permit

19   them to trample the First Amendment, essentially?

20               Or are we going to say, in the normal

21   situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with

22   probable cause, if you can prove that it's the

23   motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret

24   Service differently?

25               And I think that was the point


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most

 2   interested in.

 3               MR. GALLAGHER:        Okay.

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          If we don't extend.

 5   Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the

 6   unique needs of the Secret Service?

 7               MR. GALLAGHER:        Let me -- let me briefly

 8   address the first half of the question, and then I'll

 9   address the second half.      The first half, when --

10   Justice Sotomayor, when you suggest that police officers

11   could trample on the First Amendment, it's important to

12   remember we still have probable cause as the -- as the

13   principal picture here.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          If you're jaywalking,

15   there's probable cause.

16               MR. GALLAGHER:        But probable cause is the

17   Fourth Amendment standard specified by the Framers of

18   the Constitution.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But -- but what does it

20   have to do with violating the First Amendment?         Meaning,

21   if police officers have discretion and they would not

22   otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your

23   speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech,

24   isn't it?

25               MR. GALLAGHER:        Well, I'm not sure that that


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   is exactly the case.      Again it gets back to this

 2   footnote 10 in Hartman, which -- which, there -- Hartman

 3   can be read two different ways.            It can be read as

 4   saying that the elements of the constitutional tort

 5   itself require the absence of probable cause, or it can

 6   be read as saying the elements of the cause of action.

 7   But let me -- let me address the second question.

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         We can go to that

 9   question later.

10                  MR. GALLAGHER:       Yes.     And the second

11   question has to do with Secret Service agents, because

12   Secret Service agents, unlike police officers performing

13   law enforcement functions, when Secret Service agents are

14   acting in a protective capacity, they are protecting our

15   Nation's leaders and they are doing so in a very public

16   way, and they are also doing so in a way that is

17   essentially a free speech zone.

18                  Virtually everyone that a Secret Service

19   agent encounters when he's protecting the President or

20   the Vice President can allege that they're engaged in

21   free speech.    So, for Secret Service agents in

22   particular, they -- they can legitimately evaluate what

23   someone is saying in order to determine a particular

24   threat level.    And because of that, Secret Service

25   agents have a similar sort of complexity of causation to

                                                                         13
 1   the -- the situation addressed in the Hartman case.

 2               Now, in Hartman, clearly it was a one -- it

 3   was a two-individual causation situation, but with

 4   regard to Secret Service agents, the causation is

 5   similarly complex because Secret Service agents can

 6   legitimately take into account what someone is saying in

 7   order to determine a threat level.

 8               Regardless of whether the Court decides to

 9   extend the Hartman case, it's absolutely clear that the

10   law in 2006, in June of 2006 when the agents made this

11   arrest, was not clearly established.            The Hartman case

12   was handed down in early 2006.         It had only been on the

13   books about 3 months when the arrest was made.           For that

14   reason, Secret Service agents should be entitled to a

15   qualified immunity in this case because the law was not

16   clearly established.

17               With regard to the -- the formulation of

18   qualified immunity that we are asking for, we believe

19   that it is important for Secret Service agents acting in

20   this protective capacity to have the requisite breathing

21   room in order to make decisions in life-or-death or

22   imminent-threat situations.       In fact, the qualified

23   immunity that we're advocating is particularly important

24   at the margins, particularly important in situations

25   where it's not clear what a Secret Service agent can do

 1   or should do, where a Secret Service agent has to make a

 2   snap decision in order to determine whether someone's a

 3   threat and then act appropriately.

 4                 The Court in the Atwater case noted that the

 5   object of -- of the Court's cases has been to draw

 6   standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied

 7   with a fair prospect of surviving judicial

 8   second-guessing, months and even years after the -- the

 9   arrests are made.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You're not suggesting

11   absolute immunity?

12                 MR. GALLAGHER:       No, we are suggesting a

13   qualified immunity that's --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But it's a different kind

15   of qualified immunity?

16                 MR. GALLAGHER:       It's certainly different

17   from the Harlow type of qualified immunity.           It is an

18   immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent

19   upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a

20   protective capacity and having probable cause to make

21   the arrest.   But, certainly, once the immunity attaches,

22   it would be -- it would be full immunity from a claim.

23                 The Court noted earlier this term, in

24   Ryburn v. Huff case, that judges should be cautious

25   about second-guessing a police officer's assessment made

 1   on the scene of the danger presented by a particular

 2   situation.   We think that this case aptly demonstrates a

 3   situation in which Secret Service agents made very --

 4   very difficult decisions on the spot, and they should

 5   not be second-guessed by the Court.

 6                Finally, with regard to the -- whether

 7   qualified immunity is -- was clearly established in June

 8   of 2006, the Ninth Circuit -- the primary case relied

 9   upon by the Tenth Circuit was the Skoog case.    The Skoog

10   case was the case that the Tenth Circuit relied upon in

11   holding that Hartman should not be extended.

12                It's important, though, when you review the

13   Skoog case to -- to read the entire case, because the

14   Skoog court, after concluding that -- that Hartman

15   should not be extended, still proceeded with the

16   qualified immunity analysis to determine whether the law

17   was clearly established at the time of the incident.

18   And what the Skoog case concluded was -- it looked at --

19   it looked at the nature of the right.

20                And, you know, we know from the

21   Anderson v. Creighton case that this Court has said it's

22   important when focusing on constitutional rights not to

23   look at the 30,000-foot level, not to look at the high

24   level, but to look at the contours of the right.   And

25   that's what the Skoog case did.

 5                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 7                  MR. SRINIVASAN:       Thank you,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 9                  I'd like to start off addressing the Secret

10   Service in particular because that's the principal

11   focus, although I take the point that there are

12   questions about applying the rule in a broader context.

13   But I think understanding why the rule makes sense in

14   the context of Secret Service agents and law enforcement

15   officers who are performing similar protective functions

16   would help inform why it makes sense to broaden the rule

17   as well.    What the Secret Service --

18                  I'll pick up on the point that Petitioners'

19   counsel was making, which is that it's legitimate in

20   this context for Secret Service agents to take into

21   account expressive activity in determining whether the

22   circumstances warrant a discretionary exercise of the

23   power to arrest.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I assume you would

25   include U.S. marshals?

 1                 MR. SRINIVASAN:       Yes.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              F.B.I. agents?   So,

 3   you're talking about protective details.

 4                 MR. SRINIVASAN:       That's correct.         And that's

 5   why I wouldn't limit it to the Secret Service in

 6   particular.   I think what happens in a lot of these

 7   contexts is that it's natural for these individuals to

 8   encounter First Amendment activity by the public, and

 9   it's legitimate for them to react to First Amendment

10   activity in deciding whether the circumstances warrant

11   an arrest.

12                 And the problem arises because it's very

13   difficult to distinguish between, on one hand, a

14   legitimate consideration of expressive activity as

15   evidencing the sort of threat that warrants a response

16   from an illegitimate consideration of expressive

17   activity borne of a motive to suppress a viewpoint.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Does your rule apply

19   regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is

20   alleged to have had as to the particular view being

21   expressed?

22                 MR. SRINIVASAN:       I think it would,

23   Justice Kennedy, because we would have an

24   across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the

25   kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory


                          Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                      18
 1   prosecution context in Hartman.

 2                Now, I think your -- the question of the

 3   degree of animus asserted by the agent on the scene is

 4   exactly why these are complicated factual questions.

 5   Those kinds of allegations can be made, and then you're

 6   going to have a trial where the agent is on the stand,

 7   and the jury is going to have a very difficult time, and

 8   the agent is going to have a difficult time explaining

 9   why it is that he acted legitimately based on expressive

10   activity because he felt that there was a threat to the

11   person he was trying to protect, as opposed to

12   explaining that he didn't act in order to suppress the

13   viewpoint that was being asserted.

14                These kinds of allegations can often be

15   made.   And, in fact, they can even be manufactured at

16   the scene by an intelligent person who's going to be the

17   subject of an arrest.     And I think that complicated

18   question of causation is exactly why it makes sense to

19   apply in this context the same objective screening in

20   the form of a no-probable-cause requirement in Hartman

21   to this context of retaliatory arrest.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Why is there any difference

23   if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized

24   demonstration --

25                MR. SRINIVASAN:       Yes.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- in front of this Court

 2   or anywhere for that matter?           The people making the

 3   demonstration have -- have the same motivation and can

 4   make the same assertion of, oh, the only reason you

 5   arrested me was because you didn't like what I was --

 6   what I was talking about.      So, why should that situation

 7   be different?

 8               MR. SRINIVASAN:       That's correct,

 9   Justice Scalia, and that was going to be my next point.

10   Once we understand why it is that it makes sense to

11   apply this rule in the context of officers who engage in

12   this sort of critical public protective functions of the

13   Secret Service, I think we understand why it also makes

14   sense to apply it in other situations, because law

15   enforcement can legitimately take into account

16   expressive activity when they're engaged in functions

17   such as crowd control.

18               And in those contexts as well, it's going to

19   be difficult to disaggregate the legitimate

20   consideration of expressive activity as evidencing a

21   threat --

 2   "crowd control," you are making a distinction.

 3                MR. SRINIVASAN:       I'm making a --

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:       Do you want -- do you want

 5   the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's

 6   sort of automatic immunity -- when crowd control isn't

 7   at issue, where there's a history of persecution of an

 8   individual by a particular officer, da, da, da?           I mean,

 9   you know, we can make up cases.

10                MR. SRINIVASAN:       I think --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:       Did you want it absolutely

12   across the board, or are you going to start making

13   distinctions?

14                MR. SRINIVASAN:       I -- I would not draw a

15   distinction, Justice Breyer.            Of course, there's going

16   to be factual situations --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:       I mean, I agree with you

18   about the crowd control.

19                MR. SRINIVASAN:       Yes.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:       I see that.      I see that

21   problem.   I see the problem of protecting people in

22   public life; I see the problem in protecting the

23   President.

24                MR. SRINIVASAN:       Well, I think --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:       Now, how far -- now, given

 1   that that's a particular problem where views are likely

 2   to be evidentiary -- unpopular views actually are,

 3   unfortunately, but how far do you extend it?            You say

 4   extend it to everything.     To jaywalking, to

 5   persecutions, to, you know -- that's what's making me a

 6   little nervous.

 7               MR. SRINIVASAN:       Right, and I can understand

 8   the basis for the nervousness.         I guess the question for

 9   the Court is whether the benefits of having an

10   administrable across-the-board rule outweigh the costs

11   of trying to forge some sort exceptions to deal with

12   extreme hypotheticals.    And --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Do you have a sense of

14   how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in

15   those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they're

16   more limited -- how many of these cases arise?

17               MR. SRINIVASAN:       We do.        We've done --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And with what frequency?

19               MR. SRINIVASAN:       We've done an unscientific

20   search, but to use the same time frame of reference that

21   the Court used in Hartman, which is looking back

22   25 years, if you do a sort of standard Westlaw search,

23   what you'll see is there's roughly a hundred court of

24   appeals cases and 450 or so district court cases

25   where --

 2   there a year?

 3               MR. SRINIVASAN:        I don't know.

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It's -- a non-felony.

 5   I'm sure it's in the millions.

 6               MR. SRINIVASAN:        It's -- the -- I'm sure

 7   there are scores and scores of arrests.          That's correct.

 8   And, of course, all we're talking about is the cases

 9   that get to the point where you have an opinion that can

10   be -- that can be found.      And there's the obvious point

11   that, depending on what the Court does here, you may see

12   a proliferation of -- of those claims.           And we certainly

13   hope that wouldn't be the case.

14               But I think on -- in -- on the question of

15   whether it makes sense to have an across-the-board rule,

16   I guess I would echo what Petitioners' counsel was

17   suggesting, which is you can have the same set of

18   considerations in the retaliatory prosecution context

19   because prosecutors do act with -- by hypothesis, with

20   illicit motives in some situations.

21               And the Court considered whether the

22   benefits of having an across-the-board rule outweigh the

23   costs of forging an exception to deal with extreme

24   circumstances.   And what the Court said was:         We want to

25   have a rule that's designed to deal with the mine run of


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   cases; we don't want to have a rule that has an

 2   exceptional-circumstances exception because in that --

 3   at that point, there will be a great deal of litigation

 4   concerning what cases fit within of the exception and

 5   what cases don't.

 6                  And what the Court said was that's rather

 7   like designing a retirement plan to deal with the

 8   possibility that someone might win the lottery.            That's

 9   in footnote 10 of Hartman.          And I think similar

10   considerations would weigh -- counsel in favor of

11   applying an across-the-board objective,

12   no-probable-cause screen in this context as well.            And I

13   think it's important to understand that --

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Even though this -- I

15   think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific

16   reasons, neither of which apply in this context.            I

17   mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the

18   charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who

19   would be absolutely immune.          So, that is not in this

20   picture.   Here we have one officer.

21                  So, it would certainly be an extension of

22   Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the

23   rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather

24   than arrest.

25                  MR. SRINIVASAN:       Well, I -- with respect,

 1   Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with

 2   Hartman in two relevant respects.             Your Honor is quite

 3   correct that Justice Souter's opinion focused on the

 4   fact that you have two individuals in play.            You can

 5   have that situation here, but we don't base it on that.

 6               What the opinion was getting to was that

 7   that creates complex issues of causation in the

 8   prosecution context.    And I think it was the complex

 9   causation that really drove the need to have an

10   objective across-the-board rule.

11               You have the same kind of complex causation

12   problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which

13   is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a

14   legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which

15   speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to

16   suppress a viewpoint.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You might apply the same

18   immunity for selective enforcement based on race?

19               MR. SRINIVASAN:       The same immunity?

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

21               MR. SRINIVASAN:       No.      The -- they -- I think

22   the Court's decision in Whren, for example, supposes

23   that even though you have probable cause, you can have

24   an equal protection claim if the proof could be made --

25   and this is very important.       In the equal protection

 1   context, including for race, there is a different

 2   objective screen in place, and it's a stringent

 3   objective screen that this Court announced in Armstrong,

 4   which is that --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm aware of the

 6   reservation in Whren.      Why should there be a difference

 7   in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First

 8   Amendment speech?

 9                 MR. SRINIVASAN:       Well, I think part -- part

10   of the reason is this, that in -- with the First

11   Amendment, expressive activity can legitimately be taken

12   into account precisely because it can manifest a danger,

13   whereas with race in the ordinary case, I think the

14   reason why we have these principles in the race context

15   is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration.

16                 And the Armstrong rule is designed to

17   distinguish between circumstances in -- in which race

18   was the motivation and in which race wasn't the

19   motivation.   And it serves that purpose well.           But it

20   doesn't work so well in this context, because here First

21   Amendment activity can legitimately be taken into

22   account; when, as in this case, a Secret Service agent

23   overhears an individual say that he's going to ask the

24   Vice President how many babies he's killed, it makes all

25   the sense in the world for the Secret Service to focus

 1   their attention on that person.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:       What -- what about for

 3   crowd control?   You want to extend it to crowd control

 4   as well.   What difference does the First Amendment make

 5   there?

 6                MR. SRINIVASAN:       Well, I think it's -- the

 7   nature, intensity, and vehemence with which the First

 8   Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an

 9   officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of

10   danger that warrants a law enforcement response.

11                So, I -- and when a law enforcement officer

12   does that, he's going to be subject to potential

13   liability if an individual says:           Look, you weren't

14   reacting against me because of the way I was expressing

15   my views; you were acting -- reacting against me because

16   you disagree with my views and you wanted to suppress

17   them.

18                And that's a very hard thing to disentangle.

19   And it not only has that problem at the back end, but it

20   results in a problem at the front end as well, because

21   what happens at the front end is that officers at the

22   very outer margins might have in the back of their mind

23   a concern that if they acted based on their best

24   intuitions about what kind of law enforcement response

25   is warranted, they might later be subject to suit based

 2   convince a jury that they were acting based on an

 3   illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint rather than

 4   on a legitimate desire --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:       How many cases -- you might

 6   know this; you might have information on how many cases

 7   over 5 years or whatever period there actually have been

 8   against Federal protective officials of retaliatory

 9   First Amendment activity.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:       It would be in the

12   Department, wouldn't it?      Do they keep track?

17   unique, the one before us?

18                MR. SRINIVASAN:       Well, these -- certainly,

19   we know that these kinds of interactions arise with some

20   frequency.   I think there was some publicity surrounding

21   the --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:       But when you looked up your

23   research for this, did you find any other case in which

24   anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of

25   retaliation for an arrest?

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:          Against a Federal

 5   protective official.

 6               MR. SRINIVASAN:          No, I -- candidly, I didn't

 7   -- we didn't conduct a search with that object in mind.

 8   So, I can't give you an answer one way -- one way or the

 9   other.

10               I did want to make one additional point,

11   Justice Ginsburg, in response to the question you posed

12   about the applicability of Hartman, which is that at one

13   level it applies, the rule should apply, because the

14   same concern with complex causation is at issue here at

15   well -- as well.

16               But the other way to think about the

17   applicability of Hartman is to -- is to put these cases

18   on a spectrum.    On one end, you have what the Court in

19   Hartman identified as a standard retaliation case, of

20   which the Court identified public employment as the

21   archetypal example.      And on the other end, you have

22   retaliatory prosecution, where the Court thought that

23   there were sufficient concerns about complicated

24   causation that it made sense to have an across-the-board

25   objective rule.


                           Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                       29
 1               Now, the question could be where does

 2   retaliatory arrest fit within that spectrum?          Is it on

 3   the retaliatory prosecution side or is it on the public

 4   employment side?   And for a couple of reasons, I think

 5   it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution

 6   side.

 7               One is the one I've given, which is that

 8   speech can legitimately be taken into account.          And so,

 9   it creates complex causation.           But the other one is in

10   some sense the flip side of that, which is that in the

11   -- in public employment context, the standard fact

12   pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship

13   between an employer and an employee, during which time

14   there's been no adverse action; the employee then

15   engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the

16   aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse

17   action such as a termination.

18               Now, in that context it makes sense to infer

19   that there may well be an illegitimate speech --

20   speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have

21   in some sense a control period in the interactions

22   between the employer and the employee that pre-dated the

23   expressive activity.

24               That's not the case when you're dealing with

25   law enforcement.   In the law enforcement context in the


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer

 2   and a suspect, the arrestee.              You don't have the prior

 3   relationship that acts as a control.               And so, you have

 4   to ask the question whether, based on that one-time

 5   relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a

 6   speech-suppressive motivation was at work?

 7               And here, because it can be legitimate for

 8   an officer to take into account speech in deciding

 9   whether this situation is the kind of one in which a law

10   enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense,

11   unlike in the public employment context, to apply the

12   same objective across-the-board screen in the form of a

13   no-probable-cause requirement that you have in

14   prosecutions.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              May I go back to the

16   probable cause, the question I asked before?              It's not

17   like the taillight.      1001 came up in court.          I -- this

18   situation may well have warranted probable cause for

19   assault, probable cause for harassment.              But where did

20   -- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind.               It

21   does seem quite strange.

22               MR. SRINIVASAN:          It was not, Your Honor.          Of

23   course, that's exactly what happens in the Fourth

24   Amendment context.     That's -- that was the issue before

25   the Court in Devenpeck, and the Court explained in

 1   Devenpeck why it makes sense to have an objective

 2   probable cause inquiry rather than a subjective one.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But doesn't it matter

 4   that it's something that comes up only in court; it's

 5   not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural --

 6   well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because

 7   it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges

 8   that were made?

 9               MR. SRINIVASAN:       I don't know the reason

10   that a -- I don't know the precise contours of the

11   harassment charges in State court that were made.             I

12   think that they mapped on in some measure to the

13   assault, the assault that was suspected by the -- by

14   Officer Reichle, who effected the arrest.

15               Now, I think the concern with importing some

16   sort of subjective probable cause dimension into the

17   inquiry -- if you asked, you know, what offense did the

18   officer in fact have in mind, it's the same concerns

19   that drove the Court to apply an objective rule in

20   Devenpeck, including, for example, that you would have

21   dis-uniformity, in that similarly situated individuals

22   would be treated differently based purely on what

23   happens to have been in an officer's mind.

 2                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANE

 3                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 4               MR. LANE:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

 5   may it please the Court:

 6               I think what we have here is a solution

 7   being offered by the Government, and now we have to go

 8   find the problem.    And I think that's what

 9   Justice Breyer's question was directed at here.

10               I have done, not a scientific search, but I

11   can take credit for a little bit of science involved in

12   determining how many such cases arise.             And at page 13

13   of our brief, we cite in footnote 8 that a search with

14   no time limitations whatsoever going back in LEXIS with

15   the words "Bivens" or "1983," "retaliatory arrest," not

16   limited to protective details, shows 15 reported Federal

17   appellate cases, with no time limitations whatsoever.

18               So, we have a solution, but we really don't

19   have a problem.    The only Secret Service case that this

20   Court has ever heard that I'm aware of involving

21   anything remotely like this is Hunter v. Bryant.            So,

22   this is not a significant problem.

23               This also factually is probably not the best

24   case for them to be making their argument that we need

25   some sort of special rules that apply to the Secret

 1   Service, given the facts of this case, where Mr. Howards

 2   by all accounts walked over to the Vice President,

 3   looked at him and said:     "I just want you to know I

 4   think your policies in Iraq are disgusting."

 5               There is a dispute at that point whether he

 6   gently patted him on the arm -- not a crime -- or tapped

 7   him on the shoulder -- again, not a crime -- or --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:       There's no --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:       That's an assault, isn't

10   it?

11               MR. LANE:     I'm sorry.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:       All it takes for an assault

13   is an unwanted touching.

14               MR. LANE:     Well, incidental contact is not

15   an assault, and everyone on the Mall --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:       It's not incidental if you

17   reach out and touch somebody on the shoulder or the arm.

18               MR. LANE:     Well, the problem is that the

19   Vice President was on the Mall having contact with

20   numerous people, shaking their hands, letting them pat

21   him on the back, telling him what a great job he's

22   doing.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:       That's fine, and he didn't

24   -- he doubtless didn't consider those contacts hostile.

25   But when somebody tells you "I think your policies are

 2                 MR. LANE:    And then --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       I mean, just don't tell me

 4   that it's -- it's not a crime.           It is an assault if it's

 5   an unwanted touching.

 6                 MR. LANE:    Well, under Colorado law, he was

 7   charged with harassment, and --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, what you've

 9   described is not when the person was arrested, right?

10                 MR. LANE:    That's correct.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The person was

12   arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service

13   agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President;

14   at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a

15   bag, right?

16                 MR. LANE:    Correct.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And wandering

18   around.   Turns out that he was looking for his son.               But

19   if you're the Secret Service agent, you see somebody who

20   said your policies are disgusting, that person touches

21   the Vice President, he -- he lies to you.               He

22   comes back, he's carrying a bag and he's wondering --

23   wandering around, do you think it's reasonable at

24   that -- well, I guess you don't --

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The reason it's

 6   multifaceted is because I'm trying to capture what might

 7   have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind

 8   at the time.

 9                  MR. LANE:    Well, that's -- that is part of

10   the point I have to make here, all right?                In this

11   Court's jurisprudence on Fourth Amendment issues, what

12   is going on in the agent's mind is irrelevant.                The

13   issue is --

15   going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at

16   the time.

17                  MR. LANE:    Right.        First level of inquiry,

18   was there a Fourth Amendment violation?                No, according

19   to the Tenth Circuit.       We then have got to shift gears

20   if we're going to do a First Amendment analysis.                   And is

21   this a retaliatory arrest or not?

22                  We have got to look into the subjective mind

23   of the agent.    That's where Justice Ginsburg's questions

24   I think take on great import for this discussion,

25   because, as she correctly pointed out, the agents on

 1   scene never said in deposition, they have never claimed

 2   anywhere, that they arrested Mr. Howards on a 1001

 3   violation.

 4                The agents on scene in deposition said we

 5   arrested him because of the way he approached the Vice

 6   President -- not a crime -- and his demeanor.              We

 7   thought it might be an assault.           That later morphed into

 8   a State charge of harassment.           Nobody ever said 1001

 9   formed any basis whatsoever.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes, but they did say --

11   and also you've left out that one of the agents

12   overheard him say he was going to ask the Vice President

13   how many babies he killed that day.

14                MR. LANE:    Right.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         So, their job is to

16   protect the Vice President.

17                MR. LANE:    Absolutely.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:       That's their job.

19                MR. LANE:    Correct.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:       And it's a very emotional

21   subject.

22                MR. LANE:    Absolutely.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:       And if something happens to

24   the President, nobody's going to say, oh, you know, what

25   were you doing?   And the whole country is in mourning.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:       We understand that.         And,

 3   therefore, it's a matter of concern that the -- if you

 4   have a rule of law that says to the agents, when you

 5   hear someone who says how many babies are you going to

 6   kill that day, I'm going to ask the Vice President, I'm

 7   going to touch him, I am going to then tell them a lie

 8   when they ask me if I touched him -- that's cause for

 9   concern.

10                  MR. LANE:    Absolutely.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         Now, if there's a

12   lawsuit, the agency will say we just can't do it.                We

13   can't do it.    We can't use that as a basis for stopping

14   that individual.

15                  MR. LANE:    Well, that --

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:       All that poses a problem.

17   Now, you're -- and I -- I think -- I recognize it as

18   a problem.    I'm not saying I have the solution.

19                  MR. LANE:    Well, I think you hit on the

20   solution as part of the problem you just expressed, and

21   that is, can they stop this individual?                And the answer

22   is "absolutely yes."       They have every arrow in their

23   quiver, under Terry v. Ohio.              They can stop him if they

24   perceive a threat.     They can force him to open up his

25   opaque bag.    They can force him to show them what's in

 2   They can wand him with a metal-detecting wand.         They can

 3   assure themselves --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:       And it wouldn't be a

 5   violation of the First Amendment if they only did that

 6   because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing?

 7               MR. LANE:    They are allowed --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Wouldn't that be a

 9   violation of the First Amendment?

10               MR. LANE:    They are allowed to take

11   reasonable steps under Terry, under every conceivable

12   case that this Court's ever decided.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Even though they're doing

14   it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be

15   okay?

16               MR. LANE:    No.     No.    What I'm saying --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Of course not.    I don't see

18   how your -- your First Amendment exception doesn't apply

19   to those things as well as to --

 2               But if he could prove that the Terry stop

 3   was motivated by -- in an effort to punish him for his

 4   free speech, yes, that would be a cause of action as

 5   well.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So, what you have,

 7   under your theory, a person should put on his car a

 8   bumper sticker that says "I hate the police" and then

 9   every time they're pulled over, they will have --

10   certainly a plausible case is you violated my First

11   Amendment rights.   It's not because I was going 60 miles

12   an hour; it's because of my bumper sticker.

13               MR. LANE:     Well --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And the police

15   officer -- at that point, he says, you know, I can't

16   give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into

17   court on personal liability because he's got a credible

18   case that it was for First Amendment grounds.

19               MR. LANE:     Well, I think we can look at

20   the -- as I've said, the arrows in the quiver of the

21   Court to weed out those kinds of cases.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               No, no.   You've

23   already got the officer in court.           I mean, you get a

24   speeding ticket, and most times they don't show up

25   because they have got other things to do.              Now he's got

 1   to show up in district court, in State court, to defend

 2   against this.

 3               MR. LANE:    Well, I mean, litigious

 4   plaintiffs are a consistent problem across the board

 5   under many contexts.    And there's really -- you know,

 6   there's almost nothing that can be done.             This Court has

 7   taken steps to cut back prison litigation that's

 8   frivolous, things of that nature.

 9               But, yes, if -- the heightened pleading

10   standard this Court enunciated in Iqbal:             You can't just

11   come up with conclusory allegations.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Right.   Well,

13   this --

14               MR. LANE:    You have to have facts in support

15   that that's why they stopped me, because of my bumper

16   sticker.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is that -- is that a

18   case that you could state?

19               MR. LANE:    That would be --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              He pulled me over,

21   he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he

22   picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying

23   "I hate the police."

 2                MR. LANE:    No, that doesn't necessarily go

 3   to trial.   That's a conclusion, first of all --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why doesn't it go to

 5   trial?   And -- well, does it go -- I mean, do you get

 6   depose the police officer?        You know, why did you stop

 7   him?   Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles an

 8   hour that day?

 9                MR. LANE:    Well, I mean, these evidentiary

10   questions have to be first of all supported in a

11   pleading with heightened scrutiny under Iqbal.

12   Conclusions are not simply enough.               You have --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:       It's not a conclusion.        I

14   mean, if -- if he didn't have the bumper sticker and you

15   asserted in the pleading he stopped me because he knows

16   I hate the police, that's a conclusion.               But if you have

17   the bumper sticker, he says, you know, I had the bumper

18   sticker, and that's why he stopped me.

19                MR. LANE:    Well, let me give the flip side

20   of that and say if the police officer did stop him

21   because of the bumper sticker, he should go to trial.

22   He should be held accountable for that.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, the only way you

24   can find out is you put in the evidence -- here's the

25   bumper sticker -- and you put the police officer on the

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- and you say, why

 4   did you do it?

 5               MR. LANE:      Under --

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And then all of a

 7   sudden -- I don't know why everybody doesn't have a

 8   bumper sticker.

 9               MR. LANE:      Theoretically, every single

10   person who has ever been arrested for any crime could

11   raise a first amendment retaliation lawsuit.               Every

12   convicted murderer doing time throughout this country

13   could do that.    They don't, however.             There is -- there

14   is not a rush to the courthouse of retaliatory arrest

15   claims because the pleading requirements are heightened.

16   Qualified immunity for over a hundred years has

17   protected the Secret Service.            They've been protecting

18   the executive branch --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, say, though, that in

20   the case of the President, what you're hearing is, as

21   you well know, that the combination of disparate

22   political views and risk is unlike other situations.

23   And I don't know if they can prove it or you could prove

24   the contrary, but that's -- that's a claim.               And I can't

25   say there's nothing to it.

 2   which ­ I'll ask you what you think of this arrow, and

 4   in hearing --

 5               MR. LANE:     Go ahead.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- your reason.

 7               MR. LANE:     I'm ready.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:        In -- in Hartman, Justice

 9   Ginsburg and I dissent.

10               MR. LANE:     Yes.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:        And we referred to a D.C.

12   Circuit case.   And in the D.C. Circuit, it said -- it

13   talked about rare cases "where strong motive evidence

14   combines with weak probable cause to support a finding

15   that the prosecution would not have occurred but for

16   the ... animus."   Now, so far, you think "fine."

17               But suppose you were to say because of the

18   factors that have just been mentioned where the

19   President's at stake, the courts -- where his life is at

20   stake, the President's -- the courts will not infer once

21   probable cause exists that it's weak.            And the courts

22   will not infer from the simple presence of political

23   disagreement that the motive of retaliation is strong,

24   which in fact would produce a very limited extension of

25   Hartman to the case of protecting the President of the

 2                  And now, I know you're not going to agree

 3   with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I

 4   agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you

 5   react.

 6                  MR. LANE:    Well, let's take a look at the

 7   facts of this case.      The Tenth Circuit found there was

 8   probable cause for a 1001 violation.               But was there

 9   probable cause -- is there a great body of

10   circumstantial evidence surrounding this case that would

11   point to probable cause which should be considered in

12   deciding how this case proceeds?             We have the agent in

13   charge of the protective detail, Agent Lee, standing 8

14   inches away from Vice President Cheney when this entire

15   encounter occurs.    Agent Lee testified he saw no crime

16   committed.   We had numerous agents --

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Excuse me.

18                  MR. LANE:    Yes, Your Honor.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Let's go past that for a

20   second.   What was it that the arresting agent said or

21   did that showed the animus?          Meaning, because that

22   another officer actually saw it and understood himself

23   what he thought doesn't mean that this agent who was

24   told that there had been a touching had that

25   information.

 1                MR. LANE:    The evidence --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, I know collective

 3   knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal

 4   with the facts of this case.            What's the animus?

 5                MR. LANE:    Well, there were discrete First

 6   Amendment episodes that occurred in the context of this

 7   case.   One was testified to by Mr. Howards in his

 8   deposition, that when he first of all was approached by

 9   Agent Reichle, Agent Reichle said, "I want to talk to

10   you," and flashed his badge, and Mr. Howards declined

11   the invitation to talk to Agent Reichle.            That,

12   according to Mr. Howards, angered Agent Reichle.             That

13   is a First Amendment significant event in and of itself.

14                Steve Howards testified that he then was

15   asked by Agent Reichle:      We want to talk to you about

16   assaulting the Vice President.            And his response was:     I

17   didn't assault the Vice President; I merely criticized

18   his policies in Iraq, and if you don't want him

19   criticized publicly he should stay in his undisclosed

20   location.   Or words to that effect.

21                Again, Mr. Howards testified that angered

22   Agent Reichle.   At that point, the cuffs went on.           And I

23   think that is circumstantial evidence in support of the

24   animus for what -- what was going on.            Agent Reichle was

25   on notice as to what Howards had said to the Vice

 1   President --

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How does all of that

 3   prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed

 4   fact that he lied about touching the Vice President?

 5                  MR. LANE:    Well, again --

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And that's the --

 7                  MR. LANE:    -- lying to the Vice President is

 8   what we look at on a Fourth Amendment analysis, because

 9   what's in Reichle's actual mind under Devenpeck is

10   irrelevant.    So, yes, there was probable cause, but was

11   Reichle himself directing his animus at Mr. Howards and

12   arrested him?    We have to look into what was actually in

13   his mind, and that was not in his mind.            A 1001

14   violation was not in his mind.            We looked -- what was in

15   his mind?   And we've already said what was in his mind

16   is he approached the Vice President, he criticized him

17   publicly --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You do understand that

19   this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice

20   asked, which -- and which -- as Justice Breyer and some

21   of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary

22   has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be

23   a part of many, many arrests.

24                  MR. LANE:    Absolutely.

 1   outside of the one that you proposed by your

 2   adversaries, that probable cause is the line?

 3               MR. LANE:    Well, that line --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That doesn't enmesh the

 5   police in a constant barrage of claims that just because

 6   they angered a police officer, that's why they were

 7   arrested.

 8               MR. LANE:    Well, first of all, there has not

 9   been this constant barrage.       Hartman has only applied

10   until -- I mean, this Court decided Hartman in 2006 for

11   retaliatory prosecutions.      There has not been a run on

12   the courthouse on retaliatory arrests --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:       Would you --

14               MR. LANE:    -- either before Hartman or

15   after.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:       Would you acknowledge that

17   the Secret Service faces a different situation from

18   ordinary police officers in conducting their daily

19   activities, in that Secret Service agents may

20   legitimately take into account First Amendment activity

21   by someone who is in the vicinity of the President or

22   the Vice President in assessing the degree of danger the

23   person presents?

24               MR. LANE:    This may not help my case, but

25   I'll go further than that and I'll say any police

 1   officer has an absolute right to listen to what any

 2   protester is saying and consider what is being said in

 3   terms of assessing the level of threat that that

 4   protester poses.

 5                But as I said in this case, they had every

 6   right to stop Mr. Howards, to do a Terry stop on him,

 7   because they were concerned about him.           And reasonable

 8   cause for concern under Terry is the standard.          You

 9   don't need probable cause to pat someone down under

10   Terry.   It's simply if a reasonable officer would be

11   concerned.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Again, I don't understand

13   why you -- why you say that they're immune from the

14   charge of First Amendment retaliation for that but not

15   immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean --

16                MR. LANE:    I'm not --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:       If you say they're doing it

18   on First Amendment grounds for the one, they're doing it

19   on the First Amendment grounds for the other.          Why is

20   either one okay?

21                MR. LANE:    I'm not saying that they're

22   immune on a Terry pat down if it's done in retaliation

23   for free speech.   I'm simply saying that would make it a

24   much more difficult case for any protester to go to a --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         So, then putting it

 3   in their point of view, I just what he actually said.

 4   He was very angry, your client.           I mean, judging what he

 5   said -- there were a lot of swear words and so forth --

 6   he was pretty angry at this whole situation.

 7                 So, you're a Secret Service agent, and you

 8   hear him say -- speak like this -- he has every right to

 9   speak like that.    I mean people do.             I understand that.

10   But now he's also thinking that -- I'm nervous about

11   this.    The President is here, the Vice President,

12   whatever --

13                 MR. LANE:    Sure.

15   got to do my job.    So -- and nobody's going to say, ho,

16   ho, First -- whatever if is -- if somebody is hurt.

17                 MR. LANE:    I agree with that.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Now, he has also lied about

19   whether he touched the President.

20                 MR. LANE:    So --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But they didn't

 4   arrest him -- they didn't arrest until after he lied,

 5   right?

 6               MR. LANE:      But it was never in their minds.

 7   They testified.    That didn't have anything to do -- that

 8   is the Tenth Circuit's post hoc rationale under

 9   Devenbeck, which -- Devenpeck -- which says you -- if

10   there's any objective probable cause that the Tenth

11   Circuit or this Court or any other court can concoct,

12   post hoc, even though it wasn't in the officer's mind,

13   that's good enough to arrest somebody.               That's -- that

14   probable cause.    All right?

15               But in First Amendment analysis, it can't be

16   an objective standard.      There -- objective standards are

17   clean, they are nice, they -- they create bright lines.

18   But when we are looking at a First Amendment violation,

19   we have to got to be able to get into subjective intent

20   of the officer at -- on the scene.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:         And when you say that, that

22   means that almost all of these cases have to go to

 2   to trial?

 3                  MR. LANE:    Because if -- first of all, as

 4   I've said, Iqbal requires heightened pleading, not just

 5   conclusions.    We have the summary judgment standard.

 6                  JUSTICE ALITO:       I engaged in First Amendment

 7   -- I engaged in First Amendment activity.

 8                  MR. LANE:    We have a summary judgment

 9   standard, where -- and, in fact, in Butz, this Court

10   held that a firm application of rules of civil procedure

11   will always prevent frivolous claims and meritless

12   litigation from occurring in situations exactly like

13   this.   And that's true.       A firm application of the rules

 1   this Court has decided some incredibly difficulty cases.

 2   Snyder v. Phelps, authored by Your Honor, very difficult

 3   case.   Could it be side-stepped, by -- you know,

 4   somebody steps off a curb and is thereby jaywalking?

 5   Are we limiting --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               One thing about your

 7   analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a

 8   very black-and-white view of what's going on in the

 9   officer's mind:   Did you stop -- did you arrest him

10   because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate

11   security?

12                And I suspect that the people engaged in

13   this type of thing have intuition.                I mean, they don't

14   sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he

15   says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's

16   wandering around, looks like he's looking for something,

17   with a -- with a bag?      I mean, I assume they sort have

18   experience and they calculate all this in and say I've

19   got to do something.     And how do you parse those

20   different motivations?

21                MR. LANE:     Well, what I say about that

22   is that -- and, again, I know this is not an answer that

23   you're probably going to like, because this means a

24   trial is involved, but this is what juries do on a daily

25   basis throughout this country, in every criminal case.

 1   What is the subjective intent of the defendant?              In

 2   every civil case, is this an intentional act, a knowing

 3   act, a reckless act, a negligent act?              That's what

 4   juries do.

 5                And if there's enough evidence to get this

 6   case to trial -- and I would posit it that in this case,

 7   where you have agent after agent after agent who saw the

 8   encounter up close and personal with the Vice President

 9   and Mr. Howards, none of whom saw any evidence of any

10   criminal activity by Mr. Howards, all of whom let Mr.

11   Howards walk away from the scene, that's good evidence

12   that --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One reason that I,

14   in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent

15   is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the

16   hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice

17   President, the lying about it, the wandering around with

18   the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm

19   wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for

20   taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to

21   say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation

22   to protect the Vice President.

23                MR. LANE:    Well, I mean, theoretically yes,

24   that could be a problem.      And I am quite certain that

25   certain civil litigants -- just as in criminal cases,

 1   people are wrongly accused of things that they didn't

 2   do, they end up in a trial, and sometimes juries get the

 3   wrong results and an injustice occurs.

 4                 We can't fix all those problems when it's

 5   not really a significant problem.             There are no run on

 6   the courtrooms around the land of these kinds of cases

 7   arising.    We don't need to have any rules that

 8   specifically pertain to the Secret Service when, to my

 9   knowledge, this Court has had one Secret Service case in

10   its entire history, and there are 15 appellate reported

11   Federal decisions regarding retaliatory arrests,

12   period --

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Which -- is there a record

14   of retaliatory arrests by Secret Service agents against

15   people who say things that are critical of the President

16   and the Vice President?

17                 MR. LANE:    The only way I know to look for

18   that is on Westlaw or LEXIS.             And Mr. Srinivasan

19   indicated that they found 100 or 400 cases.             We did a

20   search like that.    We came up with the same number.           We

21   dug down into those cases.         And in terms of actual

22   litigated retaliatory arrest cases, we found 15 total.

23   That's not scientific, but that's the best I've got for

24   you at this point.

25                 And I don't know if there is a repository of

 1   where we can find that or not.          But this -- and I

 2   started this argument by saying this is a solution in

 3   search of a problem.     The Secret Service has adequately

 4   done their jobs beautifully over -- for over a century.

 5   And there is no reason to put some different rule down

 6   on the Secret Service.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, we lost a couple of

 8   Presidents, didn't we?

 9                (Laughter.)

10                MR. LANE:    Well, they're doing the best they

11   can.   I mean, that's -- I understand that.         But it is --

12   it is a serious, serious issue to curtail the First

13   Amendment.

14                Consider the situation where you actually

15   do -- and I believe this is that case -- you have Secret

16   Service agents who deserve to be taken to a trial

17   because they have gone out of their way to punish

18   someone for their free speech.

19                What do you do about those guys?

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But it's ambivalent.   I

21   mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial.          We know

22   what words were spoken.      Get to the trial; it turns out

23   Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam.

24   Then, end of trial, right?

 1   be considered by the jury.       I could lose this trial when

 2   we go back, if we get a trial.         That's what -- that's

 3   what jury trials are all about, Justice Ginsburg.

 4               And I'm not saying that I have to show

 5   evidence to this Court that I'm going to win the trial

 6   before I win this case.     The issue simply is, can we

 7   sacrifice the First Amendment?         You know, does a

 8   litterbug lose their right to have First Amendment free

 9   speech, does a jaywalker lose their right to have First

10   Amendment free speech because probable cause exists to

11   believe they've committed some offense?         And you'll have

12   officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws and jaywalking

13   laws and blocking-the-sidewalk laws, and First Amendment

14   is essentially evaded.

15               A hundred years of jurisprudence, courageous

16   jurisprudence, many times by this Court, goes by the

17   boards because somebody is a litterbug.         I just don't

18   see that as the solution to this problem, and I also

19   don't see that the Secret Service needs some enhanced

20   protection from this Court when this has never been and

21   is not now any kind of a serious problem.

22               The status quo is Mount Healthy.         It has

23   worked for decades, and it should continue to work.           And

24   if these agents get tagged in this case, maybe they

 1   Amendment is extremely important.          And I don't denigrate

 2   the job of law enforcement or these agents in any way.

 3               I'm simply saying that when the First

 4   Amendment is at stake, I think -- and the law has been

 5   working just fine throughout decades, to extend the no

 6   probable cause in Hartman to on-street encounters where

 7   there is no complex causation chain, where the main

 8   actor in Hartman was immune completely from lawsuit --

 9   the prosecutor in Hartman could not be sued under any

10   circumstances, nor could the prosecutor in Hartman be

11   questioned in deposition under our traditions.            We don't

12   question prosecutors in depositions about why they made

13   decisions to go ahead and prosecute.            So, this Court

14   stepped back in Hartman and said that's a different

15   story.

16               But on-street encounters -- if you extend

17   the no-probable-cause requirement to on-street

18   encounters, any rogue police officer, or Secret Service

19   agent, who wants to can ostensibly enforce any number of

20   legal violations -- 1 mile an hour over the speed limit,

21   you're going to jail allegedly for going 1 mile an hour

22   over the speed limit; or under Atwater, for not wearing

23   a seat belt -- when the real reason is your bumper

24   sticker.

25               If you can prove that, they should go to
