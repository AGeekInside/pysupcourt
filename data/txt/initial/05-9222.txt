 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. FISHER:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10              In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit

11   opinion that first decided the question that's before

12   you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting:

13   "The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the

14   maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the

15   basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was

16   not clear until the Blakely decision itself."                The Ninth

17   Circuit is simply wrong.        In this Court's Apprendi

18   decision it laid down precisely that rule.                At page 483

19   of that decision this Court described the statutory

20   maximum concept as, quote, "the maximum a defendant

21   would receive if punished according to the facts

22   reflected in the jury verdict alone" -- virtually the

23   identical language.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Mr. Fisher, you know,

25   assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a


                                       3

                                 Official


 1   basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get

 2   to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would

 3   comment on it at the beginning of the argument.          That is

 4   -- or I'll put it in the form of a question.

 5              Is the decision which the judge makes here

 6   to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a

 7   decision that requires the finding of any fact about the

 8   commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances

 9   of those crimes or about the defendant's character?

10              Does the judge have to make or does the

11   fact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any

12   of those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of

13   the defendant?

14              MR. FISHER:      Yes, he does, Justice Souter.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:          What is that fact?

16              MR. FISHER:      It's precisely the same kind of

17   fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself.

18   Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the

19   statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively

20   in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively,

21   refers the judge back to the very same provision that

22   was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating

23   factors provision of Washington, which was formerly

24   codified at section 390 and is now codified at section

25   400.


                                    4

                                   Official


 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:         I thought the only fact

 2   that had to be found was that, given the classification

 3   sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in

 4   effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless

 5   there were consecutive sentencing.                That's not a fact

 6   that falls within any of those categories of crime,

 7   character, or circumstances.

 8                 MR. FISHER:     That would be a fact, Justice

 9   Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law

10   works.   It is colloquially known as the free crime

11   aggravator.    But in the Washington Supreme Court

12   decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our

13   reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that

14   to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that

15   there was extraordinarily serious culpability or

16   extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the

17   multiple offenses.

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:         So it's a misnomer to say

19   it's a mere free crime criterion?            It's free crime plus

20   some further fact?

21                 MR. FISHER:     That's right.          And this Court's

22   decision -- I'm sorry.      The Washington Supreme Court

23   decision in Hughes clearly lays that out.               If you have

24   any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work

25   in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to

 1   a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that

 2   considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same

 3   way that Mr. Burton's was.         That is to say, they are run

 4   consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor.

 5   That case is called State versus Washington and it was

 6   just reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606.            The

 7   Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a

 8   sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does

 9   trigger and violate Blakely.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:          So the extra fact then is a

11   lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel

12   aggravator?     I mean, it's comparable to it?

13                 MR. FISHER:      Exactly, it's part of the same

14   list.     And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that

15   extra culpability, which is one of the ways this

16   aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of

17   element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable

18   doubt .

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:          When you say extra

20   culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime?

21   Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same

22   time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping.

23                 They're all very serious crimes.          And if you

24   sentence them consecutively, you will take into account

25   that there were three.       If you sentence them


                                       6

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


1    concurrently, it doesn't matter.           The Washington court

2    says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or

3    rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to

4    sentence consecutively if do you more than that.               You

5    have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special

6    kind of kidnapping.

7                MR. FISHER:      That's right, Justice Breyer.

8    In section --   the current section is section 589 of

9    the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run

10   concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of

11   exactly the same type the judge is required to find in

12   Blakely.   And if you look at Blakely itself, remember

13   Blakely involved concurrent sentences.             And so what Washington

14   is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently

15   unless there's an extra fact, something about the

16   additional crimes that would otherwise be running

17   concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above

18   and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish

19   those crimes separately.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:        But could the nature of the

21   additional crimes themselves satisfy it?            In other

22   words, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might

23   be one thing if one were serious and the other two were

24   trivial, but all of these three are very serious.               Now,

25   that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of




                                       7

 1   discrete fact.    Could that value judgment satisfy the

 2   extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must

 3   be in addition to free crime.

 4                 MR. FISHER:     No, it couldn't, and the

 5   Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you

 6   with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an

 7   aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under

 8   Blakely itself, there has to be something above and

 9   beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes

10   themselves.    It can't simply be -- I'm sorry.           It can't

11   simply be that there were three crimes committed

12   and all three of them are very serious.

13   It has to be something about the crime, the additional

14   crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary

15   commission of that crime.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But, Mr. Fisher, even if

17   it's true that there are other examples out there that

18   might qualify for that example, it's not true of this

19   case?

20                 MR. FISHER:     I'm not sure I follow, Justice

21   Stevens.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           In this particular case,

23   there was -- it was necessary to make an additional

24   finding of fact, even though there may be cases out

25   there in which you could get consecutive sentences


                                      8

 1   without an additional finding of fact?

 2              MR. FISHER:       You're certainly right that in

 3   this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact.

 4   There are some situations under the Washington Code and

 5   I believe in the majority of other States where it is up

 6   to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences

 7   concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that

 8   Justice Souter described.       So what Washington does in

 9   its respondent's brief is it cites these other State

10   decisions, from other States that simply have different

11   sentencing systems than we have in Washington.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm not sure I

13   understand that.   I mean, we have not held, for example,

14   that the fact of a prior conviction is something that

15   has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely.               Why, if

16   you're determining that sentences run consecutively,

17   isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous

18   conviction and saying they're going to run

19   consecutively?

20              MR. FISHER:       Under some State systems that

21   might be the case, Mr. Chief Justice.               However, in

22   Washington the way that the code works is that judges

23   are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences

24   shall run consecutively.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you'd have --


                                     9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1              MR. FISHER:      Unless they make the exact kind

 2   of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same

 3   statute that was at issue in Blakely itself.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And you're saying

 5   that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a

 6   conviction for a particular serious crime that's going

 7   to go unpunished otherwise?

 8              MR. FISHER:      That's right.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So under this system

10   if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder

11   and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get

12   an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence,

13   that would not contravene Blakely.              But if you're

14   convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those

15   two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does

16   violate Blakely.

17              MR. FISHER:      If the judge needs to make an

18   extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two

19   crimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate

20   Blakely.

21              THE COURT:     But we've never held that?

22   We've never held that consecutive -- that the treatment

23   of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by

24   Blakely?

25              MR. FISHER:      You haven't had a case in the


                                   10
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive

 2   sentences.   But what you've done is laid down a rule

 3   from the very State that we're dealing with here that

 4   says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding

 5   beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and

 6   beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of

 7   guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be

 8   proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.       That's why

 9   in this case that line, that rule, is triggered.

10                The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk

11   about any of this.    What it said, as I mentioned, is

12   that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic

13   rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to

14   the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever

15   the State happened to label as the statutory maximum.

16   In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times,

17   that the statutory maximum concept was triggered

18   according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict.

19   And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply

20   ignored that language in this Court's opinion.

21                Lest there be any doubt about the way that

22   concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi

23   itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but

24   one of effect:   Does the required finding take a

25   defendant to a higher sentence level than would


                                     11

 1   otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed

 2   in the jury verdict?

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Fisher, there's

 4   another potential impediment in this case and I would

 5   like you to comment on it.       That is the petition from

 6   the sentence, it was second in time.             There was a prior

 7   petition that challenged just the conviction, and under

 8   the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've

 9   got to get permission from the court of appeals and it

10   has to meet stringent criteria.

11              How do you get past that?             You went out

12   concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence

13   which is a second petition.

14              MR. FISHER:       This is the very first petition

15   that Mr. Burton has filed against the 1998 judgment.             He

16   did file earlier a petition against the original

17   judgment of 1994.   In the joint appendix at page 34,

18   that is where that petition is reprinted.            He says quite

19   clearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that

20   petition, whereas here this is his first petition

21   against the 1998 judgment.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So did -- then you are

23   bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is

24   not the sentence.   You are saying there's an earlier

25   judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a


                                    12
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   civil case, if you have a determination of liability,

 2   that doesn't give you a final judgment.              The judgment

 3   will come at the end of the case when damages are

 4   determined.

 5                 MR. FISHER:     That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

 6   And if what the State is saying is correct, which is to

 7   say that we don't have any judgment at all until the

 8   sentence is final, then all you get from that is that

 9   Mr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed

10   and the court could have gotten it dismissed.              But we

11   submit what you can't do from that is retroactively

12   change the first petition that he explicitly told the

13   court was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told

14   the court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that

15   his sentence was still on direct review.              You can't

16   retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment

17   into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons.

18                 One is that if the State is right, the

19   district court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that

20   1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either,

21   because as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that

22   sentence was still on direct review.              But even if you

23   get past that, we submit that this Court's Castro

24   decision simply doesn't allow a court, especially

25   retroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that

 1   the petitioner himself said was against one judgment as

 2   against another.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you think there can

 4   always be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review?

 5                MR. FISHER:      No, there can't, Justice

 6   Kennedy.    And so what should have happened according to

 7   the state's theory, is that the first petition should,

 8   should simply have been dismissed.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Bit is that also your

10   theory?

11                MR. FISHER:      I think that's -- this Court

12   hasn't laid down a solid decision.                But I think that's a

13   better reading.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But are you -- are you

15   asking us to say that while the sentence is still under

16   review, there can be no habeas petition filing?

17                MR. FISHER:      Am I asking --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Why isn't that up to the

19   option of the petitioner?        He can take his chances or he

20   can wait.

21                MR. FISHER:      I think that is a fair

22   characterization, Justice Kennedy.                But what Mr. Burton

23   did is he want to the district court saying I'm

24   challenging the 1994 judgment.             And as I was saying,

25   under Castro before that gets recharacterized --

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I'm asking if it is your

 2   position whether or not he properly can do that?

 3              MR. FISHER:        I don't think so.          But I'm just

 4   recognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that

 5   this Court would decide for itself.               But assuming that

 6   he can't do that, what the district court would have had

 7   to say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge

 8   the 1994 judgment.    And let's assume for the moment he

 9   could have challenged the 1998 judgment.               The district

10   judge would have said, "Now Mr. Burton, you're only

11   challenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment.              You

12   need to wait until you're ready to challenge your

13   sentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment."

14   Presumably -- and this is I think a fair inference

15   especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted,

16   since he told the district court that he was challenging

17   his sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at

18   that time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it

19   and wait until I can challenge my sentence.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:           But if the first proceeding

21   was not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would

22   lose under the second and successive objection in this

23   case, right?

24              MR. FISHER:        I don't know that we would,

25   Justice Souter.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:         Why not?

 2                MR. FISHER:      Because it is a common rule

 3   that -- this Court hasn't had a case exactly like this,

 4   but the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth

 5   Circuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply

 6   brief is one of them.      Where, it is a common practice

 7   for a petitioner to bring one petition against a

 8   judgment and then be partially successful, and then

 9   bring a new petition against something in the new

10   judgment.   And that's essentially what happened here.

11   And it may --

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:         Aren't those cases in which

13   the first judgment is complete, he simply does not

14   attack everything that was a predicate for the first

15   judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial,

16   and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility

17   arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment

18   was not complete.

19                MR. FISHER:      No, you put your finger on it

20   exactly.    And so, but we still think that, that, either

21   the court had jurisdiction or it didn't.             And if it had

22   jurisdiction, then it must be -- fall in somehow into

23   the category that you're talking about.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that's not necessarily

25   true.   Isn't it also possible if, at the time of the

 1   first judgment the judge could have said, well you really

 2   haven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final

 3   until the whole thing is over.            But nevertheless,

 4   because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm

 5   going to go ahead and decide it.

 6                MR. FISHER:     Could a district judge have

 7   done that?

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes.

 9                MR. FISHER:     I think what would have needed

10   to have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and

11   40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm

12   still challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under

13   AEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would

14   have needed to say, you need either to renounce that

15   appeal from the State court or renounce this one.             You

16   couldn't do both at the same time.

17                Mr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it

18   is fair to say, could have gone into district court and

19   said, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to

20   challenge my conviction and sentence because I have no

21   intention of challenging my sentence through State court

22   proceedings.   And perhaps he could have done that.            But

23   that would be a very different situation than what we

24   have here.

25                If I can turn back to the, not a new rule

 1   question, another angle at this is not simply to look at

 2   the text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we

 3   submit told a State court in this situation all it would

 4   have needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to

 5   look behind that and look at the statutes that were in

 6   play in New Jersey and in Washington.                And even if you

 7   did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a

 8   district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is,

 9   would have known that Apprendi applied here.

10                 What you had in New Jersey was essentially

11   two statutes.     One that said an ordinary commission of a

12   crime is punishable up to 10 years.                And a second

13   statute that said if you commit that crime with some

14   kind of extra -- extra bad circumstance, there a hate

15   crime, then you get -- you can get a higher sentence.

16                 Exactly the same thing was true in

17   Washington.     We had one statute that said this is what

18   the, this is what the punishment is for the ordinary

19   commission of this crime.         And we had an extra statute

20   that said, but if you commit that crime with extra bad

21   circumstances -- and here the only difference was, there

22   was a list of circumstances, not just a single one --

23   but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances,

24   then you can get extra punishment.

25                 And the analogy that the respondents want to

 1   draw between the Washington sentencing system and the

 2   Federal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So you think Blakely

 4   was not a new rule but Booker was?

 5                MR. FISHER:      I think that's fair to say,

 6   Mr. Chief Justice.    Because in Blakely all you needed to

 7   do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two

 8   different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold

 9   for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is

10   the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the

11   facts in the jury verdict.        To decide Booker this Court

12   had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to

13   a different type of threshold, which was as this Court

14   put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment.

15                So under -- under the system that this Court

16   reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory

17   maximum.    And then you had to decide whether the

18   Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal

19   sentencing guidelines.      And if there is any confusion on

20   that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself

21   where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made

22   clear that there was unique status of the Federal

23   sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult

24   question.

25                However, here where you didn't have anything


                                     19
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   like that, we had just a simple situation where there

 2   were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime,

 3   and then an additional maximum for the crime being

 4   committed with aggravating circumstances.               And so it was

 5   a very clear map line.     And that's what this Court said

 6   in Blakely, of course.     It said, it didn't break any new

 7   ground in the decision in Blakely.               It simply said that,

 8   took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our

 9   precedents on this point are clear.              And it just simply

10   quoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum

11   for Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the

12   maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts

13   and the jury verdict alone.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          There were decisions

15   going the other way.

16                MR. FISHER:     There were lower court

17   decisions?

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes.

19                MR. FISHER:     Yes, there were.          And I think,

20   if we want to talk about these, it is important first to

21   be clear about what we are talking about.              There were,

22   there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to

23   the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its

24   sentencing guidelines system could not stand.              And then

25   you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of


                                    20
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a

 2   couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some

 3   in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way.

 4               But I think it is very telling, Justice

 5   Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme --

 6   I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court

 7   decisions, because none of them -- not a single one --

 8   quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in

 9   Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of

10   effect.   And there's several passages in Apprendi that

11   said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed

12   based on the facts in the jury verdict.             So once you

13   take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas

14   Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion

15   that you can reach.     The only way those lower courts

16   were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to

17   pluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and

18   not acknowledge the rest of the opinion.             And of course,

19   the rest of the opinion where this Court has these

20   passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the

21   building blocks of the opinion itself.             It is where the

22   Court canvasses the historical rule that was

23   incorporated into our constitutional system.             And so it

24   is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or

25   loose language that this Court had in its opinion.                It


                                      21

 1   was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi.

 2              And we submit that, in a Teague analysis

 3   where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a

 4   reasonable jurist would have found something, not just

 5   the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable

 6   jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you

 7   take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only

 8   one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come

 9   to.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I suppose that doesn't

11   make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.

12              MR. FISHER:      Well, Justice Kennedy, I think,

13   as I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the

14   dissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi

15   itself was a bad idea.    And that Apprendi really wasn't

16   dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.           I see

17   almost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents

18   of Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law,

19   we can distinguish it from the facts in this case.

20   There was nothing of that in the dissents.

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Of course you have to show

22   that the result was dictated by the prior precedent.

23   That's a strong phrase.     We said it in Stringer --

24   Stringer versus Black.    But if it has a new application,

25   that's -- that's new.     Even though the principle is the


                                   22
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   same.

 2              MR. FISHER:      I think the Stringer test is

 3   helpful because there, of course, this Court said that

 4   one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because

 5   even though there was a different State sentencing

 6   system that slightly different before the Court in the

 7   subsequent case, the principle from the prior case

 8   dictated only one result.      And I think once you go back

 9   to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say,

10   with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in

11   Booker, I think again it is telling, because the

12   dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a

13   possible way to distinguish one case from the other;

14   whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't

15   have to extend it this far.        We can limit to it to true

16   statutes and not go this far.          So there is a difference.

17              Really what this case, I think one way to

18   phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether

19   when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that

20   has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust

21   reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a

22   certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in

23   this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court

24   and say I don't know if the Court really means what it

25   says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely


                                   23

 1   dissent.

 2                We think that, we submit what this Court

 3   should say is that when we say something is the law,

 4   that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at

 5   least until we tell them somehow that the law is

 6   different.

 7                If there are no more questions on the new

 8   rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument.

 9   Because if for some reason this Court adopted the

10   state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly

11   formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and

12   that -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have

13   evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be

14   considered a watershed exception --              a watershed rule.

15   And the reason why is because, is because of an error

16   that runs throughout the state's brief.

17                And the state's position is basically that

18   this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely

19   deal with circumstances where a defendant has already

20   been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is

21   what sentence ought to be imposed.               But, of course, that

22   -- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and

23   Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant

24   is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury

25   actually found him guilty of.           And --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              This argument, this

 2   argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or

 3   not it is a new rule.

 4                MR. FISHER:     I think that's right, Mr. Chief

 5   Justice.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Don't you have --

 7   don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that

 8   question?

 9                MR. FISHER:     In the watershed realm?

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              In other words, it

11   doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a

12   point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters

13   whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA

14   2254(d)(1) by its terms.

15                MR. FISHER:     If this Court concluded in the

16   Whorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then

17   of course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get

18   us home here.   But as this case comes to the Court, as I

19   understand it, this Court is considering this case in a

20   posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks

21   where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is

22   supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a

23   threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is

24   satisfied.   And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned

25   the watershed exception itself.


                                    25

 1                 So we think that what this Court should

 2   really do is address that threshold question to the

 3   extent it needs to holistically.

 9               ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

10                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

11                 MR. COLLINS:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13                 I would like to begin where Justice Ginsburg

14   began, with the issue of successive petitions.                 We

15   believe that the petition before this Court is a

16   successive petition barred under AEDPA.               Now my brother,

17   Mr. Fisher says that it's not a successive petition

18   because the first petition challenged the 1994 judgment.

19   But that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts

20   of this case.

21                 A new judgment was entered in March of 1998.

22   That judgment was entered as a result of Mr. Burton's

23   conviction being affirmed and his sentence being

24   reversed.   So when he was in custody, when he filed his

25   first petition, he was in custody pursuant to that


                                     26

 1   amended judgment.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:         So that is the only

 3   judgment that could be attacked on habeas?

 4               MR. COLLINS:      Exactly, Your Honor.           So he

 5   has an amended judgment filed in March of 1998.               He

 6   files his first petition challenging his conviction

 7   under that petition.    Later, in 2002, he files a second

 8   petition challenging his sentence.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It doesn't matter --

10   I'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment

11   of conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994.

12               MR. COLLINS:      He does put that in, Your

13   Honor, but I don't think that's determinative.               If you

14   take a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you

15   appeal from the judgment of conviction?               Answer, yes.

16   If you did appeal, answer the following.               And it lays

17   out the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was

18   affirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new

19   judgment is entered in March of 1998.

20               He is not in custody pursuant to the 1994

21   judgment.   He is in custody --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Where does it say a

23   new judgment was issued in March of '98?

24               MR. COLLINS:      Your Honor, that's in the

25   joint appendix at page 3, which shows that --


                                    27

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Oh, I thought you

 2   meant it was in his petition.

 3               MR. COLLINS:      No, no, it wasn't in his

 4   petition, Your Honor, but it doesn't seem -- the fact

 5   that he was looking back at his conviction, original

 6   conviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down,

 7   doesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was

 8   the judgment under which he was in custody, because it

 9   simply wasn't.   The original 1994 judgment no longer

10   existed because a new judgment had been entered.              So

11   because -- and I don't think -- I think what we disagree

12   about in this is which judgment, if the first petition

13   went to the first -- to the 1994 judgment, and the

14   second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would

15   agree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive.

16               On the other hand, I believe I heard him say

17   that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in

18   existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998

19   judgment.   Then he's filed a successive petition with

20   regard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing

21   with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the

22   sentence.

23               So since it's a successive petition and

24   Mr. Burton did not go through the gatekeeping function

25   that AEDPA requires, there is no -- the district court


                                    28

 1   had no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that

 2   this Court does not have jurisdiction.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:         The fact is, we're looking

 4   at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the

 5   first petition that was filed; is that right?

 6                 MR. COLLINS:      That's correct, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So you look at it and it

 8   says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you

 9   said.     Then it says date of judgment of conviction,

10   December 16, 1994.     So looking at that, you'd think that

11   is what he was attacking.         Where does it say he's

12   attacking anything else?

13                 MR. COLLINS:      Well, Your Honor, it doesn't

14   say he's attacking anything else, but the problem with

15   that is that when he filed this petition, he was not

16   being confined --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes, but I imagine there

18   are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal

19   system.    And I would think that judges when they're

20   trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate

21   looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking,

22   he has to figure that out often for statute of

23   limitations purposes, or some other purpose.           He'd look

24   over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd

25   think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked,

 1   unless of course there's some indication that it's

 2   something else.

 3                 I've never heard of this before.           Is there

 4   any precedent on that where even though the petition

 5   refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest

 6   anything other than date A, because it turns out that

 7   there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being

 8   held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're

 9   attacking date B.

10                 Is there any precedent that says that's how

11   it's read?

12                 MR. COLLINS:     I'm not aware of any

13   precedent.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:        No.    So this might be the

15   first time.    I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read

16   the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the

17   judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it

18   refers to.

19                 MR. COLLINS:     Well, Your Honor, I think you

20   have to say the judgment that's being attacked is the

21   judgment by which he's being confined.            I mean, he --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:        I don't know what

23   implication this is going to have for a lot of these

24   petitions.    I don't know one way or the other, but it

25   might be there are thousands right now in the Federal

 1   court which have date A, and somebody is going to go

 2   back and say no, it is really date B or something.                I'm

 3   a little nervous about it.       If you're not nervous,

 4   you're the ones in charge.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:          Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it

 6   your position that, number one, the only judgment that he

 7   can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the

 8   time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92

 9   judgment that follows the resentencing?               But he may in

10   attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction

11   which occurred earlier?

12               MR. COLLINS:      Exactly, Your Honor.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:          And if he chooses to attack

14   only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the

15   later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other

16   issue.   And when he comes in later and tries to raise

17   the issue that he could have attacked under the '92

18   judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas,

19   it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do

20   it.

21               MR. COLLINS:      That's exactly right, Your

22   Honor.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And further, I

24   thought you told me that the petition goes on to

25   indicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the


                                    31

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   sentence was reversed, looking at 9(b) on joint appendix

 2   35.

 3               MR. COLLINS:     Yes, Your Honor.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Which in other

 5   words, he details in the petition the subsequent history

 6   that would have resulted in a new judgment.

 7               MR. COLLINS:     That's right, Your Honor.

 8               Next I would like to go briefly to the

 9   question that Justice Souter asked about --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I just be sure I

11   understand one thing about that?           So you're saying at

12   the time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he

13   had already had, the second judgment had already been

14   entered by the Washington Supreme Court?

15               MR. COLLINS:     It had been entered by the

16   trial court, Your Honor, so he --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Pursuant to the reversal

18   of the --

19               MR. COLLINS:     Exactly, Your Honor.          That

20   sentence is on page -- if you look at page 3 of the

21   joint appendix, that is the second amended judgment

22   filed in the superior court in Washington on March 16,

23   1998, and he was confined under the authority of this

24   judgment.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Of the second judgment?


                                   32

 1              MR. COLLINS:      Of the second judgment.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why does it make any less

 3   sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the

 4   conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow

 5   separate appeals to this Court from each of those?        And

 6   once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only

 7   from final judgment, but you can bring here on

 8   certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though

 9   proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.

10              MR. COLLINS:      Well, Your Honor, I think

11   we're talking about the habeas corpus statute and there

12   the Court --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:         A fortiori, we have a lot

14   more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable

15   remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our

16   jurisdictional statute under certiorari.

17              Why does it make any more sense for habeas

18   purposes to insist that he await the final sentence

19   before he gets review of the premise for that sentence,

20   namely the conviction?

21              MR. COLLINS:      Your Honor, I'm sorry.

22              I think that a couple things are being

23   confused here.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:         All right.

25              MR. COLLINS:      The first thing is when -- is


                                   33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   this a successive -- is this a successive petition, and

 2   we would say it is, because he filed the first one and

 3   then the second one.

 4               Now the question of whether he can get

 5   relief under the first -- under his first habeas

 6   petition does not depend on the entry of a final

 7   judgment.   In fact, under the facts of this case, the

 8   judgment was entered in March of 1998.               In December of

 9   1998, he filed his first petition.               And in fact, the

10   first petition was denied in April of 2000 on the

11   merits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to

12   wait for that, because those claims were exhausted and

13   because they were ripe, because they -- the factual

14   predicates had occurred in the trial court, then that

15   was all that was required for him to bring those claims.

16   He didn't have to wait for a final judgment.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:         But you're saying he can't

18   later bring any claim about the sentence?

19               MR. COLLINS:      That's because Congress in

20   AEDPA has declared that you have to bring all of your

21   claims in your -- at one time, and if you don't, then

22   your petition should be dismissed as successive, unless

23   you go through the gatekeeping solution.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:         So that if the statute

25   governing our review had an exhaustion requirement and a


                                    34
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   second and successive requirement comparable to the

 2   AEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put

 3   would be exactly like this case?

 4               MR. COLLINS:      I believe so, Your Honor.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:         Okay.

 6               MR. COLLINS:      So I just briefly want to go,

 7   Justice Souter, to where you started about the

 8   consecutive sentence issue.

 9               We believe that consecutive sentence is

10   quite different than, from what exists in Blakely and

11   that, in fact, there aren't really additional findings

12   of fact.   I think you referred to about the crime, about

13   the circumstances, about the character.          In fact, in

14   this case, the finding of fact entered by the trial

15   court in order to justify the exceptional sentence --

16   this is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of

17   fact 18 -- if the court were to sentence the defendant

18   to a standard range sentence on each count run

19   concurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if

20   he had committed only the rape in the first degree.

21   This would effectively result in the free crimes

22   of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first

23   degree because he would receive no additional penalty

24   for those crimes.   Now --

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:         That's -- I keep doing


                                    35
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   this.     I'm sorry.   Is that sufficient, as you understand

 2   it, under the Washington case that your brother cited to

 3   me?

 4                 MR. COLLINS:       I believe it is, Your Honor.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:          Okay.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought the law was

 7   that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the

 8   unless is that the judge makes an additional finding,

 9   the very same kind of finding that he would make in

10   determining aggravating factor.

11                 MR. COLLINS:       Your Honor, the sentence could

12   have been run consecutively because of an aggravating

13   factor.    In fact, in this case the trial court judge, in

14   fact, had three independent and separate reasons for

15   running the sentence consecutively.                 Two of those would

16   be, I think we would say aggravating factors that the

17   Blakely reasoning would apply to.               But the court of

18   appeals when it considered this case only looked at the

19   free crimes element to make that decision.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:             Maybe you can give me just

21   a little more help on this.            The finding number 18 that

22   you referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing

23   him on the basis of the jury verdict he won't get --

24   he'll get a free pass.        But it doesn't say the judge

25   can -- could therefore increase the sentence.                 It seems


                                       36

 1   to me there had to be additional findings that justify a

 2   result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of

 3   justice.

 4              MR. COLLINS:         No, Your Honor.          I don't think

 5   that's right.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:               You think that just having

 7   pointed out that he would get a pass would have been

 8   sufficient to justify consecutive sentences?

 9              MR. COLLINS:         I think it would, and the

10   State supreme court affirmed this decision.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Yeah, but he did make

12   additional findings.      It goes on.          In fact, 19 and 20

13   are additional findings.

14              MR. COLLINS:         Your Honor, I think -- I mean,

15   I agree with you that he did make additional findings.

16   But --

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:               It nowhere says they're

18   unnecessary either.

19              MR. COLLINS:         That's true, Your Honor.          But

20   if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which

21   is at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the

22   court of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court

23   of appeals says is, "nonetheless, the sentencing court

24   concluded that the multiple offender policy alone

25   justified the exceptional sentence.                The fact that the

 3   Sentencing Reform Act standing alone, is a substantial

 4   and compelling reason and justification for imposing the

 5   exceptional sentence here."

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:         That is to say that that

 7   would have been sufficient.

 8              MR. COLLINS:      Exactly.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:         But in fact that is not

10   what the trial court premised its decision on, because,

11   as Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings

12   19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication

13   and planning, and so on.     Having been through those

14   findings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the

15   court now makes the following conclusions of law.

16              It seems to me as though the trial court was

17   basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as

18   upon finding 18, which was the free crime finding.

19              MR. COLLINS:      Well, I think that the --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:         I guess what I'm saying is

21   the fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake

22   of argument that the trial court might on the basis

23   simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced

24   consecutively, is simply not the case that we've got,

25   because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on

 1   cruelty, sophistication, and so on.

 2                 MR. COLLINS:     Well, Your Honor, I believe

 3   that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive

 4   sentence on the free crimes was -- standing alone would

 5   have been sufficient.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:        I don't want to take you

 7   up.   Let me just have one on the merits, one.          I mean,

 8   the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in

 9   my dissent.    I was trying as hard as I could to show why

10   I thought this case was wrong.           I start the dissent by

11   saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two

12   sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that

13   increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must

14   be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum,

15   again quote, means "solely on the basis of the facts

16   reflected in the jury verdict."           Okay.

17                 Then at the end of the opinion I say:

18   "Until now I would have thought the Court might have

19   limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't

20   cause so much harm."     Now, the next sentence of course I

21   explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but

22   somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I

23   guess I couldn't think of it.

24                 So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I

25   didn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I

 1   couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi,

 2   and they read Apprendi to mean what it said.            Now, you

 3   tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't

 4   think of that would have limited Apprendi?

 5                 MR. COLLINS:     Well, Your Honor, I think that

 6   you could have said that the definition of "statutory

 7   maximum" is the traditional statutory maximum that was

 8   at issue in Apprendi.     And in fact in the Apprendi

 9   decision the Court specifically, I think in response to

10   Justice O'Connor's dissent, explained that Walton versus

11   Arizona was still good law.          And as you know, in Walton

12   the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first

13   degree murder, but they could not receive the death

14   penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a

15   hearing.

16                 And it seemed to say that the statutory

17   maximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings

18   would not take you above that statutory maximum.            I

19   think that --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Wasn't that overturned in

21   Ring?

22                 MR. COLLINS:     It was overturned in Ring,

23   Your Honor.    But when you had lower court appellate

24   judges looking at your decision in Apprendi and seeing

25   the fact that Walton and Apprendi were consistent, it


                                     40
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was logical for them to conclude, as virtually every

 2   single court did except for Kansas, that the definition

 3   of "statutory maximum" was the traditional statutory

 4   maximum that was in Apprendi.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:         Was it logical for them to

 6   conclude it or were they -- were they expressing the

 7   hope that the Court would draw a distinction which it

 8   had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in

 9   Apprendi?   It's one thing to say that if you draw no

10   further distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain

11   result.   It's another thing to say but maybe they will

12   draw a distinction and we're going to predict that they

13   will, and hence not apply Apprendi.

14               Weren't the other appellate courts to which

15   you refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call

16   the exercise of hope?

17               MR. COLLINS:      I'm not sure that I would

18   agree with that, Justice Souter, only because as I think

19   Justice O'Connor explained in her dissent, there are two

20   ways to read Apprendi, and one of those ways would

21   result in upholding guideline systems which are now

22   invalid because of Blakely and Booker, but really quite

23   different from Apprendi because those systems involve

24   what you would call guided discretion.           That is, in

25   Apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the

 1   judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was

 2   enhanced.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:         Okay, but doesn't that

 4   require drawing a distinction that Apprendi did not

 5   speak to?    And isn't it still the case that, I think

 6   Mr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in

 7   Apprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a

 8   jury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range

 9   increases.

10                Isn't the distinction which -- and I trust

11   your recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in

12   mind and that they had in mind a distinction which

13   simply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been

14   something new as opposed to merely an application of

15   what was implicit in Apprendi?

16                MR. COLLINS:      I believe it definitely would

17   have been something new, Your Honor.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:         Yes.

 1   please the Court:

 2                 If I could begin by addressing the issues

 3   that you were just talking about, there was a

 4   distinction that the Court could have drawn between

 5   Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could

 6   have drawn and did draw.        One was the formal distinction

 7   that you were discussing before with the State, which

 8   was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an

 9   interpretation in her dissent and the majority not

10   responding to that, that that distinction was contrary

11   to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting

12   the -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and

13   saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference,

14   that the Apprendi rule still was important.

15                 The second -- and in addition to that, that

16   distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was

17   consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of

18   Walton.     And you have to look at what reasonable jurists

19   could have interpreted looking at that decision at the

20   time with those distinctions and what the Court said in

21   Apprendi.

22                 But in addition to that, there was more than

23   a formal distinction that could have been drawn between

24   the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines

25   system.     That's the distinction that we proposed in our


                                      43
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that

 2   sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to

 3   channel but not to eliminate the discretion that

 4   sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise

 5   applicable limits.    And in the Washington system the

 6   sentencing judge retained a significant degree of

 7   discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized

 8   to traditional sentencing systems that aren't

 9   constrained by Apprendi.

10               The facts, the facts on which the judge

11   could rely to go above the guidelines, were not

12   specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the

13   legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the

14   judge himself or herself to determine what facts the

15   judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in

16   addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher

17   sentence.   The judge had to look at those facts and make

18   the additional determination that those facts rose to

19   the level of substantial and compelling reasons that

20   justified the higher sentence.

21               In that respect, the judge had a degree of

22   sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it

23   and whether it was in fact justified.

24               Now, of course, this Court rejected those

25   distinctions in Blakely.       But the question is whether a


                                     44

 1   reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions

 2   and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could

 3   have.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Roberts, do you

 5   have a position on whether we have a successive petition

 6   problem here?

 7               MR. ROBERTS:        We don't have a position on

 8   that precise, on that particular issue here, because it

 9   can't arise for Federal prisoners.                 But let me explain

10   why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps

11   that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the

12   issue.   In the Federal system, it's well established

13   that the conviction and the sentence are part of a

14   unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't

15   become final until the conviction and the sentence have

16   both been fully adjudicated.

17               That understanding is reflected in the

18   language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that

19   authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners.

20   That statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is

21   motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence.                So

22   it's clear from that that it's not authorizing

23   collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the

24   attendant sentence.     And I think that could shed some

25   guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a


                                      45
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for

 2   Federal prisoners.

 3              I would also make a point on the other sort

 4   of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the

 5   consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact

 6   that the judge said that the multiple offense policy

 7   standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence

 8   here and that the court of appeals relied on that in

 9   upholding that.

10              But the court of appeals went further,

11   because petitioner had made a separate challenge to --

12   and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix.

13   Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two

14   aggravating factors.     Petitioner argued that the

15   district court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me,

16   the trial court couldn't rely on those two other

17   aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in

18   the original sentencing and this was a resentencing.

19              The court of appeals rejected that challenge

20   and it rejected that challenge because it said the

21   sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense

22   policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and

23   then on page 53 it said:       "The sentencing court did not

24   rely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing

25   an exceptional sentence."        So I think these --


                                     46
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:        Is that true in fact?

 2               MR. ROBERTS:     Well, that is how --

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:        I'm mean, I'm sure you're

 4   reading correctly, but is that in fact true?        Because,

 5   having talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having

 6   spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says,

 7   on the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the

 8   following conclusions of law.

 9               MR. ROBERTS:     The trial court said each of

10   the three standing alone was sufficient.        But what the

11   court of appeals said is these other two have been

12   challenged, but these other two are -- we're not going

13   to deal with this challenge to these other two

14   factors because they're out of the case.        So I think

15   that this Court has to take the case as coming from --

16   coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts

17   essentially said is those other two are not in the case

18   any more.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:        So we can treat it in

20   effect -- and this may be the way to do it -- we can

21   treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington

22   appellate court and that's what they said?

23               MR. ROBERTS:     Well, what the Washington

24   appellate court essentially, they could have said

25   petitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors


                                   47
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   couldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the

 2   standing alone.   What they chose to do is, we're going

 3   to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on

 4   the one.   And that was the basis for responding to that

 5   claim of error, and I do think that the Court has to

 6   take this case as coming on that basis.

 7               If I could turn to the issue of Blakely

 8   retroactivity for a few minutes.            In addition to the

 9   points that I made before about why Blakely was a new

10   rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a

11   watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's

12   essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if

13   they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of

14   Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance

15   for three reasons.    First, the right to counsel

16   pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but

17   Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the

18   punishment of defendants who have already been found

19   guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a

20   crime.

21               Second, a felony trial in which the

22   defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but

23   it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance

24   standard to find facts that determine the extent of

25   punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use


                                     48
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have

 2   as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by

 3   Blakely.   Those include facts that trigger mandatory

 4   minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence

 5   within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which

 6   a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in

 7   advisory guideline systems.

 8               Third, counsel is so essential to a fair

 9   trial that deprivation of the right can never be

10   discounted as harmless error.           But this Court held in

11   Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in

12   reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that

13   Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal

14   trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for

15   determining guilt or innocence.

16               That conclusion seems to strongly suggest

17   that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair

18   trial.

19               If the Court has no further questions --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

22               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

23                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

24               MR. FISHER:      Let me say one word on

25   jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the

 1   merits.     On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right

 2   that this rarely happens in the Federal system.                It

 3   rarely happens in the State system.                We can't find any

 4   other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the

 5   State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and

 6   saying:     "I'm challenging this judgment."

 7                 But what happened here was just that.

 8   Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994

 9   judgment.     And under this Court's Castro decision, when

10   a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one

11   thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it

12   can't be converted into something else which is a first

13   habeas petition without advising the petitioner.               And

14   here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but

15   the State in its own answer, which we attached to our

16   reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994

17   conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he

18   can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment.

19                 So it's way too late in the day for the

20   State to stand up to you now and say this pro se

21   petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an

22   improper petition.

23                 On the merits, I don't want to elaborate

24   beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look

25   at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington

 1   decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear

 2   that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the

 3   only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly

 4   too lenient factor.     Hughes makes it crystal clear that

 5   a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, "extraordinarily

 6   serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple

 7   offenses."   And to the extent that the State stands

 8   before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's

 9   case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that

10   finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas

11   petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge

12   needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the

13   judge didn't do so.

14                Let me finally turn to a discussion about

15   whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi

16   could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to

17   distinguish the system at issue in Blakely.              We don't

18   think it could because this Court didn't simply say in

19   Apprendi that Walton stands.              It explicitly said the

20   reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand

21   it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system

22   that is permissible under Williams against New York.

23                It's one where on the basis of the jury's

24   finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible

25   without anything else.       And so the only disagreement


                                      51

1    between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was

2    as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that

3    would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the

4    majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as

5    the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence.

6                  That is exactly the kind of system that was

7    not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full

8    well realized.

9                  And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed

10   out, once it became clear to this Court the way that

11   Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this

12   Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule

13   and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too.

14   And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the

15   dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise.

16                 If this Court has no further questions, I'll

17   submit the case.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Thank you,

19   Mr. Fisher.    The case is submitted.

20                 (Whereupon, at 12:01 a.m., the case in the

21   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
