 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 08-1553, Kawasaki

 5   Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. v. Regal-Beloit Corporation, and the

 6   consolidated case.

 8                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

 9                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10                  MR. BALLENGER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may

11   it please the Court:

12                  From its enactment in 1906 until very

13   recently, it has been settled law for a century that the

14   Carmack Amendment does not apply to the inland leg of an

15   import through shipment.        This Court had a factually

16   identical --

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Are you taking -- are

18   you taking a position different than the U.S., that it

19   applies to exports but not imports?                I think the -- the

20   Solicitor General's position is that it doesn't apply to

21   any import or export.

22                  Is it yours that it doesn't apply to

23   imports?

24                  MR. BALLENGER:         I don't believe so, Your

25   Honor.     I think both of our position is that the current

                                       4

 1   scope of Carmack is consistent with its historic scope,

 2   which had a very limited, special application to exports

 3   to Canada and Mexico.     Other than that, it doesn't apply

 4   to foreign trade at all.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could you tell me

 6   something?    Is there -- do you know if there's a

 7   railroad line from the U.S. through to -- through

 8   Mexico?   I know there is one from New York to Canada, a

 9   freight line.

10                 MR. BALLENGER:         There certainly are rail

11   connections between the United States and Mexico, yes,

12   Your Honor.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         There are?

14                 MR. BALLENGER:         Yes, absolutely.

15                 This Court had a factually identical import

16   case just a few years ago in Kirby, and, although it did

17   not discuss the Carmack Amendment, this Court agreed

18   unanimously on both reasoning and a result that are

19   flatly inconsistent with Respondents' arguments here.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought the government

21   told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in

22   the case because it was either waived or something.             But

23   the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand,

24   COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States.

25                 MR. BALLENGER:         That's correct, Justice.

 1   The United States represented to this Court that -- that

 2   Carmack was not in the case, either because it was

 3   waived or because the traffic was moving under 49 U.S.C.

 4   section 10709, which of course is true here as well.

 5                 Our view has always been that this Court

 6   wouldn't have granted certiorari purely on the basis of

 7   a waiver.    But in any event, this Court's reasoning in

 8   Kirby was that it's very important to foreign trade and

 9   to the uniformity of rules on a through shipment.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but uniformity is

11   one thing when you're talking about 50 States and

12   another when it's just two Federal statutes.

13                 MR. BALLENGER:         That's absolutely true, Your

14   Honor.    But the -- for more than a century, the relevant

15   Federal statutes have been construed harmoniously not to

16   overlap in this particular situation.               Foreign ocean

17   commerce is governed by the Carriage of Goods at Sea

18   Act, and the Carmack Amendment has always governed

19   purely domestic traffic and exports to Canada and

20   Mexico.

21                 Now, Respondents say that the settled

22   meaning of that statute changed dramatically in 1978,

23   but Congress said that it didn't.             And it's not really

24   that hard to read the present language --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, what if --

                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   what if Congress was wrong?           I mean, the language that

 2   they adopted sure looks quite different to me than what

 3   was applicable prior to 1978, and the boilerplate

 4   provision that, oh, when we codify this, we don't mean to

 5   change anything -- I mean, which prevails, the actual

 6   language they used or that boilerplate?

 7                MR. BALLENGER:          Your Honor, I think that

 8   this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as

 9   a whole, which includes that language that Your Honor

10   characterizes as boilerplate and also includes the

11   language that we are here to construe.            And you would

12   want to read it all together if possible.

13                So let's look at the -- at the present

14   language.   It appears at the back of Union Pacific's

15   reply brief at page 6a.      Just like it always has,

16   Carmack distinguishes between receiving carriers,

17   delivering carriers, and connecting carriers.

18               The simplest way to resolve this case is

19   that I believe even Respondents would concede that for

20   Carmack to apply, you need a receiving carrier that

21   is a rail carrier.   "K" Line is the receiving carrier

22   here, and they are not a rail carrier.            Numerous decisions

23   of this Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission

24   confirm what the statute plainly says, which is that a

25   rail carrier is a party providing common carrier railroad

                                      7

 1   transportation, not --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Those are -- those

 3   are two different arguments, right; your rail carrier

 4   argument and your pre-1978 argument?

 5                MR. BALLENGER:         They are, Your Honor.       The

 6   simplest way to resolve this case is that the present

 7   language, even taken on its face, requires a receiving

 8   carrier that is a rail carrier.

 9                "K" Line is the receiving carrier here.

10   They are not a rail carrier.            This Court and the ICC

11   have long held that merely subcontracting for common

12   carrier service does not make you a common carrier.

13   This Court held that in the American Railway Express

14   case.   The ICC made this crystal clear in the

15   CSX/Sea-Land matter in 1987, where they held that the

16   ocean carrier Sea-Land was not a rail carrier simply

17   because it subcontracted for inland rail transportation

18   and provided carrier containers to the inland rail

19   carrier.   So --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So your -- I'm sorry.

21   I'm a little confused.     Your position is that "K" Line

22   -- you're representing whom here?

23                MR. BALLENGER:         I -- my client is Union

24   Pacific, but I am here today speaking for both of the

25   Petitioners, "K" Line and Union Pacific.

                                     8

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            You have a bit of a --

 2                 MR. BALLENGER:      Yes.

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- conflict, don't you?

 4   Because isn't "K" Line taking the position it's not a rail

 5   line?   And who are you speaking for when you say it's --

 6                 MR. BALLENGER:          For both of us, Your Honor,

 7   because that resolves -- actually resolves the case for

 8   both "K" Line and Union Pacific.

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            If it's considered what?

10   If it's considered --

11                 MR. BALLENGER:          "K" Line -- the statute

12   requires -- to be triggered, it requires a receiving

13   carrier that is a rail carrier.              "K" Line is the

14   receiving carrier here, and they are not a rail carrier.

15   So then the question becomes -- Union Pacific certainly

16   is a rail carrier.    The question becomes:              Can you treat

17   Union Pacific as the receiving carrier?                You can't.   The

18   receiving carrier language has been in the statute since

19   1906.   It has never changed.             And for a century it has

20   always meant the carrier that receives the property from

21   the shipper at the point of origin.                The current

22   language --

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Where is that defined in

24   Carmack?   Where in the pre-1978 provisions or in the

25   current statute is that to be read?

 1                 MR. BALLENGER:        Well, there are -- there is

 2   not an explicit definition of the term "receiving

 3   carrier," Your Honor.      It appears in the first sentence

 4   of 11706, where it has always appeared in the first

 5   sentence of Carmack, and then there are implications

 6   in -- throughout the rest of Carmack, which I'm happy to

 7   talk about.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I -- I'm trying to

 9   find it, statutorily.

10                 MR. BALLENGER:      Okay.

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And what case says that?

12                 MR. BALLENGER:      Well --

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What case of ours defines

14   a -- a receiving carrier in that particular way?

15                 MR. BALLENGER:        Well, let's start with the

16   statutory language, if we may.            The first sentence of

17   Carmack says that "A rail carrier providing

18   transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of

19   the Board under this part shall issue a receipt or bill

20   of lading for property it receives for

21   transportation under this part."

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The only one who's in --

23                 MR. BALLENGER:        That's how --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The only one who has --

25   the board has jurisdiction over is the railroad.               It

                                      10

 1   doesn't have jurisdiction over the ocean carrier

 2   receiving.

 3                  MR. BALLENGER:       That -- that's correct, Your

 4   Honor.     And then the question is --

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And so you are the --

 6   you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the

 7   person receiving the goods, correct?

 8                  MR. BALLENGER:       No, Your Honor.        The

 9   receiving carrier has always been the party at the point

10   of origin of the shipment.          And you can see if you look at

11   the venue provision in the current language --

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But you're not reading

13   the language.     Doesn't the language say the person who

14   receives under the jurisdiction of the board?

15                  MR. BALLENGER:       No, Your Honor.        It's --

16   it's two separate requirements.             It's always been

17   understood as two separate requirements.                Carmack

18   requires that the receiving -- a receiving carrier is

19   subject to the jurisdiction of the board, and then it

20   also has to be the receiving carrier.               The receiving

21   carrier is the originating carrier.                If you look at the

22   venue provision --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I -- I keep going back

24   to:   What language tells me that particular point in the

25   statute?

                                      11

 1                MR. BALLENGER:       Because otherwise the -- the

 2   whole structure of the statute doesn't work.            Carmack draws

 3   a distinction between receiving carriers, delivering

 4   carriers, and connecting carriers.

 5                If receiving property directly from another

 6   common carrier and merely moving it for a portion of the

 7   journey and connecting that were enough to make you a

 8   receiving carrier -- and, of course, it is in common

 9   parlance; you are receiving goods in that circumstance.

10   But this receiving --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That's my problem.

12                MR. BALLENGER:       "Receiving carrier" has

13   always been a term of art in this statute.            If that were

14   enough to make you a receiving carrier, then the

15   statutory structure would fall apart, because every

16   interim carrier in the line would be a receiving

17   carrier.   Every single one of them receives property --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes, but not --

19               MR. BALLENGER:      -- property for transportation.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Not every -- where you are

21   dealing with -- with intermodal transportation, not every

22   receiving -- not every rail carrier would be the receiving

23   rail carrier.   I mean, this --

24                MR. BALLENGER:       That --

 2                  MR. BALLENGER:       It's not how -- that's not

 3   how the statute is worded, Justice Scalia.             The

 4   statute --

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Is this the language?   It

 6   says the     -- see if it helps with Justice Scalia's question.

 7   The language says "a rail carrier providing transportation

 8   or service subject to the jurisdiction of" the STB "shall

 9   issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it

10   receives."

11                  MR. BALLENGER:       Correct.

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:        And so that's what it has

13   to do, is a bill of lading for property it receives.

14   And you are saying "receives" means receives from the

15   shipper.

16                  MR. BALLENGER:       It has always meant --

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:        It does not mean receives

18   from another carrier.

19                  MR. BALLENGER:       It has always meant that.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Is that right?

21                  MR. BALLENGER:       That's correct, Your Honor.

22   It has always meant that.         It has to mean that, because

23   otherwise, if you read it to mean receives from another

24   carrier, then every single connecting carrier or delivering

25   carrier in the chain would be a receiving carrier as

                                      13

 1   well as a connecting or delivering carrier and required

 2   to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the

 3   historic purposes of Carmack on its head.

 4                  The purpose of Carmack was to require the

 5   first carrier in the chain to issue a single through

 6   bill of lading to the destination that would govern the

 7   whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms.

 8   No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of

 9   lading, so there's only one receiving carrier.            It's

10   the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper.

11   If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the

12   statute uses the term "originating carrier"

13   interchangeably with "receiving carrier," and it

14   provides venue over that carrier only at the point of

15   origin of the shipment.       That would make absolutely no

16   sense if someone downstream could be the receiving

17   carrier.   In this circumstance you would say, I suppose,

18   that Union Pacific was the receiving carrier --

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I -- I always thought

20   that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail

21   responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it

22   was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad

23   connections.     If that was the purpose of Carmack --

24                  MR. BALLENGER:       That's not quite correct,

25   Your Honor.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Okay.

 2               MR. BALLENGER:      Historically, this Court

 3   explained in Atlantic Coast Line v. Riverside Mills and

 4   in the Ward case, the purpose of Carmack was to require through

 5   transportation, a through bill of lading, from the

 6   originating point to the destination point, a single

 7   bill of lading under consistent terms, so that the

 8   shipper does not have to prove where damage occurred.

 9   The point of Carmack --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But on the rail line.

11                MR. BALLENGER:       On --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             On rail -- on the rail

13   transportation.

14                MR. BALLENGER:       On any transportation,

15   actually, Your Honor.     The way that the statute works,

16   it can --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Historically you say

18   that?

19                MR. BALLENGER:       Yes, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             In the pre-1978 Carmack,

21   there is a -- if you want to take a look at it.

22               MR. BALLENGER:      Sure.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It is in page 99a of

25   injury occurs while the property is in the custody of

 1   a carrier by water, that liability" -- "the

 2   liability of such carrier shall be determined by the

 3   bill of lading of the carrier by water and by and under

 4   the laws applicable to transportation by water."

 5               MR. BALLENGER:       Yes, Your Honor.     That --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So --

 7               MR. BALLENGER:       That provision was

 8   introduced in the Transportation Act of 1920.          It's

 9   talking about domestic water carriers.          And it's still

10   there in the statute.     It's just in the -- the Carmack

11   provision -- when Congress split Carmack into three in

12   1995, it moved that provision to 14706(c)(2).          And --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So explain to me what

14   happens in domestic water cases.          It says that you can

15   have a different bill of lading for the water transport.

16   That bill of lading controls your damage on the water,

17   and it separates that out from damage on the rail side?

18               MR. BALLENGER:       In domestic -- Congress drew

19   a distinction between foreign and domestic commerce for

20   a very long time, Your Honor.          In domestic commerce, the

21   rule has been that a rail carrier could interconnect

22   with a domestic water carrier and the domestic water

23   carrier could carry it for a leg of the trip, and the

24   whole trip would still be governed by the Carmack

25   through bill of lading.    But if there was damage during

                                   16

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the water portion, it would be governed by the water

 2   law, which is the Harter Act.

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And the railroad is

 4   covered by any damage that occurs on land?

 5                 MR. BALLENGER:       The railroad is liable on a

 6   through transportation basis for the entire trip, but if

 7   the damage occurred during the water leg, its liability

 8   is limited and confined by the law that governs the

 9   water leg.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So there already is

11   domestically two different forms of liability

12   protection?

13                 MR. BALLENGER:       Congress made that

14   compromise, because Congress was forced to choose

15   between not having through bills of lading at all

16   domestically or making -- or essentially repealing the

17   Harter Act in circumstances where rail carriers interact

18   with them.    Congress made the choice to compromise and

19   have kind of a hybrid arrangement.

20                 But in foreign trade -- the geographics of

21   Carmack was always confined -- that Carmack did not apply

22   to imports at all, and it did not apply to exports except

23   for exports to adjacent foreign countries --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Prior -- prior to

25   1978.   If I think you lose on that question under the law

 1   as happens to be currently codified, but would prevail

 2   under the pre-1978 law, what -- what is your strongest

 3   case for the proposition that what I referred to earlier

 4   as the boilerplate language trumps the plain language of

 5   the currently codified version?

 6                MR. BALLENGER:       Your Honor, we don't think

 7   that this Court has ever interpreted language of that

 8   nature.   But in a different context with a much weaker

 9   statutory language, the Fourco Glass line of cases, this

10   Court applies a strong thumb on the scale that Congress

11   didn't intend to change the law.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It's kind of a

13   difficult -- I mean, if you're a shipper and you're

14   trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and

15   you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the

16   law says, who's going to tell you that, well, that you

17   may think that's what the law says, but you're really

18   governed by the pre-1978 law.

19                MR. BALLENGER:       Well, Your Honor, we don't

20   -- we don't think that it's -- it is necessary for this

21   Court to read the statute in a counter-textual way.

22   You just have to do what this Court has always done and

23   read the statute as a whole, including giving some weight

24   to that provision, which is in the text of the statute, and

25   reading the rest of the statute in light of it.

 1                And I think if you do that, particularly in

 2   this case, it's really not that hard to reconcile the

 3   pre-1978 law with the current law.                 Union Pacific can't

 4   be a receiving carrier because it didn't receive the

 5   goods at the point of origin.              "K" Line isn't a rail

 6   carrier.   That's enough to resolve this case, and this

 7   Court doesn't need to go any farther.                Actually, that

 8   would, as a practical matter, mostly resolve the

 9   commercial problem that this Court granted certiorari to

10   resolve.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I have one question.     I

12   know that it's -- your white light is on.                 Can I assume

13   that whether we rule for Petitioners or Respondents in

14   this case, the shipping world, the cargo world, will

15   immediately adjust to our decision?                It's not going to

16   be a problem.   There are insurers, there are freight

17   forwarders, there are form contracts.                People will know

18   exactly what to do.     They will adjust in 1 week to what we

19   do.   Am I right about that?          Or can you say that if we

20   adopt the Respondents' position, it will be disruptive to

21   the shipping trade and so forth?

22                MR. BALLENGER:         Not exactly, Your Honor,

23   because of course Respondents' position is that Carmack

24   is a mandatory regime; there's no way to contract

25   around it if it applies.        So Respondents' position is

                                      19

 1   that Carmack mandatorily must govern the inland leg of

 2   any of these through shipments.             The practical

 3   consequence of that is that true through bills of

 4   lading -- unity of responsibility in one shipper under

 5   consistent terms for the entire voyage -- will become

 6   impossible in foreign trade.             So there won't be a way to

 7   correct that.

15   please the Court:

16                I'd like to address a few of the

17   questions that have come up already.                Justice Sotomayor,

18   you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the

19   receiving carrier.   There's a series of decisions which

20   address receiving carriers and the nature of the

21   receiving carrier as the initial carrier that receives

22   goods from the shipper.      I would -- Mexican Light and

23   Power Company, 1947, is probably the best, but that

24   traces its way back all the way to the 1910s, Galveston

25   Wharf Company, Ward, Starbird, Blish Milling, Riverside

 1   Mills.    These cases are largely cited at our brief at

 2   page 27 to 28, footnote 10.

 3                Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on

 4   the current text, we believe that the current text,

 5   which is reproduced in the petition appendix at 69a --

 6   if you look at the combination of both the first and the

 7   third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that

 8   reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only

 9   domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation,

10   and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when

11   it's an export.

12                The first sentence requires that the rail

13   carrier be providing transportation or service subject

14   to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or

15   bill of lading.     The very purpose of Carmack from the

16   very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper

17   to sue the initial carrier.           The initial carrier was

18   responsible for the entire shipment.                 All the connecting

19   carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier,

20   and, therefore, there was an easy defendant for the

21   shipper, who dealt directly with that shipper -- that

22   carrier and received a bill of lading from that carrier

23   to sue.   That --

 1   exclusively on the pre-1978 language.

 2                 MR. YANG:   Our brief addressed the first

 3   sentence briefly in, I believe, the prior page.                   Page 20

 4   to 21 deals with the first sentence, and then 22 deals

 5   with the third.    But our point is that the first sentence

 6   sets an anchor in the United States as the -- as the

 7   origin of the shipment.

 8                 Part A jurisdiction -- this is reproduced at

 9   page 62a of the petition appendix.                It does cover

10   shipments that themselves transit United States and

11   foreign countries.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Excuse me.        What -- what are

13   you referring to now?

14                 MR. YANG:   62a of the petition appendix.

15   This is section 10501, which defines Part A jurisdiction

16   of the STB.   And then I'm looking --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The Union Pacific

18   petition appendix?

19                 MR. YANG:   They're both -- both of them are

20   actually the same.    Both the petition appendices are the

21   same.

22                 So I'm looking down at -- (a)(2) provides

23   that the jurisdiction of the STB applies only to

24   transportation into the United States when that's

25   between -- you know, part of a larger transit between

                                     22

 1   the U.S. and a foreign country or even purely

 2   domestically.

 3                 So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is

 4   subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this

 5   U.S. transportation when it issues the bill of lading.

 6   So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a

 7   carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring

 8   suit in a convenient forum, the person that the shipper

 9   dealt with.     And that's now reflected in section -- the

10   forum provision of Carmack, which is subsection (d)(2),

11   it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be

12   brought against the originating rail carrier in the

13   judicial district in which the point of origin is

14   located.   Those -- and the prior provision says that

15   that's a U.S. district court or a State court.

16                 Carmack itself anchors the transportation

17   as starting in the United States.

18                  And then the third sentence explains the

19   remainder of the historic scope.              The third sentence --

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Where -- we're looking

21   where, now?

22                 MR. YANG:    This is back to 69(a).          It's

23   Carmack, third sentence in subsection (b).              It defines

24   the liability under Carmack.              It says the liability

25   under this section is for damage "caused by the receiving

                                      23

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   carrier, the delivering carrier, or another rail carrier

 2   over whose line or route the property is transited in

 3   the United States or from a place in the United States

 4   to a place in an adjacent foreign country."

 5               So, what that does is that provides the

 6   center for the two bookends.           The first bookend is the

 7   originating carrier, the receiving carrier that receives

 8   the goods in the United States, provides the bill of

 9   lading to the shipper.

10               The second bookend is the delivering

11   carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended

12   to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole.           The

13   in-between is transportation in the United States or

14   export transportation from the United States to a point

15   in a foreign country.

16               We believe that that text, read as a whole,

17   reflects the historic scope of Carmack that's existed

18   since 1915 when it was extended beyond purely domestic

19   transportation.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:        But why -- why doesn't the

21   (2), (a)(2), the delivering rail carrier -- if what you

22   say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier

23   delivering in a -- in an adjacent foreign country.

24               MR. YANG:    Correct.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:        That -- that limitation is

 2                 MR. YANG:     Well, we believe the portion of

 3   (a)(3), which now looks like it's in (a)(3), the "over

 4   whose line or route the property is" transited --

 5   "transported" actually applies to the receiving and

 6   delivering rail carrier.

 7                 If you would turn to page 5a and 6a of the

 8   reply brief of Union Pacific, there's a side-by-side

 9   comparison.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Okay.        Wait a minute now.

11                 MR. YANG:     I'm sorry to have the --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         The paragraphing you say is

13   wrong?

14                 MR. YANG:     The -- from 5a to 6a, you'll see

15   5a is the 1978 version of Carmack that was enacted in the

16   1978 codification.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Right.

18                 MR. YANG:     The current version is reflected

19   on the facing page.       There was no paragraph indentation

20   in 1978.   And in 1995, when Congress changed the text, it

21   did include a paragraph indentation, but the committee

22   report -- the conference report is very clear that

23   Carmack was not changed.        Also --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         So all -- you're saying

25   that -- I think what you're saying is that all we have

 1   to use the statutory statement that nothing was meant

 2   to be changed or is to say, well, that paragraphing in

 3   3 is just wrong, right?

 4                  MR. YANG:   Well, I don't know -- you mean

 5   the indentation?

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        The indentation.

 7                  MR. YANG:   The indentation was inadvertent.

 8   And I would actually direct the Court to page 73a, which

 9   is the other part of Carmack that now exists for motor

10   transportation and freight forwarders.             There is no

11   indentation.    The current version of the other half of

12   Carmack does not provide the indentation.             The

13   indentation is inadvertent.           And in '95 -- the '95 Act,

14   which --

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        I'm losing you.    73a?

16                  MR. YANG:   73a -- (a)(1) reproduces what we

17   were just looking for -- looking at in the rail carrier

18   context.

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Okay.

20                  MR. YANG:   It's a single paragraph.         That's

21   the way it's existed since, you know, 1915, basically,

22   or 1927 when they added receiving carriers.

23                  So, what the Court can do -- it's true,

24   Carmack is less clear than it used to be.             It was made

25   somewhat less clear in '78 and in '95.             But we believe

 1   that when you take the text as a whole, particularly

 2   when read in light of the context of this Court's

 3   decision and the long-standing practice in the United States

 4   reflected in the STB -- the STB's decisions, that is the

 5   ICC's decisions, the predecessor, that at least the

 6   provision is ambiguous.

 7               And if the provision is ambiguous, section

 8   3(a), the mandate that the statute should not be construed

 9   to make a substantive change in the law, should control.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               This may not have

11   anything to do with anything.           Is there a reason the STB

12   doesn't appear on your brief?

13               MR. YANG:    The STB does not appear on our

14   brief --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It did in the Kirby

16   case just a few years ago.

17               MR. YANG:    It did.        It did.       The STB has not

18   taken a position about the current scope of Carmack and,

19   therefore, decided not to join our brief.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:         Is -- is there a way to --

21   are you finished?

22               MR. YANG:    No.      I would say, though, that

23   the ICC's decisions remain binding.              This is 1995.   The

24   statute, ICCTA section 204(a), which is a note now to

25   section 701 of Title 49, specifically provided that the

                                    27

 1   ICC's orders and determinations would remain binding

 2   unless changed by the STB.        The STB just did not, at

 3   this point, come on record and take a position about the

 4   scope of Carmack.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:         We don't even get into this

 6   problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier?

 7               MR. YANG:    In part.         There's -- if you --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, it says, "A rail

 9   carrier providing transportation or service subject to"

10   the STB "shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading."

11   That's what leads us into the problem.

12               MR. YANG:    That would take care of the

13   initial carrier, what we believe is the initial

14   receiving carrier in the case, "K" Line.           However, I

15   believe the argument is being made that Carmack could

16   suddenly apply mid-carriage at the border.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:         But mid-carriage -- it only

18   talks about -- they use that word "received."           That's

19   why I thought possibly it didn't because it says --

20               MR. YANG:    I believe the argument is that

21   the first carrier who receives property in the United

22   States would be deemed the receiving carrier.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:         That's a separate argument?

24               MR. YANG:    That's a separate argument.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:         Did the Ninth Circuit pass

 1   on that argument?

 2                  MR. YANG:   You would have -- excuse me.

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Did the Ninth Circuit pass

 4   on that argument?

 5                  MR. YANG:   It did not.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:        It did not.

 7                  MR. YANG:   It did not.

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:        So that's not right in

 9   front of us?

10                  MR. YANG:   That is correct.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:        It's quite different.

12                  MR. YANG:   It is a different -- but we think

13   it's clearly wrong in light of Carmack's historic

14   purpose.   This would be to divide the -- the -- if that

15   were correct, it would divide the transportation in two.

24                  It does not take great mental gymnastics to

 1   the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents.

 2                  The case is controlled by the plain language

 3   of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted

 4   to, to some extent.     But I would like to point out to

 5   the Court that in 2-1/2 pages of our merits brief,

 6   starting at page 26 and going over to page 28, we not

 7   only cite the full language in full of the Carmack

 8   Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB,

 9   but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier

10   within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the

11   plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the

12   loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of

13   the property; and the train derailment which was caused

14   by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the

15   Carmack Amendment.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Then under that view, I

17   guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all

18   the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a

19   single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United

20   States and go on a train for 50 miles, a new bill of

21   lading must issue?

22                  MR. FREDERICK:       No.      In fact, this Carmack

23   Amendment --

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Why?

25                  MR. FREDERICK:       -- explicitly says, quote:

 1   "Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not

 2   affect the liability of a rail carrier."                Carmack --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:        All right, so you're saying

 4   they don't have to issue --

 5                 MR. FREDERICK:       They do not have to issue a

 6   separate --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Fine.        If they don't have

 8   to issue a separate receipt, what we're talking about

 9   is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship.

10                 MR. FREDERICK:       That's correct.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:        All right.        Now, if that's

12   correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do

13   that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is

14   a person providing common carrier rail transport.                And

15   then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used

16   by or in connection with a railroad.                And my

17   understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction

18   if I don't -- is that the argument here is the ship is

19   providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection

20   with a railroad.

21                 MR. FREDERICK:       That's correct.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:        And it's the words "used by

23   or in connection with" that I am focusing on, because to

24   apply those words here seems to me to bring every

25   international shipment in the world, no matter how small

                                     31

 1   the American portion by rail and no matter how big the

 2   foreign part of this transport -- it brings it all within

 3   Carmack.     And it means that the bill of ladings issued

 4   by people throughout the world are all going to have to

 5   apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which

 6   had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and

 7   that's going to be a nightmare.

 8                 MR. FREDERICK:        No, it won't,

 9   Justice Breyer.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Now, first, is it true what

11   I said?    And, second, if it is true why isn't it way

12   contrary to the purpose and a nightmare?

13                 MR. FREDERICK:        It is not -- it is true and

14   not true, but for different reasons.               And if I could

15   take a moment to explain, because I think it is

16   important.

17                 In 1978, the plain language of the statute

18   defined what the STB's jurisdiction is.               They do not

19   dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional

20   provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment

21   is in, quote, "between the United States and a place in

22   a foreign country," but the STB only has jurisdiction to

23   the extent the transportation occurs in the United

24   States.

25                 So it is true that imports into the United

                                      32

 1   States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to

 2   the extent of the transportation being within the United

 3   States.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:        No, but why don't they have to

 5   issue a bill of lading?    That's what they say.        So every

 6   company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company,

 7   every shipowner, even if he's never been to the

 8   United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every

 9   one of those is going to have to issue a bill of

10   lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are

11   there, and we know at least one requirement you think

12   applies.

13               MR. FREDERICK:       Let me go back -- let me go

14   back to the international point, Justice Breyer, because

15   the railroads argued against an international uniform

16   rule that would apply both to ocean carriage and inland

17   carriage in the Rotterdam rules.          And they made the

18   representation to the international community:          You don't

19   need to have a uniform rule that applies to both ocean

20   carriage and inland carriage, because we have this thing

21   called the Carmack Amendment.

22              And they made the representation that the

23   Carmack Amendment would apply to imports, as this Court,

24   in the Woodbury case written by Justice Brandeis, decided

25   in 1920, and a month earlier --

 2   estoppel?

 3               MR. FREDERICK:       No, I'm arguing that their

 4   position is inconsistent with their representations, and,

 5   therefore, the plain language of the statute --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Which one is right?     That's

10   earlier position or their current position?

12   earlier position was correct under the plain

13   language of --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why don't you speak to that

15   rather than the fact that they had an earlier position?

16               MR. FREDERICK:       The plain language,

17   Justice Scalia, as it is currently enforced, I think

18   disposes of the case without any real argument.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And perhaps -- as I

23   understand this, I think we are all forgetting that none

24   of these liability provisions come into play until there

25   is proof that an incident has occurred somewhere, either

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And so the issue becomes

 4   which set of rules governs that particular incident --

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- where it happened.

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I think Justice Breyer

 9   asked you why it made sense that there would be two

10   rules in effect for what happens on the ocean and what

11   happens on land; and if we had it, wouldn't it create

12   great difficulty?     I think -- you may correct me.

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Your point was --

14                  MR. FREDERICK:       That's how the whole world --

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:        -- if it creates such

16   difficulty, why were the railroads in favor of it

17   before?

18                  MR. FREDERICK:       Correct.       And that's how --

19   that's how Europe operates.           Europe has separate

20   conventions for rail and road that apply to damage that

21   occur on land, and the European nations have acceded to

22   the various versions of Hague rules --

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Anything here that says on

24   land?     Anything in Carmack that says on land?

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:          In other words, if it's in

 2   a ferry boat -- remember, we have a very broad definition

 3   of "rail" where "rail" includes all things that have

 4   nothing to do with rail.

 7   broad definition, and I would have thought we traced

 8   through what has to be in the receipt, and then we get to

 9   the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got

10   -- want to get rid of it; then you have to put in -- you

11   have to put in a certain kind of waiver, which is very hard

12   to achieve. And that -- that's my understanding of it.

13               MR. FREDERICK:         It's the Surface

14   Transportation Board, Justice Breyer, that has the

15   jurisdiction here.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, but they can't get rid

17   of the thing you like.

18               MR. FREDERICK:         No, they can.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:          They can?

20               MR. FREDERICK:         They can.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:          How do they do it?

22               MR. FREDERICK:         And I want to get to

23   Justice Kennedy's question.          They can.    These are

24   background rules that we're talking about, and they will

 1   decided in the Second Circuit, Union Pacific went right

 2   out and changed the contracts that they have with ocean

 3   carriers to ensure that the ocean carriers would

 4   indemnify them if they were liable and did not get the

 5   full benefits of contractual extensions.                What we're

 6   talking about here --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, you don't --

 8               MR. FREDERICK:         -- is whether there's an

 9   American forum for American cargo interests for an

10   American train that is derailed in the United States.

11   That's what we are talking about.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But part of your

13   argument -- you don't rely heavily on your plain

14   language argument when it comes to deciding that these

15   huge ocean vessels are rail carriers.

16               MR. FREDERICK:         Let me go to that point now,

17   Mr. Chief Justice.   The Port of Long Beach is situated

18   more than 20 miles from Los Angeles, and the port has

19   60 miles of train track with intermodal, multimodal

20   facilities that get the cargo containers which "K" Line

21   owns on chassis that "K" Line owns, and they have to get

22   from the Port of Long Beach 20 miles away to the Los

23   Angeles train depot where Union Pacific picks them up.

24               Now, under "K" Line's theory of the case,

25   they get to have a donut hole in the Carmack Amendment

                                     37

 1   liability provision for that 20-mile transport.               We

 2   would submit as a factual matter, which of course would

 3   need to be done on remand, that there are facts that can

 4   be adduced to establish the functionality test which the

 5   ICC has long administered to look at the functions being

 6   performed as well as --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So that's a little

 8   bit different from your argument that they are a rail

 9   carrier because their bill of lading would cover the

10   train ride to Chicago.

11                MR. FREDERICK:       We didn't make that

12   argument.   Our argument was that, based on the functions

13   and them holding themselves out to be a rail carrier,

14   which they have done, they qualify under the normal ICC

15   method of determining rail carrier.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              If it weren't -- if

17   it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to

18   Los Angeles, you would say then they're not a rail

19   carrier?

20                MR. FREDERICK:       The argument, as the ICC has

21   defined it, also looks at things like the multimodal

22   facilities, like the containers, and -- and the holding

23   themselves out as a rail carrier in their advertising.

24   Those are important parts of the functionality test.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, how -- how does

 1   the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language

 2   of the statute?   They -- it just goes to Los Angeles and

 3   it -- there's a railroad track right by -- by the

 4   wharf, and it's the Union Pacific Railroad.

 5                MR. FREDERICK:       Well, there are -- there are

 6   two ways to read the text and resolve the case.            One is

 7   to say "K" Line is the receiving rail carrier when it

 8   transfers from the international ocean carriage

 9   corporation to the American multimodal transportation

10   operation and gets the goods from the Port of Long Beach

11   up to Los Angeles, and then treat UP, Union Pacific, as

12   the delivering rail carrier.            Under the statute, UP is

13   not required -- although the first part says you're

14   supposed to issue a bill of lading, their liability for

15   the train derailment does not turn on whether they

16   issued a bill of lading or not.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Is your case -- does

18   your case end if we hold that "K" Line is not a railroad

19   carrier?

20                MR. FREDERICK:       No.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           All right.

22                MR. FREDERICK:       "K" Line gets out of the

23   case.   We would have to go to Tokyo to pursue "K" Line

24   under the bill of lading.       But we could continue our

25   suit against Union Pacific as a delivering rail carrier

 1    under the Carmack Amendment.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         As a delivering carrier.

 3                MR. FREDERICK:       Correct.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, unless we

 5   hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they

 6   can opt out under 10709.

 7                MR. FREDERICK:       Well, you would need to

 8   reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage

 9   under 10502 takes away the option of a 10709 contract.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And that's a

11   different question with respect to liability and claims

12   and with respect to venue.

13                MR. FREDERICK:       Correct.         And let me address

14   that, if I might.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could I just -- just

16   briefly before you answer the Judge --

17                MR. FREDERICK:       Sure.

20   Union Pacific.   Under what contract could the shipper sue

21   Union Pacific?

22                MR. FREDERICK:       Under the --

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If "K" Line is -- is the

24   shipper --

25                MR. FREDERICK:       Directly under the Carmack

 1   Amendment.    And in fact, when Union Pacific removed this

 2   case from State court to Federal court, the Federal

 3   question was they said:      There is a Carmack Amendment

 4   claim being asserted against us.            That's how we get from

 5   State court to Federal court.

 6                And when they -- when they sought to transfer

 7   the case from California to New York, they did so on the

 8   basis of the convenience of 28 of the 32 witnesses to their

 9   train derailment being American citizens.

10                So it's not like there needs to be some

11   special -- there's a special cause of action within the

12   Carmack Amendment, Justice Sotomayor, that provides a

13   means of redress for damaged cargo interests to go

14   directly against the railroad.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Perhaps --

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Regardless of whether

17   the shipment was by them directly or not?

18                MR. FREDERICK:        Correct, if they caused the

19   damage.   That's the whole point of the Carmack

20   Amendment.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Maybe now you could

22   respond to my question about the distinction under 10502

23   between claims and liability and venue.

24                MR. FREDERICK:        Yes.     The STB, in an

25   authoritative determination that is entitled to our

                                     41

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for

 2   certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done

 3   with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove

 4   the possibility of a 10709 contract carriage.

 5                  And the reason for that is that, in both

 6   situations, the rail carrier has to provide an

 7   opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to

 8   the shipper.     If it's exempt cargo carriage under 10502,

 9   10502(e) says that the carrier must provide

10   Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of

11   the exemption and contract under the exemption.                 10709

12   provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier

13   provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest

14   could ship under.

15                  Here, because the transportation is exempt

16   under 105 -- 10205, there is no common carrier tariff

17   that is applicable.     And that's why the STB has said if

18   there's no common carrier tariff applicable under

19   11101, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract

20   carriage.   To do otherwise would be to make the statute

21   a complete deregulation statute.

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but it's a

23   little -- I mean, the -- I'm looking at page 64a of the

24   petition appendix, where they're saying you can't exempt

25   through contractual terms for liability and claims.

 1   Venue is treated elsewhere, separately from liability and

 2   claims.   So, again, under -- you're the plain language team,

 3   and that seems fairly plain that venue is not covered.

 4                MR. FREDERICK:       No -- well, liability, Your

 5   Honor, is where you can bring your suit and what your

 6   suit --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, the liability is

 8   not where you can bring your suit.               Liability is

 9   liability.   Venue is where you can bring your suit.

10                MR. FREDERICK:       The -- the way the board has

11   construed this in the letter brief that they filed in

12   the -- in the Second Circuit, which is entitled to our

13   deference, says the Ninth Circuit in Regal-Beloit got it

14   right with respect to the interplay between 10502,

15   10709, and -- and contract carriage.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Wait.        Excuse me.     You say

17   we have to defer to a letter --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- brief in another case?

20   I think most of my colleagues would not defer to a

21   letter brief in this case.        And you're saying that we

22   owe deference to a letter brief in another case?

23                MR. FREDERICK:       That is what this Court

24   held --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mead, which I didn't agree

 1   with, it seems to me --

 2               MR. FREDERICK:       Mead did not overrule Auer,

 3   and in Auer the Court -- this Court gave deference to a

 4   brief by the Federal Government that was setting forth

 5   the authoritative --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:        In another case?

 7               MR. FREDERICK:       In that case.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:        In that case.

 9              MR. FREDERICK:      But I don't know why --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:       Do we have a brief here?

11               MR. FREDERICK:       It's a distinction without

12   a difference, because here the Second Circuit invited

13   the views of the STB to tell us what do you think is

14   the interplay between these various provisions?

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:       Right.

16              MR. FREDERICK:      And the STB gave an

17   authoritative view to the Second Circuit so that it could

18   resolve a case in which the STB was not a party.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:        There are two things here I

20   don't understand I'm just trying to get clear.           In the

21   first part, 706(a), it talks about -- in the definition

22   of "rail carrier" -- 102(6), I guess.           It says railroad

23   includes -- railroad transport will include intermodal

24   -- intermodal equipment transport used in connection

25   with a railroad.

                                   Official


 1                 What is intermodal equipment?

 2                 MR. FREDERICK:       Those are the chassis.         They

 3   are the containers that are used to --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.        So now, if we read

 5   it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce

 6   the worst example that frightens me the most.                There is

 7   3 miles of railroad transport in the United States,

 8   but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box,

 9   which has come all over the world, from all over the

10   world.   And if we read this with no limitation, this

11   definition makes the ships that carried it from other

12   places railroads, and once that's railroad

13   transportation, we're into Carmack.

14                 And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is

15   the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt

16   an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability

17   provisions.   And it means the ships that had to issue the

18   bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits --

19   now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would

20   think against them, not just against a railroad carrier,

21   and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even

22   on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for

23   something that happens within the United States.

24                 MR. FREDERICK:       No.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Now, explain to me:        What

 1   is it that gets us out of that?

 2                  MR. FREDERICK:       There -- the -- COGSA

 3   applies tackle to tackle.         If the damage is occurring

 4   on a ship --

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes.

 6                  MR. FREDERICK:       -- the STB has no jurisdiction

 7   over that.     Carmack does not apply.             It is only once the

 8   ship --

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, where does it say

10   that?     Because I'd better read that one.

11                  MR. FREDERICK:       Well, COGSA itself, which is

12   set out in the --

14                 MR. FREDERICK:      And under no condition --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Do you know -- do you know

16   offhand where it says that, just so I -- I'd better --

17                  MR. FREDERICK:       Yes.     I can give -- the

18   provision of COGSA that you are looking for is the

19   definition of "carriage," which is set forth in --

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Good.

21                  MR. FREDERICK:       -- page 48a of the petition

22   appendix, and it is 1(e).         "The term `carriage of goods'

23   covers the period from the time when the goods are

24   loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the

25   ship."    And as the Court in Kirby said --

 2   Carmack.

 3                MR. FREDERICK:       Right.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:        So what gets us out of

 5   Carmack?

 6                MR. FREDERICK:       Carmack only applies if it

 7   is carriage and transportation within the STB's

 8   jurisdiction.   The STB has no jurisdiction over COGSA

 9   carriers.   That's the Federal Maritime Commission.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:        Then why are we suing --

11   why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here?

12                MR. FREDERICK:       The ship is performing two

13   different functions, Justice Breyer.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:       I see.

15               MR. FREDERICK:      It is performing an ocean

16   carriage function, and then once it's on land -- and

17   there are thousands of "K" Line containers all over the

18   United States right now where "K" Line is performing

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is that because they

22   have contracted for them?

23                MR. FREDERICK:       They own them.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, they don't own

25   Union Pacific's rail line.

 1                MR. FREDERICK:        No, they own the containers

 2   that Union Pacific is pulling.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So if I -- if I own

 4   a container being pulled by somebody else's train, I'm

 5   in the train business?

 6                MR. FREDERICK:        Under the definition of

 7   functionality, where that is part of how the STB

 8   regulates.   And to say otherwise, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   would be to deny the Federal Government the regulatory

10   authority over containers that come into this country

11   representing approximately 80 percent of the trade.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               No, it wouldn't.   It

13   would just -- it may just mean that they don't have

14   the regulatory authority because that container is a

15   rail carrier.

16                MR. FREDERICK:      It's carrying --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           What's carrying it

18   is the rail carrier.     It's a container.

19                MR. FREDERICK:        But they -- well, at one

20   level, Mr. Chief Justice, it's sort of academic, because

21   the STB exempted from Part A, which includes the Carmack

22   Amendment, those containers, and it did so in an

23   exemption order which we've cited in our -- in our brief.

24   So, at some level, there's an academic quality to this

25   colloquy.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I -- I am a little

 2   bit confused now.   Now, back to being confused.

 3                You're suggesting that from the landing --

 4   it's an ocean carrier -- and the minute that the

 5   containers are unloaded from the vessel and put on land,

 6   it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery

 7   contract may have ended at that point?

 8                MR. FREDERICK:       If its delivery contract

 9   ended at that point, it did not hold itself out --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          No.      Right.   So what about --

11               MR. FREDERICK:      -- as a rail carrier --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So what about -- what is

13   it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier

14   once they put it there.     Let's assume the reverse of the

15   hypothetical that you -- that you posited.                They deliver

16   to the dock, and Union Pacific is the one that owns

17   those 3 to 6 miles of connection to its main railroad.

18   It's the one who's going to provide the motor carriage.

19   It's the one who's going to take it from the -- the dock

20   and bring it in.

21                MR. FREDERICK:       And can I just add to the

22   hypothetical the fact, which is an important fact:                Did

23   the ocean carrier hold itself out to the public as a rail

24   carrier in making the contract with the original

25   shipper?   Because that is an important fact that does

                                    49

 1   not help us resolve your particular hypothetical,

 2   Justice Sotomayor.

 3                  If UP is picking up the goods with its

 4   equipment, the ocean carrier is not a rail carrier under

 5   our theory of the case.       There has to be functions being

 6   performed that are multimodal functions, and the ocean

 7   carrier has to hold --

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So it's not merely that

 9   it has possession of the container that it has dropped

10   somewhere.     It has to transport it in some way in

11   relationship to the railroad?

12                  MR. FREDERICK:       I think that's the best way

13   to understand the statute.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Can we go back one more

15   second?     Can you just give me the citation in Carmack --

16   not COGSA, but Carmack -- that would get our intermodal

17   shipment out of the board's jurisdiction?

18                  Because what I'm thinking about is the

19   intermodal shipment and the boat sinks near Hawaii.

20   Okay?     Now, on your reading of Carmack, not COGSA, what

21   gets that shipment sunk in Hawaii -- or Midway or Guam

22   or someplace -- what gets them out of Carmack?

23                  MR. FREDERICK:       Well, the --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Which words?

 2                 MR. FREDERICK:      -- the petition appendix

 3   defines the general jurisdiction.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes, and it includes

 5   transport, just as you defined it, between the United

 6   States and another place -- United States and a place

 7   in a foreign country.

 8                 MR. FREDERICK:        Yes.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So that's what this is.

10   This is a shipment between Shanghai and San Francisco

 1                MR. FREDERICK:       Now, it is not true that the

 2   law was settled prior to 1978.          The Woodbury case

 3   applied the Carmack Amendment to imports.            Union

 4   Pacific v. Burke applied it to imports.            And in those

 5   cases, this Court made the determination that the words

 6   "from" and "to" were also meaning "between."            And

 7   Congress, when it cleaned up the statute in 1978 and

 8   provided words that are very easy to understand now, was

 9   not changing what had been a well-settled practice of

10   goods that were getting -- arriving at a port in the

11   United States and then being transported by land means.

12                And it's important to understand the context

13   in which this arose, because I think our fundamental

14   disagreement with the Solicitor General's presentation

15   is that it ignores the container revolution that was

16   occurring between the late 1950s and the '70s, when

17   this Act was codified and cleaned up.            And in that

18   container revolution, prior to the time when containers

19   were used for multimodal transportation, it was common

20   for goods to be repackaged at ports in the United

21   States.   They were taken off ships; they were

22   repackaged, put onto trains or trucks, and that required

23   a separate contractual arrangement.

24               Now, this Court, in Woodbury and Burke, had

25   said it is not so important whether or not there is a

                                    52

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   separate contract, so long as the function and the intent

 2   is clear that it is being moved by rail or road in the

 3   United States.

 4                The Carmack Amendment will apply, Justice

 5   Sotomayor.   You are completely correct that the purpose

 6   of the Carmack Amendment was to hold railroads and motor

 7   carriers responsible for the liabilities caused by their

 8   loss.   But when Congress then cleaned that up and put it in

 9   section 3, it was not intending to obviate the clear and

10   unambiguous language of the statute.             It was simply

11   providing, you know, some boilerplate that I think is

12   very difficult to cause the Court to override the

13   plain language of the statute today.

14                And in 1995, when Congress eliminated --

15   terminated the ICC and enacted the ICC Termination Act,

16   it reenacted that language.         It did not encompass

17   section 3 at that time, so the statute as it presently

18   exists does not have a statutory pointer as to how you

19   are to interpret the language.          And under the normal

20   canons that this Court has instructed for courts and the

21   bar, the easiest way to practice law in this area is to

22   look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to

23   go back, not just through the last iteration of the

24   statute, but the one before that, and not just to be

25   able to look at what was in the U.S. Code, but to have

                                    53

 1   to go back to the Statutes at Large to see what other

 2   statutory provisions Congress had put into the statute.

 3   That would make the practice of law extremely difficult.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Can I ask you a question

 5   about -- about whether -- whether the shipper becomes a

 6   rail carrier?   Suppose it's not 3 to 5 miles.

 7   Suppose the -- suppose the American rail carrier is

 8   waiting right at the foot of the wharf, and all these

 9   wharves have rails that go out to the ship, okay?

10   And let's assume that that's owned by the -- by the

11   shipping company.    And a crane takes the -- the

12   goods off of the ship, puts it on a -- on a car that

13   rides along those rails for a couple of hundred yards.

14   Is that enough to make the shipper a railroad?

15                MR. FREDERICK:        I would -- I would concede

16   the point of interchange at the port, Justice Scalia.            I

17   don't think it's necessary for the Court to reach that.

18   I will concede that point, so long as, you know, we are

19   talking about an immediate nexus between the vessel and

20   the ship.   And -- and that is not -- not a point that we

21   have to prevail on to win in this case.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:         And you say here they own

23   rail lines that --

24                MR. FREDERICK:        There are 60 --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- that go for --

 1                MR. FREDERICK:       Well, there was no discovery

 2   because this was decided on the pleadings as a matter of

 3   law.   We believe that once discovery is permitted, if

 4   you allow the case to go back for factual development,

 5   that the facts would reveal that "K" Line was engaging

 6   in significant rail operations that at least get us

 7   beyond -- into the realm of legitimate advocacy.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         When you say "engaging

 9   in," are you talking about vis--vis this shipment?

10                MR. FREDERICK:       Yes.

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Or is it just in

12   general?   Vis--vis you?

13                MR. FREDERICK:       Yes.     That's correct.

14               When my colleague here says that we take

15   the position that Carmack cannot be contracted around,

16   that is not true.   Our point here is that when there is

17   exempt carriage, the STB has already defined this as

18   something that can be provided by contract, but we believe

19   that 10502(e) says that they have to provide

20   Carmack-compliant terms.

21                The industry will adapt to a decision by

22   this Court in setting the background rules.           We would

23   submit that the simpler regime and the one that the

24   railroad had advocated in the international community

25   was there -- was for there to be a U.S. statute that

                                    55

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   applies and not to allow complete deregulation through

 2   contracts --

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, they -- they

 4   can't contract around liability for an event such as the

 5   one that happened here.       Because they have to offer

 6   Carmack-compliant terms, and if the owner of the goods

 7   has the option of accepting those, they can't contract

 8   around that.

 9                  MR. FREDERICK:       That's correct.         And -- and

10   the point here about the forum is an important one,

11   because Union Pacific has never thought that in these

12   ocean bills of lading that that entitled American cargo

13   interests to have to go to a foreign country under the

14   ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the

15   interests in damage to their cargo.                That was an

16   invention by "K" Line in this case after UP sought to

17   remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to

18   New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued

19   throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies.

20                  It would be unusual, to say the least, to

21   allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual

22   extension of COGSA where section 12 of COGSA, by its

23   plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by

24   the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the

25   tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not

 2   specific reference in section 12 to the Harter Act and

 3   any other applicable law.         And in 1936, when Congress

 4   enacted COGSA to implement the United States -- of the

 5   Hague rules, it was aware of the Carmack Amendment.

 9              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

10                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11                 MR. BALLENGER:        Thank you, Your Honor.

12                 Even Respondents can't really bring

13   themselves to say that Union Pacific is the receiving

14   carrier here.    It's obviously not.            They say that

15   somehow, UP could be liable as the delivering carrier

16   under Carmack.   But of course, if "K" Line is not a rail

17   carrier, there is no receiving carrier who is obligated

18   to issue a bill of lading under Carmack.               No one is

19   liable to under Carmack.

20                That is how the statute always worked from 1906

21   to 1978.   If the receiving carrier was not governed by Carmack,

22   as it was not in any import case and in any export case except

23   for Canada and Mexico, then Carmack did not apply to

24   anyone.    You can't parachute in midstream into the

25   middle of a big movement and impose Carmack obligations at


                                          57

 1   the midpoint, because that would turn the historic purpose

 2   of Carmack completely upside down.           It would read Carmack

 3   as mandating the commercial problem that Carmack was designed

 4   to solve.

 5                 The point of Carmack and of through bills

 6   under Carmack and COGSA is uniformity of responsibility

 7   under consistent terms for the whole voyage in one

 8   person.

 9                 And the reason is that in order to recover

10   from anyone, the shipper has to prove receipt of the

11   goods in good condition by that carrier, and if you

12   break the chain of the through bill, then you would have

13   to prove -- the shippers would have to prove that Union

14   Pacific, for instance, received the property in good

15   order, when as Respondents concede, all that Union

16   Pacific gets is a sealed container.            It has no idea at

17   that point.

18                 And -- and so the shipper would be left in a

19   position at the end of the day; it opens the container,

20   there's damage; no one knows where it occurs; and there's

21   -- there's no source of law, no source of fact to

22   figure out where the damage occurred.

23                 Respondents raise a lot of questions about

24   some track that they say "K" Line owns from Long Beach

25   to Los Angeles.   None of this is in the record, and it's

 1   waived at this point, Your Honor.            It's not actually

 2   true.   That's not "K" Line; it's an affiliate, and they

 3   don't provide rail transportation.               It's a Union Pacific

 4   subsidiary that provides the rail transportation.

 5               But the real point is that all of this is

 6   far too late.   This case was decided on a rule 12(b)(3)

 7   motion to dismiss for improper venue, and the lower

 8   courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are

 9   confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you

10   are required to at least come forward with any factual

11   disputes that you think need to be resolved before the

12   district court can grant or deny that motion.              It's far

13   too late to wait until the Supreme Court of the United

14   States, and say we have discovered some X number of

15   miles of track --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:         How -- how do you get out

17   of the language that says that a rail carrier providing

18   transportation "shall issue a receipt" for property it

19   receives?

20               Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail

21   carrier under the definition.

22               MR. BALLENGER:        The --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:         And, therefore, it should

24   have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving

25   character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued

                                    59

 1   a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack, as

 2   I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain

 3   things in it that they say aren't there.

 4                  MR. BALLENGER:     Under the definitions, a rail

 5   carrier is a party providing railroad transportation.

 6   And this --

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:      Oh, yes, right; and now we

 8   see a rail carrier --

 9                  MR. BALLENGER:     No --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:     You can get the definition

11   there, and it includes somebody who provides intermodal

12   equipment.    And you look at transportation, and transportation

13   includes services related to that equipment.

14                  MR. BALLENGER:     The definitions of "railroad"

15   and "transportation" have always been defined to include

16   all of the equipment used by a real railroad.          But that

17   doesn't mean that anyone who happens to own that

18   equipment is also a railroad.           For instance, the

19   purpose --

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:      Ah, now all right.      Fine.

21                  MR. BALLENGER:     The purpose of those definitions

22   from 1906 on was to make sure that railroads couldn't evade

23   rate regulation by overcharging for the use of a bridge that

24   it owned.

25                  JUSTICE BREYER:      But --

 1                MR. BALLENGER:     But that doesn't mean --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:      Now just give me how -- what I

 3   would write in the opinion that would in fact -- because

 4   what they did here, the ship, is it took a container and

 5   put it on the train.     Okay?        So that's inter-service

 6   equipment.     What's the language that does it your way?

 7                 MR. BALLENGER:        A party providing rail

 8   common carrier transportation, the scope of the -- of

 9   that transportation is defined to include a container.

10   But that doesn't mean that everyone who owns a container

11   is -- meets the first part of the definition of

12   providing railroad transportation.                 Otherwise, for

13   instance, everyone who owned a bridge or a track or

14   provided rail cars would be providing railroad

15   transportation.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

17                The case is submitted.

18                 (Whereupon at 11:06 a.m., the case in the
