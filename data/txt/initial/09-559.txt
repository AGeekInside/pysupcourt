 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll hear

 4   argument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed,

 5   Washington Secretary of State.

 6               Mr. Bopp.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. BOPP:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10   may it please the Court:

11               No person should suffer harassment for

12   participating in our political system, and the First

13   Amendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting

14   from compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs

15   and their private associations.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             What -- what about

17   requiring disclosure of campaign contributions?

18               MR. BOPP:       Well, the --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you think that is

20   unconstitutional?

21               MR. BOPP:       This Court has upheld the

22   disclosure in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Right.           Now, why doesn't

24   that fall within your principle that no person should be

25   exposed to criticism for --


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MR. BOPP:     Well, it could --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- his political beliefs?

 3                 MR. BOPP:     It could potentially, and -- but

 4   this Court subjected those requirements to the

 5   appropriate constitutional First Amendment analysis,

 6   found that there was sufficiently important governmental

 7   interest, some of which are not present when we're

 8   talking about a referendum or initiative, and then also

 9   created an exception from even a generally valid statute

10   where there is a reasonable probability of harassment of

11   that particular individual or -- or group.

12                 So the First Amendment analysis regarding

13   the privacy of association, the privacy of identity and

14   beliefs, the potential of -- of intimidation are all

15   elements of the analysis that was employed by the Court

16   in Buckley.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I'm -- I'm trying to separate

18   out the harassment aspects of this case from the working

19   proposition that there's some sort of freedom of

20   association, of privacy.

21                 Your theory, putting harassment aside, would

22   invalidate all of the State laws that require disclosure

23   of voter registration lists, correct?                    All of those

24   States like New York that permit public review of voter

25   registration lists and party affiliations, et cetera --


                                         4

 1   that's illegal?

 2                  MR. BOPP:     No.

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That's unconstitutional?

 4                  MR. BOPP:     No.         We believe they would not.

 5   They would certainly be subject to First Amendment

 6   analysis.     But in -- in those -- in the instance of

 7   voter registration, there are other governmental

 8   interests that are not present in petition signings for

 9   referendums.

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Explain to me the

11   difference.     And -- well, one other aspect of State

12   legislative -- I can only work from New York because I

13   know it intimately, but it is a State that also permits

14   or requires that petitions for candidate listing on the

15   ballot be public as well.            New York relies in part, as

16   this State does, on the public reviewing those

17   petitions.     Would that be invalid as well, for a

18   candidate's running?

19                  MR. BOPP:     Well, we believe it would be

20   subject to First Amendment analysis.                      But, again, there

21   are different governmental interests when you have

22   candidates involved.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So explain to me what

24   the difference is in those three situations.

25                  MR. BOPP:     Well, one is you have candidates

 1   involved --

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             With -- with the State's

 3   interest.

 4                 MR. BOPP:     One is you have candidates

 5   involved.   And this Court recognized in Buckley that

 6   there were disclosure interests that related

 7   specifically, and actually only, to candidates.                   For

 8   instance, people who contribute to a candidate, that

 9   information, to the voter, can signal the interests that

10   the candidate, once he or she takes office, will be

11   responsive to.

12                 When we have an initiative, we know what the

13   law is that is being voted upon.                It's not a matter

14   of -- of electing a representative.

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You don't think that --

16   putting aside this kind of referendum, just a

17   hypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax

18   scheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested

19   in knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are

20   interested in that particular tax benefit or not?

21                 MR. BOPP:     Well, a few -- few might be, but

22   we think this is marginal information.                   First, they are

23   adopting a law.    And so we know what the law is.                 And --

24   and while it might be marginal information for a few

25   people, once the measure qualifies for the ballot, this


                                         6

 1   is only -- the petition signature and distribution is

 2   only for a very limited governmental interest.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel --

 4                MR. BOPP:     And that -- and that --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry, go ahead

 6   and finish your answer.

 7                MR. BOPP:     And that limited governmental

 8   interest is to preserve State money, to not conduct an

 9   election on the matter unless there is sufficient public

10   support.   So --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Now, counsel, the

12   responses you have given to a couple of the questions

13   has been that the First Amendment analysis would apply.

14   But given you have a facial challenge, is that enough?

15   Don't you have to indicate that the First Amendment

16   analysis would prevail in either all of the other cases,

17   most of the other cases, a significant portion?

18                This is a facial challenge.                And if the

19   challenge is going to fail in some of those other cases,

20   I think your facial challenge fails as well.

21                MR. BOPP:     Well, we're only challenging the

22   application of the Public Records Act to petitions and

23   referendum petitions.      We're not challenging it as it

24   would be applied to petitions to put people on the

25   ballot.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So we have to decide,

 2   in assessing your claim that, no matter what the

 3   referendum issue was, that there's a significant

 4   intrusion on First Amendment rights?

 5               MR. BOPP:     Yes.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that if, for

 7   example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to

 8   which people may have particular views, but they're not

 9   going to get terribly excited about it, we'd still have to

10   say that that's protected under the First Amendment?

11               MR. BOPP:     Well, actually, under -- with

12   modern technology, it only takes a few dedicated

13   supporters, and a computer, who are willing to map -- to

14   put this information on the Internet, MapQuest it, as

15   they did with respect to the contributors of

16   Proposition 8, which resulted in -- and then encourage

17   people to harass and intimidate them, which resulted in

18   hundreds of examples of harassment --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, my point is,

20   though, you're not likely to get that with respect to,

21   you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from

22   0.8 percent to 0.9 percent.           You're not going to get a

23   crowd outside your house because you signed that

24   petition.

25               MR. BOPP:     Well, it may not manifest itself


                                       8

 1   in -- in any particular initiative.                      We agree with that,

 2   but we think the potential is there, and there is

 3   usually a group of supporters of any measure that, you

 4   know, are passionate about that particular issue.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But -- but don't you

 6   have -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the

 7   complaint.

 8                 MR. BOPP:     Yes.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Count 2 would be the

10   counterpart to the exception that's made from the

11   disclosure requirement with regard to contributions with

12   certain organizations whose members might be harassed.

13                 MR. BOPP:     Well, with this --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's -- that's not --

15   that would still be open if you lose the first part of

16   this case.

17                 So going back to the question you were

18   asked, how does this differ -- that Justice Scalia

19   asked -- how does this differ from the contributor who

20   says, well, I might be harassed?                The contributor

21   would have an opportunity to show that.

22                 MR. BOPP:     Buckley dealt with that exact

23   question.    And first -- the first step of the analysis

24   is whether or not the law is -- is valid under the First

25   Amendment.    And then there is an exception to even a


                                         9

 1   valid constitutional -- a constitutionally valid law.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So, that's why I'm asking

 3   you why, on the first part, should it be any different,

 4   as long as you have the door open to show that if you

 5   were going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an

 6   exception would have to be made?

 7                MR. BOPP:     Well, we don't think that the exception

 8   is a substitute for considering the initial validity of

 9   the law, which --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           May I -- may I ask you

11   one -- something that was not in your brief, but was in

12   the Secretary's brief.       Is this list available to

13   Project Marriage?   And specifically on page 34 of

14   Secretary Reed's brief, the statement is made that the

15   sponsoring organizations sometimes sell or trade these

16   lists.    They use them for fundraising purposes.         So that

17   would be the end of a person's privacy, at least on one

18   side.    Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses

19   these lists?

20                MR. BOPP:     Yes.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes?

22                MR. BOPP:     Yes, this is an act of private

23   association.   The petition signers are associating with

24   the referendum committee for purposes of placing this

25   measure on the ballot --

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            They don't say:             Now, I

 2   agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes.                       But

 3   that's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the

 4   petition that the --

 5               MR. BOPP:     Well, what --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- signature collector

 7   can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising

 8   purposes?

 9               MR. BOPP:     What is implicit is they are

10   associating with this group for a purpose, and that is

11   support for, in this case, Referendum 71.                       And so they

12   use those names for valid purposes.                    But --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Bopp, do you have any

14   case in which we have held that the First Amendment

15   applies to activity that consists of the process of

16   legislation, of legislating --

17               MR. BOPP:     Yes, Buckley II.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- or of adopting legislation?

19   What is that?

20               MR. BOPP:     Buckley II.             You struck down the

21   requirement that the person who is soliciting signatures

22   self-identify.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That is --

24               MR. BOPP:     That is a process --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Soliciting signatures is not

 1   taking part in the process of legislating.

 2                MR. BOPP:      Well --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The person who requests a

 4   referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of

 5   signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in

 6   that.

 7                And in light of the fact that for the first

 8   century of our existence, even voting was public -- you

 9   either did it raising your hand or by voice, or later,

10   you had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so

11   that people knew which party you were voting for -- the

12   fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount

13   of civic courage.    And the First Amendment does not

14   protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls

15   when you exercise your political rights to legislate or

16   to take part in the legislative process.

17                MR. BOPP:      Well, the --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You are asking us to enter

19   into a whole new field where we've never gone before.

20                MR. BOPP:      Well, with all due respect, you

21   have already opined in Buckley II that the person on the

22   other side of the clipboard is protected by the First

23   Amendment.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I don't think that's --

25   that's true of Buckley II.            What was -- what this Court

 1   said could not be done is that the solicitor could not

 2   be made to wear a badge that says "I am a paid

 3   solicitor," but that the solicitor's name had to be

 4   identified for the State.           Certainly, the solicitor --

 5   there was an affidavit, and there was the filings with

 6   whatever was the State agency.

 7                 So what was -- what this Court said could

 8   not be done was this kind of in-your-face big button

 9   that says "I am a paid solicitor," but the solicitor's

10   name and address certainly had to be disclosed.

11                 MR. BOPP:     That is true.                You've correctly

12   described Buckley II.       But as we can see in the facts of

13   this case, the public disclosure of the petition names

14   in this case -- there was a planned harassment and

15   intimidation of these voters by --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, let me -- let me ask

17   you, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure

18   organize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose

19   managers had supported that boycott?

20                 MR. BOPP:     Yes.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Had supported that

22   initiative?

23                 MR. BOPP:     Yes.        Under the --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, if that's so,

25   then under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you

 1   didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so,

 2   then it seems to me that the State's -- or

 3   that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their

 4   names private is somewhat diminished.

 5                MR. BOPP:     Yes.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's a First Amendment

 7   activity.

 8                MR. BOPP:     But what we're -- but what is

 9   involved here that is not involved there is the

10   requirement by the government that you publicly disclose

11   your identity and beliefs on a matter that then --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But -- just --

13                MR. BOPP -- subjects you to the boycott.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let me stop you there,

15   because I think your -- your own brief, I think you said

16   twice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's

17   belief from the mere signature.               You said it could be

18   support for -- for the proposition or it could be just

19   support for letting the people decide.

20                MR. BOPP:     That is --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Or it could even be, you

22   say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to

23   placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we'll

24   just sign.   So you -- you have said that -- that

25   the signing itself is ambiguous.               You don't know what


                                       14

 1   the reason is.     It doesn't necessarily mean that the

 2   person is a supporter of the proposition.

 3                  MR. BOPP:     But, with all due respect, we

 4   did not say the third.         We did say the first and the

 5   second.     And -- but either of those are political

 6   statements.     The highlighted box at the top, you know,

 7   states -- states that by signing R-71, we can reverse that

 8   decision, meaning the passage of a law, and protect

 9   marriage between a man and a woman.

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            May I call your attention

11   to page 20 of your reply brief?                 Because I don't think

12   that your response was correct.                 You say:   Do petition

13   signers support the repeal, simply indicate they would

14   like public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid

15   any further discussion with the petition circulator?

16                  MR. BOPP:     I acknowledge that we said that,

17   Justice Ginsburg.     And, of course, the second statement

18   is -- and which I think is the dominant statement and

19   certainly sufficient -- and that is that we want a measure

20   to be placed on the ballot in order for the people to

21   vote.     That is one of the central --

22                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter --

23   if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is

24   satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that

25   person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum


                                         15

 1   to see whether the statute should be blocked?

 2               MR. BOPP:     I think it's very unlikely.              But

 3   it -- we acknowledge it's possible, but we think it's

 4   very unlikely.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:          It's possible --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          -- but if you were in the

 8   real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a

 9   referendum petition with respect to a statute that was

10   passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you

11   think would be opposed to that legislation?

12               MR. BOPP:     Very few.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And so Justice Alito's

14   question points out that this would be a very slim basis

15   upon which to rest a holding in your favor.

16               And just to go back to the line of questions

17   of the first, the State of California has very

18   complicated referendum and initiative matters.              Don't

19   you think it's relevant for the public to know that,

20   say, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put

21   those signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of

22   Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had

23   paid solicitors to put this on the ballot?

24               Isn't that part of assessing the -- the

25   reasons why this initiative was proposed?              And isn't


                                      16

 1   that vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an

 2   informed decision?

 3                  MR. BOPP:     Well, actually, after your

 4   Buckley II decision, the Ninth Circuit struck down the

 5   requirement of disclosing the paid circulators.                And, of

 6   course, in California, petitions are not public.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            They did that.   It wasn't

 8   due to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged,

 9   under Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed.

10                  MR. BOPP:     Well, the Ninth Circuit thought

11   it was Buckley.

12                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Correct me, but the point is,

13   isn't -- isn't there an interest in knowing this

14   information?     Not -- not that it's paid.

15                  MR. BOPP:     There is no evidence --

16                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           We'll leave that out.

17   But -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that

18   supported the amendment.

19                  MR. BOPP:     There's no evidence in the

20   record that that is pertinent information, and, at most,

21   we think it is marginal information.

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, if we create

23   this right of -- this constitutional right of

24   association in the manner that you are describing it,

25   why is it limited to the voting area?

 1                  Would we be inviting review if a group of

 2   citizens get together and send a letter to an agency

 3   that says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y

 4   regulation?     Would the agency be prohibited from making

 5   that letter public?

 6                  MR. BOPP:     Well, potentially.              And -- and

 7   this Court -- I -- because it would be required to be

 8   subject to a First Amendment analysis.                    It's this Court

 9   that created, in the NAACP case --

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So you're -- you're

11   suggesting --

12                  MR. BOPP:     -- the right of private

13   association.

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- that when a

15   petitioner or a person engages in political discourse

16   with the government, that they -- when they choose to do

17   it, because the government is not compelling them to

18   write to it; it's not compelling them to sign the

19   referendum.     It's just --

20                  MR. BOPP:     And they're not compelling

21   Ms. McIntyre to distribute her brochure, either.                    But

22   this Court held that --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But it's -- but

24   Ms. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its

25   process in her favor.        She was asking for political

 1   reform, but she wasn't asking to engage the government

 2   process on her behalf.

 3                MR. BOPP:     Well, the government, you know,

 4   has a lot of options.      For instance, they don't have to

 5   conduct elections for the election of judge.            But if

 6   they opt to do that and provide that procedure, well,

 7   then, the First Amendment applies to the political

 8   speech.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, to follow up on

10   Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency

11   could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a

12   proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and

13   your address and your telephone number and your

14   political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital

15   status and your income level and all sorts of other

16   demographic information?

17                MR. BOPP:     And your employer, as in this

18   case here.

19                JUSTICE ALITO:          Could they do that?

20                MR. BOPP:     No -- no, because there is no

21   sufficient governmental interest that would justify it.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Not even just your name, so

23   they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all

24   the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person?

25                MR. BOPP:     They, of course, can -- can check


                                       19

 1   that.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course, they can.   So

 3   they can get your name, right?

 4                 MR. BOPP:     Yes, they can get your name --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

 6                 MR. BOPP:     -- and we're not objecting to

 7   filing of a petition.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But you're objecting to

 9   the public being able to check whether the agency is

10   indeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or

11   not, correct?

12                 MR. BOPP:     No.       No, I'm not objecting to

13   that.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Really?

15                 MR. BOPP:     They have procedures to check and

16   verify these signatures that do not involve public

17   disclosure.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Didn't you have some

19   options, too?    Have you started a referendum to repeal

20   the -- the California law that requires disclosure?

21                 MR. BOPP:     California law does not require

22   disclosure of the petitions, and that has been upheld by

23   the courts of California.           And you can verify these

24   signatures.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't understand.    I

 1   thought that's what you're challenging.                 The --

 2              MR. BOPP:    Well, but you asked about

 3   California --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:        I'm sorry.            I'm sorry.

 5              MR. BOPP:    -- if I heard your question.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Washington.           I got the wrong State.

 7              MR. BOPP:    Okay.       It --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:        Can you go back --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:        The people of

10   Washington -- the people Washington evidently think that

11   this is not too much of an imposition upon people's

12   courage, to -- to stand up and sign something and be

13   willing to stand behind it.

14              MR. BOPP:    In a sense --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Now, if you don't like

16   that, I can see doing it another way.              But -- but the

17   people of Washington have chosen to do it this -- this

18   way.

19              MR. BOPP:    Actually, for --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:        And you're saying that the

21   First Amendment absolutely forbids that.

22              MR. BOPP:    Actually, for a century, they

23   chose not to do this.   It wasn't until 2006 --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:        That's fine.           Proving my

25   point.

 1                  MR. BOPP:     They did not publicly disclose

 2   the petitions for a century.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           It might have been a good

 4   idea.

 5                  MR. BOPP:     Well --

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I suppose the -- a

 7   majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and

 8   one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect

 9   minorities.

10                  MR. BOPP:     Well, only in the most general

11   sense.     They adopted a Public Records Act.                   They didn't

12   adopt a law that specifically required the disclosure of

13   these petitions.     But in a general sense, they did.

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Bopp, this is not a

15   peculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's

16   correct, isn't it?      Aren't there about 20-odd States

17   that require disclosure of the names of signers to

18   initiatives, referenda?

19                  MR. BOPP:     That is true.                Some -- some in

20   their initiative and referendum statute, because they

21   actually provide some public input on verification where

22   Washington does not; others under their Public Records

23   Act.     Some do not, such as California.

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So -- but what you're

25   saying with respect to Washington would go for most of


                                         22

 1   those other States that have -- that have public

 2   disclosure of initiative and referendum petitions.

 3                MR. BOPP:      Well, one -- one thing we say is

 4   different between Washington and these other States is

 5   that Washington provides no way for the public, even if

 6   they get access to the petitions, to participate in the

 7   verification process.

 8                The only thing the public can do is have --

 9   observe -- a limited number of observers.                These

10   observers are prohibited from --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought that there were

12   instances where the State official missed something and

13   a member of the public who had access to the list of

14   signers said:    Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my

15   neighbor who died 5 years ago.

16                MR. BOPP:      That's not allowed in the State

17   of Washington.    The instructions from the Secretary of

18   State is while you can have observers to observe the

19   process, the people --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you mean if -- that was

21   over.   It passed the screen of the Secretary of State.

22   It's disclosed to the public.              If someone then said

23   you've got a lot of dead souls on these lists, the State

24   would do nothing about it?

25                MR. BOPP:      There is absolutely no procedure

 1   under Washington statute to do anything with that

 2   information.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, we'll ask --

 4   we'll ask the --

 5               MR. BOPP:        Nothing.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               We'll ask the Attorney

 7   General of Washington.

 8               MR. BOPP:        Yes.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Weren't two of the

10   Petitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here

11   seeking the list so that they could go over the

12   certification process the State had done to ensure that

13   they had certified all the right people, et cetera?

14               MR. BOPP:        Well, one of -- one of the

15   intervenors sought an exception from the -- from the

16   injunction, which we did not object to, that -- that

17   they would have access to the list.                       But under

18   confidentiality and protective order --

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I'm not going to the

20   privacy questions.      You responded to Justice Ginsburg by

21   saying that there was no way to challenge the State's

22   process of validation, and that -- I don't think that's

23   correct.

24               MR. BOPP:        With all respect, I didn't say

25   that.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Oh.

 2                 MR. BOPP:      What I -- what I said is there's

 3   no role for the public in verifying signatures.                   You can

 4   ask for judicial review --

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That's assuming the

 6   answer, meaning if they don't have the right to access,

 7   they can't.    But, legally, they can challenge it if they

 8   find on the petitions that things were erroneously

 9   counted by the State.        They can go into court and prove

10   that.

11                 MR. BOPP:      The only thing that they could do

12   is request that the court does its own count.                   In other

13   words, there's judicial review available.                   But the

14   public has no role in the verification, but they can

15   trigger judicial review.           And then the court conducts

16   its own count.

17                 In other words, this is not an adversary

18   process in which people come in and present evidence

19   of -- of people's -- of invalid signatures.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why would you involve the

21   court?   If the State's -- the executive representative

22   of the State says:      Oh, we missed that.               Now we're going

23   to have to deal with it.           We don't need any court to

24   order us to do it.

25                 MR. BOPP:      Well, the observers can observe

 1   the process, and if they feel --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          No, this is after the

 3   observers.   This is --

 4                MR. BOPP:     Well, but --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          We're talking about a member of

 6   the public noticing that there are people on the list

 7   who shouldn't be there.

 8                MR. BOPP:     Well, the -- the observer --

 9   under the Washington procedure, observers can observe

10   the process, and if they feel, or if anyone feels,

11   that there has been an inadequate job in -- in

12   verification, then they can ask for judicial review.

13   And then the court conducts the --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Why would they ask for

15   judicial review instead of going first to the State's

16   Attorney General and saying, look, you -- your people

17   missed it?

18                MR. BOPP:     Well, there's no procedure for

19   that.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Why involve the court?

21                MR. BOPP:     That's not -- there's no

22   procedure for that.      You know, if they wanted to involve

23   the public -- and that's the difference, I said, between

24   this procedure and other procedures.                They're claiming

25   the need for public disclosure so the public can be

 1   involved in verification.          Well, there's no

 2   procedure --

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't there another --

 4               MR. BOPP:      -- to be involved in verification.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't there another

 6   possible public interest?          Would it be a legitimate public

 7   interest to say I'd like to know who signed the

 8   petition because I would like to try to persuade them

 9   that their views should be modified?

10               Is there a public interest in encouraging

11   debate on the underlying issue?

12               MR. BOPP:      Well, it's possible, but we think

13   this information is marginal.             In other words, the --

14   it's much more important --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, it does identify

16   people who have a -- a particular point of view on a

17   public issue.   And if you had the other point of view,

18   don't you have an interest in finding out who you'd

19   like to convince to change their minds?

20               MR. BOPP:      Well, we -- we think it's a -- a

21   very marginal interest.        The Ninth Circuit recently

22   ruled that if you give a small contribution to an

23   initiative, there's not -- I mean, nobody cares.              So why

24   should it be publicly disclosed when it's so marginal?

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about just -- just --

 1   what about just wanting to know their names so you can

 2   criticize them?

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 MR. BOPP:     Well --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is -- is that such a bad

 6   thing in a democracy?

 7                 MR. BOPP:     Well, what is bad is not the

 8   criticism; it's the public -- it's the government

 9   requiring you to disclose your identity and beliefs.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But part of the reason is

11   so you can be out there and be responsible for the

12   positions you've taken.

13                 MR. BOPP:     Well, then why don't they require

14   both sides?

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So that people -- people

16   can criticize you for the position you have taken.

17                 MR. BOPP:     Then why don't they require both

18   sides if that was the purpose?

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What do you mean, "both

20   sides"?   The other side hasn't signed anything.            When they

21   sign something --

22                 (Laughter.)

23                 MR. BOPP:     Well, but the other side --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           When they sign something,

25   they'll be out there for public criticism as well.

 1               MR. BOPP:     Okay.        But this is a one-way

 2   street.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, this is such a

 4   touchy-feely, oh, so sensitive about -- about any --

 5               (Laughter.)

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You know, you can't run a

 7   democracy this way, with everybody being afraid of

 8   having his political positions known.

 9               MR. BOPP:     I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, but

10   the campaign manager of this initiative had his family

11   sleep in his living room because of the threats --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, then that's --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that's bad.       The

14   threats should be moved against vigorously --

15               MR. BOPP:     And -- and --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- but just because there

17   can be criminal activity doesn't mean that you --

18   you have to eliminate a procedure that is

19   otherwise perfectly reasonable.

20               MR. BOPP:     But all we're asking for is a

21   First Amendment analysis of the compelled disclosure of

22   the identity of these people and whether or not these

23   interests are sufficient.

24               Could I reserve the balance of my time?

 1                  General McKenna.

 2             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M. McKENNA

 3                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 4                  MR. McKENNA:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 5   it please the Court:

 6                  I'd like to begin with the question of

 7   how the public can bring to the attention of the

 8   government that errors and fraud have been discovered.

 9                  First of all, it's important to understand

10   that the petitions do not become public records after

11   the verification process but, in fact, are made available

12   as public records before the verification process even

13   begins.

14                  This is because the Secretary of State's

15   first step after receiving submitted petitions is to

16   take them to his archiving section and to have them

17   digitized.     As soon as they're digitized, they're

18   available on disks for anyone who requests them.                Then

19   the verification process begins.

20                  During the verification process, it is

21   possible --

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How much time are we

23   talking about in those processes?

24                  MR. McKENNA:        The verification process,

25   Justice Sotomayor?


                                         30

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Yes.

 2                  MR. McKENNA:        The verification process

 3   will depend on how many signatures have been

 4   submitted --

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             No, no, no.      I'm trying

 6   to get the relationship between the disks being made

 7   available and the verification process.

 8                  So is there a time for the public to look

 9   through the disks before the people who are sent into

10   the room are sent into the room?

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's what you've just

12   said --

13                  MR. McKENNA:        Yes, they're --

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- that they're --

15   that they are immediately available on the disk, and

16   so while the checking is going on by the Secretary,

17   the public has the list.           Is that what you've just said?

18                  MR. McKENNA:        Yes, that's correct.            For

19   example, in the case of Referendum 71, the proponents of

20   the referendum submitted the petition sheets on

21   Saturday, July 25, 2009, and on Tuesday, July 28, a

22   records request was already submitted.                    And so they

23   can obtain records --

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Would these

25   records --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Was that pursuant to the

 2   Public Records Act that we're talking about --

 3               MR. McKENNA:        Yes.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- or was that part of the

 5   initiative and referendum structure before the Public

 6   Records Act was passed?

 7               MR. McKENNA:        Justice Kennedy, this is

 8   part of the Public Records Act.              This is as a result of

 9   the Public Records Act that these petition sheets are

10   made available.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel --

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So -- all right.        So

13   this -- the public record -- pardon me.                The -- in

14   California, we call it an initiative and referendum

15   process -- existed and was in place before the Public

16   Records Act added this additional feature of disclosure?

17               MR. McKENNA:        Yes, that's correct.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So there was a judgment at

19   one time by the State of Washington that it didn't --

20   that it didn't need the public records disclosure?

21               MR. McKENNA:        Well, when the initiative

22   and referendum processes were created by public vote on

23   a constitutional amendment of 1912, there was no

24   Public Records Act at all.          And the Public Records Act,

25   an Act of general applicability, was adopted by the


                                      32

 1   voters in 1973 as part of an initiative which also

 2   enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, if the

 4   State had a law that you could disclose voters and for

 5   whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment

 6   interests?

 7                 MR. McKENNA:        Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we

 8   would -- we do believe that First Amendment interests

 9   would be implicated by revealing how people voted, and

10   we don't see a legitimate State interest in knowing how

11   people voted, only in who voted.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So the country was acting

13   unconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted

14   the Australian secret ballot?              Do you really think that?

15                 MR. McKENNA:        No.      No, Justice Scalia.        I --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That it was

17   unconstitutional --

18                 MR. McKENNA:        No, Justice Scalia.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- for a whole century

20   not to have a secret ballot?

21                 MR. McKENNA:        No, Justice Scalia, I

22   didn't say that I thought that the secret ballot was

23   constitutionally required.            I was asked by the Chief

24   Justice whether some First Amendment interests would be

25   implicated.    They probably would be.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What would the First

 2   Amendment interests be?

 3               MR. McKENNA:        Well, the First Amendment

 4   interest in how you vote?

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

 6               MR. McKENNA:        You know, it might be

 7   implicated by a potential chill from voting, if you know

 8   your vote is going to be revealed.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you think having

10   your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have

11   a chilling effect on whether you sign it?

12               MR. McKENNA:        Mr. Chief Justice, some

13   chill may result, just as some chill may result from

14   having your campaign contributions disclosed or the

15   fact that you have registered to vote and provided your

16   name, address, your voting history is being disclosed.

17   So some chill might be -- might result, but we do not

18   think that it is significant enough.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You don't think

20   revealing that you're a voter has the same chilling

21   effect as revealing how you voted, do you?

22               MR. McKENNA:        No, I do not.            I think how

23   you voted would have a much greater chilling effect than

24   the fact that you are registered to vote.

25               And -- and, of course, this Court has not

 2   constitutional right.       If -- if it is, then is town hall

 3   voting in New England unconstitutional?                  Is the caucus

 4   system in Iowa for presidential candidates

 5   unconstitutional?    The Court in this case does not

 6   have --

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:           -- in the last questions --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought you

 9   told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated

10   with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't

11   require people to reveal how they voted.

12                MR. McKENNA:         We don't -- we don't know

13   if this Court would rule that the vote could never be

14   revealed.    We know that in some places, votes are done

15   in public.   We know that before the late 1800s, there

16   was no secret ballot.       We just -- we don't know what the

17   constitutional ruling would be.                But we -- we do know

18   that in this case, it's not necessary for the Court to

19   reach that -- that determination, because in this

20   case --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, I'd like to know

22   how far you -- you are -- you want to go.                  You say in

23   your brief that the availability of the referendum

24   signature petitions allows Washington voters to engage

25   in discussion of referred measures with persons whose

 1   acts secured the election and suspension of State law.

 2                So would -- would it be consistent with the

 3   First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition

 4   to put down not just the person's name and address, but

 5   also telephone number, so that they could be engaged in

 6   a conversation about what they had done?

 7                MR. McKENNA:         It -- it would depend on

 8   the strength of the State interest in having the

 9   telephone number.    The State does not have an interest

10   in the telephone number on the petition form, because

11   the State has -- only needs to know from the petition

12   form the name and the address in order to verify --

13                JUSTICE ALITO:           I thought that you were

14   saying that one of the interests that's served by this

15   is to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens

16   to discuss this matter with those who signed the

17   petition.   So putting down the telephone number would

18   assist them in doing that.

19                MR. McKENNA:         It -- yes, it probably

20   would make it easier for people to contact.

21                JUSTICE ALITO:           So you would --

22                MR. McKENNA:         But the policy --

23
           JUSTICE ALITO: You would endorse that?
24               MR. McKENNA: That would be a policy

25   determination for the legislature to make,

 1   Justice Alito.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:             No, I'm not asking the

 3   policy question.     I'm asking whether the First Amendment

 4   would permit that.

 5               MR. McKENNA:           I believe it could permit

 6   that, yes, Justice Alito.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:             Now, one of your

 8   Co-Respondents says that supplying this information

 9   provides insight whether support comes predominantly

10   from members of particular political or religious

11   organizations.

12               Would it be consistent with the First

13   Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to

14   list the person's religion?

15               MR. McKENNA:           No, I do not believe it

16   would, Justice Alito.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              Suppose that in 1957 in

18   Little Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted

19   to put on the ballot a petition to require the school

20   board to reopen Central High School, which had been

21   closed because there was a sentiment in the community

22   that they didn't want integration.                   And it was pointed

23   out that if they signed this petition, there was a very

24   good chance that their businesses would be bombed, that

25   they would certainly be boycotted, that their children


                                         37

 1   might be harassed.

 2                  Now, is there no First Amendment right in

 3   protecting those people?           And if there is, how does it

 4   differ from your case?

 5                  MR. McKENNA:        Justice Breyer, that is

 6   count 2.     That is count 2 of the Petitioners'

 7   complaint.     This Court ruled as recently as Citizens

 8   United that such situations should be evaluated on a

 9   case-by-case basis to evaluate the reasonable

10   probability of threats, harassments, and reprisals.                  But

11   that --

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           So you -- you would have no

13   objection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the

14   names of individuals to a particular cause, where it is

15   demonstrated that the opponents of that cause are

16   violent and will do violence to the people who signed

17   the petition?

18                  MR. McKENNA:        Yes, Justice Scalia.       That

19   would be the Socialist Workers Party case.                This -- this

20   Court has ruled that, on a case-by-case basis, it is

21   possible that some information otherwise disclosed --

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What about a business

23   boycott?

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           So this is just a general

25   challenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition

 1   signers?

 2                  MR. McKENNA:        Of any type of petition

 3   including nominating petitions --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 5                  MR. McKENNA:        -- initiative petitions,

 6   and the rest.

 7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What about a business

 8   boycott?     Suppose that were a -- a likely outcome of

 9   disclosing the name?

10                  MR. McKENNA:        Well, of course, boycotts

11   have been upheld under the First Amendment in Claiborne

12   Hardware, and so if someone wanted to boycott a business

13   because it turned out that the manager of the business

14   had been a supporter of a particular ballot measure,

15   that would be allowable, of course, to that person

16   choosing to boycott.

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, your answer

18   to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied

19   challenge.     Now, that as-applied challenge would be

20   small comfort unless the names were protected pending

21   the resolution of that challenge, correct?

22                  MR. McKENNA:        Yes.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you think a stay

24   should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners

25   to pursue an as-applied challenge.

 1               MR. McKENNA:         Yes, of course -- yes,

 2   they could apply for another preliminary injunction if

 3   this Court upholds the court of appeals.                 They were able

 4   to obtain that preliminary injunction in this case,

 5   which is why these petition forms have not been released

 6   to date, except under a protective order by the court to

 7   the opponents.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that would --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you think that

10   the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of

11   their as-applied challenge, would subject them to

12   incidents of violence and intimidation?

13               MR. McKENNA:         We -- there is no evidence

14   of that in the record.       There's no evidence --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Does -- is it --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 There's no

17   evidence -- there's no evidence of episodes of violence

18   or intimidation?

19               MR. McKENNA:         Involving the

20   Referendum 71 signers?       No.       The evidence in the record

21   is about people who were out circulating petitions,

22   people who were out, you know, campaigning for the

23   petitions, the campaign manager for the measure.                 But

24   none of the evidence in the record speaks to petition

25   signers, and none of the evidence in the record speaks


                                       40

 1   to petition signers for other, similar measures which

 2   were cited by the Petitioners.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is that because nobody

 4   got to count 2?     And the district court -- this whole

 5   case in the lower courts was on count 1 alone; wasn't

 6   that so?

 7                 MR. McKENNA:         Yes, that is -- yes, that

 8   is correct.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And count 2 is the one

10   that deals with the harassment.

11                 MR. McKENNA:         That is true,

12   Justice Ginsburg.     Of course, in several other States,

13   Arkansas, Florida, and Massachusetts, which had similar

14   measures regarding gay civil rights or same-sex marriage

15   on the ballot -- in those three States, the petition

16   forms were obtained under public records, were put on

17   the Internet, and no evidence has been provided that's

18   in the record that anyone who signed any of those

19   petitions in those three States was subjected to

20   harassment --

21                 JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, let's say somebody is

22   thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive

23   subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from

24   signing because they fear retaliation.                    At what point

25   could they bring this as-applied challenge?


                                         41

 1               Do they have to -- could they do it before

 2   they even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that

 3   if -- if these names -- if people are not assured ahead

 4   of time that their name and address is not going to be

 5   revealed to the public on the Internet, they're not

 6   going to sign this?

 7               MR. McKENNA:        Justice Alito, it would be

 8   possible procedurally for them to bring the motion for

 9   an injunction even before collecting the signatures --

10               JUSTICE ALITO:          And how would they --

11               MR. McKENNA:        -- if they had sufficient

12   evidence.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          How would they prove that

14   there's -- that there's a -- a threat, a sufficient

15   threat of harassment in that particular case, before the

16   petition is even signed?

17               MR. McKENNA:        I believe that the

18   sponsors of the measure would bring to the court

19   evidence, if they have any, of -- because of the

20   controversial nature of that particular measure, that is

21   based on what's happened to some of the people who were

22   planning to put the measure on the ballot.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But -- but you -- you've

24   rejected that here.     You've said there's no evidence here

25   that any of the petition -- petition signers were


                                      42

 1   subjected to any harassment.

 2                  MR. McKENNA:        Right.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course there isn't,

 4   because the names haven't gotten out yet.                 How could you

 5   possibly demonstrate before the names get out that

 6   petition signers are going to be subjected to

 7   harassment?

 8                  MR. McKENNA:        One could look to --

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Or otherwise, don't insist

10   upon evidence that these very petition signers will be

11   harassed.

12                  MR. McKENNA:        I imagine, Justice Scalia,

13   that the individuals moving for that preliminary

14   injunction would do what the Petitioners have done in

15   this case.     They would cite to an example from another

16   State involving a comparable measure.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you think that would be

18   an acceptable type of evidence?

19                  MR. McKENNA:        They could bring it into the

20   court.   I'm not saying the court would accept it,

21   because I don't know --

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, if you don't think

23   it's acceptable, then -- then -- then you're not making

24   an argument.

25                  MR. McKENNA:        Justice Scalia, I didn't


                                         43

 1   say it couldn't be acceptable.             I'm saying this is a

 2   hypothetical, so I don't know what the evidence would

 3   look like in the hypothetical example.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, the -- the

 5   hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated,

 6   the supporters came into court, and they said:                    Look what

 7   has happened in California with -- with Proposition 8.

 8   Don't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public

 9   disclosure of the names and addresses here.

10               Would that be sufficient?

11               MR. McKENNA:        Justice Alito, I think

12   that the evidence would have to be very strong.                    It

13   would have to rise above criticism.                    I think it would

14   have to rise to the level of threatened violence.                       It

15   would have to rise to the level of the Socialist Workers

16   Party case, for example, or the NAACP case.

17               I think the standard would be very high.

18   But it would be up to the trial judge to decide whether

19   or not the evidence was sufficient to issue the

20   preliminary injunction.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is it -- the State has

22   had this procedure now for some time, and there have

23   been controversial ballot initiatives.                    Is there any

24   history in the State of Washington that signers have

25   been subject to harassment?

 1                MR. McKENNA:        There has not,

 2   Justice Ginsburg, and that's even though a half a dozen

 3   initiatives on a variety of topics have been released.

 4   Another half dozen are pending.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What -- what's the

 6   most sensitive similar petition for a referendum?

 7                MR. McKENNA:        There has been no measure

 8   on domestic partner benefits or same-sex marriage in

 9   Washington State --

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, but what's the --

11                MR. McKENNA:        -- but there are other --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What's -- what's

13   the other one that's going to get people -- that's the

14   most controversial public issue?

15                MR. McKENNA:        Justice --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Proposition 8?

17                MR. McKENNA:        Well --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I'm talking

19   about in Washington, counsel.

20                MR. McKENNA:        In Washington State.

21   Mr. Chief Justice, we have had measures on assisted

22   suicide, for example, which was very controversial,

23   and -- and there's no evidence involving that set of

24   petitions.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Was the referendum


                                       45

 1   in favor or opposed to assisted suicide?

 2                MR. McKENNA:        It was -- well, the

 3   referendum challenges the assisted suicide law.            So if

 4   you vote for the referendum, you vote to uphold the

 5   legislature's adoption of that law, which -- which

 6   allowed assisted suicide.

 7                So there have been controversial measures.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           This case will likely be

 9   controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because

10   that's the most fully developed.

11                Did you look at the Petition Clause at all?

12   In the early days of the republic, the petitions were

13   the way in which you communicated with your legislator.

14                MR. McKENNA:        Yes.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And I tried to look it up.

16   I have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those

17   petitions were sometimes put in the Congressional

18   Record.   But did you look at the history of the Petition

19   Clause?

20                MR. McKENNA:        Justice Kennedy, we have

21   considered the history of the Petition Clause, and we

22   see a basic difference between the kinds of petitions

23   under the Petition Clause and the petitions at issue

24   here because, essentially, petitioning the government

 1   something.   You're petitioning them:                     Please do

 2   something.

 3                The petitions for a referendum or an

 4   initiative are telling the government to do something.

 5   The petition form says that I, the signer, am directing

 6   the Secretary of State to conduct an election.                        And by

 7   submitting these petitions in a referendum, I am

 8   suspending the law which the legislature has already

 9   approved until the election has taken place.

10                Tell versus ask.             I think that's a pretty

11   big -- a significant difference.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But, of course, that can

13   cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a

14   vote.   And there -- there is strong interest in keeping

15   the -- the vote private.

16                MR. McKENNA:          And, Justice Kennedy, I'd

17   like to speak to that question, because several

18   Justices asked:   Well, what can we tell from what, you

19   know, someone who signed?            Do we know how they're going

20   to vote.

21                I -- I agree that many people signing a

22   petition are going to vote in favor of -- in the case of

23   an initiative, in favor of the law the initiative would

24   put on the ballot.      But also we know from the social

25   science research, which is cited, for example, in the


                                         47

 1   Direct Democracy Scholars green brief, that many people

 2   sign simply because they believe it's important for

 3   the -- for the public to have an opportunity to vote.

 4   And, of course, as the Petitioners have acknowledged and

 5   we also point out, some people vote just to get around the

 6   circulator and get into the store.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What percentage --

 8   what percentage of the people who signed this petition

 9   to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it

10   because they think these sort of things should be

11   generally put to a public vote as opposed to because

12   they opposed the law?

13               MR. McKENNA:        The percentage of people

14   who believe simply that there should be a vote held has

15   not been quantified by the research, except that several

16   scholars indicate that it is significant.                 So, whether

17   it's 20 percent or 40 percent, I -- I really can't say

18   within a certain --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You think as much as

20   20 percent of the people who signed this petition are

21   actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?

22               MR. McKENNA:        It is possible.           But it's

23   also possible some of those 20 percent don't have an

24   opinion on the law, Mr. Chief Justice.                 They simply

25   think that there should be a vote held, and they'll

 1   make their mind up later on.

 2                  There are plenty of people who aren't aware

 3   when certain laws are -- are adopted that are subjected

 4   to a referendum, and they may not have decided at all.

 5   In fact, one of the reasons they may sign the petition

 6   is to say:     Well, I'm not sure how I'm going to vote,

 7   but, you know, I think a public vote would be a good

 8   idea.     So, I'm going to let it go forward to be on the

 9   ballot, and I'll decide.

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Can I ask you this question?

11   It seems to me your -- the strongest State interest here

12   is detecting fraud.       And you mentioned that the records

13   are digitized.     And maybe you can correct my impression

14   of this, but it seems to me that if the records are

15   digitized, there are very simple ways of detecting fraud

16   that would not require the disclosure of the list to the

17   public.

18                  If somebody wants to see whether his or her

19   name has been fraudulently put on the list, wouldn't it

20   be very simple to set up a Web site where the person

21   could put in a little bit of identifying information and

22   see whether that person's name is on the list?             And if

23   the -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person

24   lives at a particular address, couldn't you just

25   cross-reference by means of a computer program the


                                         49

 1   information on the referendum with the -- with the

 2   voting lists?

 3               So if you've got John Jones who lives at 10

 4   Main Street, you see whether there really is a

 5   registered voter John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street?

 6   Why does this all have to be put out on the Internet?

 7               MR. McKENNA:        Justice Alito, the -- just

 8   to be clear, you are right.           They do use computer --

 9   computers because when -- in the verification process,

10   the Secretary of State's staff, with the observers looking

11   over their shoulder, will look at the petition and look

12   up that voter in an -- in an electronic voter

13   registration database.

14               This is exactly why the information is so

15   useful to the public as well.            They have access to

16   electronic online voter registration history as well,

17   and they can also check.

18               In -- in Massachusetts, under their public

19   records law in 2006, petition forms obtained by public

20   records requests were put online, and over 2,000 people,

21   as has been documented in the Lambda amicus brief,

22   discovered that they -- their names are on petitions

23   that they claimed did not sign, and discovered that they

24   had been, in some cases, misled.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what's the answer to


                                      50

 1   my question?    Couldn't you -- couldn't this be done very

 2   simply?   If I want to see whether somebody has

 3   fraudulently signed my name, very quickly go to a

 4   Web site, wouldn't be expensive to set up, put in your

 5   voter ID number, and see whether -- and your name, and

 6   see whether you're on the -- on the --

 7                 MR. McKENNA:        Yes.

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:          -- whether you --

 9   somebody signed your name to the petition?

10                 MR. McKENNA:        Yes, Justice Alito,

11   that -- that could be done.             In our State and the

12   other States that's done when somebody requests the public

13   records and chooses them to put online.                  The State

14   doesn't -- does not put the petition forms online

15   itself, although, you know, other information is put

16   online by the State.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do -- do we take this case

18   on the assumption -- do you make the contention before

19   us that the Secretary of State and those who assist it

20   are not capable of determining whether the petition

21   signatures are valid?

22                 MR. McKENNA:        No, we are not taking

23   that position, Justice Kennedy.                Of course --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean without public

25   disclosure?

 1                MR. McKENNA:        What we know,

 2   Justice Kennedy, is that in dozens of States around

 3   the -- around the country, as recently as 2009 in

 4   Maryland, 2006 in Massachusetts, and so on, it was

 5   the -- it was the public who requested ballot petitions

 6   by public records request who found significant fraud

 7   and error.   This isn't just about fraud -- fraud is very

 8   important -- it's also about finding plain old mistakes

 9   which the State, Secretary of State, or auditor has

10   missed.

11                That -- that does happen with regularity in

12   this country, and we cite cases in our brief where error

13   is not fraud, but errors in Washington State have been

14   discovered by people who look at these public records.

15   And --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Sometimes the public may

17   not trust the Secretary of State.

18                MR. McKENNA:        Yes, sir.              Justice Scalia,

19   we agree.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It -- it may be an issue in

21   which his administration has taken a particularly firm

22   stand, and the public may not trust the job that the

23   Secretary of State does.

24                MR. McKENNA:        That goes to the heart to

25   the Public Records Act, Justice Scalia:                     Trust but

 1   verify.    The people did not leave to the State the idea

 2   that, well, we'll let you know what you need to know.

 3   The people want a --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Trust but verify -- I like

 5   that.

 6                 (Laughter.)

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You did say something

 8   about this category of speech.                You said, well, this is

 9   in the category that -- it's like O'Brien.                  It has speech

10   elements and non-speech elements.                  And I was trying to

11   figure out which -- what is it in the signature that

12   speaks and what is it in the signature that doesn't

13   speak?

14                 MR. McKENNA:         The speech element could

15   be construed in the fact that someone has chosen to sign

16   a petition which we know means they want something to be

17   put on the ballot.      So, they favor having it on the

18   ballot.    That -- that much we know.

19                 But we also looked to Burdick, of course,

20   because in this -- in -- in the Burdick decision this

21   Court held that write-in voting could be prohibited by

22   the State of Hawaii.        That was upheld by the court of

23   appeals and this Court.          And this Court found that

24   writing in a candidate's name was not even expressive

25   conduct.

 1               So we look to the Burdick level of

 2   intermediate scrutiny, to the O'Brien level of

 3   intermediate scrutiny for the test.

 4               Justice Ginsburg, the other point I wanted

 5   to bring up is something about Buckley II, which --

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, what is the -- to finish

 7   your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the

 8   non-speech component of signing a petition?

 9               MR. McKENNA:           The non-speech component

10   is suspension of law in the case of a referendum or the

11   legislative effect.       We believe this is a legislative

12   act fundamentally.      In --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:             And what's the State's interest

14   in regulating the non-speech component?                   When you --

15   when you talk about the vote cast by an elected

16   representative, of course, there's a strong interest in

17   knowing how an elected representative voted, because the

18   representative is answerable to the voters.                   But

19   somebody who signs a petition isn't answerable to

20   anybody -- any other citizen.               So what's your interest?

21               MR. McKENNA:           The interest, Justice

22   Alito, is knowing, first of all, that there were a

23   sufficient number of signatures submitted to qualify the

24   measure for the ballot.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:             It's the fraud interest?


                                         54

 1                  MR. McKENNA:        That's the fraud interest.

 2                  And, secondly, there is a valid informational

 3   interest in knowing who is it exactly who's calling for

 4   this election and suspending the --

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, but how far does that

 6   go?     When I asked whether you could -- you want to know

 7   the religion of the people who signed, no, you can't do

 8   that.    How much more demographic information could be

 9   -- could be -- does the -- does the State of

10   Washington have an interest in making publicly available

11   about the people who support this election?

12                  Let's say it's -- it's a referendum about

13   immigration.     Does the State of Washington have an

14   interest in providing information to somebody who says

15   I want to know how many people with Hispanic names

16   signed this, or how many people with Asian names signed

17   this?     Is that -- that what you want to facilitate?

18                  MR. McKENNA:        No, Justice Alito, we

19   don't need to know that.           We need to know whether there

20   were a sufficient number of registered voters who

21   signed -- we need to know whether they signed more than

22   once.     We need to know they are registered in Washington

23   State.

24                  Informational interest I think that you could

25   -- the information you could collect to satisfy


                                         55

 1   informational interest might include other information

 2   that's in the voter registration records.                      You might

 3   want to know --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought one of the

 5   reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have

 6   information that would allow them to participate in the

 7   civic process, and there are people who -- might think

 8   it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested

 9   by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group

10   or not.   So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief

11   would say the State has an interest in that type of

12   disclosure.

13                 MR. McKENNA:        I don't see what the valid

14   State interest would be of knowing the ethnicity of the

15   person.   I mean, of course, anyone could look at the

16   petition ballot forms and, I suppose, divine something about

17   the ethnicity based on the last name, but the State's

18   interest doesn't go -- go to that.                  That we -- we

19   don't believe we need to know that.                      We believe we need

20   to know what is requested -- required on the -- on the

21   petition form.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Then I don't understand what

23   information is being -- what information you think you're

24   providing to the public.          Outside of the fraud area,

25   if I see that John Jones from Seattle signed this


                                        56

 1   petition, that tells me absolutely nothing.

 2                MR. McKENNA:       Well, Justice Alito, it

 3   might -- if you know John Jones, that would tell you

 4   something.   Number two, we know from the -- we know from

 5   the, you know, Direct Democracy Scholars green brief

 6   that intermediaries and especially the press and

 7   sometimes social science researchers and others will --

 8   will look at the names, and they'll be able to tell,

 9   for example, that a large number of employees at one

10   company signed a measure; maybe it's a measure that would cut

11   a tax break for a particular industry.                   Or perhaps members

12   of a union, in large numbers, have signed.                  They have been --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How can they --

14                MR. McKENNA:       -- able to provide

15   that information.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How can they find that out

17   with just the name and address, that a large number of people

18   from a company signed it?

19                MR. McKENNA:       Well --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You don't have to

21   put on who you work for, do you?

22                MR. McKENNA:       No, you do not.            I'm

23   saying intermediaries might discover this, for example,

24   by taking a close look at who's paying for the

25   signature gathering.     If it's paid signature gathering,

 1   they might be aware of prominent sponsors.                   In fact,

 2   the -- the importance of knowing who the sponsors is, is

 3   demonstrated --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I'm sorry.   I'm still

 5   on the companies.     How -- how does knowing who the

 6   sponsors are tell you how many people from a particular

 7   company signed the petition?

 8               MR. McKENNA:           Well, a voter who -- who

 9   works at that same company or does business with that

10   same company might know that, gosh, I know these

11   employees, and they've -- they have all signed this

12   petition.   The press might be able to do the research to

13   find that out.    Intermediaries do play an important role.

14               The last point, if I may, I wanted to make

15   about -- about Buckley II is that the Petitioners have

16   stressed that Buckley II struck down the requirement to wear

17   the name badge.     But in that same decision this Court

18   upheld the requirement by Colorado that affidavits

19   signed by the petition circulators, including the

20   petition circulator's name and address, can be disclosed

21   as public records.

22               And the Court ruled that -- found that and

23   compared it favorably to the badge requirement because

24   the disclosures of public record occurred after the heat

25   of the moment, after the moment of interactive discussion.

 1   It happened later on.       And we believe, of all the Court's

 2   rulings, that -- that approval of the disclosure requirement

 3   of the -- of the affidavit, in contrast to the badges, is the

 4   most similar to requiring after the fact or allowing

 5   after the fact for petitions to be disclosed under the

 6   Public Records Act.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:          You know, if somebody called

 8   your office and said I'd like the -- the home

 9   address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney

10   General's Office because we want to -- we want to go to

11   their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with

12   them --

13                (Laughter.)

14                JUSTICE ALITO:          -- which is what has been

15   alleged here, would you release that information?

16                MR. McKENNA:        We would not, Justice

17   Alito.    We would not release it because they can come to

18   the office and have uncomfortable conversations with

19   them --

20                (Laughter.)

21                MR. McKENNA:        -- which I can personally

22   attest happens with some regularity.

23                (Laughter.)

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Isn't that information, at

25   least the names of those people -- isn't it probably

 1   public information anyway?

 2                  MR. McKENNA:        Yes, it is,

 3   Justice Scalia.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can it be obtained under

 5   the Freedom of Information Act in this case?

 6                  MR. McKENNA:        Yes, it can.           Their names,

 7   their office locations, their office phone numbers,

 8   their office e-mails is all a matter of public record in

 9   our State.

10                  Thank you very much.

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, General

12   McKenna.

13                  Mr. Bopp, you have 2 minutes remaining.

14                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,

15                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16                  MR. BOPP:     Thank you.            First a clarification

17   of what we sought in the preliminary injunction.                    We

18   were -- we sought to base our preliminary injunction on

19   both count 1 and count 2.            Of course, the district

20   court and the Ninth Circuit did not reach -- in either

21   case -- reach count 2.

22                  Secondly, with respect to whether or not

23   there's any conduct here, I don't think signing a

24   written statement is conduct.               And, of course, by signing

25   the statement, the person is adopting the statement on


                                         60

 1   the petition, one of which involves their preference on

 2   the referendum, and the second is the -- the request

 3   that the matter goes on the ballot.                      And, of course, it has

 4   no legal effect unless 122,000 make the same political

 5   statement.

 6                Third, evidence of harassment comes in,

 7   as in Citizens United, because the weight of the

 8   interest that is required depends upon the burden of the

 9   First Amendment -- to the First Amendment speech

10   involved; and this Court specifically referred in

11   Citizens United to the lack of evidence of harassment of

12   the donors that might occur if they were disclosed

13   through the reports which Citizens United upheld.

14                Here we do have evidence of harassment, and

15   we believe that that requires a greater burden in the

16   First Amendment analysis --

17                JUSTINE GINSBURG:             But that's out of the

18   case up till now.    That's count 2.                You put it in your

19   pleading, but it wasn't reached by the court.

20                MR. BOPP:      Actually not.                Many is the case --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So everybody agrees

22   that that's still in the case.

23                MR. BOPP:      Yes, but it is relevant to count

24   1.   Bates, for instance, looked to the evidence of

25   harassment in protecting the membership list of the


                                        61

 1   NAACP from disclosure.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The court did not rule on

 3   whether there was a risk of harassment here.

 4               MR. BOPP:     Well, that --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It dealt only with count 1.

 6               MR. BOPP:     That is -- that is true, Your Honor.

 7   There are -- there were several First Amendment claims

 8   made -- made under count 1, and this decision was --

 9   was based on other claims.

10              I see my time is up.               Thank you. 


11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr. Bopp. 


12              The case is submitted.
