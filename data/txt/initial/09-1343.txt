 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 09-1343, J. McIntyre

 5   Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro.

 6               Mr. Fergenson.

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR F. FERGENSON

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. FERGENSON:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11               Because J. McIntyre did not direct any

12   activity at residents of New Jersey either itself or by

13   directing its distributor MMA to do so and had no

14   awareness or knowledge that the distributor took the

15   action that it did toward New Jersey, New Jersey lacked

16   adjudicative jurisdiction.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              When you say "its

18   distributor," was this distributor at all controlled by

19   the defendant?

20               MR. FERGENSON:             No, Your Honor.           It was not.

21   And both under Ohio law, Wells v. Komatsu America, and

22   under the Restatement (Second) Agency, section 1(1), the

23   right to control is essential to ascribe actions to

24   create an agency, and it's on a per-purpose basis.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It might be better to refer
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                          4
 1   to it as the company that distributed its product,

 2   rather than calling it "its distributor."

 3                MR. FERGENSON:            Very good, Your Honor.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's loaded, it seems to

 5   me.

 6                MR. FERGENSON:            Very good, Your Honor.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Fergenson, in your

 8   question presented to this Court, you ask whether

 9   there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -

10   "solely because the manufacturer targets the United

11   States market for the sale of its product."

12                So I'm taking from that, that you

13   acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British

14   manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the

15   sale of its product.       That's correct, yes?

16                MR. FERGENSON:            Your Honor, that's what the

17   New Jersey Supreme Court held, and that's how we

18   fashioned the -

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:            That's your question

20   presented.

21                MR. FERGENSON:            -- the test.

22                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Did this -- well, I'll just

23   ask you, then:    Did this manufacturer target the United

24   States market?    Did it want to sell its products in the

25   United States?

 1                 MR. FERGENSON:           Yes, Your Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           Okay.            So what does that

 3   mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson?                Because the United States

 4   is the United States.        It's made up of 50 States.                    So I

 5   assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted

 6   to sell its products in each of the 50 States.                          Is that

 7   right?

 8                 MR. FERGENSON:           No, Your Honor.

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           It only wanted to sell its

10   product in a few States?

11                 MR. FERGENSON:           No, Your Honor.               It wanted

12   to sell its product anywhere that the distributor could

13   find.    The distributor was the market manager.

14                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           Right.            Anywhere.     So if the

15   distributor came up with California, that was great.                             If

16   the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey,

17   that was great.    As many as possible, more the better,

18   all over the United States.              Is that right?

19                 MR. FERGENSON:           As many as possible,

20   wherever the -- the distributor could find a customer,

21   yes, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           Exactly.            So you targeted

23   New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New

24   York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else.

25                 MR. FERGENSON:           Well --

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:            You targeted the entire

 2   United States.   Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in

 3   each of the States you targeted?

 4               MR. FERGENSON:            Well, Your Honor, because,

 5   first, this Court's jurisprudence looks to a direct act,

 6   from World-Wide Volkswagen and even before, as it

 7   brought forward Hanson.         As this Court has applied

 8   World-Wide Volkswagen, Burger King and Justice

 9   O'Connor's concurrence in Asahi and the other

10   occurrence -- concurrence, Justice Brennan's concurrence

11   in Asahi, look toward a specific State -

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Fergenson, I suppose

13   you could say the same thing about any United States

14   manufacturer -

15               MR. FERGENSON:            Yes.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- who would desire to sell

17   his product in any of the States that would buy it.

18               MR. FERGENSON:            Yes, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And to say that this

20   foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State

21   would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in

22   any State, which -

23               MR. FERGENSON:            Yes, Your Honor.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- none of our cases hold.

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, suable in any State

 1   where the incident arises.            This is not general

 2   jurisdiction.   This is specific jurisdiction.                So the

 3   question is, when you target the entire United States

 4   and each of the 50 States within that and an accident

 5   occurs within one of those States, are you subject to

 6   jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a

 7   claim based on that accident?               Not generally, but just

 8   for a claim based on that accident.

 9               Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you

10   referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said

11   as long as there's purposeful availment, there is

12   specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment

13   when there's an active effort to target a market.

14               MR. FERGENSON:            Well, Your Honor, in Burger

15   King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the

16   purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities

17   within the forum State.         The -- this Court, through

18   those opinions, foreseeability, clear notice, reasonably

19   anticipate -- all converge.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               In all of those cases,

21   there was a forum in the United States where someone

22   injured in the United States could sue.                Your

23   proposition is that a company can deliberately send its

24   products, wants to exploit a U.S. market.                But I take it

25   that there is no place in the United States, because New

 1   Jersey is no different than California or any other

 2   place -- is it your position that there is no forum in

 3   which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this

 4   distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having

 5   its machines in as many locations in the United States

 6   as it could?     Is there a forum in the United States

 7   where it could be sued?

 8                  MR. FERGENSON:           Yes, Your Honor.

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Which one?

10                  MR. FERGENSON:           Ohio.            It could have been

11   proceeded against in Ohio.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It could be reached in

13   Ohio.   Now, does that make a whole lot of sense?                       Is it

14   any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than

15   New Jersey?     It's a lot less convenient for

16   Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this

17   machine.

18                  But you -- you are conceding that there is a

19   forum where this British company can be sued on a tort

20   that occurred in New Jersey.                Explain to me why, since

21   there is a forum in the United States, the logical one

22   isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.

23                  MR. FERGENSON:           Well, Your Honor, first, the

24   issue of convenience, choice of law, conflict of law, as

25   a determinative factor was rejected by this Court --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I'm asking you -

 2                  MR. FERGENSON:           What?

 3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- the question:     Where

 4   can it be sued?     Well, something happened in New Jersey.

 5   The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm

 6   there.     What happened in Ohio?               What basis for specific

 7   jurisdiction is there in Ohio?                  There was no tort in

 8   Ohio.

 9                  MR. FERGENSON:           Well, Your Honor, under Ohio

10   law, the -- there can be an assignment.                  There was no

11   written contract between MMA and J. McIntyre.                    There can

12   be an assignment in return for a release of a common law

13   indemnification right.

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I don't understand.

15                  JUSTICE KAGAN:           Yes, but, Mr. Fergenson,

16   just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is

17   a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim

18   between the British manufacturer and its distributor in

19   Ohio.     Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the

20   agreement between the two -- Ohio is the appropriate

21   place for jurisdiction.           But Ohio does not seem the

22   appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're

23   talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as

24   to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New

25   Jersey.

 1                The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is

 2   that you need a relationship between the defendant and

 3   the forum and the claim.            And here the claim arose in

 4   New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio.

 5                MR. FERGENSON:             Well, Your Honor, Ohio

 6   explicitly provides, and they -- it's arisen in statute

 7   of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers

 8   Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both

 9   express and common law indemnity arises under contract.

10                So, upon the assignment -- and there need

11   not be a judgment under Ohio law; that's Fort Defiance

12   Construction v. Village of Grover Hill -- there can be

13   an assignment of a common law indemnity under strict

14   product liability.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                What kind of common law

16   indemnity are we dealing with here?                      Where does

17   Mr. Nicastro sue?     He hasn't got any assignment, any

18   indemnity.   Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States

19   by a machine manufactured in England, and he wants to

20   sue, understandably, in the United States.                      Why are we

21   talking about assignments, indemnity?                      That has nothing

22   to do with Mr. Nicastro.

23                MR. FERGENSON:             Yes, Your Honor, it does.

24   Mr. Nicastro had an action under strict product

25   liability.   I want to come back to more fully answer the

 1   why question that you asked:                Why is it just and right

 2   that he go -- that he to Ohio?

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 No, I would just like to

 4   know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and

 5   not in New Jersey.      In New Jersey, it's the place where

 6   the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but

 7   the relationship between the distributor -- there's a

 8   contract between the distributor and McIntyre.                      So why

 9   does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?

10               MR. FERGENSON:              Ohio has New Jersey -

11   jurisdiction.     There -- as Your Honor noticed, there are

12   three places that Mr. Nicastro, in looking over this,

13   could have chosen:      United Kingdom, which he is now in,

14   in filing a claim in the liquidation proceedings; Ohio;

15   and New Jersey.     The accident occurred in New Jersey.

19   a forum non conveniens issue.                 And Justice Brennan was

20   clear before Burger King that that's what he wanted to

21   see the law go in the direction of.                      He was clear about

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And the claim in suit.

 3   That's very important.

 4                  MR. FERGENSON:           And -- and the cause of

 5   action, yes.     There -- the one place where both the

 6   distributor, who would upon suit and then a claim over

 7   under product, strict product liability, would disappear

 8   -- that's why you could get an assignment -- the

 9   distributor is in Ohio, and so too is the contract

10   relationship.

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I still don't -- I don't

12   follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment,

13   indemnity.     Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he

14   sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt.

15   And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction;

16   specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is

17   where the claim arose.          International Shoe, it arose in

18   the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -

19   the people who were promoting sale of International

20   Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day.

21   So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by

22   International Shoe based on the events that occurred in

23   California.     It was not all-purpose jurisdiction.

24                  And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a

25   proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really

 2                  MR. FERGENSON:           It -- Your Honor, it is.

 3   Mr. Nicastro could have contacted MMA, and stated I have

 4   a strict product liability action, or the trustee in

 5   bankruptcy.     The statute of limitations was 2 years in

 6   both cases.     Ohio would have applied New Jersey strict

 7   liability law.

 8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Your answer to Justice

 9   Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you,

10   but it seems to me rather strange.                       All of a sudden

11   you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out.                       I

12   thought the question was, from the standpoint of the

13   defendant at least, whether the defendant purposefully

14   availed itself of the forum.                And you would say the

15   defendant here purposefully availed itself of Ohio by

16   choosing an Ohio distributor.                 But you don't make that

17   argument.     You're talking about a contract, an

18   indemnity, which seems to me another step.                       That's

19   choice of law and applicable law.

20                  MR. FERGENSON:           I agree, Your Honor; it is

21   choice of law.     And -

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Also, I don't think it's

23   worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole

24   lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or

25   not.   You really think that that's --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:             The United States would

 6   not?   They surely targeted the United States.

 7                MR. FERGENSON:            Well, Your Honor, in the -

 8   in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in

 9   Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially

10   accepted by Justice Brennan -- in that footnote, it

11   states that national contacts is for the national

12   sovereign to decide.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's right.       But if the

14   national sovereign, the United States, provided by

15   statute that Federal district courts would have

16   jurisdiction over any -- any tort suit by a person

17   injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the

18   United States, would that be proper?

19                MR. FERGENSON:            This Court has not evaluated

21   and this is speculation, how Congress would establish

 8   venue, Congress could establish a uniform system to

 9   bring -- to bring foreign defendants into this country.

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Would you say the same

11   thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a

12   hypothetical, the distributor were in France -- machine

13   manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and

14   the distributor then selects the United States and then

15   the same facts, New Jersey?               United States would be an

16   appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause,

17   but not New Jersey?

 1   limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the

 2   United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than

 3   in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here,

 4   does have jurisdiction.         That seems backwards.

 5                MR. FERGENSON:           Well, Your Honor, I think

 6   that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's

 7   power to control, let's say, imports, then as a

 8   condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign

 9   Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act looks for.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, Congress has power to

11   control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress

12   says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter.

13                MR. FERGENSON:           Yes, Your Honor.

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:           Mr. Fergenson, could I try

15   another hypothetical?

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the question is why

17   the State can't make the same choice that the Congress

18   does.   The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be

19   sure.   Is that the only distinction?                  That doesn't sound

20   to me like due process.         What we're talking about is a

21   source of authority, not fairness to the defendant.

23   and I go to two words in particular in Burger King, one

 2   within the forum.     And then the other -

 3                JUSTICE KAGAN:             But, Mr. Fergenson, the

 4   question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and

 5   here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50

 6   States -- is purposeful availment.                       So let me -- let me

 7   just try a different hypothetical.

 8                Suppose you had the same arrangement with

 9   your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to

10   serve the entire United States market.                       Instead, the

11   arrangement was to serve only five States in the

12   Midwest.   That's what you wanted, your client wanted,

13   the market to be.     So it was going to be Ohio and

14   Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right?

15   So now a machine blows up in Illinois.                       Is there

16   jurisdiction in Illinois?

17                MR. FERGENSON:             Yes, Your Honor.

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:             There is jurisdiction in

19   Illinois, even though your relationship with your

20   distributor was in Ohio.            But there's jurisdiction in

21   Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were

22   seeking to serve the market; that's right?

23                MR. FERGENSON:             Because there was a

24   direction of the distributor to go into the State where

25   the accident occurred.

 2   say this is working very well.                  Let's get another nine

 3   distributors on board.          We'll give each of them five

 4   States, all right?      Now, if I understand you correctly,

 5   now you're liable all over the United States because

 6   you've had this relationship with 10 different

 7   distributors, each of whom are going to serve 5 States.

 8   So there's personal jurisdiction in any State where a

 9   machine blows up.

10                MR. FERGENSON:             If the -- yes, Your Honor,

11   if the States are assigned by name.

12                JUSTICE KAGAN:             And now I say:            Let's forget

13   these 10 distributors.          Who needs 10 distributors?                I'll

14   just have one distributor.

15                Why is there any difference?

16                MR. FERGENSON:             Because that distributor -

17   unless that distributor is told you must go -- like a

18   traveling salesperson, you must go into each State, you

19   must personally go into each State -- that's purposeful

20   availment.

22   this distributor was told to sell as many products as it

23   could in as many States as it could.

24                MR. FERGENSON:             No, it was not, Your Honor.

 1   article in 1958, very influential, and to look at

 2   footnote 99, in which Professor Kurland quotes, all

 3   quotes, from this Court's transcript of record in

 4   International Shoe.         And in international Shoe, the

 5   salespeople were controlled by International Shoe.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:               Right.         Can I ask you -

 7                 MR. FERGENSON:              Yes, Your Honor.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:               Now, first, the word

 9   "distributor" hurts you, so I'm going to take that out,

10   and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs

11   from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not

12   you, okay?

13                 Now, a person walks into a shop in either

14   West Virginia or the country of India where they make

15   pots.   They're very nice pots made, actually, in West

16   Virginia.    And the potter makes several thousand a year,

17   and this individual says:               Mr. Potter, I want to sell

18   your pots; send me a thousand each year.                       Where are you

19   going to sell them?         Everywhere.               Great.

20                 Okay?     That's it.              Now, suppose that the law

21   were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for

22   jurisdiction throughout the United States that the

23   distributor or independent buyer said good, I'm selling

24   them everywhere I can.            And two or three end up in New

25   Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up.

 1   Suppose that was sufficient to find jurisdiction.

 2               You've prepared for this case.                      I want to

 3   know in your opinion, if that were the rule -- that's

 4   all that's necessary -- what cases in this Court in your

 5   opinion would that conflict with?                      I mean, I'm thinking

 6   of the facts.   I'm not thinking of statements of law or

 7   whatever, but you can bring those in, too.                      I want to

 8   write those down because I want to read those cases, and

 9   you know them better than me.

10               MR. FERGENSON:            Your Honor, I believe that

11   the -- that the principles of law as stated, because

12   they're law and they're applied in each case, it could

13   -- which you apply to the facts, I believe that the

14   rejection of the convenience test by this Court in

15   World-Wide Volkswagen, Savchuk, and in Shaffer, where

16   Justice Brennan posited that there be a convenience

17   test, that those -

18               JUSTICE BREYER:             I don't know what a

19   convenience test is.      Assume I'm very ignorant, which

20   isn't too far from the truth.               I would like you to tell

21   me, are there any cases which we would actually be

22   conflicting with were we to say all that's necessary to

23   assert jurisdiction in every State is that a buyer walks

24   into a shop where the manufacturer of pots makes pots

25   and tells the potter I'm going to sell everywhere I can,

 1   and the potter says good, okay.                 Now -- and he buys the

 2   pots.

 3                Now, if that were the rule, can you find a

 4   case that that actually conflicts with?

 5                MR. FERGENSON:           I believe that that

 6   conflicts, Your Honor, with Asahi.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            Asahi, okay.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Asahi -- Asahi,

 9   Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese

10   component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished

11   product manufacturer.       What -- how in the world could

12   you compare that case, which really has nothing at all

13   to do with the United States?               It's -- it's a Japanese

14   valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in

15   Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go

16   forward in the United States?

17                I can see it going forward in -- in Japan,

18   but it has no connection with the United States.                 And

19   how can you possibly compare that with this case where

20   somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions,

21   allegedly?

22                There was something very interesting you

23   said in your brief.     And you said the U.K., which you -

24   you say -- now you've added Ohio, but you said U.K.

25   would be the place for Mr. Nicastro to go.                 It provides

 1   a trusted legal system.

 2               What would be your answer if the

 3   manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell

 4   anyplace in the United States you can, is from China?

 5   Would you give the same answer?

 6               MR. FERGENSON:              Your Honor, I would have to

 7   look at -- and -- and the answer would not be, off the

 8   cuff, the same.     It would not be flatly the same.

 9   There's been a recent decision by Judge Chasanow on

10   melamine in which Chasanow applied the availability law

11   that this Court has set forth in Piper and Gulf Oil

12   and -- and the other cases that follow, and determined

13   that China was an available forum for the plaintiffs

14   suing for the harm to their children from tainted milk.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 You -- you made a point

16   about the trusted legal system.                   Well, let's say it was

17   Russia, Mexico -- you may pick any one.                   The machine is

18   manufactured in one of those countries where it's not so

19   certain that there's a trusted legal system.

20               MR. FERGENSON:              That's correct, Your Honor.

21   And so under Piper, Gulf Oil -- and I can't remember the

22   name of the other case that Judge Chasanow relied

23   upon -- they are difficult cases, and the ability of the

24   court to determine whether the other forum is available

25   is quite cabined.     And they are difficult, Your Honor.

 7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. ROSS, JR.,

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 9               MR. ROSS:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               "All we wish to do is sell our products in

12   the States and get paid."             That's what the British

13   manufacturer said.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       What if he said we

15   want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't

16   sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company

17   nonetheless does so?        Can you get them -- can you hale

18   them into court in New Jersey?

19               MR. ROSS:         I would say under those

20   circumstances, yes, because the purpose that -- this

21   particular manufacturer purposefully availed themselves

22   of the entire U.S. market.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       But he said:     But I

24   have no intention of selling in New Jersey; I'm afraid I

25   might get sued there, and I don't want to get sued

 1   there.   He is not entering the stream of commerce in the

 2   United States.   He's entering a stream of commerce that

 3   detours around New Jersey.

 4                MR. ROSS:      So every State with the exception

 5   of New Jersey -- is that the hypothetical, Your Honor?

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes.

 7                MR. ROSS:      Then I would say under those

 8   circumstances, yes, New Jersey would be excluded.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Oh, it would be

10   excluded?

11                MR. ROSS:      Yes.        If the manufacturer -

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So it depends on the

13   intent of the manufacturer?

14                MR. ROSS:      I think it's the intent and the

15   additional conduct of the manufacturer, Your Honor.                      I

16   think, as Justice O'Connor said in the Asahi case -- she

17   gave several examples.        I think we'd meet all those

18   examples under the circumstances of this case.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if a manufacturer

20   tells a distributor:      You have international

21   distribution authority; you can sell my machine anywhere

22   in the world, sell as many as you can anywhere in the

23   world -- that would include the United States, right?

24                MR. ROSS:      That is correct, Your Honor.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And, therefore, it would

 1   include New Jersey?

 2               MR. ROSS:      Under those circumstances, of

 3   course, which are different from our case, it would seem

 4   to me -

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I know; it's a

 6   hypothetical.

 7               MR. ROSS:      Of course, of course.           But the

 8   fact of the matter is if the manufacturer purposefully

 9   availed itself of -- of the market which would include

10   the world and had a distributor for the entire world and

11   did -

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would include New

13   Jersey.

14               MR. ROSS:      Yes, it would.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Purposeful availment of the

16   government of New Jersey?

17               MR. ROSS:      I would say the manufacturer has

18   to take some additional conduct.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, availment doesn't

20   mean much if that's all it means.

21               MR. ROSS:      Well, if -

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You tell somebody

23   distribute in the world and you are availing yourself of

24   the government of New Jersey?

 1   and additional conduct, Your Honor.                      In this case,

 2   that's what we have here.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:              Additional conduct?

 4                MR. ROSS:        Correct.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:              What I have written down in

 6   my notes, which you can add to -

 7                MR. ROSS:        Sure.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:              -- is that there are three

 9   things that happened.         One -- it's the equivalent of the

10   potter.   One thing that happened, we have to take it as,

11   I think, an independent company, whether you want to

12   call them a distributor or not.                   I didn't see a

13   difference there.     An independent company goes to a firm

14   somewhere in the world and says:                    I will buy your

15   product and sell it in the United States.                      And the guy

16   says good.   And that's true whether it's a woman's

17   cooperative in southern India or whether it's the

18   biggest company in the world, okay?                      That's the first

19   thing.

20                The second thing is that an executive of

21   that company went to seven trade shows in the United

22   States.

23                And the third thing is that two, three, or

24   four machines ended up in New Jersey.

25                Now, is there anything other than that?                        And

 1   there's a lot of rhetoric, and there are all kinds of

 2   characterizations, but when I looked for facts, I found

 3   those three, and I want to be sure I have them all.

 4               MR. ROSS:      You do, Your Honor.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            I do.          Now, then my

 6   question following from that, if I have those are the

 7   three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of

 8   what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said.                      It

 9   said in worldwide markets this is a good thing.                      I think

10   I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's

11   cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese

12   development, I'm worried about development everywhere.

13   We have a lot of small businesses.                    And I'd worry -

14   now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd

15   worry about a rule of law that subjects every small

16   business in every developing company -- in every

17   developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50

18   States simply because they agreed to sell to an

19   independent company who is going to sell to America,

20   plus your two factors.

21               And really the third is none, because if it

22   hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no

23   accident.

24               MR. ROSS:      I would say -

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, that's my basic

 1   concern here.

 2               MR. ROSS:      I would say in -- in response to

 3   your hypothetical question, that because there was

 4   purposeful availment where they came to the United

 5   States, attended trade shows in an effort to sell their

 6   product to anyone who would come to that trade show

 7   throughout the United States, and those sales were in

 8   fact consummated, then in that case I think that the

 9   manufacturer has done more than just intend to sell.

10   They have taken certain positive steps.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.           Okay, but you see

12   what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that

13   may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's

14   going to work or develop if in fact every small business

15   everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law

16   of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here,

17   rather than making the accident victim go there.

18               Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but

19   the other is also tough.         So -- so that's -- that's sort

20   of the -- I'm sketching out my concerns here.                     You -

21               MR. ROSS:      I understand.

 1   respond to Justice Breyer's -

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

 3                  MR. ROSS:      In -- in my judgment, it's not

 4   enough to just have intent; it's not enough just to send

 5   the product out on -- adrift on the stream of commerce.

 6   There has to be some additional conduct, some concrete

 7   steps taken.     And I believe -

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Trade shows.

 9                  MR. ROSS:      -- in your hypothetical,

10   attending the trade shows, perhaps hiring a distributor,

11   selling the products -

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that's the same as

13   the first; that's a sale to the entity.

14                  MR. ROSS:      That's right.              So I think those

15   are the additional concrete steps that were taken in

16   your hypothetical.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Ross -

18                  JUSTICE KAGAN:           Mr. Ross, do you think if

19   there's a small business in the United States that sells

20   a product and that actively seeks to serve a foreign

21   market -- maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China -

22   and that product blows up in that foreign country --

23   Great Britain, China -- do you think that the

24   manufacturer, the American manufacturer, is subject to

25   jurisdiction there?

 1               MR. ROSS:      Yes.        If they actively seek the

 2   market there, they have purposefully availed themselves,

 3   they have taken -

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:           All -- all over the world

 5   this is true; is that right?

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And it is a

 8   jurisdictional rule that civil law systems have always

 9   had.

10               MR. ROSS:      That's correct, Your Honor.           I

11   believe -

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But -- and I assume that if

13   we do this to a company in England, any country in the

14   world, and we say that this satisfies due process, we

15   would have to honor a judgment from Bangladesh based

16   upon -- against an American company, based upon a

17   similarly modest degree of -- of availment, right?

18               MR. ROSS:      Well, Your Honor, it depends on

19   the extent of the availment, I would say, under those

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just as -- just as modest

22   as what you propose here, or as extensive.               I don't mean

 6   a judgment by a court of Madras against an American

 8   exists here.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But the United States has

 5   taken a very neighborly view about recognizing and

 6   enforcing foreign judgments.

 7                 MR. ROSS:      Yes, Your Honor.           I -

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's true when there's a

 9   proper jurisdictional basis, which is what we're talking

10   about here:    What does the United States mean when it

11   says there is a proper jurisdictional basis?                  Is all

12   that the court in Madras needs what existed here in

13   order to hold an -- an American manufacturer liable?

14   That's -- that's a little scary.

15                 MR. ROSS:      Well, Your Honor, if the

16   corporation, the manufacturer, is purposefully availing

17   itself of the Madras market and hires a distributor to

18   go to Madras and to sell its products, then indeed I

19   don't see why a court in Madras would not have -- and

25   distributor is marketing the manufacturer's product?

 1                 I thought because, in the hypothetical he

 2   created, it was they were availing themselves of the

 3   U.S. market because they were marketing.                     They went to

 4   seven trade shows.     They did merely -- they did

 5   something more than the sale.                So where's your -- what's

 6   your position?

 7                 MR. ROSS:      My position is exactly what Your

 8   Honor has just stated.         They have to do something more

 9   than just sell.    There has to be purposeful availment.

10   There has to be some concrete action, attending trade

11   shows, designing the product for the market.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:           What -- what difference does

13   attending some trade shows in the United States mean -

14   make?    Suppose they're -- they didn't attend any trade

15   shows.    They just have a Web site that provides a

16   description of the product.

17                 MR. ROSS:      I think -

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:           Would there be no

19   jurisdiction then?

20                 MR. ROSS:      Well, it depends on the Web site.

21   But in my judgment, attending trade shows is a large

22   factor that is unique in this case.                     As I pointed out in

23   our briefs, they were -- they didn't just attend a trade

24   show; they attended trade shows throughout the United

25   States to sell this product.

 5   company that bought this machine find out about it?

 6                  MR. ROSS:      Well, Mr. Curcio, who was

 7   Mr. Nicastro's employer, went to one of these

 8   conventions, trade shows, in Las Vegas, where he saw the

15   it make that they go to a trade show somewhere other

16   than New Jersey?     We have the notion that they're

17   availing themselves of the -- the entire United States

 3                  MR. ROSS:      With -- no, with New Jersey,

 4   because the British manufacturer was there.                       He was in a

 5   booth.   A New Jersey person came to the booth and said

 6   that's a great machine.           There was some kind of

 7   interaction.     The record is unclear as to what it was,

 9                MR. ROSS:      He was prepared to sell to

10   anyone.   Whether it was from New Jersey or Massachusetts

11   or Connecticut, it didn't matter as long as the sale was

12   into the United States and the manufacturer got the

13   economic benefit of it.

15   point that he was selling by using large convention

18   sites?

19                I know that Justice Alito doesn't want to

10   your theory to say that in areas where you don't expect

11   to be haled into court because your machine is not going

12   to be used, you can't be.

13                MR. ROSS:      Well, it seems to me that if

14   the -- if the manufacturer has purposefully availed

15   itself of the entire United States market, which is

16   inclusive of Montana -

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes.

18                MR. ROSS:      -- and the machine somehow winds

19   up in Montana -

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No, no.     Not the

21   machine.

22                MR. ROSS:      The individual.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes.

24                MR. ROSS:      So the individual is in Montana;

25   the accident happened somewhere else?

 2                MR. ROSS:      Under those circumstances, I

 3   would say that wherever that machine was sold into,

 4   whether it was in an adjoining State, and the fellow

 5   from Montana lived across the border, say -

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, exactly.

 7                MR. ROSS:      -- I would say that the

 8   jurisdiction would better be put where the accident

 9   occurred.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, well -

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Could it be put

12   elsewhere?   Could it be put in the other State?

13                MR. ROSS:      I would say that if the -- if the

14   manufacturer has not purposefully availed itself of the

15   State of Montana -

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Right.

17                MR. ROSS:      -- and has taken no steps -

20   though it is seeking to sell to the entire United

 3                 What I'm trying to get at, obviously, is

 4   we're talking about the stream of commerce in the United

 5   States, but the stream doesn't wash over the United

 6   States evenly.    The manufacturer, as I asked earlier,

 7   may decide I don't want to sell New Jersey.

 8                 MR. ROSS:       Right.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     The manufacturer may

10   reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in

11   Montana because there's no scrap metal business in

12   Montana.   So I'm just trying to see if there are

13   limitations to your theory about the stream of commerce

14   covers everything.

15                 MR. ROSS:       Yes, Your Honor.                The answer is

16   yes, there are limitations.               There are those

17   limitations, and I think the best way of -- of stating

18   it would be if there is purposeful availment of entering

19   a market and you sell the product into that market, you

20   take these additional steps plus the intent, plus the

21   additional -

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Right, but the

23   market cannot be simply the United States, because you

24   carve out New Jersey if the manufacturer does, you carve

25   out Montana if --

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But what I'm thinking is

 5   this -- this area of law has treated States as if

 6   they're foreign countries, in a certain way analogous

 7   to.   If that -- and I'm trying to -- let me ask:                       What

 8   you said at one point, that if an independent company

 9   comes to a business, however small, in the United States

10   and says give us some of your product, we're going to

11   sell it everywhere in the world we can, fine.                       And they

12   do.

13                  A couple go -- get into some very -- Burma

14   or whatever, Myanmar.         And right now, it's the law that

15   consumers in all those countries sue in that country if

16   they're hurt.     Is that really the law?                    Is there

17   something you can cite me to on that?

18                  MR. ROSS:      Well, there are conventions.

19   There's a Brussels convention and a Uganda convention.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And what does it -- what

21   does it say?

22                  MR. ROSS:      They basically state, according

23   to my understanding, that where the -- where the tort

24   occurred to the signatories of that convention, which

25   includes the --

 2               MR. ROSS:      The United Kingdom.            Which

 3   includes the United Kingdom.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            And are we one?

 5               MR. ROSS:      That -- then in those cases,

 6   where the tort occurred there would be jurisdiction over

 7   the foreign manufacturer.          For example, if there's an

 8   injury in Belgium and the machine is manufactured in

 9   Britain, someone is hurt in Belgium, according to those

10   conventions, then the person in Belgium could sue the

11   British company in Belgium.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            Did you refer to that?        Do

13   you have a citation to that in -

14               MR. ROSS:      They're in our brief.            Yes.

16               MR. ROSS:      Yes, Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It's the EEOC Convention

18   on Jurisdiction and Judgments?               Because that operates

19   only within the Community.

20               MR. ROSS:      That's correct.            The United

21   States is not a signatory to that convention.                But the

22   hypothetical was -- and I tried to answer the

23   hypothetical.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Does your argument depend

 1   whole machine as opposed to a component part, like

 2   Asahi?   Suppose there was a little battery or lever that

 3   was manufactured, I don't know, in France, and it was

 4   sent over to this English manufacturer, and they were -

 5   this part is incorporated in many different kinds of

 6   machines, but the part then -- and then the facts are

 7   the same:   It goes to the Ohio distributor and New

 8   Jersey, but the part is what causes the injury.

 9                What results?

10                MR. ROSS:        I would say no jurisdiction for a

11   component manufacturer under those circumstances, unless

12   the component manufacturer was deliberately

13   manufacturing a product for sale into a State in the

14   United States -

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, it's like Justice

16   Breyer's hypothetical.          He wants to sell to the entire

17   universe if he can.

18                MR. ROSS:        That's correct, but the

19   manufacturer in your hypothetical did not purposefully

20   avail itself of the United States market.                He simply

21   sold a component part.

22                And this is, of course, not a component part

23   case we have here before us.                So he may have known -

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Let's say he does

 4   know, it's a component part for something that is sold,

 5   widely sold, in the United States.                    Or it's a component

 6   part of this machine.

 7               MR. ROSS:      Our position is that under those

 8   circumstances, if the manufacturer did not purposefully

 9   avail itself of the United States market by hiring a

10   distributor -

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But why would it

12   be -

16   entirely different test.

19   an entirely different test for a component manufacturer

20   than you do for the finished product manufacturer.                       The

21   component manufacturer may well know to a certainty that

22   his component is going to be used in a product that's

23   sold in the United States.

 3   different?     Shouldn't it be the same test?

 4                  MR. ROSS:      I think it's different.                  And

 5   that's where the limitation of the Due Process Clause, I

 6   think, comes into play because that manufacturer, making

 7   a small component, a spring, a small part for a large

 8   machine like in the Asahi case, he may not -- he may

 9   have known.     It's foreseeable that this product will go

10   there, but -

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    He makes -- let's

12   say he makes the 25-inch blade that only goes into this

13   machine.     That's the only market for it.                    Does -- no

14   difference?

15                  MR. ROSS:      I would say there is a

16   difference, because that component -

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I'm sorry.    That was

18   poorly phrased.     Is it the same test for the machine, or

19   is it a different test?           Is it your component test?

20                  MR. ROSS:      I think it's -- I think it's the

21   same test, but it would come out differently for the

22   component manufacturer.           That's the way I'd like to -

 2   Justice O'Connor, it was not enough, that knowledge was

 3   insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment,

 4   that there had to be an active decision, a choice to

 5   seek the market.     And -- and I understand that, on your

 6   view, McIntyre made that choice.

 7                  MR. ROSS:      Exactly.

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    How can there not -

 9   how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if

10   the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only

11   going to be used in McIntyre's machine and it knows that

12   McIntyre is trying to sell its machine in the United

13   States?

14                  MR. ROSS:      Because the manufacturer of that

15   blade did not specifically target the United States

16   market.   He -

19   going to be sold in the United States.

21   designed for them.      And that -- that machine is not

22   specifically designed for the U.S. market.                       That

23   machine -

 1   machine; the other partner makes the insides of the

 2   machine.   Are they, as individual companies -- are they

 3   availing themselves of the United States market?

 4                MR. ROSS:      Now, under those circumstances, I

 5   would think there would be a difference.                I think there

 6   would be a difference because they are combined in

 7   joining to market into the United States.                But if this

 8   is a -- a manufacturer of blades in Birmingham, England,

 9   and the manufacturer of blades in Birmingham, England,

10   sends it to Nottingham, England, and then something

11   happens in New Jersey, and all the facts are the same, I

12   would say Birmingham is off the hook.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Suppose the company in

14   Nottingham only sells to the United States.                It's the

15   only place its machines are -- are marketed.

16                MR. ROSS:      That would be different then.

16   All right.

17                Now, all of these people, however small, I

18   mean, many, many will have Internet sites, and some of

19   them might have an Internet site that's accessed by

20   American buyers, as this man did.

21                MR. ROSS:      Right.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.          Is there any

23   difference between that and your trade shows?

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:               Yes.

 3               MR. ROSS:         -- purposefully availed itself -

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:               No, no, don't use the

 5   characterization.     I mean, I'm -- see, I'm trying to

 6   figure out does this count as purposefully availed?

 7               MR. ROSS:         If -- if they take steps,

 8   concrete steps, additional conduct, then yes.                       The

 9   answer is yes.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:               Okay.          So the answer is

11   going to be, in this case, if we say you win -

12               MR. ROSS:         Sadly, even if -

13               JUSTICE BREYER:               -- then everyone with a -

14   with a -- everyone with an Internet site who also sells

15   to a buyer who says anywhere in the world, perhaps -- I

16   don't know how far that reaches -- seems pretty filled

17   with implications.

18               MR. ROSS:         Yes, it does.                The Internet -- we

19   deliberately did not raise the Internet or any Web sites

20   in our briefs.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:               But it's the same, you

22   think?   It's the same -- I thought it might -

23               MR. ROSS:         I think if there's purposeful

24   availment and if the Internet is being used to market

25   specifically into the United States and the product

 1   causes harm to someone in the United States -

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Are there -- there are

 3   some cases just beginning -- at the beginning stages,

 4   aren't there, involving sales through the Internet?

 5               MR. ROSS:      Yes.        Yes, Your Honor.        I believe

 6   that those cases say if there's an interactive Web site;

 7   in other words, if the person sitting in the United

 8   States can press several buttons on its computer and

 9   interact and make -- consummate the transaction, if you

10   will, with the foreign manufacturer, then under those

11   circumstances, I believe, the trend of the cases seems

12   to be that there would be jurisdiction.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But -- but you were cut

14   off before you finished your answer.                  I want to make

15   sure I understood it.      I -- I make the inference that

16   you -- you would say that if there is an advertisement,

17   not a sale, just an advertisement on the Internet,

18   replacing the trade show, that that is a significant

19   availment -- a purposeful availment, and there can be

20   jurisdiction in New Jersey.            Same factors here -

21   somebody who doesn't go to the U.S. trade shows, but he

22   does put it on the Internet, the same result?

23               MR. ROSS:      That was one of the four examples

24   that Justice O'Connor gave us in Asahi, advertising

 1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I want to know what your

 2   position is.

 3                  MR. ROSS:      Yes.        My position is yes, because

 4   they are -- they are attempting to sell into the United

 5   States with advertising.            But the trend of the decisions

 6   has been that it has to be an interactive Web site.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Can -- maybe

 8   everybody knows this except me.                   Do you -- are Web sites

 9   targeted to the United States?                  Don't you -- you can -

10   let's say they put it on their Web site in England.

11   Can't you -- can't -- can't I access that from here?

12                  MR. ROSS:      Yes, you can.

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So they don't even

14   have to send the Web site to the United States?                         They

15   just have to have a Web site?

16                  MR. ROSS:      If it's an interactive Web site

17   where you can sit in New Jersey, order a product, the

18   product is then delivered by the foreign manufacturer

19   into New Jersey, and the product then chops off four

20   fingers of someone's hand -

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So it has to be

22   interactive?

23                  MR. ROSS:      Yes, Your Honor.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If it's just -- what

 2   you want to buy one?

 3                 MR. ROSS:       Not enough.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Not enough?

 5                 MR. ROSS:       That's like a billboard.                 That's

 6   not enough.     That's just a pure advertising; not enough.

 7   But if the additional steps that I just mentioned are

 8   taken and a sale occurs -

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     And this distinction

10   is somewhere in the Due Process Clause?

11                 MR. ROSS:       I believe that the Due Process

12   Clause requires the additional conduct.                       The purposeful

13   availment, which is what we have in your hypothetical,

14   and the actual transaction, the sale, then we have

15   jurisdiction.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But was the sale here

17   negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in

18   Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer

19   just was interested in the machine and then later

20   contacted the Ohio distributor?

21                 MR. ROSS:       In this case, the manufacturer

22   said that they own the machines until they're paid for

23   in full.   The machine was not paid for in full.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              No, I'm -- I'm trying to

25   relate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical.

 4   where there's just an advertisement.

 5                  MR. ROSS:      Right.

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And, at first, I thought

 7   you were saying that's sufficient.                       Now you say no,

 8   because they have to be part of the contract.                       I'm

 9   trying to make the Internet equivalent to the trade

10   show.

11                  MR. ROSS:      If the Internet Web site is

12   interactive, so you can sit in New Jersey, order the

13   product, complete the transaction, send money, and in

14   response to the money coming, you get a product -

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Okay.         But not just an

16   advertisement?

17                  MR. ROSS:      Not just an advertisement.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Even though that's the

19   cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues -

20   pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the

21   information on the Internet, but he phones the Ohio

22   distributor?

23                  MR. ROSS:      It's not enough, in my judgment,

24   if -- under the Internet example that you just gave.                        If

25   there's an interactive Web site where the person in New

 1   Jersey can press buttons on his computer and complete

 2   the transaction with the result that the product comes

 3   to New Jersey, under those circumstances, I would say

 4   there is jurisdiction.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Complete?   He's got

 6   to complete the transaction?

 7                MR. ROSS:      That's correct.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What if it's -

 9                MR. ROSS:      I don't -

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    -- you know, punch

11   these numbers, and we will send you an application for a

12   machine?   Is that not enough, because he's got to

13   complete the transaction?

14                MR. ROSS:      I would say, under those

15   circumstances, that that's part of what the manufacturer

16   requires, but the end result is that the machine winds

17   up in New Jersey through this contact between the person

18   and the manufacturer.       Then I would say that would be

19   enough for jurisdiction.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So that if they say

21   fill this out, and contact this person, McIntyre,

22   whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our

23   machines -- that's enough?

16               MR. FERGENSON:           Thank you, Your Honor.

17               Justice Breyer, I would -- in response to

18   your concern, I would ask you to look at page 29 of the

19   States' amicus brief:      "Ignorance of the fact that New

20   Jersey is a State within our union, or of the specifics

21   of New Jersey products liability law, should not allow

22   Petitioner to avoid jurisdiction.                     Its own lack of

23   research prior to embarking on a nationwide marketing

24   campaign is no defense."         I think that -

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Could you answer -

 2               JUSTICE KAGAN:           -- could I ask you a

 3   question?

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm sorry.     Could you -

 5   just one quick point of clarification.

 6               MR. FERGENSON:           Yes, Your Honor.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               It's a point that your

 8   adversary raised in passing.             I'm not quite sure, do you

 9   sell outright to the American company?                Do you ship a

10   product and they pay you, or they only pay you when they

11   receive the money from their customer?                There appears to

12   be some suggestion of the latter.

13               MR. FERGENSON:           And the New Jersey Supreme

14   Court said that there was a suggestion that some trades

15   could have been by consignment.                I believe that that is

16   outside of this -- taken out of this case by an

17   admission in the brief -- at least for this sale -- in

18   the brief in opposition to defendant's motion to

19   dismiss, at 19-20, filed October 11th, 2006, where they

20   state -- where Respondent states it was sold by us to

21   MMA, and it was sold by MMA to Curcio Scrap Metal.

22               So, there is no consignment.                  There's no

23   consignment under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But that's a different

25   question than I asked.       There was no consignment on this

 1   machine?

 2               MR. FERGENSON:             Yes.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 But you're not claiming

 4   that there might not be on others?

 5               MR. FERGENSON:             The evidence in the record

 6   under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted, I think can only be

 7   reasonably viewed -- and this Court obviously treats it

 8   as de novo, on a jurisdictional review -- can only be

 9   viewed as not a consignment because MMA was in the

10   business of selling the products to others.

11               Let me say that for the -- there was no

12   interaction in the record with anyone from New Jersey by

13   MMA or by J. McIntyre.         It was the booth, and then there

14   was an order.    And if you look at the invoice, it says

15   verbal order.    There was an order by the son of the

16   owner of Curcio Metal Works, and that's it.                  The order

17   was fulfilled.

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:             Mr. Fergenson, Toyota,

19   Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many

20   millions of cars to the United States.                  They start

21   blowing up here.     They operate through independent

22   distributors only.     Can they be subject to jurisdiction

23   in any of the States?

24               MR. FERGENSON:             I think that most

25   sophisticated distribution networks -- and this one was

 2   issue of this as a scheme.            Most sophisticated

 3   distribution networks, such as the manufacturers you're

 5   throughout the United States, whether against the
