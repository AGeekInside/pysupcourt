 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument

 5   Stainless.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MR. SCHNAPPER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11                Section 704(a), Title VII, prohibits the use

12   of third-party reprisals as a method of retaliating

13   against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise

14   opposed discrimination.         The text of section 704(a)

15   doesn't limit the types of retaliation which are

16   forbidden.   The elements of the statute are unrelated to

17   that.

18                The first requirement is that the plaintiff

19   show that discrimination occurred with regard to the

20   individual who engaged in a protected activity.                In a

21   case like that, like this, that's shown by -- would be

22   shown by evidence that they singled out Ms. Regalado and

23   Ms. Regalado's fiancé.        They didn't go fire anybody

24   else's fiancé.     That was the basis on which this

25   particular action was taken.

                                      3

                                Official


 1               Secondly, the plaintiff must show that the

 2   conduct was discrimination against the person who

 3   engaged in protected activity.           That language is easily

 4   applicable to a situation where you single out, say, a

 5   family member or a fiancé.        The purpose of that, the

 6   complaint can fairly be read to allege, was to punish

 7   the person who had engaged in protected activity.

 8               There are a number of Federal statutes that

 9   use the word "against" in precisely this way.            They say

10   that actions cannot be taken to -- say, against a family

11   member of a sitting judge or other Federal official

12   where the purpose is to act against the official.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is Ms. Regalado still

14   engaged to this fellow?

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           She's married to him.

16               MR. SCHNAPPER:        I'm sorry.      Is she still

17   engaged to him?

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

19               MR. SCHNAPPER:        They're married.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, they're married.

21               MR. SCHNAPPER:        And they have a lovely

22   2-year-old daughter.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, good.   Well, why didn't

24   she bring this suit?

25               MR. SCHNAPPER:        I -- I think, Your Honor,

                                   4

 1   that your -- this Court's Article III jurisprudence

 2   would have precluded her from getting any remedy.                  The

 3   -- certainly most of the remedies that are needed here.

 4   She wouldn't have had Article III standing to win an

 5   award of back pay to -- to her now husband.              She

 6   couldn't have gotten an award of damages to him.               I

 7   think, if I'm right -

 8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Could she have gotten

 9   reinstatement on the grounds that his continuing

10   inability to be employed by the company is an ongoing

11   hurt to her?

12                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Perhaps.     It would depend on

13   the circumstances.     In this particular case, almost

14   certainly not, because of just the -- the course of

15   subsequent events.     But it's -- she subsequently left

16   the company.     At this point, they live nowhere near that

17   town.   It simply wouldn't work.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Suppose an employer -

19   suppose an employer dismisses an employee on an

20   impermissible ground, impermissible under Title VII, and

21   it's a very valuable employee.             Can the shareholders sue

22   on the ground that the shareholders are now injured

23   because the company is worth less, having lost this

24   employee, under Title VII?

25                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        I don't -- I don't believe

                                      5

 1   so, Your Honor.     I don't believe so.           But the situation

 2   here is different than that.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Because you start with

 4   somebody who is -- who is unlike the shareholders.

 5   There's no Title VII violation as to them.              Regalado is

 6   complaining of sex discrimination, and then she said,

 7   because I made a complaint, they retaliated against me.

 8   Shareholders are not in that position, because there was

 9   no initial charge there.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, it's the same

11   hypothetical.     We'll just say Regalado, all the same

12   facts, except she is very valuable to the company.              The

13   company is now worth less; shareholder sues.

14                MR. SCHNAPPER:          I think the thrust of your

15   question was -- is:      Are the shareholders like Thompson?

16   And I think -- I think that Thompson's situation is

17   quite different.     He was the very target of the illegal

18   act.   The illegality occurs only by means of dismissing

19   him.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:          The question is whether he's

21   aggrieved within the meaning of Title VII, right?

22                MR. SCHNAPPER:          That is the other question.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:          And your argument is that if

24   there's injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III

25   of the Constitution, then the person is aggrieved.

 1                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        The -- the Court's decision

 2   in Trafficante goes that far, and in practice it has not

 3   proved a problem under Title VIII.                It's -- that's

 4   generally been its understanding of -- here.

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:        But your -- is it your

 6   argument that we have -- that we should go that far?

 7                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        You do not -

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:        We should say that there was

 9   injury -

10                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        You do not -

11                  JUSTICE ALITO:        We don't?       We don't need to

12   go that far?

13                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        You do not need to go that

14   far.

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Where do we draw the line?

16                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Well, I think -- I think the

17   Government has -- I -- I think as far as you need to go,

18   which is not the same as saying that's as far as the law

19   goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as

20   in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the

21   very method by which the law was violated, that that

22   would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved.

23                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Where does that come from?

24   Where does that test come from?

25                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Your Honor, I don't -- I

                                      7

                                   Official


 1   think that's as far as you need to go in this case.              I

 2   think the standard of aggrieved is broader than that,

 3   but the -- in -- as this has played out in the lower

 4   courts since Trafficante, there's a wide range of

 5   different kinds of circumstances under which the

 6   Trafficante rule has been invoked in Title VII cases.

 7   We're not asking you to address all of those.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:        I understand the argument.

 9   I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me,

10   to say as far as we need to go in order to reverse.

11   That's really not how a statute ought to be interpreted,

12   I would say.     What does it mean?           What -- now, I

13   understand the argument that "aggrieved" means all the

14   way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is

15   necessary to satisfy the Constitution.              And I understand

16   that argument.     It's a very broad argument with a lot of

17   implications.

18                  But if -- if that's not correct, then what

19   is the correct test and where does it come from?

20                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Well, Your Honor, I think

21   that there are two other limitations that would be

22   applicable here, as indeed they would have been under

23   Title VIII.

24                  First one is proximate cause, which will cut

25   off a lot of injuries down the road.              And Title VII is

                                      8
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   adopted against a background of proximate cause rules,

 2   and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in

 3   using the word "person aggrieved" they meant -- Congress

 4   meant to set those aside.

 5                  Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of

 6   the word "aggrieved" is that it is -- "aggrieved" is

 7   both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower

 8   than "injured."     It is broader -- and that's, of course,

 9   not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people

10   who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the

11   future.

12                  But it also has a second element which is

13   that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong.

14   If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm

15   probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football

16   in the middle of a football game.                 That's a legitimate

17   thing to do.

18                  So I think that there has to be a wrong, and

19   the wrong has to be the -- the basis of the -- of the

20   plaintiff's objection.        You could have a situation where

21   the plaintiff really didn't care one way or another why

22   -- why that harm had happened.             It was -- but in this

23   case, that's precisely why Thompson complains.                 He's not

24   suggesting that he would be wronged if he were ever

25   fired at all.     He is aggrieved because he was fired for

                                      9

 1   a reason that was an improper reason.               And -- and we

 2   think those are -- those are limiting principles.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What -- what do you do

 4   with the argument that says there's a middle step?                  You

 5   can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and

 6   then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense

 7   that he was hurt, he was injured.               But they say there's

 8   no cause of action, there's no statutory cause of

 9   action, for Thompson.

10                MR. SCHNAPPER:        Well, the -- we think that's

11   just clearly wrong.     The statute provides a cause of

12   action.

13                If I might go back to how that came up in

14   the court of appeals, the court of appeals appears to

15   have assumed that third-party reprisals are unlawful.

16   It's not entirely clear.       And then, in footnote 1, the

17   court of appeals said that -- that Thompson was

18   aggrieved.

19                Notwithstanding that, they then went on to

20   say that there's no cause of action in the statute -

21   they said in section 704(a).           That really doesn't make

22   any sense.   The -- the statute provides an express cause

23   of action.   It says that individuals -- certain

24   individuals, if the requirements are met, can bring

25   lawsuits.

                                   10

 1                  So the question is, as -- as Justice Alito

 2   put it and -- and it was put before, which is whether

 3   the plaintiff is aggrieved.              But if he's aggrieved, he's

 4   clearly got a cause of action -

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Suppose Thompson were not

 6   Regalado's fiancé at the time.              Suppose they were

 7   just -- they were just good friends.              Would -- and

 8   everything else happened, and he alleged that he was

 9   fired in retaliation for her engaging in protected

10   conduct.     The way the company wanted to get at her was

11   by firing her friend.       Would that be enough?

12                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Well, the -- the plaintiff

13   would have to prove two things.              First of all, the

14   plaintiff would have to prove that that was indeed the

15   company's motive for picking him to fire him.

16                  Secondly, under this Court's decision in

17   Burlington Northern, the plaintiff would have to show

18   that this was a retaliatory action sufficiently serious

19   that it was -- it would likely persuade a reasonable

20   employee in Regalado's position -- dissuade her

21   complaint.     And -- and that's why we've agreed with the

22   Respondent's contention that -- that they're entitled to

23   an evidentiary determination about whether that standard

24   was met here.

25                  So that's an important limiting principle,

                                     11
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and it has -

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:         How does that translate?

 3   How does that Burlington Northern standard translate

 4   into the situation in which there is some sort of

 5   relationship between the -- the person who engaged in

 6   the protected conduct and the person who suffers the

 7   adverse employment action?

 8                 That's what's troubling to me about -- about

 9   the theory.     Where it's a fiancé, it's -- that's a

10   relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole

11   spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser

12   relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -

13   unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory

14   is rather troubling.

15                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         Well, I think -

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Can you help -- can you help

17   provide where the clear line is?              Does it go to -- does

18   it include simply a good friend?              Does it include

19   somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day

20   with the person who engaged in the protected conduct?

21   Somebody who once dated the person who engaged in the

25   to a jury.    I mean, the -- the problem, as you cast it,

 1   is that's the standard in Burlington Northern -- no

 2   offense -- isn't a bright line.              It is the standard,

 3   which it is.     And the same question could arise about

 4   other methods of retaliation.

 5                  What about -- you know, what about cutting

 6   someone out of 5 meetings or 10 meetings?              But that same

 7   problem exists under Burlington Northern no matter what.

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:           But why can't -

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well -

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Why can't they get -- the

11   first question, to go back, is just a confusion in my

12   mind:    Why couldn't she bring this suit?            And she says:

13   I was discriminated against because they did A, B, C, D

14   to him, and the remedy is cure the way in which I was

15   discriminated against.        And to cure that way, you would

16   have to make the man whole in respect to those elements

17   that we're discriminating against her.

18                  Do you give him back pay?           Do you restore

19   him?    You do everything you would normally have to do,

20   because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury,

21   though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for

22   opposing a practice.       What's wrong with that theory?

23                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        I think that that kind of

24   remedy would pose very serious problems under Article

25   III.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?     Why?

 2               MR. SCHNAPPER:         Because money isn't going to

 3   her.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            So what?        She's hurt.

 5   Suppose it was a child that they -- what they -- or

 6   suppose they robbed -- they robbed the -- the judge's

 7   wife in order to get him to do something?                  And -- and

 8   that's a crime, and suppose there was a civil statute.

 9   The judge says:   The way you cure what you did to get me

10   to do something is you make me whole.                  And in that

11   instance, it requires making her whole.                  What's the

12   Article III problem?

13               Well, anyway -

14               MR. SCHNAPPER:         I don't -

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't know that this is

16   crucial, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm just saying -

17               MR. SCHNAPPER:         Well, I think it -- I think

18   it is of some -- some importance here.                  I mean, it -

19   it -- the -- ordinarily, Article III would bar me from

20   suing for an award of money to be paid to somebody else.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's because the

22   award of money to be paid for somebody else, their

23   absence of money didn't hurt you, but where there -- for

24   example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to

25   get the beneficiary put back.            There are dozens of cases

                                   14

 1   where you can sue to get somebody else paid back money,

 2   and -- and why isn't this one of them?

 3               But anyway, I'm not -- I don't want to

 4   pursue it beyond a quick answer, because there are other

 5   things in this case.

 6               MR. SCHNAPPER:         Well, as I say, I think -- I

 7   think Article III would be -- would be a major obstacle

 8   there.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I understood your

10   brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a

11   very expansive view of what type of retaliation would

12   give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly

13   harmed employee.

14               Now you seem to be suggesting that that

15   employee would not have Article III standing to bring an

16   action.

17               MR. SCHNAPPER:         I think we've got a

18   situation here in which this violates the rights of

19   Regalado, but Regalado's ability to herself bring a

20   lawsuit and get a remedy is limited, and that -- that -

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You're not taking the

22   position that she could not have sued for retaliation?

23   It would be awkward because he is -- it's his injury

24   that requires compensation.            But are you saying that she

25   could not have brought a retaliation suit?

 1                 MR. SCHNAPPER:        It's possible she could

 2   bring a suit.    The question would be whether she had

 3   Article III standing to seek the remedy that she was

 4   then seeking, which would often be a problem.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Let me -- because your

 6   time is running -- the Americans with Disabilities Act

 7   has an explicit provision that allows suits by adversely

 8   affected close relatives.         You are essentially asking us

 9   to read that provision, which is stated expressly in the

10   ADA -

11                 MR. SCHNAPPER:        If I might respond to that

12   briefly, you're referring to section 12112(b)(4) of the

13   ADA.    That is a provision directed at a very different

14   problem, which is not associations between employees.

15   It's -- it's directed at employers who might refuse to

16   hire a worker because, for example, he had or she had a

17   child with a disability.

18                 The EEOC's commentaries on the regs about

19   this explain it.    It is -- it is not concerned with

20   employee relations.     It's concerned with a

21   discrimination against a worker, prospective worker,

22   typically because they have a family member who has a

23   disability, and the employer has preconceptions about

24   whether they'll be good workers based on that.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you -

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But the Fair Housing Act

 2   has a definition of injury that would include

 3   Mr. Thompson, and that's not in this Act, that express

 4   language.

 5                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        That's correct, Your Honor.

 6   That -- that statute was adopted somewhat later.

 7                  There are large numbers of statutes that

 8   have rather general language like "person aggrieved."

 9   But I think that, in the case of the Housing Act, that

10   language fairly describes the ordinary English meaning

11   of "aggrieved."     Sometimes Congress does that.

12                  There are other definitions in the Fair

13   Housing Act like that, like the definition of

14   "dwelling."     It doesn't mean "dwelling"; it means

15   something else everywhere else in the U.S. Code.                Just,

16   Congress, in that instance, decided to spell out what

17   everyone, I think, would have understood the word to

18   have meant.

 1                  When an employer fires an employee as a

 2   means of retaliating against a relative or close

 3   associate who has filed an EEOC charge, the employee who

 4   has been fired is entitled under Title VII to go to

 5   court and seek appropriate remedies, even if he hasn't

 6   himself engaged in protected activity.

 7                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Can I ask you this?

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             You -

 9                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Suppose -

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Go ahead.

11                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Put yourself in the -- in

12   the shoes of an employer, and you -- you think -- you

13   want to take an adverse employment action against

14   employee A.     You think you have good grounds for doing

15   that, but you want -- before you do it, you want to know

16   whether you're potentially opening yourself up to a

17   retaliation claim.

18                  Now, what is the employer supposed to do

19   then?     They say, well, let's -- we need to survey

20   everybody who is engaged in protected conduct, and now

21   we need to see whether this person who we're thinking of

22   taking the adverse employment action against has a,

23   quote, unquote, "close relationship" with any of those

24   people.

25                  So what do you do?          Do you call everybody in

 1   from the company and you say, now, is -- you know,

 2   was -- are these people dating?             Did they once date?

 3   Are they good friends?

 4                What are you supposed to do?

 5                MS. KRUGER:       Justice Alito, we're not

 6   arguing for a test that would create a kind of

 7   protection for a so-called right of association under

 8   Title VII.   It's not the case that so long as somebody

 9   is associated with somebody who has complained about

10   discrimination, they would be automatically protected

11   under the test that we're advocating.

12                The reason the relationship is important in

13   this case is because it tends to render plausible the

14   argument that there's a causal connection between the

15   adverse action visited on Thompson in this case -

16                JUSTICE ALITO:         I understand that.     I do

17   understand that, but I wish you'd -- I'd like you to

18   answer my question.

19                Does the employer have to keep a -- a

20   journal on the intimate or casual relationships between

21   all of its employees so that it knows what it's -- it's

22   opening itself up to when it wants to take an action

23   against somebody?

24                MS. KRUGER:       No, I think it's actually quite

25   the contrary.   I think if the employer doesn't know

                                    19
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   about the relationship, any allegation like the

 2   allegation that we have in this case simply isn't going

 3   to be plausible.   It isn't going to be a plausible

 4   contention that there is a relationship between one

 5   employee's protected activity and an adverse action

 6   visited on the plaintiff.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, but you say -

 8   but it won't be because of the degree of connection

 9   between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the

10   means of retaliating.

11                I understood your brief.            I'm just looking

12   at page 6.   The limitation you propose is someone -

13   someone close to him.      The anti-retaliation prohibition

14   "prohibits an employer from firing an employee because

15   someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint."

16                And I guess I have the same concern that

17   we've been discussing for a little while.             How are we

18   supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to

19   tell, whether somebody is close enough or not?

20                MS. KRUGER:      Well, if there's -- I don't

21   think that there's any reason for the Court to try to

22   fashion a hard-and-fast rule that identifies some

23   relationships that are close enough and others that

24   aren't.

25                The question in every case is the question

                                   20

 1   that's posed by this Court's standard in Burlington

 2   Northern:    Was this an action that a reasonable employee

 3   would have considered materially adverse?                Would it have

 4   been deterred -

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But Burlington

 6   Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're

 7   just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in

 8   that case.    You -- your -- your concern is confined to a

 9   particular person.

10                 In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited

11   universe that you don't have any reason to know where it

12   ends.

13                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, it's certainly going to

14   be important, whenever a plaintiff brings a suit like

15   this, both to establish that the employer knew of the

16   relationship and the relationship was one that is of

17   sufficient closeness that a reasonable employee might be

18   deterred from making or supporting a charge of

19   discrimination -

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Why does that matter

21   under your theory?     Let's assume the different -

22   slightly different, that they're just coworkers, but a

23   coworker who has expressed sympathy for the

24   discriminated person, has spoken about them in a

25   favorable light or has tried to defend them.                Would that

 1   person be protected from being fired -

 2               MS. KRUGER:        Well -

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- if the intent was to

 4   retaliate against the person complaining of

 5   discrimination by getting rid of their friend who's

 6   supporting them?

 7               MS. KRUGER:        In that scenario, I think that

 8   that person would have a cause of action but for a

 9   different reason.

10               Under this Court's decision in Crawford,

11   that person would probably be considered to be a person

12   who had opposed the discrimination and, for that reason,

13   would themselves have engaged in a protected activity.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So an opposer is anyone

15   who -- who assists?

16               MS. KRUGER:        That's our understanding of

17   what this Court held in -- in the Crawford case.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But let's assume they

19   did it just in private, but the employer knew it.               They

20   overheard a conversation between the close friend and

21   the employee saying:      I really am in support of you; I

22   know you've been treated unfairly.               I like you; I like

23   you working here.

24               Would that person be close enough?

25               MS. KRUGER:        I think that -- again, I think

                                    22

 1   that's a question that sort of turns on whether a jury

 2   would find the reasonable employee in the position of

 3   the person who had engaged in protected activity would

 4   be deterred from making or supporting a charge of

 5   discrimination if they knew the consequence was that

 6   their best friend would be fired.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't want to have to go

 8   before a jury as an employer all the time.             I want -- I

 9   want a safe harbor.    I don't even want to mess with

10   people that might -- that might be buying a lawsuit.

11   And you're telling me, well, you know, I can't help you.

12   You have to go before a jury and say if this person is

13   close enough.

14                Why can't we say members of family and

15   fiancés?   Would -- would that be a nice rule?

16                MS. KRUGER:      Well, I think that it would be

17   an essentially arbitrary rule.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I know.

19                MS. KRUGER:      At end of the day, when the

20   question is just the question that the Court assigned

11                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, an employer always is

12   going to have to be careful to some degree not to visit

13   harm on an employee for retaliatory reasons.

17                 MS. KRUGER:       I don't think that there's any

18   way to fashion a hard-and-fast rule.              The fact of the

19   matter is that most of the cases that have arisen that

20   have raised third-party retaliation arguments and which

21   are indeed cognizable under a number of -- of employment

22   statutes -- and I don't think Respondent disputes that

23   they are rightly so -- have largely concerned

24   relationships like the relationship between parent and

25   child, between husband and wife.

 1                In one case under the Occupational Safety

 2   and Health Act, it's -- it's involved a relationship

 3   between very good friends in the workplace, whereas

 4   there is a D.C. Court of Appeals decision that holds

 5   that a merely professional relationship that doesn't

 6   exhibit that degree of personal affection isn't

 7   sufficiently close.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:        Very good friends is enough?

 9                MS. KRUGER:      I think that a reasonable

10   employee who knows that the consequence of making or

11   supporting a charge of discrimination is going to be

12   that their best friend at work is going to be fired may

13   be deterred from engaging in protected activity.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          And in -- in your view,

15   could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?

16                MS. KRUGER:      Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do

17   think that Regalado could have brought a suit in her own

18   right, because she, too, is a person aggrieved within

19   the meaning of the statute.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, if that is so, why

21   doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?

22                MS. KRUGER:      Well, for two reasons, Justice

23   Kennedy.   First of all, Regalado here didn't sue, just

24   like most people in her position didn't sue, because

25   mostly people who are charged with the enforcement of

 1   Title VII, as the private attorney generals under the

 2   statutory scheme, will assume that the person who lost

 3   their job, rather than the person who's -

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but I -- I assume

 5   that part of the thrust of your argument is that this

 6   was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was

 7   hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well,

 8   it's not important enough for her to sue, so somebody

 9   that's more remote can sue.              That's an odd rule.

10                  MS. KRUGER:      Well, I think in that

11   situation, she certainly -- she might sue, but she also

12   might assume that it ought to be her fiancé whose job

13   was actually lost who ought to carry the mantle -

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, can't they

15   talk about that?

16                  MS. KRUGER:      They might -

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I mean, it's not

18   like you're dealing with strangers.                That's the whole

19   point.     It's someone close to them.

20                  I -- on the one hand you're saying, well,

21   you only have to worry about people really close, and

22   then your response to this line of questioning is, well,

23   the other person might not sue.              They're going to sit

24   and say:     Well, you sue.      No, you sue.

25                  MS. KRUGER:      Well, the fact that they were

 1   close at the time of the retaliatory act doesn't

 2   necessarily mean that they might still be close at the

 3   time that they need to decide whether or not to press

 4   charges.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But that's different from

 6   the -- the point that you were first making, I thought,

 7   was these are lay people; they don't have a lawyer; they

 8   would naturally think that the person who was hurt would

 9   be the one to sue.

10                  MS. KRUGER:      That's exactly right, Justice

11   Ginsburg.     And I think the other -

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Why is that a

13   problem?     You're dealing with people who are close.

14   They assume the person who was hurt, the person

15   retaliated against, would sue.             Well, why -- why don't

16   they?    You said that person has a valid suit.

17                  MS. KRUGER:      They may not be close by the

18   time -

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             They're lay people.

20   They don't know about Article III.

21                  MS. KRUGER:      Well, that is certainly one

22   point.     But I think even if they were perfectly informed

23   and the rule that this Court announced was one that put

24   Regalado in the driver's seat entirely with respect to

25   whether or not to pursue the cause of action under Title

 2   whether or not she could seek full relief, the relief

 3   that's necessary to make him whole.

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, if somebody in

 5   Thompson's position filed a charge with the EEOC,

 6   couldn't the EEOC tell him you're the wrong person to

 7   sue?

 8                 MS. KRUGER:      It conceivably could, but that

 9   is -

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But EEOC thinks he's the

11   right person.

12                 MS. KRUGER:      Well, EEOC certainly does think

13   that he's the right person.             If this Court were to say

14   that the EEOC's wrong -

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:        If the rule is that -- if

16   the rule is otherwise, why couldn't they provide advice?

17                 MS. KRUGER:      The EEOC is ordinarily not in

18   the business of advising people who filed charges with

19   respect to charges that other people might file, for

20   confidentiality reasons, among other reasons.

 1                 MS. LATHEROW:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3                 Eric Thompson does not allege that he was

 4   discriminated against, but Title VII is a discrimination

 5   statute.     The only person who alleges that they were -

 6   that was -

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Do you -- if Regalado

 8   had sued and said -- assume the fact; I know that you

 9   claim it didn't happen -- they fired my fiancé to

10   retaliate against me.

11                 MS. LATHEROW:        Yes, ma'am.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Do you agree with your

13   adversary that she wouldn't have Article III standing to

14   seek reinstatement or back pay for her fiancé?

15                 MS. LATHEROW:        I don't -- I do think she

16   could seek reinstatement through the general equitable

17   relief of the court.       In terms of back pay, I don't see

18   why she couldn't recover that for him.             But in terms of

19   his coming back to work -

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I would like to see that

21   case next.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Are you willing to

 2   commit your company to that position today?              I won't do

 3   that to you.

 4                  MS. LATHEROW:       Okay.      Thank you, Your Honor.

 5                  (Laughter.)

 6                  MS. LATHEROW:       No one is seeking damages for

 7   Ms. Regalado in this case.           Eric Thompson is here to use

 8   her rights to recover for her alleged discrimination

 9   based upon her conduct.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but if -- you know, if

11   you concede that she could have sued, then what's the

12   big deal?     Then we still have the same problem, that the

13   employer doesn't know whom -- whom he has to treat with

14   kid gloves.

15                  What's the difference whether, when the law

16   comes down on him, it's -- it's she who brings the suit

17   or her fiancé?     He's worried about the suit.           He still

18   doesn't know whom he has to be careful with.

19                  MS. LATHEROW:       I -- I agree that she can

20   bring the cause of action based upon Burlington and the

21   way that the language is written in Burlington.              I think

22   it's very, very broad.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

24                  MS. LATHEROW:       And so she has -- the

25   Burlington says she has to prove injury, that

                                     30

 1   retaliation without injury is not actionable.              So she -

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.    So that's your only

 3   point, not that -- not that it's going to be very

 4   difficult for employers to figure out who can be

 5   protected and who can't?       You abandon that -- that

 6   issue?

 7                MS. LATHEROW:       No.      I think if Regalado has

 8   the right to bring a cause of action, it is going to be

 9   very difficult.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

11                MS. LATHEROW:       But I think that the way that

12   Burlington reads now, and that is whether someone would

13   be dissuaded, if that is harm to her, then she could

14   bring the cause of action.         What's difficult about

15   applying the Burlington standard is you could have

16   someone who is dissuaded from filing a claim but may not

17   be harmed.

18                For example, if an employer announced a

19   proposition that it was going to fire an employee at

20   random whenever someone filed an EEOC charge, I might

21   not file a charge because I wouldn't want someone, even

22   someone who I didn't know, to be terminated, but I

23   wouldn't be injured in that scenario.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So you're saying an

25   employer could adopt that policy?

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are you saying an employer

 3   could adopt that policy?

 4               MS. LATHEROW:        No, I'm not, because the

 5   person who is discriminated against -

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So if an employer says,

 7   now, if anybody makes a discrimination claim, we're

 8   going to fire two other employees just to show you that

 9   we run an efficient corporation out here, you say that

10   that is -

11               (Laughter.)

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- that's proper or

13   improper?

14               MS. LATHEROW:        It's improper, because the

15   person who was discriminated against would have the

16   right to sue.   What clouds this case -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Wait, wait.   Who is

18   the person who is discriminated against in the

19   hypothetical?

20               MS. LATHEROW:        The person who -- the person

21   who filed the EEOC charge.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Okay.

23               MS. LATHEROW:        What makes this case a little

24   cloudy -

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the -- the persons -

                                   32

 1   the two people in the hypothetical that are fired can't

 2   sue?

 3                MS. LATHEROW:       They cannot, not under -- not

 4   under the discrimination provision of Title VII, because

 5   they were not discriminated against based upon their

 6   conduct.   It wasn't anything that they did.           And that's

 7   what Burlington Northern says, that the anti-retaliation

 8   provision of Title VII seeks to prevent harm to

 9   individuals based upon what they do, based upon their

10   conduct.   Those two hypotheticals -

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, why -- why should -

12   in this World War II Nazi scenario -

13                (Laughter.)

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why would the -- the woman

15   who caused the random firing -- why would she bring a

16   lawsuit if these people are really nothing to her?            She

17   just has a guilt of conscience or something?            I mean, I

18   don't see why she'd bring the lawsuit.            If it was her

19   fiancé, maybe, but -

20                MS. LATHEROW:       She may not, but the EEOC

21   could.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           She might not even like the

23   people who were fired.

24                (Laughter.)

25                MS. LATHEROW:       In -- in which case, she

                                   33
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   wouldn't have been injured -

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

 3                  MS. LATHEROW:       -- so she would have no

 4   claim.   And if you think about it, if she was not

 5   discriminated against, then the other people could not

 6   bring a claim for discrimination based upon her.

 7                  What makes this case a little cloudy is that

 8   Eric Thompson is an employee as well, but he doesn't

 9   bring this case as an employee.              You could very well

10   have Eric Thompson as a spouse who is not employed.                So,

11   for example, if Mr. Thompson had been just -- let's make

12   him a spouse, an even closer relationship than a fiancé,

13   and suppose that he -- his job -- he ran an animal

14   shelter in Carrollton, Kentucky, and it was a benevolent

15   organization, but his only source of revenue was a

16   generous gift from North American Stainless at

17   Christmastime.

18                  And in 2003, after Regalado filed her claim

19   with the EEOC, filed her charge, North American

20   Stainless said:     I'm not going to -- I'm not going to

21   give money this year to the animal shelter, to Mr.

22   Thompson, and I'm not going to do it because of

23   Regalado, who is our employee, because she filed a

24   charge of discrimination.          I'm not going to do anything

25   to help her.     I'm not going to do anything to help him.

 1               In that case, under Mr. Schnapper's

 2   standard, that any person aggrieved can bring a claim,

 3   that person, who is not even an employee, because they

 4   have some kind of injury could bring a claim.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but his point

 6   was that "aggrieved" includes not only injury but

 7   wrongfulness.   It may not be very -- I don't know, but

 8   -- nice, but there's nothing wrongful about North

 9   American Stainless deciding it's not going to fund an

10   animal shelter because of some other reason.

11               MS. LATHEROW:        But it's -- but it's treating

12   Regalado with discrimination.            It is treating her

13   differently than it might treat another employee because

14   she brought the cause of action.            That would be

15   discrimination against Regalado because it's treating

16   her differently, but under their analysis -

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            But you couldn't win on

18   that under Burlington.      I mean, I think that there are

19   three separate issues here that have to be kept

20   straight.

21               No one can win in court unless they show

22   there was a human being -- in this case, the woman -

23   who suffered material -- who suffered serious harm,

24   serious harm.   And serious harm is defined as materially

25   adverse action which might well have dissuaded a

                                   35

 1   reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of

 2   discrimination.     So unless she suffered that kind of

 3   serious harm, nobody wins.

 4                  Then the next question is suppose, in the

 5   course of that, somebody else was hurt.              And the person

 6   aggrieved provision suggests, because of the history of

 7   the word "aggrieved," that more than just she can bring

 8   the lawsuit.     That's our first question.

 9                  And then our third question is, if the

10   second question is yes, why can't the whole world do it?

11   At least the barber who doesn't get the haircut anymore

12   because the person fired doesn't have any money or the

13   landlord who can't get his rent or the -- you know, we

14   can go on indefinitely.         Okay?

15                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:           So why don't we get to the

17   second question?

18                  The second question is -- the word

19   "aggrieved" has a history.           I think it comes out of -

20   what's the case?     It's -- I think it comes out of FCC v.

21   Sanders Brothers, which is a 1940 case, which said that

22   sometimes where there's a statute using the word "person

23   aggrieved," that that means that a person can bring a

24   lawsuit even though that person does not suffer injury

25   of the type that the statute was meant to prevent

 1   against.

 2                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, Your Honor.

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:           That was picked up by the

 4   APA.

 5                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, Your Honor.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:           It says "person aggrieved."

 7                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes.

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:           So we have a statute that

 9   says "person aggrieved."         Maybe it means it in a

10   different sense, or maybe it means it in the APA sense,

11   Sanders Brothers sense, which means, in principle, this

12   plaintiff can sue.     Now, you can argue against that if

13   you want, but, I mean, that's where I'm starting from.

14                  And then we can have the third part, which

15   is:    Is there a way of limiting this?

16                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, Your Honor.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:           You don't have to.   I'm -

23   agree with his description of what Sanders Brothers and

 3   hard to do that, because it's in black and white here.

12   Honor.     In -

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Can we go back to basics?

14   First, you agree that it is unlawful to retaliate -- to

15   retaliate against a person who filed a complaint, under

16   Title VII, by dismissing a close relative?               It is an

17   unlawful employment practice; is it not?

18                 MS. LATHEROW:       I believe it -- it could meet

19   the standard under Burlington, yes, Your Honor.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Do you want to get

21   back to Justice Breyer's question?               I don't think you

22   had a chance to respond to it.

23                 MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, Your Honor.        Thank you.

24                 Justice Breyer, I believe your question was

25   the scope and what does this term "aggrieved" mean?                  And

                                    38

 1   in the Sanders case, the Court said that this term

 2   "aggrieved" means something broad, and it is intended to

 3   bring a lot of people in.

 4                  But that case was interpreting the APA,

 5   which has specific language.              Just like in Trafficante,

 6   the Court was considering the Fair Housing Act, both of

 7   which have very different -- than the statute in

 8   question.     The APA says a person suffering a legal wrong

 9   because of an agency action or adversely affected or

10   aggrieved by agency action within a meaning of a

11   relevant statute is entitled to judicial review.               And

12   that's much broader than what we have in this case.

13                  So we have to be looking at whether

14   prudential standing rules apply, and we know that

15   Congress legislates against that prudential standing

16   doctrine.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm not sure it's broader.

18   Why do you say it's broader?              It says "adversely

19   affected" -- "adversely affected" -- or "aggrieved

20   within the meaning of the relevant statute."              And it's

21   that language that says, well, the statute was only

22   meant to protect this group of people, and the fact that

23   somebody else was incidentally harmed would -- would not

24   be covered.

25                  I don't know why you say that's broader.              If

                                     39

 1   anything, it's narrower than what we have here.                We just

 2   say "aggrieved."     It doesn't say within the meaning of a

 3   relevant statute.     You want us to read that into it?

 4                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, I -- I believe it should

 5   be read into Title VII, because that's the term

 6   "aggrieved."

 7                  If someone -- if my husband calls and says,

 8   oh, my gosh, we've been involved in a car accident, I

 9   don't say:     Honey, are you aggrieved?          I say:     Honey,

10   are you injured?     And that's exactly -- exactly the

11   definition of "aggrieved" in the Fair Housing Act.

12                  So Congress recognized, just 4 years later

13   after Title VII was adopted, when it enacted the Fair

14   Housing Act, and it defined "aggrieved" and said

15   aggrieved means or includes any person who claims to

16   have been injured.     I mean, that's really -

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         This is not -- this is

18   not an altogether novel question, because it has come up

19   under some other statutes.           You are suggesting that this

20   is carrying "a person aggrieved" to new heights, but we

21   have both the NLRB and we have OSHA, and both of those

22   agencies have said that to take adverse action against a

23   close relative is an unfair employment practice, and

24   they've done that for some time; have they not?

25                  MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, Your Honor.        And, again,

 1   we're not saying that discriminating against an employee

 2   in taking some kind of action against someone that they

 3   loved is not an unlawful employment action.               It can be.

 4   That's not the position that North American Stainless is

 5   taking.     The question is if the person who was not

 6   discriminated against, the person who was injured by the

 7   action -- can they bring the cause of action?

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Ms. -

 9                  MS. LATHEROW:       And Title VII -

11   your -

12                  MS. LATHEROW:       Oh, I'm sorry.       Burlington

13   makes clear that the interests to be protected abut with

14   the anti-retaliation provision, and that's what we're

15   talking about.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, that's -- that's why

17   this is -- see, what Sanders Brothers did is the

18   interest to be protected against had nothing to do with

19   protecting competitors from competition.               The Court says

20   that.     And it says:   But here is a competitor trying to

21   protect himself from competition; can he bring a suit?

22   Well, normally not.      But Congress used the word "person

23   aggrieved" or "adversely affected," and, therefore, they

24   can.    Now, that's the precedent that -- that -- that's

25   harmful to you.     I'm not certain.

 1                  What about the third part?           I have a

 2   suggestion, and I'd like your response, because I'm just

 3   playing with the thought:          That the way to limit this is

 4   to say that where a person is being used, person B is

 5   hurt because -- in order to retaliate against person A,

 6   okay?   That that is a person aggrieved where person B is

 7   being -- is hurt.     The injury, the injury to B, not to

 8   A, is the means of hurting A.              But where it is a

 9   consequence of hurting A, that doesn't fall within the

10   statute.

11                  That gets rid of the bowling alley, it gets

12   rid of the landlord, it gets rid of the shareholder, it

13   gets rid of all the people who -- who are not the person

14   retaliated against, but they suffer injury because he

15   was retaliated against.         It keeps the people who are

16   being used as a means.        They can bring the lawsuit.

17                  MS. LATHEROW:       And, I'm sorry -- and your

18   question is?

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:           If, in fact, you set in

20   motion hurting Mrs. Smith, the child, the wife, even the

21   coworker, though that would be hard to get past

22   Burlington, if you do that in order to hurt A, to

23   retaliate against A, B can bring the suit.              But if B is

24   a person who is injured only because you retaliated A,

25   that really wasn't the means, B can't bring a suit.

 1                MS. LATHEROW:         But, Your Honor,


 2   respectfully, there's no basis in the statute to adopt


 3   that rule.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:             That is the problem with my

 5   theory.

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                MS. LATHEROW:         I'm glad -

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:             But there are -- I do -- I

 9   think that it isn't so hard to find, in some of the

10   sources that Justice Ginsburg mentioned and others,

11   instances where the only kinds of suits that have been

12   allowed are where it was like a family member or was

13   being used as a means, and there never have been cases

14   where they allowed somebody who was just suffering

15   consequent injury.     So it's quite possible I can be

16   borne out, though I think your criticism is a pretty

17   good one.

18                (Laughter.)

19                MS. LATHEROW:         If we look at the kinds of

20   cases, for example, the Trafficante case, and the other

21   cases under the APA where Congress has used this broad

22   language or has interpreted the term "aggrieved"

23   broadly, those cases are -- the nature of those cases,

24   such as with Bennett v. Spear, the Environmental Species

25   Act, or the Blue Shield of Virginia case, which was a

 3   inflict harm on a large group of people.             So that, under

 4   Trafficante there were over 8,000 people who lived in

 5   the housing complex.      Under Bennett v. Spear, with the

 6   Environmental Species Act, there was more than one

 7   person who was adversely affected or potentially was

 8   adversely affected.     In Blue Cross -

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't see where you're

10   going.    The employer has to fire three fiancés or a

11   larger number of -

12                 (Laughter.)

13                 MS. LATHEROW:       No, my point is, is that if

14   we're looking at trying to compare Title VII and whether

15   or not we're going to impose some prudential limitations

16   on the "aggrieved" language, those statutes are

17   different than the statute that we have in question -

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you know, I don't

19   know what "aggrieved" means.             I don't think anybody

20   does.    Why shouldn't we be guided by the EEOC, which has

21   responsibility for implementing this statute?             And

22   they've come up with their theory of what it means, and

23   we usually do accede to a reasonable theory proposed by

24   the implementing agency.        Why -- why shouldn't we do

 2   situation like Holowecki, where the Court is trying to

 3   determine something about a procedure within the EEOC,

 4   and that is what does it mean for a charge, because you

 5   need some kind of special expertise.            Here the Court is

 6   the expert on interpreting.

 7                And Thompson even disagrees with the EEOC.

 8   The EEOC would say Regalado and Thompson could bring the

 9   claim, but Thompson disagrees with that.            So it's hard

10   for Thompson to come and say let's do what the EEOC says

11   when he disagrees with it himself.

13   100 percent clear he does.         He thought there might be an

14   Article III impediment.       But in -- in your brief, I

15   think you suggested that the EEOC doesn't get a whole

16   lot of deference, and you -- but the other agencies that

17   I mentioned, where there is this claim that can be

18   brought by a close relative, the NLRB gets a lot of

19   deference; the Department of Labor, when we're dealing

22   deference, and they've come to the same conclusion.

 2   agencies where there would be hearings within those

 3   agencies versus, with Title VII, the EEOC does not -

 4   they're not a determiner of -

 6   interpretation of the substantive meaning of the

 7   statute.

 8               MS. LATHEROW:       Yes, Your Honor.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         It doesn't have to do

10   with the evidence in a particular hearing.           Can a person

11   who is a close relative sue on the grounds that he was

12   injured, deliberately so, in order to retaliate against

13   his spouse or his fiancée?

15   don't know the distinction between relying on those -

16   those agencies versus the EEOC, but I do know that in

17   the Burlington Court, this Court noted that the EEOC

18   Compliance Manual -- and that's what we're talking

19   about, is the compliance manual.           We're not talking

20   about a regulation.   We're not talking something else,

21   but a compliance manual.      So, in your hypothetical, I

22   don't know if we're talking about a compliance manual

23   from the NLRB or OSHA, but this is a compliance manual.

24               And, in Burlington, this Court noted that

25   there were inconsistencies regarding the

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, so can the Justice

14   Department, but we don't defer, thank goodness, to the

15   Justice Department's interpretation of the criminal law,

16   do we?

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             No.

19                MS. LATHEROW:         Your Honor, the concerns from

20   the employment side in this case are substantial.                  Under

21   Thompson's theory of the case, anyone who is injured -

22   or what he says is "aggrieved" -- anyone who receives

23   injury becomes a protected party.                 It's not just

24   bringing the lawsuit, but it's the protected party.

25                He's not even a silent opposer in this case.

 1   There were -- there were concerns in Crawford about the

 2   silent opposer and how do we know who they are.             He says

 3   it's based solely upon his relationship.             He has engaged

 4   in no protected conduct.         The silent opposer, assuming

 5   they can have -- bring a claim, at least engaged in some

 6   conduct, but Thompson has no protection under this

 7   statute.   He could have very easily gotten the

 8   protection.

 9                 In our joint appendix, we -- we've submitted

10   the brief that Eric -- or the memo that Eric Thompson

11   submitted to his supervisor just shortly before he was

12   terminated.     He complains in that memo about his

13   compensation.     And this is on page 22 and 23 of the

14   joint appendix.     He says -

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            22 and 23 of -

16                 MS. LATHEROW:        The joint appendix.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

18                 MS. LATHEROW:        He says in this memo:     I am

19   disappointed in compensation this year.

20                 At the time that he submitted this memo to

21   his supervisor, his fiancée had a complaint or a charge

22   with the EEOC pending.        If he had only come forward in

23   this memo, Congress says you would have gotten

24   protection.     If he had come forward and said, and by the

25   way, I think the way you treat my wife is

 1   discriminatory, he would have gotten protection.

 2                The -- the means by which employees get

 3   protection under the statute are not very difficult.

 4   All they have to do is to come forward and oppose.

 5   Thompson clearly had an avenue and a means to do that

 6   because he was taking -- he was taking action on his own

 7   behalf to complain.    So Thompson wants to bring a claim

 8   under -- for Regalado, but he couldn't at that time come

 9   forward and step up to the plate and say to the

10   employer, hey, I have a problem with this.       But yet, he

11   wants to come into court and to claim his rights -- or

12   to claim her rights as a basis to bring this suit.

13                According to the EEOC statistics, in 1992,

14   when data first began being collected, 14.5 percent of

15   charges filed with the EEOC were retaliation claims.         By

16   2009, that had risen by 31 percent.

17                In the Chamber's brief on page 2, they

18   submit -- or recite to a study that was published in

19   1994 saying that the average cost to defend an

20   employment litigation in 1994, when the study was

21   published, was $120,000.       In this case, what Thompson

22   would propose is to give protected party to a wide range

23   of people.

24                And with respect to the Government's

25   position today, at the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

                                   49

 1   they advocated that there would be no limitation, that

 2   everyone would get the protection.                That's a broad -

 3   that is a lot of protection for people.               And I can tell

 4   you that employers who are faced with someone in a

 5   protected party, they are -- employers are reluctant to

 6   take adverse decisions against them; they're reluctant

 7   to implement discipline; they will postpone implementing

 8   that decision because they know that at some point

 9   they're going to have to establish a legitimate

10   nondiscriminatory reason.

11               When we -- when we point out -- when we

12   point this out in our arguments, the response by Eric

13   Thompson as -- as to who gets the protection -- it's in

14   his footnote on page 4 at his reply.               He says that "the

15   identity of individuals who might have a claim is a

16   function of the employer's own intent."

17               So, in other words, in order to determine

18   whether someone has protection, you have to look at the

19   employer's intent.     So there are no protected parties

20   anymore until the employer can establish that they had

21   no intent -- or the other way.              Everyone is a protected

22   party until the employer can show that he had no intent.

23   So what that means at the trial is that there will never

24   be -

 1   employer's intent comes into this.               A is the person who

 2   is being retaliated against, and the issue would be:

 3   Did the employer take such action against B as the A

 4   would think, quite reasonably -- he'd have to reasonably

 5   think that the action that the employer took was

 6   retaliation, was meant to be -- whatever those words

 7   were -- was -- might well have dissuaded a reasonable

 8   worker from making or supporting a charge of

 9   discrimination.

10                 MS. LATHEROW:       But the position that's set

11   forward by Thompson is you determine whether someone is

12   a protected party by looking at the intent of the

13   employer.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, you'd have to show he

15   had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true

16   however he retaliates.

17                 MS. LATHEROW:       That's true at trial, though,

18   after a plaintiff gets past his initial burden of proof.

19   And in this case the plaintiff is going to be able to

20   establish their burden of proof solely by saying that

21   they were a protected party and there was intent on the

22   other side.    That is going to shift the burden to the

23   employer at the outset of the case to prove that there

24   was no retaliation, that there was no intent.

25                 Your Honor, in conclusion, the Sixth Circuit

                                    51

 1   Court of Appeals was correct.           The Sixth Circuit

 2   determined that Eric Thompson, who was not discriminated

 3   against, had no protection under the statute.               This

 4   Court clearly held in Burlington that the

 5   anti-retaliation provision of Title VII is designed to

 6   protect employees based upon what they do, based upon

 7   their conduct.    In this case, Eric Thompson engaged in

 8   none of that behavior, he had no conduct, he did not

 9   come forward on behalf of anyone; yet, he is here asking

10   for remedies, remedies that really should belong to

11   Regalado.

12                There's no reason that Regalado could not

13   have brought this case.        There -- if the concern is that

14   employers are going to discriminate against employees,

15   the response to that is employers will still be held

16   liable and can still be held liable, and that is by the

17   person who is discriminated against from bringing the

18   suit.

19                We ask that the Sixth Circuit Court of

20   Appeals' decision be affirmed.

 1   just have a couple quick points.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Schnapper, in the

 3   points that you're making, would you have an answer to

 4   this point that was made about the burden of proof?                  The

 5   argument was that you wouldn't have McDonnell Douglas

 6   anymore, and you wouldn't know how to proceed on this

 7   third-party claim.

 8                 MR. SCHNAPPER:           Your Honor, McDonnell

 9   Douglas -- the particular formula in McDonnell Douglas

10   was for hiring cases.         The courts have readily adapted

11   it to other kinds of cases where the -- depending on the

12   nature of the claim, the plaintiff produces some minimal

13   amount of information, and the employer is required to

14   -- to articulate a reason.             But I don't think it would

15   be a problem here.

16                 Getting back to the question that was asked,

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I'm not sure why not.

21   Plaintiff comes in and says:               I engaged in protected

22   activity.     They -

23                 MR. SCHNAPPER:           Well, probably -- the other

 1   They retaliated against me.

 2                  How do you -- what -- then the employer

 3   always has the burden to come forth and give an

 4   explanation as to why?        What would be -- the prima facie

 5   case generally is they treated me differently than

 6   similarly situated people, I complained at a time close

 7   to my firing.     There's -

 8                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Well, there has to be -

 9                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- a whole series of

10   prima facie elements.

11                  MR. SCHNAPPER:        Right.       There would have to

12   be some evidence that could plausibly give rise to -- to

13   an inference of motive.         Even if I were complaining that

14   I was retaliated against, I can't just come in and say I

15   engaged in protected activity and was fired.                I would

16   need more than that.

17                  So you would need that additional amount

18   here, plus you'd also have to have some evidence to give

19   rise to an inference that this third party was selected

20   as a victim.     So it wouldn't -- you could -- you could

21   adapt it.

22                  But getting back to what was asked earlier,

23   there's no question the burden of proof is on the

24   plaintiff at all times to establish motive; and as we

25   get particularly far afield from family members, someone

                                     54

 1   closely associated with the plaintiff, it is going to be

 2   difficult to -- to establish, to meet that burden.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What happens in

 4   the -

 5                MR. SCHNAPPER:          These cases -

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What happens in the

 7   animal shelter hypothetical that your friend proposed?

 8   You know that North American Stainless funds the animal

 9   shelter of -- that -- where the wife works, and they cut

10   off their funding, as a means presumably of -

11                MR. SCHNAPPER:          I don't -- I don't -- I

12   think this Court's decision in Burlington Northern makes

13   it clear that the plaintiff wouldn't have to be an

14   employee.   In that case, one of the questions was, could

15   you retaliate against an FBI agent by not protecting his

16   wife from being murdered?          I think that would be a

17   pretty good way to -- to keep people from complaining.

18                But I think the Burlington Northern

19   limitation would -- you know, would have some traction

20   in these cases.     The animal shelter seems unlikely.

21                But the burden of proof is there.               As the -

22   as the relationship becomes more attenuated, once you

23   get past family members, I think it's going to be

24   difficult, even at summary judgment, for these cases to

25   survive.    And -
