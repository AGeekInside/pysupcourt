 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato.

 5               Mr. Miller.

 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. MILLER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The Social Security Administration has

11   reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to

12   provide that, as a general rule, a person seeking to

13   establish eligibility for child survivor benefits must

14   show that he or she would have been able to inherit

15   personal property from the decedent under applicable

16   State intestacy law.    That interpretation is supported

17   by the text, structure, and history of the Act, and it

18   comports with principles of federalism because it defers

19   to State law on the determination of family status,

20   which is a traditional subject of State regulation.

21   It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron.

22               Now, the textual arguments in this case

23   involve the interaction of three provisions of the Act.

24   And the first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic

25   benefits-granting provision.            And that says that under


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                      4
 1   certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is

 2   entitled to benefits.      And that provision has a

 3   cross-reference to a definition of "child" in section

 4   416(e) of the Act.    And 416(e), which is reprinted at

 5   page 4a of the appendix to our brief, says that the term

 6   "child" means (1) the child or legally adopted child of

 7   an individual, (2) a stepchild under certain cases, and

 8   (3) a person who is the grandchild or stepgrandchild of

 9   an individual.

10               Now, I think the one thing that's

11   immediately apparent from looking at that provision is

12   that under anyone's reading, it's a little bit confusing

13   because it uses the word "child" twice to mean two

14   different things.    That is, the first "child" is broader

15   than the second, because the first one includes the

16   second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so

17   forth.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:         Suppose a State legislature

19   got the crazy idea that children born to married people

20   during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under

21   State intestacy law.     Would that mean that they would be

22   ineligible for survivors' benefits?

23               MR. MILLER:       Not necessarily, because if

24   somebody doesn't qualify under -- and I should say at

25   the outset that that is unlike the law of any State


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        5
 1   either in 1939 or today.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:        But what if they did -- what

 3   if they did that?

 4               MR. MILLER:      There -- there are two

 5   alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the

 6   statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack

 7   intestacy rights to establish their eligibility.          Those

 8   are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3).          And 416(h)(3) says that

 9   an applicant who is the son or daughter of an insured

10   individual but is not a child under -- under paragraph

11   (A), which is the reference to State intestacy law,

12   shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was

13   an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that

14   the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a

15   court decree for support.       So, I think --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Those are -- those are

17   obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose

18   parents are not married.

19               MR. MILLER:      That's right.       And the reason

20   for that is that, in fact, under the law of every State,

21   both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are

22   married do have State -- do have intestacy rights.          But

23   I think what the provision I just referred to

24   illustrates is that the term "child" in this statute is

25   a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                      6
 1   the ordinary meaning of the word "child," the concept of

 2   an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a

 3   child, would be completely nonsensical.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:        Maybe it means something

 5   else.   Maybe it means that to the Congress that

 6   initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a

 7   child was a child.    They knew what a child was.      And the

 8   type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child.

 9   There wasn't a need for any definition of that.        And

10   they -- they never had any inkling about the situation

11   that has arisen in this case, just as they had no

12   inkling that any State would go off and take away

13   intestacy rights for children born to married people

14   during the course of their marriage.

15                MR. MILLER:      Well, I mean, I think -- I

16   think those are probably accurate factual claims about

17   what Congress was thinking, but had Congress wanted --

18   the way that Congress chose to make sure that the

19   children of married parents could establish their

20   eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law,

21   because Congress knew that under State intestacy law,

22   those children had such rights.

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Isn't there something

24   sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in

25   the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                      7
 1   stepchildren and grandchildren and even

 2   stepgrandchildren in which State intestacy law is not

 3   referenced?   But you're saying that as to the largest

 4   category, the category in which 90 percent of people are

 5   going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to

 6   State law.

 7                 MR. MILLER:     Well, it -- that's -- that's

 8   what section 416(h) says.        Section 416(h) sets out a

 9   rule --

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, suppose I'm not so

11   convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is,

12   because there are two sentences of -- of section (h).

13   I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress

14   would have specified everything about what -- how you

15   get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and

16   stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at

17   issue.

18                 MR. MILLER:     Well, I think -- I think it's

19   because with respect to the main category of people at

20   issue, the question Congress was asking is:        What is the

21   class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently

22   close relationship to the insured person such that it

23   would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the

24   loss of support that they would likely be getting during

25   the person's life?    And if you look at what is the body

                                                                            8
 1   of law that defines that class of people who have a

 2   close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy

 3   law.   And State intestacy law sets out sort of clear,

 4   easy-to-apply rules for the distribution of estates.

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, they don't

 6   always do --

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Miller, there's one

 8   provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell

 9   me what it means.    It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last

10   sentence of (A).    It says:        "Applicants who according to

11   State law would have the same status relative to taking

12   intestate personal property as a child ... shall be

13   deemed such."    What person is that referring to?

14   Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a

15   child?

16                  MR. MILLER:     That -- that's right.           The

17   first sentence sets out the general rule that you look

18   to State law for the definition of "child."                And the

19   second sentence says that people who do not have the

20   status of children but nonetheless have the inheritance

21   rights of children shall be deemed children.                And as a

22   practical matter, the people that that applies to are

23   people who have been equitably adopted.

24                  There's a doctrine in the law of many States

25   where you have an adoption -- or you have an agreement


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                              9
 1   to adopt, but not yet a completed legal adoption.                  In

 2   that circumstance, the would-be adoptee does not have

 3   the status of a child for all purposes or even

 4   necessarily for all inheritance law purposes, but can

 5   take property from the adopting parents.               So, that's who

 6   would be covered by that sentence, and that's now

 7   addressed in the regulations at --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Anyone else or just that

 9   category?

10                MR. MILLER:     I think -- I think that is

11   the -- the most likely category that it would apply to.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:       I'm sorry.          Go ahead.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You said earlier

15   that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I

16   assume that's not always the case, particularly with all

17   this new technological advancement.              There must be

18   situations where you can't tell what State intestacy law

19   provides.   And what does the Social Security

20   Administration do in that case?

21                MR. MILLER:     The Social Security

22   Administration tries to apply State law.               And --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No.   My hypothetical

24   is that there's no clear answer.           I mean, let's take a

25   situation where this type of reproduction is -- is new,


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to

 2   decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for

 3   State intestacy law or not.         What would SSA do?

 4                 MR. MILLER:     Well, the SSA does the best

 5   that it can to figure out what the State law is, and

 6   then on review in the district court, you know, the

 7   district court is able to review that.            And there have

 8   been cases in which district courts have certified

 9   questions to State courts.         And I think actually the

10   fact that there are those difficult questions that can

11   come up in some of the cases, particularly involving

12   assisted reproductive technology, really illustrates one

13   of the virtues of leaving it to the States rather than,

14   as Respondent would have it, effectively forcing SSA and

15   then the Federal courts on review of its decisions to

16   create a sort of Federal common law of parentage to

17   resolve all of those very difficult questions.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         There was in my memory,

19   and it's been a while, that some States, if not all --

20   and that's what I was going to ask you -- basically deem

21   any child born during the marriage to be a child of the

22   marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so

23   that if a mother has had a relationship outside of

24   marriage, the married parent's still responsible for

25   that child.

 1                 That would take care of, I think, a great

 2   number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that

 3   occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the

 4   biological input of one of the parents?

 5                 MR. MILLER:     That -- that's right.          And, in

 6   fact, there are statutes in a number of States

 7   addressing the question of when a -- yes.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Yes.      My question was,

 9   do all States have similar rulings?               And for those that

10   don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as

11   Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new

12   technology?   What happens to that child in terms of

13   their definition -- of whether they'll be considered a

14   child for Social Security purposes?

15                 MR. MILLER:     I -- I can't speak with

16   certainty to all of the States, but I believe that that

17   is the -- the general rule.         So, I'm not aware of any --

18   any States where, when you have a married couple using

19   donor -- donor sperm, that the child would not be

20   deemed the child of the husband.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       My impression is that, I'm

22   not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision,

23   a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage

24   unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the

25   father.

 1               MR. MILLER:      I believe that is -- that is

 2   the general rule.   And I think one thing that that

 3   illustrates, of course, is that Respondents' definition,

 4   which is also the court of appeals' definition, of what

 5   a child is and the definition that they urge the Court

 6   to apply in 416 is the biological child of married

 7   parents.

 8               And not only is the -- does the "married"

 9   part of that not comport with the ordinary understanding

10   of "child," because of course in ordinary usage whether

11   somebody is a child doesn't depend on whether their

12   parents are married, but the biological part also does

13   not comport with legal usage because, both in 1939 and

14   today, there are many cases in which biological

15   parentage is not determinative of legal parentage, both

16   for the reason that we were just talking about and then

17   also for -- another example is when you have an

18   adoption; a child who has been adopted by somebody else

19   is no longer legally the child of his biological

20   parents.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would you tell me if -- if

22   the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children

23   within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the

24   dependency or the deemed dependency requirements?           Or is

25   that a back-up argument that you have?           Or --

 1                MR. MILLER:      We -- that -- that would be a

 2   question for the agency to address in the first

 3   instance.   The agency has not addressed that question in

 4   the administrative process here.            So, we are not --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           It -- it was addressed in

 6   the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it?

 7                MR. MILLER:      That's right.       And the Ninth

 8   Circuit read the dependency provision of the Act to say

 9   that any legitimate child is deemed to be dependent, and

10   it then conducted an examination of legitimacy under

11   California law.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You don't have a position

13   on that here?    Or -- you want that to be elaborated more

14   by the agency?

15                MR. MILLER:      That -- that's right.       I mean,

16   I -- what I will say is, just speaking in general terms

17   about dependency, the statute creates a number of

18   presumptions that allow basically any -- any natural

19   child, any child under the -- that first -- that second

20   child in 416(e)(1), anyone who fits into that category

21   is deemed to be dependent.         So, it doesn't necessarily

22   turn on -- on factual dependency, which is obviously not

23   present in --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Rebuttable presumption

25   or irrebuttable?

 1               MR. MILLER:     The presumption in favor of

 2   dependency for anyone who qualifies is irrebuttable.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, you rely only on that

 4   -- on that definition.

 5               The section is entitled "Old-age and

 6   survivors insurance benefit payments," and it also

 7   provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits

 8   if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such

 9   individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time

10   that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual

11   has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such

12   individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et

13   cetera.

14               It seems to me -- is the word "survivor"

15   used anywhere in the text of this statute except in

16   the -- in the heading of this section?

17               MR. MILLER:     I don't -- it doesn't appear in

18   any of the -- the operative definitional provisions, but

19   I would certainly agree with you that it is --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:       We use titles to determine

21   the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?

22               MR. MILLER:     Yes, and I certainly would --

23   would agree with the -- the idea that it is difficult to

24   describe someone as a survivor who was not alive at the

25   time that -- or not --

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Nor would -- nor would he

 2   meet the requirements of (C), would he?            Would he meet

 3   any of the requirements of (C)?            Of (d)(1)(C).

 4                  MR. MILLER:     The dependency requirement is

 5   defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not

 6   reproduced in the appendix, but which has the effect of

 7   making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed

 8   dependent.    Now, we don't think that the children in

 9   this case qualify under 416(h).            So, there's no -- not

10   even any need to reach the dependency question there.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Then what does -- what does

12   (d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --

13                  MR. MILLER:     Well, the dependency

14   requirement is something that people who don't qualify

15   under 416(h), people who are adopted children or

16   stepchildren or grandchildren, may in some cases have to

17   make an individualized determination of actual

18   dependency.

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, it doesn's say ­ it

20   says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that

21   requirement.    If such -- such child, the one defined in (e).

22                  MR. MILLER:     Right, but then -- but then

23   402(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent under

24   certain circumstances that effectively track the 416(h)

25   analysis.    And I -- I would refer you on that point to

 1   the agency's regulations defining dependency, which are

 2   404.361, which say that any natural child -- which is

 3   the term the agency uses for that second child in

 4   416(e) -- any natural child is deemed dependent.               Now --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Can I ask --

 6   Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous.              Is

 7   that your position?      Is it your position that the

 8   definition of "child" is ambiguous and that we have to

 9   give the agency deference, or is it your position that,

10   in context, it's unambiguous and even if the Social

11   Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it

12   couldn't, in the circumstances of this case?

13               MR. MILLER:        I think that when the statute

14   was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same

15   structure of these provisions as we have now, it might

16   at that time have been ambiguous.             But the agency

17   adopted an interpretation that is, again, in structure

18   materially identical to its current interpretation in

19   1940, and it has adhered to it ever since.             And Congress

20   has amended the statute with the understanding that that

21   was the interpretation, that everybody had to go through

22   State law to qualify.

23               And I think in light of that history, at

24   this point -- and Congress's ratification of that

25   understanding, at this point the best view is that it is

 1   unambiguous and clearly resolves the question in favor

 2   of the interpretation set out in the agency's

 3   regulations.

 4                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Miller, could I take you

 5   back to 416(e)?    I take it that you don't contest that

 6   for purposes of deciding the -- which stepchildren get

 7   benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we're

 8   just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State

 9   law on those questions; is that correct?

10                  MR. MILLER:     Yes, because those terms do not

11   appear in 416(h).    There's -- there's no instruction in

12   the statute that those terms be defined by reference to

13   State law, as there is with respect to "child."

14                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       And, you know, I'm looking

15   at some of these, the grandchildren one, for example.

16   It says a person who is the grandchild, but only if,

17   blah, blah, blah.    It seems to have just sort of an

18   understanding of what a grandchild is.             In other words,

19   it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's

20   limiting a class of grandchildren with a pre-existing

21   understanding of what a grandchild is.             And so, I'm

22   wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it

23   also true of children?

24                  MR. MILLER:     Well, I should say two things

25   about that, then.    The first is, specifically with


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                     18
 1   respect to grandchildren, the agency's -- the agency

 2   defines a grandchild as the child, within the meaning of

 3   the statute, of a child.       And that's set out in the

 4   regulations at 404.358.

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       I'm sorry, the child of a

 6   child.   The child -- what kind of child?

 7                 MR. MILLER:     Well, somebody -- somebody who

 8   would qualify under 416(h) as a child.

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Oh, so, for grandchildren,

10   the agency is also looking to State law?

11                 MR. MILLER:     Indirectly.         I mean, a

12   grandchild is not expressly defined in the Act, but

13   somebody who qualifies either under State law or you can

14   also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone

15   who qualifies as a child in that same sense.

16            But -- I mean, again, the lack of a -- what's

17   significant, I think, is the lack of any other provision

18   in the statute that tells you how to define

19   "grandchild."   I mean, the -- the run of cases that

20   Congress was concerned about involved children, and for

21   -- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those

22   cases, Congress gave explicit guidance, and that's to

23   look to State law, in 416(h).

24                 Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that

25   the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                          19
 1   cross-reference to the definition in 416(e) but doesn't

 2   cross-reference the definition in 416(h).

 3               And I think there are two problems with that

 4   argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own

 5   terms says that it applies for purposes of this

 6   subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the

 7   Act that we're talking about here.              So, effectively

 8   416(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition,

 9   and there's no need for an express cross-reference.

10               The second point about that is that the

11   structure of the definitions here is very similar to the

12   structure of the definitions used in defining other

13   family relationships that are eligible for benefits.

14   So, under 402, some of the other subsections of 402,

15   there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or

16   widower of an insured person.          And just to take the

17   benefits for a wife as an example, in 402(b) the statute

18   says that the "wife (as defined in section 416(b) of

19   this title)" under certain circumstances can get

20   benefits.

21               If you look at the definition in 416(b) of

22   "wife," it's very much like the definition in 416(e).

23   It says, "the term 'wife' means the wife of an

24   individual," and then it has some limitations.              So, if

25   you were to --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Could you -- go ahead and

 2   finish.

 3               MR. MILLER:        If you were to take

 4   Respondents' approach, you would just stop there and

 5   apply some sort of Federal standard of figuring out

 6   whether people are married or not.                 But in fact 416(h),

 7   in paragraph (1) of 416(h), says an applicant is the

 8   wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person

 9   if the State courts would regard them as being married.

10               So -- and in the 1939 Act, all of those

11   references to State law for wives and widows and

12   children were all combined in one paragraph, so it was

13   even clearer that that was how the statute worked, that

14   you look to State law for defining all these family

15   relationships.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Counsel, I now have in

17   front of me (h)(3).      I don't see how it has anything to

18   do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C).

19   Why do you think it has something to do with that?

20               MR. MILLER:        I'm sorry.           The -- the

21   definition of dependency is in -- is in(d)(3),

22   402(d)(3), not -- if you're -- 402(d)(3) says a child

23   shall be deemed dependent upon his father unless at such

24   time such individual was not living with or contributing

25   to the support of such child and the child is neither

 1   the legitimate nor adopted child of the individual.          So,

 2   the effect of that is anyone who is a legitimate child

 3   is deemed dependent under 402(d)(3).

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, unless such

 5   individual was not living with or contributing to the

 6   support of such child -- which is certainly the case

 7   here; the child had not yet been born -- and other

 8   qualifications.   The principal condition does not exist.

 9   Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting

10   father unless at such time such individual, mother or

11   father or adopted father was not living with or

12   contributing to the support of such child.       How does

13   that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)?

14               MR. MILLER:      Well, because the child is

15   deemed dependent unless he was -- I mean, again,

16   since -- to be clear, we -- we think that the children

17   in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status

18   because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h).

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, that may well be.

20               MR. MILLER:      And --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:        If that is ambiguous, why

22   doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it

23   (h)(3) or whatever the 3 we're -- we've been playing

24   with here -- despite (d)(3), despite that, it seems to

25   me that they don't meet that requirement.

 1                 MR. MILLER:     That -- that might well be the

 2   case.    Our position is simply that that's not an issue

 3   that the agency has addressed and that would be a matter

 4   for the agency to resolve in the first instance if this

 5   Court were to disagree with us on the definition of

 6   "child."

 7                 I referred a minute ago to the 1939 Act and

 8   the structure of that Act, and I think that that's very

 9   instructive because, again, the way that the provisions

10   were arranged in the 1939 Act, as we set out in our

11   brief, were the same for present purposes as they are

12   today.   And Congress, when it amended the Act in the

13   1960s to allow certain nonmarital children to be

14   eligible for child status, recognized that that was the

15   case, recognized the commission's interpretation that

16   everybody had to go through 416(h) and establish their

17   eligibility under State law, and then chose to make

18   express exceptions to the requirement of State law for

19   those children.   No such exception applies here.

20                 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 1                MR. ROTHFELD:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 2   and may it please the Court:

 3                If I can, I'll start with a question that

 4   Justice Sotomayor asked about the ambiguity or not of the

 5   statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not

 6   ambiguous at all.   We think that it unambiguously

 7   dictates the reading that we advance.            And it's useful,

 8   I think, in addressing the case to recognize that it

 9   presents essentially two issues.           One is whether all of

10   the categories of applicants for child survivor benefits

11   that are defined to be children in the statutory

12   definition of "child," section 416, qualify for child

13   benefits without reference to State law, as we submit.

14                If they do, then the second question is

15   whether the children in this case, the Capato twins,

16   fall within one of the categories of children so

17   defined.   And we think that they very clearly do.

18                Congress said expressly that every child as

19   defined by 416(e) shall receive benefits so long as they

20   satisfy certain criteria that are not at issue in this

21   case.   Section 416(e), to which Congress has expressly

22   directed us in determining who is a child eligible for

23   these benefits, defines a child to be (1) a child or

24   adopted child, (2) a stepchild --

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- given that you

 4   believe that 416(e) is self-sufficient unto itself?

 5                MR. ROTHFELD:       We think subsection 416(e) is

 6   sufficient as to the children defined to be a child

 7   within that statute.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          As the child who should

 9   receive.   So, what's the purpose of (h)?

10                MR. ROTHFELD:       And our understanding of who

11   falls within section 416(e), (e)(1), definition of

12   "child," is the natural child, the biological child of

13   married parents.    There are, of course --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, the -- a child who

15   was born during marriage but is not a biological child

16   wouldn't qualify?

17                MR. ROTHFELD:       No -- well --

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Even though they qualify

19   under State law as a child?

20                MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, as to the question of

21   what (h) is designed to accomplish, we think that

22   Congress enacted (h) for children whose parentage or

23   parental relationships were unclear, which would

24   principally have been children who were born outside of

25   marriage, as to whom there was no presumption --

 2   assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased

 3   husband's sperm to -- to birth two children.           They're

 4   the biological children of the Capatos.           Would they

 5   qualify for survivor benefits even though she's now

 6   remarried?

 7                MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, I think that's an

 8   interesting and more difficult question than what we

 9   have here.   I think that the answer may well be "yes,"

10   and I think that the -- situations like that can arise

11   really in -- outside of the IVF context.           That's a

12   related situation.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, that's -- you see,

14   a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable

15   because I don't see the words "biological" in the

16   statute.   I don't see the word "marriage" directly

17   when -- within the definition of "child."           So, where do

18   I draw them from?    Where do I come --

19                MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, let me answer both of

20   those questions.    As to where marriage comes from, I

21   think from a number of sources.           One is the point that

22   was raised by Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, that at

23   the time Congress enacted the statute in 1939, the

24   overwhelming majority of children in the United States,

25   more than 90 percent -- it was actually more than 95

                                                                          26
 1   percent -- were the children of married parents.           And

 2   so, when Congress --

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That would be true

 4   under State intestate law.

 5                 MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, simply as to what

 6   Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child --

 7   and you asked where marriage comes from in the

 8   statute -- I think when Congress said a child is a

 9   child, as I think Justice Alito's question suggested, it

10   would have had in mind the paradigm of a child at that

11   time, which was the children --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But the words -- you say

13   this is plain meaning.      It says the child of a wage

14   earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are

15   importing the term "married," because someone can be the

16   undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried.            So,

17   it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed.            A

18   wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage

19   earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married.

20                 MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, let me say two things

21   about that.   And, first, to continue the question of

22   where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference

23   to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(B), the

24   companion to the intestacy provision upon which the

25   Government relies.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But I thought we weren't

 2   supposed to look to (h) at all.         I mean, your thesis is

 3   (e) covers it --

 4               MR. ROTHFELD:      But --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- and there's no reason

 6   to refer to (h).

 7               MR. ROTHFELD:      But I think (h) reflects what

 8   Congress had in mind in the statutory definition,

 9   because in the provision that I'm referring to, Congress

10   said that if the parents went through a form of marriage

11   that was defective in some sense, nevertheless the child

12   would be deemed to be a child, which tells us that

13   marriage (a) was a significant part of what constitutes

14   childness as defined --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:       I don't -- I don't -- look,

16   when Congress says "child," "child" means child, and the

17   mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most

18   children were indeed children of married people doesn't

19   change the word "child."     I mean, we don't go back and

20   say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what --

21   what their immediate concern is, and here they used the

22   word "child."

23               MR. ROTHFELD:      But --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:       You want us to probe their

 1   were children of married people, that's what they must

 2   have meant by "child."       I just don't think that follows

 3   at all.   "Child" means child.

 4                MR. ROTHFELD:        If I may, Your Honor,

 5   Congress wrote a Federal definition of "child," and as

 6   Mr. Miller acknowledged in his opening argument, when

 7   Congress defined "child," it defined "child" to include

 8   a number of things.      The first thing that it defined was

 9   a child is a child or adopted child and stepchild,

10   grandchild, stepgrandchild.          Congress used the word

11   "child" to have a particular meaning, because it said a

12   child is a child and other things.                 The other things

13   that it mentioned were --

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess

15   the question is, when it says a child is a child, does

16   it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is

17   just a child?   And we know that Congress knew how to

18   distinguish between the two because Congress

19   distinguished between the two in this very Act in the

20   dependency provisions.       It talks about the legitimate

21   child of such individual.         Well, here it didn't add that

22   word.   It just said "the child."

23                MR. ROTHFELD:        But -- and I think the reason

24   it did that, I mean, as -- again, as Mr. Miller said,

25   Congress used the "child" in two senses.                 It used the


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   word "child" in the generic sense:                Everyone who

 2   qualifies for child benefits is a child.                So, it said

 3   "child" is, in that sense, a child, adopted child,

 4   stepchild, so forth.

 5                 In the dependency section, Congress is

 6   referring to all children, all children in that -- in

 7   the generic sense, everybody who qualifies for benefits

 8   as a child.   And, therefore, Congress had to distinguish

 9   between what we say it meant when it said a child is a

10   child, natural child of married parents --

11                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Are there any other statutes

12   that you can point to around this time which support the

13   notion that when people said "child" they meant child

14   within a legal marriage?

15                 MR. ROTHFELD:      I can't point to specifically

16   that, because I think it was clear when Congress used

17   the word "child" that that's what they had in mind as a

18   generic matter.   As I suggested, when --

19                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       I'm sorry.         You can't point

20   to anything because it's so clear?

21                 MR. ROTHFELD:      In a sense, that's right.            If

22   everyone knew what the word meant -- the word "child" was

23   used to define, I think, the category that people would

24   have had in mind when they thought of a child in the legal

25   sense.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Rothfeld, don't you

 2   run into a problem?      Perhaps not in 1939, but since then

 3   this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with

 4   the distinction between children born in and out of

 5   wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that

 6   the distinction between the two is unconstitutional,

 7   that there are no illegitimate children.            All children

 8   are legitimate, whatever their parents may be.

 9                 MR. ROTHFELD:       That is true.      But I think

10   the question is, what was the intent of Congress when it

11   wrote this statute in 1939?

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes, but if we are going

13   to apply those equal protection decisions to this

14   statute --

15                 MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, that -- that may

16   suggest that an unfavorable application of the statute

17   to children born out of wedlock would be

18   unconstitutional.   But the question of whether or not

19   Congress intended to provide benefits to these

20   children --

21                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, I suppose the question

22   is aren't you at the very least getting us into a

23   situation where we should interpret the statute the

24   Government's way because of constitutional avoidance

25   concerns?

 1                 MR. ROTHFELD:      I think that the contrary is

 2   true.   I think that you should interpret it our way

 3   because the Government's application sort of disfavors

 4   children who are born through, you know -- through

 5   assisted means by its incorporation of State law in

 6   favor of --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Oh, it disfavors children

 8   who are born after the father has died, which is in

 9   accord with the title of the statute:             survivors

10   benefits.

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:      But --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       What's issue here -- what's

13   at issue here is not whether children that have been

14   born through artificial insemination get benefits.              It's

15   whether children who are born after the father's death

16   get -- get benefits.

17                 MR. ROTHFELD:      But I think -- I suspect the

18   reason that Mr. Miller was resisting your questions on

19   that point is there is no question that children who are

20   born -- who are, quote, conceived naturally in the marriage

21   and are born after the father's death are deemed to be

22   dependents and receive benefits.            That has been the

23   consistent position of the agency, and we think that

24   that's clearly right.      So, I don't think that the fact

25   the child was born after death says dispositively that

 1   they were not dependent upon --

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm interested as to

 3   what your definition of "child" is.               Is it just a

 4   biological offspring?      Is it limited to a biological

 5   offspring born of a particular marriage, but in what

 6   context?   Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's

 7   question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is

 8   the mother.   There's no question that she bore this

 9   child.   Married or unmarried, does it matter?

10                 Does marriage matter only if it's the father

11   that's the decedent?     What is your --

12                 MR. ROTHFELD:      We think --

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If there is a sperm

14   donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify?

15                 MR. ROTHFELD:      No, we -- we think not,

16   because what we think what Congress had in mind when it said

17   in the first part of clause (1) of the definition of

18   child is the child, the natural child -- and I use

19   natural as distinct from adopted child or stepchild who

20   are dealt with separately in the statute, which is why

21   we think it is clear that Congress was there talking

22   about natural children, biological children -- the

23   natural children of married parents, which we -- as I

24   say, the reason we think --

 1   unmarried who bears a child, this child is not

 2   automatically covered.

 3                  MR. ROTHFELD:      We think that as Congress

 4   wrote the statute in 1939, that's correct, and that

 5   child would then have been referred to the intestacy

 6   provision upon which the Government relies, and --

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Oh, so there are

 8   situations in which you think those provisions should

 9   govern.

10                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Yes.     Absolutely.   We think

11   that those provisions were added as an additive

12   provision as a mechanism for children who do not qualify

13   for the definition to be deemed a child.

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         This is what was not

15   clear to me.    So, you're -- you're not arguing that

16   "child" has just one natural meaning.

17                  MR. ROTHFELD:      We -- we argue that Congress

18   used the word "child" --

20   could give it.

21                  MR. ROTHFELD:      We -- I wouldn't say that.        I

22   think that when Congress said a child is a child, which

23   is the provision of the statute we were referring to,

24   it was distinguishing the child from the adopted child and

25   stepchild, and we think they were doing it in the

 1   context of marriage because (a) that was the paradigm of

 2   family relationships at the time; (b) we think the

 3   reason -- what Congress was very concerned with

 4   accomplishing in the statute was guaranteeing certainty

 5   in the -- in parentage and the parental relationship.

 6               And it set up a system of -- because in 1939

 7   there were no genetic paternity tests, there was no --

 8   it was impossible to be absolutely, scientifically

 9   certain as to who the -- at least as to who the father was,

10   Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether

11   or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the

12   child.

13               The principal one of those was the marital

14   relationship because in 1939, as I think

15   Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very

16   strong, virtually per se conclusive presumption that a

17   child born in marriage was the biological natural child

18   of both the father and mother, of the married couple.

19   And so, the existence of the marriage was a way of

20   establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was

21   the child of the parents, the child of the survivor --

22   of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being

23   invoked here.

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious

25   why you didn't argue a different theory, which is that


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

 1   (e) refers to all biological children whether in

 2   marriage or outside of marriage, and then (h) is set up

 3   for cases in which biological status is contested.

 4                I mean, what would you think of that theory?

 5                MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, I -- we would certainly

 6   embrace it if the Court were --

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, why didn't you argue

 8   it?

 9                MR. ROTHFELD:      I think -- we think that we

10   are arguing essentially a -- sort of a subset of that

11   theory.   Our sense of what Congress was up to was that

12   it wanted to assure certainty, as I just said in

13   response to the previous question, in establishing

14   parentage.   And the principal way in 1939 that Congress

15   could do that was by (a) invoking existence of a

16   parental relationship which established sort of as a per

17   se matter that the children born within the marriage

18   were the children of each of the married -- each member

19   of the married couple.

20                For parents -- children who did not fall

21   into that category, there was this additive provision,

22   section (h), which provided a mechanism for doing it,

23   and establishing that State intestacy law would

24   recognize this child as the child of -- typically it was

25   going to be the paternity that was contested -- the

 1   child of the father, (h) established a mechanism for

 2   doing that.   So, I think that we are getting to the same

 3   place --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What if --

 5                 MR. ROTHFELD:      -- that your question

 6   suggests.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What if the children

 8   -- well, I don't want -- the Capato twins were conceived

 9   4 years after of the death in this case?               Would your

10   argument be the same?

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:      I think that our argument

12   would be the same, but as a practical matter, almost all

13   of these cases involve children who were born relatively

14   soon after.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why is that?   Why

16   would they all involve children born relatively soon

17   after?

18                 MR. ROTHFELD:      They don't necessarily have

19   to, but I think the practical reason why they do is that

20   it's often the case that the surviving mother has

21   children to produce a family sibling for an already

22   existing child as was -- as was the case --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, there's no

24   reason it couldn't take place 4 years after.

25                 MR. ROTHFELD:      There is no reason.           That's

 1   correct.

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, what happens if

 3   the biological mother remarries or something and then

 4   goes through this process?          Does the child get double

 5   survivor benefits or --

 6                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, it --

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Which -- I assume

 8   you would argue that in that case the child is eligible

 9   through two different routes.

10                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Potentially, that's correct.

11   There are rules in the Act that prevent double recovery

12   of survivor benefits.       And so, I don't think that would

13   be an issue that would arise here.                 But --

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Rothfeld, these

15   children were born 18 months after the insured wage

16   earner died.    If we look to other categories of

17   children, say, stepchildren -- and there is also one for

18   adopted children.    For stepchildren, they qualify only

19   if they had that status no less than 9 months before the

20   wage earner died, and adopted children is also a

21   limitation.    The stepchild and the adopted child --

22   there could never be any question of being born

23   18 months later.    They wouldn't qualify.               There's --

24   there is a time limit for the other children.                 And if

25   Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        38
 1   have put a time limit on this, too.

 2               MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, I think that the

 3   question that the Court has to confront here is,

 4   Congress wrote a Federal definition of the word "child."

 5   And it was -- sort of the first question in the case, I

 6   think, is whether we are correct in our understanding

 7   that, when Congress wrote this definition, all

 8   applicants for child survivor benefits who fall within

 9   that category, those defined categories, qualify.

10               And then we have -- if the answer to that is

11   "yes," and so children as defined in clause (1) of the

12   definition, which we think that the Capato children do,

13   whether or not all children so defined qualify for

14   benefits without regard to State intestacy law.         If we

15   are right about that, then that raises the question what

16   is the meaning of "child" in the -- in the statute?         And

17   we think that --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:        The question is what -- you

19   haven't mentioned the text that suggests you're not

20   right, which is right in (h) which says:         In determining

21   whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the

22   Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law.

23               Okay?   That's what it says.         Now, how do you

24   get out of that?

25               MR. ROTHFELD:       Because --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:        Because you say, well,

 2   there's an implicit exception.

 3                MR. ROTHFELD:       No, no.          That's not what we

 4   --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:        You're saying that that

 6   doesn't apply.    And so, I've listened carefully to your

 7   reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its

 8   language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of

 9   why it doesn't apply.      I mean --

10                MR. ROTHFELD:       Because --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:        Suppose that two parents

12   have lived together for 6 years and 4 months in State X,

13   and they have a child.      Fine.         The father dies.    Were

14   they married?    They never went through a ceremony.              Is

15   there a common law marriage?             Might it depend on the

16   State?   Do you know the answer in every State?              My

17   answer is:   You don't know.        And I don't know.        And,

18   therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in

19   order to see whether that (e) is satisfied.               Now, we

20   have to look to it to decide if they're married.               Even

21   you say that.

22                So, what Congress did is it found a pretty

23   good shorthand way of saying where you look.               We're not

24   going to worry about 6 years and 2 months; we're just

25   going to look at their intestacy law.               That's, as I read

 2                  Now, I have been listening to you ,

 3   and I don't see how you're going to save us from

 4   even worse problems, particularly when I started looking

 5   at the state of the artificial insemination and so

 6   forth, and every State has a dozen different variations.

 7   There are uniform acts.        There are things you have to

 8   acknowledge in writing.        It's a very complicated

 9   subject.   And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to

10   read it the way you want.         But I want you to reply to

11   that.

12                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, the answer to the first

13   sentence of section (h), if that were the only thing in

14   the statute, I think that you would be right, but

15   there's a second sentence to (h), which says in -- in

16   applying State intestacy law, the -- the Commissioner is

17   supposed to look at the status of an applicant and

18   determine whether or not the status of the applicant is

19   the same as that of a child.              And if so, the applicant

20   is deemed --

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Where is that sentence?

22                  MR. ROTHFELD:      That appears in -- it's --

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Is it the bottom of the

24   paragraph?

25                  MR. ROTHFELD:      It's the bottom of the

 1   paragraph.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:       It says, "Applicants who

 3   according to such law would have the same status

 4   relative to taking intestate property as a child or a

 5   parent shall be deemed such."

 6                 MR. ROTHFELD:      And that --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:       So?

 8                 MR. ROTHFELD:      But as a child.          Why does it

 9   -- it requires a comparison to someone who is a child.

10   "Child" is defined in section (h).                If -- if -- I think

11   the problem with the Government's interpretation of the

12   first sentence of that -- of section (h) is that it

13   makes the -- the statute circular.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       I haven't found the

15   sentence you're talking about.           Where is it?

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:       At the bottom of the paragraph.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Bottom of what?         Page what?

18                 MR. ROTHFELD:      It is at page 9a of the --

19   the appendix to the Government's brief.

21   say there is no board of tax -- sorry.               I won't get into

22   that.   But -- because they used the word "deemed."              Is

 1   argument there.

 2               MR. ROTHFELD:      That's our explanation of

 3   what Congress was up to in the statute.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes, all right.

 5               MR. ROTHFELD:      It --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.

 7               MR. ROTHFELD:      It was an additive provision

 8   that says that if you are the same -- and I think this

 9   is an important point, Justice Breyer.           If you are the

10   same as a child, you are deemed to have child status.

11               You can't --

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But then, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't

13   one just say, well, first sentence, who is a child?           Look

14   to State law.   Second sentence, when State law treats

15   other people as children, you should treat them as other

16   -- as children, too.   So, the two sentences can cohere

17   fine.   For children, look to State law, and also look to

18   State law to see who they treat just like children.

19               MR. ROTHFELD:      But I -- I think that is not

20   a plausible reading of -- of the text, Justice Kagan.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:        The obvious practical thing

22   is --

23               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, why not?

24               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- is that -- that, you

25   know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't

 1   even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could

 2   do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my

 3   child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he

 4   fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception

 5   for being acknowledged?

 6                 MR. ROTHFELD:      He -- he would not.          The

 7   father here did in fact write such a note, but I --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:       He has acknowledged in

 9   writing that the applicant is his son or daughter.                  What

10   about that one?

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:      I -- I think that the problem

12   is that that has to be during the life of the father.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Does it?         It doesn't say

14   it.   I mean, it seemed to me easier to work with that

15   one than the one you're trying to work with.               But I -- I

16   don't know.   You're the -- but -- but anyway, what I'm

17   worried about here --

21                 (Laughter.)

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         What I'm actually

23   worried about and want you to address is I just -- if we

24   were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned

25   about is many different applicants coming back later.

 1   That's what State intestacy is concerned about.               And you

 2   don't really know who their parents is.               Another thing

 3   is there are already children who are eating up all of

 4   the money.   And then some new person shows up, and you

 5   have to take the money away from the other children in

 6   order to give it to this new child.               And all the time,

 7   you don't know if that's what the parent who is dead

 8   really wanted.

 9                And so, that's why the States have gone into

10   all kinds of writing requirements.                And -- and you want

11   us to sort of -- applying this old law to new

12   technology, just overlook those complications.

13                MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, Congress wrote a

14   Federal definition of "child," and it's not an

15   extraordinary thing for Congress to write a statute that

16   has language that applies in certain circumstances, and

17   the world changes.    New developments require application

18   of the statutory text to those new developments.

19                If our reading of the statute is correct --

20   if what we think that Congress had in mind when it wrote

21   this statute was that it wanted to set in place

22   categories of applicants for child benefits as to whom

23   parentage in a relevant sense could be determined with

24   certainty, and it did that by focusing on the status of

25   the marital relationship between the parents, and it did

 1   it by providing an alternative basis in section (h) --

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, that would be fine

 3   if the statute said what you claim it says.                 It says a

 4   child is a child of a wage earner.                 And you'd have to

 5   import these things that Congress didn't say to get to

 6   what you claim is the plain meaning.                 But what do you do

 7   with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says "in determining

 8   whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual

 9   for purposes of this subchapter"?             The subchapter is not

10   for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire

11   subchapter, which would include (e).

12                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Right.      And I think actually

13   that is a helpful point for us, Justice Ginsburg,

14   because in determining whether an applicant is a child

15   for purposes of the subchapter, it's referring to the

16   use of the word "child" in the generic sense, in the

17   sense -- when -- when Congress said a child is defined

18   to include people who fall in these various categories

19   of children.    So, everybody --

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But how could it do that

21   when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine

22   whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this

23   subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law

24   of intestacy"?

25                  MR. ROTHFELD:      But I -- I think that -- that

 1   these two sentences have to be read together as

 2   accomplishing the same thing.             What I think what the --

 3   it's saying that in making the determination whether or

 4   not a child qualifies for child benefits, that the

 5   Commissioner -- applicants who according to such law

 6   would have the same status relative to taking intestate

 7   personal property as a child shall be deemed such.

 8                  I think one can't apply the statute without

 9   knowing who a child is, because it -- it is directing

10   the Commissioner to engage in a comparison.                It's

11   directing the Commissioner to say:                 Does this applicant

12   have the same status as a child?

13                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, that's exactly right,

14   Mr. Rothfeld.    But you have two choices.              In the second

15   sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be

16   compared to the other, which is children.                The question

17   is, are children described by the first sentence of

18   that, or are children described by the (e) section?

19                  So, you're just reading the first sentence

20   out of the statute and saying that the second sentence

21   totally subsumes the first sentence, and we have to go

22   back to (e).

23                  But the first sentence exists.              And it says:

24   Who are children?    Children are who they are under State

25   law.

 1               MR. ROTHFELD:      No, and I -- I think that

 2   what it's telling the Commissioner to do is to determine

 3   whether or not -- when an applicant who does not fall

 4   within one of the defined categories in section (e)

 5   applies for benefits, the Commissioner is to determine

 6   whether or not that child has the same status relative

 7   to State law as the child as defined in the definitional

 8   section.

 9               The Congress -- as I say, Congress said

10   expressly that a child as defined in section 416(e) of

11   the statute qualifies for benefits.             And so, I think it

12   establishes a Federal standard as to what -- what a

13   child is for purposes of the Act.

14               The Court has to determine what that

15   standard means to apply to any particular child.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, under

17   Chevron, you lose if the statute is ambiguous.             Is there

18   any reason we shouldn't conclude based on the last hour

19   that it's at least ambiguous?

20               (Laughter.)

21               MR. ROTHFELD:      Well --

22               JUSTICE KAGAN:       It's a mess.

23               (Laughter.)

24               MR. ROTHFELD:      I think the problem is that

25   we are dealing with new technologies that Congress

 1   didn't -- wasn't anticipating at the time.           I think --

 2   one of the questions that was suggested to my friend,

 3   Mr. Miller, by Justice Alito, I think, that if the child

 4   who is the -- in 1939, who is the child of married

 5   parents, natural child of married parents, sought

 6   benefits under this statute and they were denied because

 7   some State developed an aberrant law of intestacy and

 8   said that such child would not qualify, would not be

 9   deemed to be the child of their parents, I think that

10   that would have been regarded as a clear misreading of

11   the statute.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How -- do you think that

13   Congress thought of either of these situations as real

14   possibilities?    Do you really think that the 1939

15   Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute,

16   ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally

17   born -- all naturally born children -- or that children

18   could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later?

19                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Well --

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         They weren't thinking of

21   either.

22                  So, the question becomes, given the language

23   of (h) that says define "child" this way throughout the

24   subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its

25   plain meaning?

 1               That's really the argument that you have to

 2   convince us of.

 3               MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, if we have to convince

 4   you not to give the statute its plain reading, then we

 5   will -- not going to prevail.          I certainly recognize

 6   that -- that plain meaning has to control.          And as I

 7   suggested at the outset, the reason we think we prevail

 8   is that the plain meaning of this statute as was written

 9   in 1939, as it would have been understood by the 1939

10   Congress that adopted it, was that the natural children

11   of married parents, the paradigm of the situation of the

12   child at that time, would fall into this category.          Now,

13   it is certainly true, as you say --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But that's because every

15   State law recognized them as such as well, correct?

16               MR. ROTHFELD:      And every State law -- and I

17   would put it the other way:       Every State law recognized

18   them as such because that was the way in which children

19   were understood -- the meaning of the term "child" was

20   understood at the time.     And --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Mr. --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, if we're going back

23   to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that

24   the marriage ends when a parent dies?

25               MR. ROTHFELD:      Well --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So, there wouldn't be --

 2   a child that's born 18 months after the father died

 3   wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the

 4   marriage would have ended.

 5                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, I think that one has to

 6   look at what Congress at the time -- I guess I would put

 7   it this way:    If -- if the Court were to accept our view

 8   that Congress had in mind the children of married

 9   parents, the question is whether any particular child

10   falls in the box Congress would have regarded as the

11   marital box or the non-married box.

12                  Situations like this simply could not have

13   arisen in 1939.    Congress would not have specifically ­

14   as Justice Sotomayor said, Congress would not have

15   specifically had in mind, contemplated, the question of

16   posthumous conception because --

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Mr. Rothfeld, I know that

18   the Government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my

19   curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the

20   requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency

21   upon the father?

22                  MR. ROTHFELD:      I guess two responses to

23   that.   One, as Mr. Miller said, this -- that issue was

24   remanded to be addressed by --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       I understand.    But --

 1                 MR. ROTHFELD:       But the answer --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- that is connected with

 3   this other issue.

 4                 MR. ROTHFELD:       The answer -- the answer why

 5   we think -- and if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, answer.

 6                 The reason that we think we would prevail on

 7   that question is because, as Mr. Miller said, Congress

 8   created a -- an irrebuttable presumption that the child

 9   of -- the legitimate child of -- of a parent is deemed

10   to have been dependent upon that parent at the time of

11   the parent's death.      And that --

18                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19                 MR. MILLER:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20                 Since 1940, the Social Security

21   Administration has consistently interpreted the Act to

22   require all natural children to establish their

23   eligibility under 416(h), either by establishing that

24   they can inherit under State law or by showing that they

25   qualify under one of the express exceptions --


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                   52
 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Miller, what do you

 2   think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that

 3   I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a

 4   marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that

 5   (h) is designed to deal with situations in which

 6   biological status is contested?

 7               MR. MILLER:     Well, I -- the principal

 8   problem with that, I think, is that it lacks -- it's not

 9   supported by the text of what 416(h) says.

10               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But why do you think that?

11   What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with

12   the theory that I just gave you?

13               MR. MILLER:     I would point to (h)(2)(B) and

14   (h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow

15   people to qualify when they can't establish State

16   intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who

17   is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not,

18   and is not deemed to be, the child.

19               So, if biological parentage were -- were

20   what was determinative under (e), and if you only looked

21   at (h) when there was some question about biological

22   parentage, it would -- the idea of someone who is a son

23   or daughter but isn't a child would make no sense.

24               And so, to give effect to those meanings --

25   to give effect to those provisions, to give them


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        53
 1   meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than

 2   just in cases of disputed biological parentage.          It is

 3   in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass,

 4   and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded

 5   it.

 6                The final point I would make is simply that,

 7   even if the statute were silent on whether to look to

 8   State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to

 9   hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a

10   body of Federal common law about parental status.          Here,

11   of course, there's an express textual command the

12   other way.   And it would be particularly inappropriate

13   to create, as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule

14   that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the

15   context of --

16                JUSTICE ALITO:       Why doesn't the last

17   sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that

18   Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of

19   people who were indisputably children?           I don't see how

20   you can get around that, because it says what you're

21   looking for under State law is to determine whether

22   someone has the same status relative to taking intestate

23   personal property as a child.

24                MR. MILLER:     I think the answer to that is

25   the one suggested by Justice Kagan a few minutes ago,


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             54
 1   and that is that you have to read the first and second

 2   sentences together.      And the first sentence sets up a

 3   general rule that you're looking to State law, and then

 4   the second is about people who would have the same

 5   status as children under State law.                So, that the basic

 6   background definition in either case is coming from

 7   State law.

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:        So, if the person is a

 9   child -- you have applicants who according to State law

10   had the same status as a child, a person has that status

11   because the person is a child, and the person is deemed

12   to be a child, it seems very clear that that shows that

13   (h) -- that this provision is directed to people that

14   Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm

15   of a child.

16                 MR. MILLER:      The -- well, the second --

17   maybe, I may be misunderstanding you, but our view of

18   what the second sentence does is that it covers people

19   who are not treated as children, who are not children

20   under State law but nonetheless have the inheritance

21   rights of children.      So, principally the -- in the case

22   of equitable adoption, those people would have the

23   status of children.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

25   Mr. Miller, Mr. Rothfeld.
