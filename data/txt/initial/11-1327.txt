 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN


 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 8                MR. MORAN:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


 9   please the Court:


10                A long and unbroken line of this Court's

11   precedents stand for the principle that a judge's final

12   determination that a defendant is not guilty is a final

13   determination of an acquittal for -- for double jeopardy

14   purposes, even if that determination is wrong as a

15   matter of law or as a matter of fact.               And even if --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do we give credence to

17   how the judge labels what the acquittal is?

18                MR. MORAN:     No.       No.   This Court must

19   determine -- whatever its label, what has the judge

20   done.   Has the judge made a determination that the

21   government has failed to prove its case, as in Martin

22   Linen, or has the government -- has the judge made a

23   determination of something else, as in Scott, for

24   example, pretrial delay.

25                Now, the Michigan Supreme Court --


                                      3

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But once -- once the judge

 2   determines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a

 3   dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I

 4   consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I

 5   can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking

 6   double jeopardy?

 7               MR. MORAN:    Well, you could reserve that

 8   ruling to the end of the case.          You could make a ruling

 9   as to the jury instructions without -- or what the jury

10   instructions are going to be without applying them to

11   the facts of the case; in other words, without making a

12   determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but if I persist in

14   that view, there's nothing the government can do?

15               MR. MORAN:    The government can try -- we

16   learned from Smith -- try to get you to reconsider that

17   view before the defendant puts on his case.          But once

18   the defendant -- once the judge has made a final

19   determination that the defendant is not guilty, even on

20   an erroneous view of the law, this Court has held

21   multiple times that that is a final determination --

22   that is an acquittal, for double jeopardy purposes.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Because, I suppose, the

24   judge is the government, too.

25               MR. MORAN:    Exactly.        Once -- once the


                                    4

 1   government --

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         So whether the unfairness

 3   adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's

 4   been treated unfairly.

 5                  MR. MORAN:    If a state chooses,

 6   Justice Scalia, to vest acquittal power in its judges,

 7   it must accept the double jeopardy consequences of that.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Even when the defendant

 9   interjected this issue and the defendant urged the judge

10   to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate

11   the higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser

12   crime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial

13   judge into error.    The trial judge didn't come up with

14   this on his own.

15                  MR. MORAN:    The judge came up with this,

16   Your Honor, on defendant's motion, that's correct.              But

17   it was actually supported by the jury instructions that

18   were in use.    And actually, it was supported by the

19   structure of the statute in question.              The statute in

20   question, under which Mr. Evans was charged, explicitly

21   said that the building other than one specified in the

22   preceding subsection --

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But you're not arguing

24   that that was the correct charge that --

25                  MR. MORAN:    No.       We're precluded now from


                                       5

 1   arguing that that's correct.

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But you don't --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Counsel often encourage

 4   judges to do the wrong thing.             In fact, in every case,

 5   there is one of the two counsel urging the court to do

 6   the wrong thing; right?

 7               MR. MORAN:       Yes, Justice Scalia.         And --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's what the adversary

 9   system consists of.

10               MR. MORAN:       Yes.         And in Sanabria, this

11   Court noted that point exactly, that all acquittals,

12   whether they're by the judge or by the jury -- or I

13   should say almost all acquittals, some are sua sponte --

14   almost all acquittals, whether by judge or by jury, are

15   upon invitation of defense counsel.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              What -- could a state

17   provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical

18   ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing

19   counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours,

20   and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals

21   to get a mandate?

22               MR. MORAN:       I don't think the state could do

23   that, Justice Kennedy, because of Smalis.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Because of?

25               MR. MORAN:       Because of Smalis.         So that was


                                       6

 1   essentially the situation in Smalis.             You had a bench


 2   trial.   The judge grants a demurrer.            He says the


 3   evidence is insufficient.       And then the prosecution


 4   attempted to run to the Pennsylvania appellate court.


 5   And this Court said it couldn't do that because that was

 6   a final determination.     I think --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, in my hypothetical,

 8   the state said -- and this isn't a final determination;

 9   the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours

10   and go to the court of appeals.

11                MR. MORAN:    Well, I think a state could

12   make -- could -- investing acquittal power in judges

13   could put limitations on that acquittal power.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          How would they do that?

15   I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question.              It's

16   easy when you have a jury because what happens is a

17   judge can decide whether, at the end of the

18   prosecution's case, he's going to dismiss for

19   insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the

20   jury renders a verdict, set it aside.

21                Jeopardy attaches only if the judge

22   dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but

23   not if he sets aside the verdict, correct?

24                MR. MORAN:    Well, jeopardy attaches both

25   ways, but a retry -- a reversal is possible in the -- in


                                     7

 1   the latter.

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         In the latter.

 3                  MR. MORAN:    Yes.

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So what can a state

 5   do -- some have done something -- to ensure that, even

 6   if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid

 7   reversal; if the judge is wrong on a legal theory.

 8                  MR. MORAN:    Well, the easy --

 9                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So give us an example of

10   what, in a judge trial, a state could do to ensure that

11   a legally wrong judgment is still reversible.

12                  MR. MORAN:    In a bench trial, Your Honor?

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         In a bench trial.   What

14   could it do?

15                  MR. MORAN:    I think if -- if in a bench

16   trial, if the judge has the power to acquit or convict

17   and the judge acquits, I believe the Double Jeopardy

18   Clause would preclude the state from coming up with a

19   clever mechanism allowing -- for allowing appellate

20   review.   The Court, of course -- I mean, the state

21   could, of course --

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I thought there were, in

23   your briefs, some examples -- in someone's brief, there

24   were some examples --

25                  MR. MORAN:    In a jury trial with a judge --

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, forget about a jury

 2   trial.   Let's go to the bench trial.

 3                MR. MORAN:    I don't know what --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You're not helping your

 5   argument by saying there's nothing a state could ever

 6   do.

 7                MR. MORAN:    Well, they could withdraw the

 8   power of judges to grant acquittals or convictions in

 9   the first place.   In other words, they could abolish

10   bench trials, which, as the Court noted --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Do you know something,

12   Counselor?   You're sinking your hole deeper.        You're not

13   helping yourself in this argument because how does that

14   help the system?

15                MR. MORAN:    Well, with all respect, Your

16   Honor, the Double Jeopardy Clause here transcends the

17   state's --

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I don't disagree.   You

19   mean no state could ever say to a judge, given --

20   given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory,

21   and then set it aside?     If you think the theory is not

22   legally --

23                MR. MORAN:    After Smith, it's clear that

24   immediate reconsideration is a possibility.         And if a

25   state set up a system, as in Lydon v. Municipal Court,


                                     9

 1   where you have essentially a magistrate making a

 2   preliminary determination, and then it goes to a higher

 3   judge who goes trial de novo, that, of course, is

 4   permissible.

 5                  But if the judge is the final arbiter -- in

 6   other words, if the judge sits in the place of the jury,

 7   this Court has said, over and over again, that a judge

 8   verdict is equivalent to a jury verdict, for purposes of

 9   Double Jeopardy.

10                  So, yes, courts -- a state could set up

11   systems, in which judges have less power than a jury

12   does.   I'm not aware of any state that's done that.                 I

13   am aware of what Nevada has done, which has said that

14   judges can't grant mid-trial directed verdicts.                And

15   that's the way in a jury trial.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You keep saying,

17   "mid-trial."

18                  MR. MORAN:    Yes.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What -- what is not

20   mid-trial?   Some states require a judge to wait.

21                  MR. MORAN:    Yes.         Yes.     Nevada.

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, what happens in

23   those states?

24                  MR. MORAN:    Well, in that case, then there

25   is no problem because, if the judge makes a

 1   determination after the jury verdict, then the -- then

 2   that can be appealed under Wilson.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I keep talking, not

 4   about jury verdicts, but about bench trials.              I want to

 5   focus on the bench trial process.

 6               MR. MORAN:    If -- but if the judge at the

 7   end of a trial renders a solemn, formal, final verdict,

 8   "I find the defendant not guilty," in a bench trial, I

 9   don't see a mechanism for -- for the state to appeal

10   that determination, consistent with the Double Jeopardy

11   guarantee, unless the state has set up a system as in

12   Lydon -- as Massachusetts did in Lydon.              But short of

13   that, a judge's determination is entitled to the same

14   respect.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:       If, in the middle of a

16   trial, a judge grants a mistrial and says -- I'm sorry,

17   grants an acquittal and says, I think that prompt

18   prosecution is an element of the offense, and there

19   wasn't prompt prosecution here.         Now, could there be a

20   re-prosecution in that situation?

21               MR. MORAN:    Yes, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:       Even though the judge says

23   he thinks that that's an element of the offense?

24               MR. MORAN:    Because no part of my argument

25   depends upon the judge's labeling.              What the judge has

 1   done in that case is -- is a mid-trial dismissal that he

 2   called an acquittal, but it was actually a dismissal for

 3   another purpose.     That's exactly what Scott was talking

 4   about.   And that is like Scott, where the judge may have

 5   characterized what he had done as acquitting the


 6   defendant, but he --

 7                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, he saw a phantom


 8   element, and -- and that's what happened here, too,


 9   isn't it?


10                  MR. MORAN:    Well, pretrial delay is not an

11   element of the offense.        Pretrial delay is another part

12   of criminal procedure in this state.

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:       And this -- and the fact

14   that this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the

15   offense, either.

16                  MR. MORAN:    But it is clearly related to the

17   offense.     And then Scott clarified what Martin Linen

18   meant.   Martin Linen was an attempt to distinguish

19   between cases in which the judge makes a ruling relating

20   to guilt or innocence and a ruling designed to serve

21   some other purpose.

22                  The problem with the line the Michigan

23   Supreme Court drew here is that it is completely

24   impossible to administer.         And if I can give a couple of

25   examples, the Lynch case, from the Second Circuit, was

 1   an effort by one circuit to attempt to administer -- to

 2   follow the Maker line, and you get questions that are

 3   completely unanswerable in that case.

 4                 Is bad intent simply a gloss on the

 5   willfulness element?     In which case, all you've done is

 6   misconstrue an existing element.            Or is it, as the

 7   dissent claimed in Lynch, a -- a new element?             And these

 8   are questions like how many angels can dance on the head

 9   of a pin.    They're simply semantics.            It's all labeling.

10   There is no -- there is no substance there.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, there -- that's a

12   problem.    But you're -- to come back to my earlier

13   question, your -- what is your answer?             Your answer is

14   that, if the judge grants an acquittal based on the

15   failure to prove anything that the judge thinks the

16   prosecution has to prove, that's an acquittal.             Is that

17   fair?

18                 MR. MORAN:    Yes.         And -- and I fall back to

19   this Court's footnote in Scott, that courts are

20   perfectly capable of distinguishing between rulings

21   relating to guilt and innocence and rulings designed to

22   serve other purposes.      So if you have a devious judge

23   who's determined to package a prosecutorial misconduct

24   ruling as an acquittal, I have no doubt that an

25   appellate court would be able to -- to smoke that out.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, to come back to the


 2   argument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a


 3   mistrial for failure to prove an action within the


 4   statute of limitations, even though no statute of


 5   limitations defense was raised.         Would that be -- would

 6   that be an acquittal?

 7               MR. MORAN:    Only -- I think my answer to

 8   that would depend on how you rule in the prior case,

 9   depending on whether the statute of limitations is -- is

10   something the prosecution has to prove in order to

11   establish guilt.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:       All right.     Assuming, for

13   the sake of argument, that it's not an element -- it's

14   not really an element, but the judge thinks it's an

15   element.

16               MR. MORAN:    Well, if it -- if it's something

17   that could result in an acquittal, if it is -- if the

18   defendant raising the statute of limitations is

19   something that could result in an acquittal -- because I

20   come to Burks, where Burks says an affirmative insanity

21   defense, the prosecution fails to disprove that, that is

22   an acquittal -- when the appellate court concluded that

23   there was failure to disprove the affirmative insanity

24   defense.

25               That shows that that language in Martin

 1   Linen can't be taken as if it was construing the terms

 2   of an easement.   You have to look at what was Martin

 3   Linen getting at.    And Martin Linen is trying to

 4   identify those rulings relating to guilt or innocence,

 5   which include affirmative defenses or --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'm not sure I understand

 7   the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical.

 8   The judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a

 9   misconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it

10   really isn't.    Then you said the court of appeals could

11   straighten that out?

12               MR. MORAN:      Yes.         That's Scott.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             On what rationale -- so

14   what's the general principle that allows the court of

15   appeals to do this sometimes and not others?

16               MR. MORAN:      If the judge has made a ruling

17   going to the defendant's guilt or innocence and finding

18   that, as in Martin, examining the government's evidence

19   and finding that they have failed to prove the

20   defendant's guilt, final.        There can be no appeal. But

21   if the judge has made a ruling that is designed to serve

22   some other purpose, so if the judge, in my hypothetical,

23   were to say --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Oh, I thought -- I thought

25   it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he

 1   doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an


 2   acquittal?


 3                 MR. MORAN:    That's -- that's a case,


 4   actually, quite a bit like some of the cases, and it


 5   demonstrates the problem of -- of the Michigan Supreme

 6   Court's line.   So example, in Martin Linen, all the

 7   judge said is, this is one of the weakest cases I've

 8   ever seen.

 9                 Presumably, if the Respondent were to win,

10   they would be entitled to appeal a determination like

11   that to at least try to convince the appellate court

12   that the reason the case seems so weak to the trial

13   judge was that the trial judge had added an extra

14   element.

15                 Same thing in Smalis, where the judge simply

16   said -- he granted a demurrer by looking at the

17   prosecution's case and saying that, I find the evidence

18   insufficient.   And, in fact, in Smalis, the --

19   Pennsylvania tried to argue that the judge had actually

20   heightened the burden for mens rea for third-degree

21   murder.

22                 And -- and so -- you know, they would be

23   entitled to make these arguments.            And so then we get

24   into questions of, in granting acquittals, would judges

25   have to explain all of the elements --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I see the problem, but I am

 2   still back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is

 3   my own failing here.     I didn't quite understand.       I

 4   thought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the

 5   case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution

 6   was brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle

 7   of the trial, granting something you should have granted

 8   in the first place before you impaneled the jury.

 9                 But I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge

10   Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment

11   because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had

12   been talking to a witness or a juror or something at

13   lunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal.

14   And I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote

15   Double Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him

16   again.   And I didn't think the Court ever overruled

17   that.    That -- what -- in where?

18                 MR. MORAN:    Fong -- Fong Foo has not been

19   explicitly overruled, but I think it has been limited by

20   Scott.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So Scott says that even in

22   judge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that

23   -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it

24   is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something

25   improper at lunch.    And -- and that's -- that's -- now,

 1   on your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated,

 2   there would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't

 3   protect against the second indictment, right?

 4               MR. MORAN:    Well, Justice Breyer, Fong Foo

 5   actually listed two reasons why the trial judge granted

 6   the directed verdict.    One was prosecutorial misconduct.

 7   The judge apparently thought that the prosecutor had

 8   been speaking with a witness.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

10               MR. MORAN:    But the second one was the total

11   lack of credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.

12   And -- and when the case came --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.   Yes.      That's --

14               MR. MORAN:    When the case came to this

15   Court, the concurring Justice said, the second one is

16   good for Double Jeopardy purposes, but I would make

17   clear that the prosecutorial misconduct rationale is

18   not.

19               That part -- I think that concurring opinion

20   has been effectively adopted in Scott, so that a finding

21   of prosecutorial misconduct on dumping this case

22   mid-trial, yes, the prosecution gets another bite at the

23   apple, assuming that it's done on -- on the defendant's

24   motion.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One -- one of the

 1   reasons we've said that underlies Double Jeopardy clause

 2   is to prevent overbearing conduct by the government.

 3   That's not an issue here, is it?            You said the

 4   government gets one fair shot at conviction.               And if

 5   there has been a legal error below, they haven't had a

 6   fair shot.

 7                MR. MORAN:     Mr. Chief Justice, I would

 8   respectfully disagree.      Mr. Evans was hauled into court

 9   by the state.    He was acquitted, in our view, by the

10   judge who is representative of the state, who was

11   relying on the standard jury instructions --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, this business

13   about the judge being a representative of the state, I'm

14   not sure how far that gets you.           The government is one

15   of the adversaries appearing before the judge, and the

16   judge is not supposed to take the government's side.                So

17   he is not really a part of the government.               And it does

18   seem to me that, if they had been thrown out of court

19   because of a legal error, that's not a fair shot.

20                MR. MORAN:     Well, I understand that view,

21   Mr. Chief Justice, but it's contrary to a lot of this

22   Court's cases.   I think this Court would have to review

23   a lot of its cases, most recently, Smith and Smalis and

24   Martin Linen, all of which said that a legal error

25   affects the quality of a judgment -- and Scott also


                                     19

 1   specifically said this, a legal error affects the

 2   quality of the judgment, but not it's finality for

 3   Double Jeopardy purposes.

 4                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, I suppose the

 5   question --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, I know that --

 7   I'm just saying that that particular rationale for the

 8   Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable in this case.

 9                 MR. MORAN:    Well, I think it is because a

10   citizen has been brought into court, expects to go

11   through one trial, and they are told, sir, I am finding

12   you not guilty.   And then to find out later -- for the

13   state to come back later --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That's looking at it

15   from the defendant's perspective.            We have said that the

16   government should have one fair shot at conviction.               And

17   it seems to me that, if they lose because of an error,

18   that's not a fair shot.

19                 MR. MORAN:    Your Honor, I come back to the

20   language in Martin Linen, which talks about what the

21   purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, is to protect

22   defendants against continuing government oppression.

23   And that oppression arises from the anxiety of having to

24   go through it again and again.

25                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But isn't it -- isn't it

 1   hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten

 2   a windfall here?    I mean, this is not continuing

 3   government oppression and -- and -- you know, that's --

 4   that -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your

 5   client.   I mean, here because of a legal error, your

 6   client walks away the winner when he shouldn't have.

 7                 MR. MORAN:    Well, Your Honor, without the

 8   error, the trial would have -- would have continued.

 9   But I think that argument, respectfully, proves too much

10   because there are lots of these cases in which legal

11   error was made.    And so -- in Rumsey, you could say

12   exactly the same thing about Mr. Rumsey.

13                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Yes, I think that's right.

14   This is -- this is an argument against this whole line

15   of cases, that this whole line of cases essentially has

16   set up a system where the real purposes of the Double

17   Jeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk

18   away with windfalls.     And I guess what's your best

19   argument against that proposition?

20                 MR. MORAN:    Well, once you accept the

21   equivalency of a judicial acquittal to a jury acquittal,

22   you have to accept that both actors are capable of

23   error.    Both actors are human.         Juries are incapable --

24   are capable of making legal errors, as well as factual

25   errors.   They are capable of misunderstanding the


                                     21

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   instructions.    In fact, they are capable of being

 2   misinstructed.

 3               Had the judge not granted the directed

 4   verdict here, she presumably would have instructed the

 5   jury the same way, and the jury would have also

 6   acquitted Mr. Evans for the same reason.

 7               And so to try and tease out legal and

 8   factual errors, especially when -- and often, there are

 9   mixed questions of fact or law that are at stake here --

10   I think, is a losing proposition.            I think it -- I think

11   the Court has decided to draw a firm line, recognizing

12   that an acquittal is special.            An acquittal is the most

13   fundamental thing that can happen.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could a system say, if

15   you have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the

16   case, then arguments like the one that the defendant

17   made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and

18   if they are not made pretrial, they are waived.           I mean,

19   here, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the

20   defendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system

21   had built into it a requirement that defendants that are

22   going to make this kind of plea do it pretrial.

23               MR. MORAN:      Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

24   it would have been right for Mr. Evans to make this

25   argument pretrial because it was only with the


                                     22

 1   prosecution's proof that it became clear that what the

 2   prosecution was proving was that the building burned

 3   was, in fact, a dwelling house and, therefore, seemed to

 4   be excluded by the statutory language and especially the

 5   commentary to the jury instructions from the definition

 6   of the offense.

 7                 Michigan is an information state.            Michigan

 8   does not require an indictment that lists every -- every

 9   little bit of the crime and all of the details.             All

10   Michigan requires is a very simple statement of the

11   crime and the statutory citation and, of course, who the

12   defendant is and the date and venue of the alleged

13   crime.

14                 And so here, Mr. Evans would have had no way

15   of knowing in advance what the prosecution was going to

16   prove.   That's why this case is unlike Lee.            This is --

17   Lee is an effective indictment.             Nobody claims that Mr.

18   Lee was innocent and that the prosecution couldn't prove

19   the elements of the crime against Mr. Lee.              The problem

20   was just that the indictment failed to allege a specific

21   fact.    And that --

 5   proceeding subsection" -- "subsection of this chapter."

 6   And the next proceeding section of the chapter is about

 7   burning down dwelling houses.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          My only quibble is you

 9   have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that

10   he burnt down a house -- that someone burnt down a

11   house, correct?

12               MR. MORAN:     It was -- it was allegedly a

13   vacant house.   And apparently, that's why the

14   prosecution charged it this way.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Got it.

16               MR. MORAN:     So they charged it.       They're the

17   ones who made the choice of which statute to apply.

18   They, apparently, thought that they couldn't prove that

19   it was a dwelling house, so they proved the other crime.

20   And the thinking -- the thinking of the defense attorney

21   and the thinking of the judge was that these two crimes

22   were complementary to each other; in other words, that

23   they did not overlap.

24               It was either a dwelling house or not a

25   dwelling house, and then one statute or the other

 1   applies.


 2               As a result of the ruling of the Michigan


 3   Court of Appeals in this case, which is now not


 4   contested, in fact, the burning -- the -- the statute


 5   under which Mr. Evans was charged totally encompasses

 6   the greater crime because any building is covered in the

 7   crime with which Mr. Evans is charged, while only

 8   specific buildings, dwelling houses, are charged in the

 9   arson --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              It's a sentencing

11   enhancement, is really what the argument is -- the

12   decision was.

13               MR. MORAN:       Well, there --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That every -- you can be

15   charged with burning down a dwelling and you can only

16   get the enhancement if they prove it's a house.

17               MR. MORAN:       You can only get the greater

18   offense.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Exactly.

20               MR. MORAN:       Yes.         But the -- a jury would

21   have to make that determination -- or the judge in a

22   bench trial would have to make that determination beyond

23   a reasonable doubt.

24               If there are no further questions, I will

25   reserve the balance of my time.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

 2               Mr. Baughman.

 3             ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN

 4                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5               MR. BAUGHMAN:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7               This trial here was ended before verdict

 8   from a jury on the motion of the defendant, opposed

 9   vigorously by the prosecution, alleging, essentially,

10   that the crime charged contained an uncharged element on

11   which insufficient proof had been presented for a

12   rational factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable

13   doubt; that uncharged element being that the offense be,

14   for want of a better term, of a -- excuse me -- the

15   structure be, for want of a better term, a non-dwelling.

16               We had -- that had not been alleged.              But it

17   has been conceded throughout the appellate history of

18   this case, from the Michigan Court of Appeals on, that

19   there is no such element in -- in the -- in the crime.

20               The statute that Mr. Moran mentioned, that

21   refers to the next preceding section, over three decades

22   ago, was held to be words of limitation; in other words,

23   you don't have to prove it's a dwelling, to prove that

24   other real property -- a building or other real property

25   has been burned.


                                    27

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1               So in the 1970s, it was held the difference

 2   between the two statutes is the greater requires proof

 3   of a dwelling or a habitation; the lesser does not.    The

 4   judge held that you have to prove the negative of the

 5   element that enhances the offense, in order to prove the

 6   lesser offense; you have to prove it's a non-dwelling.

 7   And, again, that's been conceded to be error throughout

 8   the entire appellate history here.

 9               And so the proofs were adequate -- were

10   appropriate here, and the charging document was

11   appropriate here.   And the question becomes, on these

12   facts, does termination of the trial by the judge

13   constitute an acquittal, so that jeopardy should bar a

14   second trial?

15               The Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting

16   certain governmental abuses that occurred historically.

17   One of them is when the government would terminate a

18   trial that was not going well, without the consent of

19   the defendant, in order to take another shot at it -- to

20   build a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder.

21               And the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits

22   that kind of conduct by establishing, through this

23   Court's cases, that mistrials without the consent of the

24   defendant bar retrial, that abhorrent practice is

25   barred, unless a manifest necessity is shown.


                                    28

 1               And we've even extended that to the

 2   circumstance that, if the judge is intending to help the

 3   defendant, if he is doing something that he believes is

 4   in defendant's favor, if defendant has not consented,

 5   then that valued right to a verdict from the tribunal

 6   that he is before trumps everything.

 7               But if there is consent, as there was in

 8   this case -- the defendant asked the judge to terminate

 9   the trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his

10   valued right to a decision by this tribunal -- if he

11   does that, then that -- the other side of that coin is,

12   that is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way.

13               A retrial is permissible, unless the

14   government has achieved the first harm by the back door;

15   that is, by goading the defendant into the mistrial.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:         So if -- if the judge did

17   this on her own, that would have been okay?        And there

18   would be Double Jeopardy attaching?

19               MR. BAUGHMAN:      That's correct.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:         So we have to decide in

21   each case whether the defendant was the initiating

22   source of the error?

23               MR. BAUGHMAN:      In terms of the -- whether or

24   not a judgment of acquittal was granted, yes, both the

25   Federal rule and the Michigan rule provide that, on the


                                   29

 1   defendant's motion or on the court's own motion, the

 2   court may grant a directed verdict.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what if the

 4   defendant just agrees with the judge?               The judge says --

 5   you know, I think this indictment is bad because you --

 6   you have to show that it wasn't a dwelling place, and

 7   the counsel for the Defendant says, yes, that seems like

 8   a good -- a good idea.        Is -- is that enough to --

 9                MR. BAUGHMAN:         I think that would be enough.

10   I think agreement with the judge's course of action

11   would be the judge -- would be, as in the mistrial

12   situation, would be the defendant's --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, my goodness,

14   disagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it?

15                (Laughter.)

16                MR. BAUGHMAN:         Well, it -- it depends on

17   whether you really wish to get a verdict from this jury

18   or whether you risk having a -- risk -- risk wanting to

19   have a retrial before a different factfinder.              You may

20   be very happy with --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            A bird in the hand,

22   counsel.   I -- I --

23                MR. BAUGHMAN:         Sometimes, that bird in the

24   hand can come back and bite you, when you have a second

25   trial.

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Baughman, what would

 2   happen if the defendant asked for improper instructions,

 3   really saying exactly something like this -- you know,

 4   that the jury has to find this additional element that,

 5   in fact, it doesn't have to find?            But your theory, I

 6   would think, would say that too, the government could

 7   try the defendant again.       After all, the government

 8   didn't get its one fair shot.

 9               MR. BAUGHMAN:        That -- that's correct.      And

10   that -- that's the logic of Justice Holmes' position in

11   Kepner, and we don't go that far, essentially because

12   this isn't a jury case.       There is a logic to that

13   position, but it is -- there's --

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:         You don't go that far, in

15   other words, just because it doesn't happen to be this

16   case.

17               MR. BAUGHMAN:        That's correct.

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But do you concede that the

19   logic of your position would extend to improperly

20   instructed juries?

21               MR. BAUGHMAN:        It would, to a certain

22   extent, but it is -- it is cut off by two facts.            One is

23   simply, as -- as Justice Holmes often said, the -- the

24   life -- an ounce of -- I'm -- excuse me -- an ounce of

25   logic is often trumped by a pound of history.            We have


                                     31

 1   historically said that a verdict by the factfinder, by

 2   the jury, terminates jeopardy, and there is no inquiry

 3   into --

 4                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, we've historically

 5   said it in this context, too.           I mean, the cases that

 6   you are asking us to overrule go back 50 years.

 7                MR. BAUGHMAN:      Well, when I say

 8   historically, I mean back to the time of the founding,

 9   in terms of when the Double Jeopardy Clause was

10   promulgated and adopted into the Constitution.

11   Fifty years is not back to when we were determining what

12   it is we were protecting against when we adopted the

13   clause.

14                And as I think most of the commentators have

15   noted, there is very little explanation in Fong Foo as

16   to how the Court came out where it came out, and there

17   has been very little explanation since as to how we got

18   from the common law prohibition of a retrial after

19   acquittal on the merits by a jury, to a ruling of law by

20   the judge that no jury could find guilt beyond a

21   reasonable doubt being the same thing, which is where we

22   are today.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You cannot necessarily --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, we didn't have it, at

25   the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to


                                    32

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   do that.    I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and

 2   how it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was

 3   certainly a -- an open question.

 4                 It's not as though this procedure existed at

 5   the time of the founding or in English law before then

 6   and was never adequate to -- to constitute Double

 7   Jeopardy.    It's a new procedure introduced, so the

 8   question for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's

 9   the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the

10   acquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy?

11                 MR. BAUGHMAN:      Well, I think you are exactly

12   right.   It, of course, is a new procedure.              It didn't

13   exist at the time of the founding.                So our question then

14   becomes is this new procedure sufficiently equivalent to

15   that procedure that is historically protected, that

16   it's -- that the protections that it is designed to

17   guard against are served when we bar retrial in these

18   circumstances?

19                 And I think, as Justice Kagan has indicated,

20   there are many circumstances where what -- what we are

21   doing is giving the defendant a windfall while serving

22   no interest that was protected by the Jeopardy Clause.

23   So if it's to be an analog, then we need to see does it

24   really closely approximate a retrial after acquittal on

25   the merits by a jury --


                                     33

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But the point I was making

 2   was that the same windfall is received by the defendant

 3   that gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed

 4   jury.

 5                MR. BAUGHMAN:        But -- that is true, except

 6   we -- we could speculate that's -- that's true, but we

 7   don't know why the jury came back the way it did.              The

 8   jury may have acquitted for an entirely different

 9   reason.   We don't know.       We don't have special verdicts,

10   and we don't have any mechanism for inquiring, so we

11   treat -- you have to have a line somewhere.           Jeopardy

12   terminates with the jury verdict, which may have been

13   misinstructed, but we don't know why they came out the

14   way they did.

15                If they --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           Now -- now, I take it

17   you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the

18   prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but

19   they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so --

20   because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough

21   evidence, and so the prosecutor thinks, I think I'd like

22   to try him again, and then he's acquitted again.           I'd

23   like to try him again, and he's acquitted again.

24                Now, substitute judge for jury, the same

25   thing could happen.      I mean, I don't see why not.          And


                                      34

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   there's no answer to that, is there?              And if there's no

 2   answer to that, the same bad thing could happen.              Well,

 3   then you're going to have to start distinguishing among

 4   which judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the

 5   problem of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

 6                And where I'm driving is that -- that there

 7   is a principle, and the principle was -- it seems the

 8   simplest way to put it, is where in fact the acquittal

 9   rests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence,

10   that's it.   That's what we're after.             And where it's

11   some procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't.              Okay.

12                Now, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's

13   consistent with the cases, it's been clear.              And you're

14   advocating, let's go into that and change it or at least

15   interpret the cases that's consistent with it.              And

16   we're saying there wasn't enough evidence, is because

17   the judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong

18   about, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work.              But if

19   the judge was right, it does work.               Well, except for the

20   matter of substantive evidence.          Now, that way, as your

21   opponent, lies a mess.

22                I just went through that long thing because

23   I don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing

24   what I see as a central problem, namely, if we don't

25   accept his view, it's going to be a terrible mess.

 1               MR. BAUGHMAN:        Well, let me say two things.

 2   One is we don't -- we don't have the circumstance that

 3   existed at the common law that the Jeopardy Clause was

 4   designed to protect against of the executive simply

 5   saying, after an acquittal by the factfinder, let's try

 6   him again, let's try him again, let's try him again.

 7               Something has to happen in-between there,

 8   and that is that a court has to determine -- neutral and

 9   detached arbiters have to determine that what happened

10   when the judge granted the directed verdict of

11   acquittal, as it's known in Michigan, was not that at

12   all.

13               The judge actually did something different.

14   And if the court doesn't interpose on the prosecution's

15   request, there will be no retrial.                So it's not the

16   harassment and abusive practice of simply starting a new

17   prosecution, we're trying to get what happened in

18   that --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, you're beginning to

20   make distinctions.

21               MR. BAUGHMAN:        Yes.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:           And once you make those

23   distinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which

24   was there is a distinction.           The distinction is whether

25   it's a procedural ground or -- and Justice Harlan's --


                                     36

 1   it's whether there was -- "Just talk to the U.S.

 2   attorney, I didn't like it," or "Talk to the witness,"

 3   or "The prosecution brought too late."

 4               The other side of it, where the clause

 5   attaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis,

 6   not enough evidence.   I said -- I don't want to repeat

 7   myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a

 8   simple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases,

 9   and why shouldn't we follow it?

10               MR. BAUGHMAN:      Well, I think -- I think

11   consistent with the cases, and also clear, is to apply

12   Martin Linen Supply by the very terms that it uses; that

13   is, the resolution that we're talking about the judge

14   making is moored to something.           It's moored to the

15   elements of the crime.    We're talking about somebody

16   being twice tried for the same offense.           How do we

17   define offense in the law?

18               In other Double Jeopardy cases, this Court

19   has taken an elements approach.           Two -- two offenses

20   are -- are different if one requires proof of an

21   element, the other does not.           We look to the elements.

22   And to direct a jury trial, this Court has been very

23   active very recently in determining how is it that we

24   determine when somebody has a right to a jury trial on

25   some fact before punishment can be imposed?           We look to


                                   37

 1   what are the elements that have to be proven beyond a

 2   reasonable doubt.

 3                If a fact is necessary to -- to -- in order

 4   for punishment to be imposed, if that has to be proven,

 5   then it is a matter for jury trial and it has to be

 6   proven beyond a reasonable doubt.           So when this Court

 7   said one or more of the factual elements of the offense

 8   in Martin Linen Supply, I took it to mean -- and I have

 9   always taken it to mean -- one or more of the factual

10   elements.   And we can identify what those are.          We have

11   to identify them in every case.

12                This is not a -- a strange process you have

13   to instruct on them, determine what they are and use

14   those --

15                JUSTICE ALITO:       If the judge -- if the judge

16   simply misinterprets one of the elements, but doesn't

17   add a new element, you say that there would be Double

18   Jeopardy there, right?

19                MR. BAUGHMAN:      Yes.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:       Isn't that going to be a

21   very difficult line to draw?

22                MR. BAUGHMAN:      It can be a very difficult

23   line to draw, but all tests can sometimes involve

24   difficult lines to draw.      We used to have a no evidence

25   test for whether evidence was sufficient and we -- that


                                    38

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was changed in Jackson v. Virginia, to whether a

 2   reasonable juror could find guilt beyond a reasonable

 3   doubt.

 4               And you will find a great many dissents in

 5   cases between appellate judges on whether or not this

 6   case itself involved sufficient proof for a jury to find

 7   guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.            The test is not always

 8   easily -- easily applicable.            And neither was the no

 9   evidence test.   So there might be some --

10               JUSTICE ALITO:        Let me give you an example.

11   Suppose the -- a statute makes it a crime to burn down a

12   dwelling, and the judge interprets dwelling to mean a

13   building that is currently lived in and, therefore, not

14   including a vacation home.        And let's assume that's an

15   incorrect interpretation.

16               Now, is that an incorrect interpretation?

17   Or is that the addition of a new element to the statute,

18   namely, that it is a building in which people -- that's

19   one element, and the other is people are currently

20   living there?

21               MR. BAUGHMAN:       I -- I would define -- I

22   would draw the line at any time the court requires the

23   prosecution to prove a fact that, under the law passed

24   by the legislature, the prosecution never has to prove

25   in order to make out the case.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that's every

 2   misinterpretation.    I mean, I don't know why this case

 3   doesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the

 4   elements of the crime are.         I mean, any

 5   misinterpretation, you can -- which goes beyond the

 6   minimum that the -- that the statute requires, can be

 7   recharacterized as adding an additional element.

 8               MR. BAUGHMAN:        Well, it does involve a -- a

 9   mischaracterization of what the elements were, but not

10   of an element.   The judge didn't here say, you can't

11   prove that this is a building, unless it was a dwelling,

12   you can't prove it was real property unless it was a

13   dwelling.

14               The judge said, you have -- you can prove

15   those things, and it's not enough, you also have to

16   prove that it was a non-dwelling in this case.

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But in several of our cases,

18   what the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution

19   prove additional facts in order to prove an element.             So

20   the distinction that you're drawing is one between

21   incorrectly making the prosecution prove additional

22   facts and incorrectly saying that the prosecution has to

23   show an additional element.           And I guess I just don't

24   understand that distinction.

25               MR. BAUGHMAN:        Well, I would suggest that

 1   this is an opportunity for this Court to draw the line

 2   at does -- does the judge require -- has the judge

 3   required the prosecution to prove something the statute

 4   doesn't require to be proven, it's not one of the

 5   factual elements of the offense.

 6               Or has the judge -- the error the judge can

 7   make under Martin Linen Supply -- has the judge simply

 8   misassessed the evidence?      The judge has looked at it

 9   and said -- you know, I -- I understand all your proofs,

10   I'm looking at them, and they're just not enough for a

11   reasonable juror to find guilt --

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, if I understand your

13   test correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis, and

14   Smith would all have come out differently.

15               MR. BAUGHMAN:      No, I don't think so.      Rumsey

16   is -- is a difficult case, but Rumsey is a verdict case.

17   Rumsey is not a directed verdict case.          The judge in

18   Rumsey was the factfinder.       Rumsey is your bench trial.

19   It's -- it's -- it's complicated because it was a

20   sentencing case -- a death penalty sentencing case that

21   this Court treats the hearing the same as the trial for

22   Double Jeopardy purposes.

23               But the judge was the factfinder, and it was

24   more like a misinstructed jury.         The judge himself --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:         So you're saying that


                                   41

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   your -- your approach doesn't solve the bench trial

 2   problem any more than your friend's approach, right?

 3               MR. BAUGHMAN:        A verdict is a verdict, I

 4   agree with Mr. Moran.      When the judge on the merits

 5   returns a verdict, what the judge does or the jury does

 6   in returning a verdict on the merits is very different

 7   when what the judge does on a judgment of acquittal.

 8               The jury weighs credibility and assesses the

 9   weight of evidence, and the judge is prohibited from

10   doing those things -- is supposed to be by the law, in

11   making his decision.     His is the ruling of law as

12   gatekeeper, that -- that we won't even reach this

13   decision.

14               The jury is expressing its opinion based on

15   the evidence.   And although it can be proven that

16   they've reached a result contrary to reality, they can't

17   be right or wrong.    Legally, their opinion is their

18   opinion of those 12 collective people after doing

19   something the judge isn't allowed to do.

20               So the directed verdict isn't, I don't

21   think, a perfect analog to the jury trial.          But the

22   bench trial issue gets very complicated because it is

23   possible to do something with a bench trial that we

24   don't do with jury trials, and that is have specific

25   factfinding as to the elements.           Many jurisdictions do.


                                     42

 1                  There is, in fact, a case -- the Lynch case

 2   that Mr. Moran cited, where, on rehearing en banc, the

 3   court split evenly as to whether or not the judge's

 4   verdict, where the judge had actually specifically found

 5   all of the elements -- the crime is elements A, B, and

 6   C, I find them; I don't find element B, so I acquit --

 7   the court split five to five on rehearing en banc and

 8   whether or not that judge had really announced two

 9   verdicts and it could be reformed -- be reformed to a

10   conviction.

11                  And Justice Sotomayor was one of the members

12   of the five who would have addressed the question of, is

13   that not different?      The form of the language doesn't

14   control.   Has not the judge actually entered a guilty

15   verdict in that circumstance?

16                  That's a very -- you know, kind of

17   off-the-beaten-track kind of a situation.          In a jury

18   trial, where a judge simply takes the case from the jury

19   on the motion of the defendant and resolves the fact

20   that the legislature has not said that one needs to be

21   proven, that is not one of the constituent parts of the

22   crime, that is not something that need be proven to

23   impose punishment under the law, then he's done

24   something very different than what the jury has done.

25                 And to reverse that and allow the

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS F. GANNON,

 8                FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 9                     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

10                  MR. GANNON:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                  We believe the Court can resolve this case

13   by distinguishing between the misconstruction of an

14   element and the erroneous addition of an element to the

15   case.   But if the Court's unwilling to draw that

16   particular distinction, it could also resolve the case

17   by allowing the government to appeal in both of those

18   instances.    This goes to the question that Justice Kagan

19   was asking near the end of my friend's argument.

20                  We don't think that that would require

21   overruling any of the Court's cases.                We think it would

22   require narrowing Smalis and Rumsey to their facts,

23   and -- and -- but Smith would not be a problem in that

24   context.

25                  Rumsey is distinct for the reason that my

 1   friend suggested.    It was actually a case involving

 2   factfindings by the judge.         The Court characterized it

 3   as a special verdict made by the sole decisionmaker

 4   there.    It was not an instance like this, where the

 5   judge had taken the case away, as a matter of law, from

 6   the jury because there wouldn't be any sufficient

 7   evidence.   It has been cited later on in this cases, in

 8   particular, in Smalis, as being about something like a

 9   sufficiency decision, but on its facts, that's not what

10   it was.

11                 Smith is about a completely separate

12   question because there is no dispute there about the

13   appropriate construction of the element.            The firearms

14   offense there, the element in question was whether the

15   barrel length was less than 13 inches.            There was a

16   question about whether certain evidence that the firearm

17   in question was a pistol was sufficient to satisfy that

18   burden, but there was no doubt about what the -- what

19   the element was.    It was 13 inches or less.          And so it

20   wasn't about misconstruing the element.

21                 Smalis is probably the hardest case in this

22   context, but if you look at what actually happened in

23   Smalis and what was at issue in the demurrer there, the

24   decision that the Court was reviewing was one that was

25   principally about whether there was sufficient evidence


                                     45

 1   of causation, which was an undisputed element of each of

 2   the counts at issue there, and only in footnote 7 of the

 3   Court's opinion did it address potential misconstruction

 4   of the element.

 5                And it was a different element.           This was

 6   what my -- my friend Mr. Moran mentioned --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:          Let's go through this.     My

 8   basic question:    Normally, a judge will wait till the

 9   jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him,

10   whether to set it aside.       So there's no problem.       So

11   now, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this

12   judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in

13   the middle of the case.

14                Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope.

15   And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing

16   down his reasons.    So he might just say there isn't

17   enough evidence.    And now, it happens that, just before

18   he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an

19   erroneous theory.    All right.          An added element or

20   something or other, some kind of misconstruction of

21   this.   What happens then?

22                MR. GANNON:      Well, I think that we -- we

23   normally expect judges to give reasons for their

24   decisions.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes.   But this a judge,

 1   after all, who for some reason -- we don't know what --

 2   decided, instead of waiting, as they normally would do,

 3   grant it in the middle of the case.

 4                  MR. GANNON:     Well, in the -- in the State of

 5   Michigan, the rule does not permit the judge to reserve

 6   the ruling on this motion.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Oh, I see.    So there are a

 8   lot more places --

 9                  MS. GANNON:     So -- and actually, in the vast

10   majority of states --

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:         They do.    They --

12                  MR. GANNON:     -- that's the rule.        The

13   Federal rule was only changed in 1994, to allow this

14   type of --

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:         And then this is a --

16                  MS. GANNON:     -- decision to be reserved

17   after trial.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:         This has arisen a lot more

19   than -- than I think.

20                  All right.    Fine.        Thank you.

22   context --

24   have to write it down?

 1   rule in Michigan, and in the Federal Rule 29, does

 2   require the judge to make a determination of -- to

 3   satisfy that -- that there's an acquittal, which would

 4   mean that there is no -- no sufficient evidence to -- to

 5   support a guilty --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But many states have a

 7   different rule.

 8               MR. GANNON:        Many -- many states --

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            And many states permit

10   the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict.

11               MR. GANNON:        My -- my understanding is that

12   most states do not permit that.            The Federal government

13   only started permitting that in 1994, and even the last

14   time the Justice Department studied this, about ten

15   years ago, it concluded that, notwithstanding the 1994

16   rule amendment in the Federal rules, which came with

17   advisory committee notes, strongly encouraging judges to

18   reserve these sorts of decisions precisely to preserve

19   the public's interest.       So notwithstanding --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            So then, in other words,

21   when an acquittal --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Finish the sentence.

23   Notwithstanding that, what?

24               MR. GANNON:        Notwithstanding that, in

25   approximately 70 percent of the cases in which there are

 1   Rule 29 verdicts, they are done mid-trial, even in the

 2   Federal system, at least in the early 2000s, is the only

 3   data collection that I'm aware of.

 4                  And so this -- this still is a problem.        I

 5   think that if -- if it looks like the decision is based

 6   on classic insufficiency of the evidence and there is no

 7   argument about whether it was -- it's based on a

 8   misconstruction or an erroneous addition of the

 9   elements, then we -- we would have to be -- we would

10   lose, unless the Court's willing to overturn the broader

11   line of cases in Martin Linens, Sanabria, Scott, and the

12   other cases that were --

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Can you add to that -- your

14   -- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in

15   the last 30 or 40 years?        Have most U.S. prosecutors or

16   prosecutors in these states thought that they could

17   appeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial

18   on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law?

19                  MR. GANNON:     I don't think that they -- they

20   have mostly thought that, but the Federal government

21   certainly has maintained that that -- that that is

22   appropriate.    In -- we think that in the Maker decision

23   in the Third Circuit in 1984 recognized this.

24                  We do think that there is -- my -- my friend

25   Mr. Moran asks the Court to conclude that any decision

 1   like this, that is predicated upon a supposed erroneous

 2   addition of an element, could easily be recharacterized

 3   as a misconstruction of another element.

 4                And I think that -- that while, at some

 5   formal level, that -- that that might be theoretically

 6   true, in an egregious case like this, there is a

 7   distinction, which is that if -- if this were an element

 8   of the offense that needed to be charged in the

 9   indictment -- at least in the Federal system, then the

10   failure to have alleged that the structure here was a

11   non-dwelling would have made the indictment invalid.

12                And the Defendant would have been able to

13   make exactly the same legal argument he made to the

14   judge here, which is to say that the prosecution has

15   failed to prove -- has failed even to allege one of the

16   necessary elements of the offense, which is that this

17   structure is not a dwelling.            We know that that

18   particular --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Gannon, if we -- if

20   we adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case

21   only.   And I -- I think this characterization,

22   nonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of

23   an element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call

24   it one or call it the other, so that -- that's a

25   difficult line to -- to adopt.

 1                MR. GANNON:     Well, I don't think it's

 2   difficult, in the sense that most -- most of the cases

 3   that we are talking about don't involve this type of

 4   error.   The cases that this Court has decided, Rumsey,

 5   Smalis, and Smith, even the Petitioner doesn't

 6   characterize this case as involving additional elements.

 7                And this Court has recognized, in Lee, that

 8   when the error is one that kept the indictment from

 9   being valid because it failed to charge a relevant

10   element and the judge did not rule on that until after

11   jeopardy attached, the government was still entitled to

12   appeal that decision, and if it were erroneous -- the

13   government's only going to get a chance at retrial if

14   the judge's decision was legally erroneous, then,

15   therefore, it demonstrates that there was no so-called

16   acquittal on the -- on the offense charged --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, you gave us

18   earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29

19   motions in trial.   I think you said 76 percent.        What's

20   the gross number, relative to the number of actual

21   verdict decisions by juries or the judge himself?

22                MR. GANNON:     The only data that I have seen

23   about this is data that the Justice Department collected

24   about ten years ago.    It was from the early 2000s.

25   And -- and the conclusion there was that there were


                                    51

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   approximately 73 pretrial Rule 29 dismissals per year --

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Out of what number?

 3               MS. GANNON:     -- which actually is a larger

 4   number than you -- than you might at first think,

 5   because that represents about ten percent of the number

 6   of cases that were actually resolved by jury verdicts.

 7   And so it -- it is not uncommon.

 8               I mean, this particular type of error that

 9   we have in this case, we think, is the most egregious

10   kind, the non-existent element error, which -- which the

11   government had also pointed out in its amicus brief in

12   Smalis, we think is the most egregious kind of error.

13   It's one that demonstrates that the court is engaging

14   in -- it's usurping the province of the legislature in

15   redefining the scope of the offense.

16               And we think, under the terms of the Double

17   Jeopardy Clause itself, which talks about whether

18   there's been -- somebody's been subject to being twice

19   in jeopardy for the same offense -- then it -- it

20   matters what the offense was.

21               And when the judge has redefined the -- the

22   crime so extensively that the indictment literally would

23   have been invalid and could have been dismissed as not

24   adequately alleging the elements of the offense, and we

25   know that that is something that the government would


                                   52

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have been able to appeal.

 2               We also know that the government would be

 3   able to appeal if the judge had reserved decision until

 4   after the jury had returned a jury -- a guilty verdict.

 5               We acknowledge, as the state does, that jury

 6   verdicts are different.     If a jury is misinstructed and

 7   a jury returns an acquittal, that we are not quarrelling

 8   with that in any way.    We don't think there's any

 9   purchase in the Court's case law to do that.            And I

10   think one of the reasons is because the jury verdict

11   might be attributable, not just to mistake or error, but

12   also to lenity or compromise.

13               There -- there are lots of reasons why we

14   don't exactly know why a jury did what it did, and why

15   juries generally enter general verdicts.            And that makes

16   it different from what we have here.            We have here an

17   instance where the court, as a matter of law, at the

18   defendant's behest, took the case away from the jury.

19   We think the fact that the defendants chose --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Is that important, "at

21   defendant's behest"?

22               MR. GANNON:     We do think that that's

23   important by analogy to the Court's mistrial cases in

24   the Double Jeopardy Clause context.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:         So you -- you're arguing


                                   53

 1   that this should only -- only be -- this rule should

 2   only be applied when the defendant asks for it?

 3                MR. GANNON:     Or if the defendant consents to

 4   it, as is the case in the mistrial cases in the Double

 5   Jeopardy context.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 8              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10                MR. MORAN:    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11                Responding to Mr. Gannon's argument first, I

12   do characterize Rumsey as an additional element case.

13   And I also characterize it as a misconstrued element

14   case.   It's a perfect example of how these cases can be

15   construed either way.

16                The judge required a contract.             You can call

17   that an additional element to the aggravating

18   circumstance, or you can call it as a misconstruction of

19   what pecuniary gain means in the first place.

20                The same here, the error here can be

21   construed as a misconstruction of the element that the

22   property burned has to be a building, and the judge

23   says, looking at the statute, I construe that to mean a

24   particular type of building.            Or it can be, as the

25   prosecution construed it, as the addition of an element.

 1   There is no difference between the two

 2   characterizations.

 3               Turning to the -- the broader question about

 4   this whole line of cases and should this Court go back

 5   and revisit this whole line of cases, is there really a

 6   problem here?   We have no amicus briefs from any states

 7   indicating that there's a problem.                We have only the

 8   amicus from the United States saying that there's a

 9   problem.

10               Is there a problem here that justifies going

11   back and revisiting 50 years -- or possibly 108 years,

12   all the way back to Kepner -- all of this case law?                  We

13   submit not, especially since, as this Court noted just

14   six years ago in Smith, there is an easy solution if

15   there really is a problem.

16               If there really is a problem with judges

17   going wild and granting directed verdicts mid-trial for

18   no apparent reason, all that has to be done is the

19   states can fall into that, as we can say, judges can't

20   do that, or judges as an intermediate -- states as an

21   intermediate step could at least give judges the power

22   to reserve that decision --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Have any states done that?

24   I -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that,

25   if the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient


                                     55

 1   evidence, that then it has to proceed with a trial.


 2                MR. MORAN:     I would be, too,


 3   Justice Kennedy.   I think it would be a mistake.


 4                I'm not aware of any state, since this


 5   decision -- since this Court's decision in Smith -- that

 6   have followed Nevada's lead.             There are good reasons to

 7   give judges this acquittal power, namely, preserve the

 8   state's resources, preserve the jury's time, and

 9   present -- and prevent the defendant from having to go

10   through a trial that is going nowhere.

11                And so there are good reasons why states

12   don't do this.   States have apparently made the

13   decision, even after being alerted in Smith, that

14   there's something they can do about it, that the good of

15   giving judges this mid-trial directed verdict acquittal

16   power outweighs the bad.

17                Finally, I'd just like to respond to

18   Mr. Baughman's point, and it was also raised by

19   Mr. Gannon, about how jury verdicts are different.

20   There's something special about jury verdicts because we

21   don't always know why they granted the verdict.

22                But we have the same problem with judicial

23   directed verdicts.    And we have Martin Linen, where the

24   judge just says, this is the weakest case I -- I have

25   ever seen.   We have Smalis, where he just says, it's


                                     56

 1   legally insufficient.

 2                If the Court adopts the line that the

 3   prosecution and -- and the Solicitor General would have

 4   you adopt, you're going to have to require judges to

 5   give very specific findings as to what the elements of

 6   the offense are and which ones that they -- they don't

 7   find.   And that, itself, would require a radical

 8   reworking of this Court's jurisprudence.

 9                If there are no further questions?
