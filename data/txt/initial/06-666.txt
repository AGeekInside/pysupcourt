 7          ORAL ARGUMENT of C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. TROWER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Kentucky's tax exemption for municipal bond

12   interest paid by Kentucky and its political subdivisions

13   to Kentucky taxpayers treats all private entities the

14   same, and favors only Kentucky and its political

15   subdivisions.   This Court has never held that a law

16   which favors government, whether the State or local

17   government, rather than private business enterprises

18   violates the dormant Commerce Clause.

19   The Court's decision last term in United Haulers holds

20   that State laws which favor government but which treat

21   all private business entities in State and out of State

22   the same does not discriminate against interstate

23   commerce.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:           Is what you just said true

25   about conduit bonds, where Kentucky issues bonds to


                                         3

 1   finance private construction?             Is the statement that you

 2   just made accurate?

 3               MR. TROWER:        Yes, it is, Your Honor.

 4   Private activity bonds, a subset of which are conduit

 5   bonds, account for approximately 20 percent of all

 6   municipal bonds issued.        And I think your question has,

 7   has two point to it.

 8               First of all is whether or not a State or a

 9   municipality ought to be able to use its tax exempt

10   borrowing power to further a project chosen by the

11   municipality to achieve public purposes, such as for

12   example tax exempt hospitals or other facilities that

13   are tax exempt, should it be able to use that tax exempt

14   borrowing power constitutionally?                The answer there is,

15   yes.   Congress has already made that decision.

16               The second question is whether there's a

17   Commerce Clause problem if a State exempts it's own

18   private activity bonds but taxes private activity bonds

19   issued in other States?

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          That's what you do, isn't

21   it?

22               MR. TROWER:        Yes, sir.

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Doesn't that raise, in

24   effect, sort of a distinction between Carbone and United

25   Haulers?   Or at least one way of understanding the


                                        4

 1   distinction between those two cases?                     In Carbone the

 2   facility, in fact, was not the facility of the

 3   government.

 4                 MR. TROWER:       That's correct.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Here the, the immediate

 6   beneficiary of the bonds is, in Justice Alito's hypo, is

 7   a private entity?

 8                 MR. TROWER:       That's correct, that the

 9   immediate beneficiary of the bonds or of the loan is a,

10   is a nongovernmental entity.              It's not necessarily a

11   private business.

12                 As we point out in our reply brief, 80

13   percent of all private activity bonds go for --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But -- correct me if I'm

15   wrong, just a matter of fact.              I thought in most

16   instances the immediate beneficiary would be a private

17   entity who, in effect, was enabled to borrow at a lower

18   rate?

19                 MR. TROWER:       That is correct.             It would be a

20   nongovernmental entity that would be able to borrow at a

21   tax exempt rate.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            So don't you have to

23   take -- therefore, if you're going to answer Justice

24   Alito as you did, don't you have to take the position

25   that Carbone really is not good law and the

 1   Carbone/United Haulers distinction is not a -- is simply

 2   not a relevant distinction?

 3                As a dissenter in Carbone, I naturally do

 4   not find that the worst answer you could give.

 5                (Laughter.)

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:              But don't you have to give

 7   that answer?

 8                MR. TROWER:         I thought the distinction that

 9   you drew in your dissenting opinion in Carbone between

10   the one entity that has got to get the job done within

11   the jurisdiction is the key distinction in observing

12   United Haulers.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, as a dissenter in

14   United Haulers, I also don't think it's a good

15   distinction.

16                (Laughter.)

17                JUSTICE ALITO:           But couldn't there be

18   instances where some, an industrial, a company is trying

19   to -- is deciding to locate a plant and is choosing

20   between Kentucky and Ohio, and Kentucky says, come to

21   Kentucky because we'll issue private activity bonds so

22   that you can finance this more cheaply than if you went

23   into Ohio?     And when you do that, aren't you, aren't you

24   doing exactly what the dormant Commerce Clause is

25   supposed to prevent?

 1               MR. TROWER:          No.       You're doing -- the

 2   dormant Commerce Clause in no way restricts the ability

 3   of States to provide economic incentives for in-State

 4   business activity.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Trower, were private

 6   activity bonds considered at all below?                   As far as I

 7   understand, this is not a private activity bond, it's

 8   not, what's at issue here.             And there was no

 9   adjudication with respect to that type of bond --

10               MR. TROWER:          That's exactly --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- in the lower courts.

12               MR. TROWER:          That is exactly right, ma'am.

13   And our position is that Respondents have no standing to

14   make a claim focused solely on private activity bonds,

15   because there is no evidence in the record as to whether

16   Respondents own any private activity bonds.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:               Suppose that you -- and I

18   have the same hypothetical for both you and your

19   brothers on the other side with some adjustment here,

20   because I'm finding the case quite difficult.                  And the,

21   the -- for you, imagine we have some milk producers in

22   Kentucky.   They are farmers.             And they go to the

23   legislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot

24   more milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a

25   tax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into

 1   Kentucky.   That's the classic unlawful -- all right.

 2   It's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.

 3               MR. TROWER:        Yes, sir.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.      Now, what is

 5   the difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to

 6   finance its schools says now to the legislature, we're

 7   going to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or

 8   elsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll

 9   only put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is

10   offering to finance their city schools?                 That will help,

11   just like the milk.     Now, what's the difference?

12               MR. TROWER:        The difference is, is twofold.

13   One, the favoritism in the first example, the dairy

14   cases, which have come up a million times, is a

15   favoritism of a private industry, whereas in your second

16   hypothetical the favoritism is to the most public of

17   industries, education.

18               The second difference is that a tax on

19   out-of-State dairy products increases the cost of

20   out-of-State dairy products to in-State consumers with

21   no detriment to in-State dairy producers, whereas, as

22   our Respondents have pointed out in their brief, when a

23   tax is imposed by a government on a transaction where

24   the government itself is paying the money, which is what

25   we have here, a tax on interest income paid by the


                                        8

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   government, the effect is to impose a dollar-for-dollar

 2   reduction in the government's tax revenues equal to the

 3   amount of the exemption.          So you've got an in-State

 4   entity, namely, the government itself, that is suffering

 5   a revenue loss.

 6                 That's not at all comparable to the dairy

 7   hypothetical.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            We have consumers in the

 9   dairy products that are suffering loss.                  They're all the

10   voters in the States.       Everyone drinks milk.

11                 MR. TROWER:       Yes, sir.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So they are suffering a

13   dollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more

14   expensive.

15                 I don't know if that's analogous.                I think

16   it's a pretty strong analogy.              As to the first, that's

17   of course the point that's worrying me.                  It is true that

18   this is a public matter.

19                 MR. TROWER:       Yes, sir.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Would it make a difference

21   in the first case if it happened to be some dairy

22   farmers who -- there are so few in Massachusetts now,

23   unfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy

24   farms that are put up for, you know -- does it make a

25   difference?

 1                 MR. TROWER:       I think it would make a

 2   difference.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It would make a difference?

 4                 MR. TROWER:       If a hamburger stand is owned

 5   by the State, it's okay under United Haulers.                     If the

 6   State wants to go into the dairy business, the Commerce

 7   Clause doesn't prevent the state from doing that.

 8   That's our answer, is that the Commerce Clause does not

 9   extend to activities by a State on behalf of all of its

10   people.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We have a different

12   variation here that wasn't present in United Haulers,

13   which, of course, is that Kentucky does compete with

14   other public entities in the municipal bond market.                     In

15   other words, I think you have a strong case with respect

16   to discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky

17   competes against Ohio bonds as well.                     And they're making

18   the Kentucky bonds more attractive through this

19   discriminatory tax on the Ohio bonds.

20                 Why isn't that a sufficient distinction from

21   United Haulers?

22                 MR. TROWER:       The key distinction in the

23   United Haulers, Mr. Chief Justice, was between an entity

24   with the responsibility for the welfare of the citizens

25   within the jurisdiction versus all other entities.                     It


                                        10
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   just happened to be in United Haulers that that was a

 2   public entity versus private entities.                     But United

 3   Haulers, we submit, would have reached exactly the same

 4   result if the trash haulers had wanted to take the

 5   garbage to a municipal or a public facility in New

 6   Jersey, as opposed to a private facility in New Jersey.

 7               And the second answer to your question is

 8   that other public entities, other States, other

 9   municipalities have no responsibilities in Kentucky for

10   the public welfare.     They're no different than private

11   borrowers in Kentucky.       They don't have sovereign

12   immunity in Kentucky if they default on their bonds.

13   They can be sued in Kentucky court.                     That's the

14   essential difference.

15               The question I think that the Justice Breyer

16   brought up would also lead me to talk about what are the

17   purposes of the Commerce Clause writ large, or the

18   dormant Commerce Clause not writ large, that have

19   motivated this Court's jurisprudence?                     I think there are

20   three:   Economic protectionism, which the Court has

21   repeatedly said does not apply to activity by the State

22   on its open behalf; secondly, the free market or free

23   trade rationale, which has motivated many of the Court's

24   decisions, but at the same time the Court has always

25   been careful to say that the free trade rationale, Maine


                                       11

 1   v. Taylor for example, does not value free trade above

 2   all other values that we have.              And we would submit that

 3   the value here is the fundamental sovereignty of the

 4   States.

 5               Our political system subdivides

 6   responsibility for government and responsibility for

 7   public works in America.         Bonds are not issued by the

 8   States to make a profit or to leverage their return on

 9   equity.   Bonds aren't issued to create an investment

10   opportunity for Wall Street or for Main Street.               Bonds

11   are issued to finance the essential work of government.

12   And this Court's decision should look at that part of

13   the equation as much more significant and weigh those

14   values much more heavily than the values of the free

15   market, which don't really apply to the State's

16   provision of goods and services.               In all the dairy cases

17   --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose a State said that

19   it was unlawful for anyone other than a State resident

20   to purchase the bond?

21               MR. TROWER:        That would be completely

22   constitutional.

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            What if -- what if the

24   State offered its taxpayers a higher interest rate than

25   purchasers from other States?             Would that be


                                       12

 1   permissible?

 2              MR. TROWER:         Yes, sir, that would be totally

 3   permissible and would achieve the same result as the

 4   exemption that we've got here.              So what you've got

 5   before you is --

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:           How would that achieve the

 7   same result if these bonds weren't negotiable and they'd

 8   be hard to sell, hard for you to sell, if people who

 9   bought them couldn't sell them, and they could sell them

10   to somebody out of State and get the higher interest

11   rate?

12              MR. TROWER:         I thought the question was if

13   the bonds increased the interest rate and limited the

14   purchasers to Kentucky citizens.

15              JUSTICE ALITO:           And these would be bonds

16   that Kentucky citizens could not sell to anyone else?

17              MR. TROWER:         They could sell them to anyone

18   else.

19              JUSTICE ALITO:           Anyone who wasn't a Kentucky

20   citizen?

21              MR. TROWER:         It would be -- let me back up.

22   I think I got ahead of myself there.

23              It would be entirely constitutional for a

24   State to offer bonds for sale and limit the sale to

25   Kentucky residents and limit the payment of interest to

 1   Kentucky residents and have a mechanism to assure that

 2   that would be the case.          For example, contract

 3   submissions by brokers.          The SEC does that right now

 4   thousands of times each day with Rule 144 sales.                   The

 5   administrative mechanism would be there.                   Would it be

 6   constitutional?   Yes, sir.           Our point is we've got a

 7   giant market upon which the States depend for the

 8   financing of public goods and services.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Would it be constitutional

10   to say that the holder of the bond must always be a

11   Kentucky resident or, if you sold the bond, it has to be

12   to another Kentucky resident?

13              MR. TROWER:           Yes, it would be.           We've got

14   the same analogy in the securities law, where the

15   intrastate exemption is conditioned upon the holder of

16   the security being an in-State resident who must agree

17   not to transfer the security out of State.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, I suppose you

19   could achieve the same result simply by providing you're

20   not going to pay interest to somebody who is not a

21   Kentucky resident.

22              MR. TROWER:           Yes, sir, you could.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               So if New York has a very

24   strong financial community, it can really benefit its

25   citizens by keeping the market in New York bonds for

 1   itself, if it chooses?

 2                 MR. TROWER:       Yes, it could.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And your case for that is

 4   what, United Haulers?

 5                 MR. TROWER:       Yes, sir, as well as an

 6   attention -- as I was going to earlier, the larger

 7   principles that are behind the dormant Commerce Clause

 8   jurisprudence of the Court.             The Court has -- we talked

 9   about economic protectionism.              We talked about the free

10   trade rationale.    And then the third rationale which

11   comes up often in the Court's opinions is political

12   solidarity.    That is to say that the Commerce Clause was

13   not a grant of power to the national government to enact

14   free trade laws, but rather it was a grant of power to

15   the national government to prevent Union-dividing

16   friction between the States.

17                 We don't have that friction here.                       All 49

18   States support Kentucky's position.                      Where that

19   political friction is not an issue, the need for

20   judicial invalidation of the laws of 42 States is

21   commensurately less.

22                 On the other hand, what are the things that

23   we think that the Commerce Clause doesn't require --

24   doesn't require the States to do?                 It doesn't require

25   the States to give up incentives to local business

 1   activities within the State.            The Commerce Clause

 2   doesn't throw into the maw of the free market, the --

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:            How do you reconcile that

 4   with the Bacchus case?

 5               MR. TROWER:        Well, Bacchus was a case which

 6   favored the in-State pineapple wine producers --

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Correct.

 8               MR. TROWER:        -- with a tax.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I've always thought it was

10   incorrectly decided, to be honest with you, but it's

11   there.   It's been there a long time.

12               MR. TROWER:        That doesn't surprise me at

13   all, Justice Stevens, because your concurring opinion in

14   Alexandria Scrap said the same thing.                   We agree with

15   that position.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So we have to

17   overrule Bacchus to agree with you?

18               (Laughter.)

19               MR. TROWER:        No, sir.          No, sir.     The

20   suggestion that we're making here today is that a tax

21   exemption which applies directly and exclusively to the

22   payment of money by a government to its direct trading

23   partners is all you're dealing with here.                   That would

24   not change the result in Bacchus, Boston Stock Exchange,

25   or any of the other discriminatory tax cases because all

 1   of those cases involved a -- a tax or an exemption.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Does your argument

 3   depend upon the uses to which Kentucky is putting these

 4   proceeds?

 5                 MR. TROWER:        No, sir.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought it

 7   would because you're saying nobody else is responsible

 8   for public works in Kentucky and so on.

 9                 MR. TROWER:        I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

10   I thought you meant it made a difference whether they

11   spent them on an airport or --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.   Just a public

13   facility.

14                 MR. TROWER:        Yes, sir.           Governmental.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So, if Kentucky had

16   a law that it could only -- no out-of-State car dealer

17   could sell cars in Kentucky, that benefited Kentucky car

18   dealers, and then it had a special tax on Kentucky car

19   dealers to fund local hospitals, airports, roads,

20   whatever -- that would be all right?

21                 MR. TROWER:        I don't think that would be all

22   right.     I think that's the West Lynn Creamery case in

23   reverse.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it doesn't

25   matter?     So the use to which the proceeds are put

 1   doesn't save an otherwise discriminatory activity?

 2                 MR. TROWER:       The -- it is the -- it is the

 3   entity which chooses the use to which the proceeds are

 4   put that determines the Commerce Clause situation.                       The

 5   choice of -- of sewers, airports, schools, that's up to

 6   the governmental entity to make.

 7                 I'll reserve my time for rebuttal.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

11                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

12                            ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14   please the Court:

15                 This is a tax case and that makes a

16   difference.    It's not a case about a monopoly, and

17   what's key about that is that Kentucky has not taken

18   over the national municipal bond market.                 It hasn't

19   taken over the market.        It is trying to regulate the

20   market with this facially discriminatory tax.                    It is

21   facially discriminatory because on its face the statute

22   says if you buy in Kentucky an in-State bond you have a

23   tax exemption.    If you're in Kentucky and you buy the

24   out-of-State bond, we tax you.               This is no different

25   from the Bacchus case or the Fulton case or Boston Stock

 1   Exchange.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or United Haulers.

 3                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          It's very different, Your

 4   Honor.     Oh, no, it's very different, Mr. Chief Justice,

 5   from United Haulers.        There inherent in the power to

 6   take over -- the State took over the local trash

 7   handling market -- the power to create a monopoly is the

 8   power to exclude all competition.

 9                 Here Kentucky does not have a monopoly.

10   They merely issue the commodity.                 Then, once it is in

11   private hands, an interest in being paid.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Then of course you win as

13   soon as we say the commodity is the same as milk.

14   Obviously to me you would, but that's the issue.                  And in

15   United Haulers what the question was, I thought, is if

16   it is a traditional governmental function, anyway --

17   say, like producing electricity, or cleaning the

18   streets -- there they discriminate and say you have to

19   buy in State -- well, it's different, and indeed it may

20   be okay.

21                 So what you've just heard your brother --

22   brother argue is if this is a fortiori, because here

23   it's not even making electricity; it's not even

24   collecting trash; it is financing the most basically

25   governmental of all governmental institutions --

 1   libraries, schools, streets.

 2               Now, why isn't it a fortiori from United

 3   Haulers, given the nature of the task that they are

 4   raising the money to finance?

 5               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Three reasons, Justice

 6   Breyer.   First, as this Court stated in Oregon Waste,

 7   the purpose of or justification for a law has no bearing

 8   on whether it is facially discriminatory.                Secondly, as

 9   this Court held in Bacchus, as long as there is some

10   competition between the locally produced exempt product

11   and nonexempt products from outside the State, there is

12   a discriminatory effect.          Here if you look at what --

13   what are these bonds?

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Can a State --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             You're arguing -- but can a

16   State do this?    It produces a service or product; it

17   sells the service or product to in-State people at a

18   price 50 percent less than it sells to out-of-State

19   people.

20               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Certainly, Your Honor.      Under

21   the market participant doctrine, if -- if you want to

22   sell cement and you own the State-owned cement plant,

23   you can choose.    You recall in South-Central --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no, you're saying if

25   the State owns cement, it can sell 50 percent less to

 1   its in-State citizens than out-of-State?

 2               MR. BRUNSTAD:          That's what this Court held

 3   in Reeves v. Stake.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine.       Then could it do

 5   this?   Could it say that if you buy cement from

 6   out of State, the answer is no, right?

 7               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Through a tax, no.         And I

 8   think the Court's precedent in South-Central --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Suppose what

10   they are selling is education?              Can the University of

11   California say that when you send your child to the

12   University of California, you will get a thousand

13   dollars back on your income tax.               But if you send the

14   child to an out-of-State school, you don't?

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:          There the State is supplying

16   educational services to its citizens, and under the

17   market participant doctrine that would be fine.                I think

18   this hypothetical --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well if that's fine, then

20   what they say is we sell you participation in the

21   financing of the project.

22               MR. BRUNSTAD:          But that's not what the tax

23   --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            And if you buy -- we sell

25   you the participation.       It's called a bond, and if in

 1   fact you give the money to us, and you are in-State, you

 2   get a thousand dollars back.            But if in fact, when you

 3   do the identical thing, and you buy a similar thing from

 4   out-of-State, you do not get the money back?                How is

 5   that different from what you just said was okay in

 6   respect to the University of California?

 7                MR. BRUNSTAD:         Justice Breyer, that would be

 8   a subsidy, and this Court drew the very distinction in

 9   the New Energy case as the difference between subsidy

10   and a tax.   And that I think is absolutely critical; and

11   I think here Justice Holmes' admonition that a page of

12   history is worth a volume of logic makes sense.                The

13   rallying cry for the American Revolution was "no

14   subsidies without representation," it was "no taxation

15   without representation."

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I'm sorry, then I

17   wasn't clear in the hypothetical.                The hypothetical was

18   that you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income

19   tax.   So I was trying to make it exactly like this case.

20   You pay a lower State tax.

21                MR. BRUNSTAD:         But I think -- I think there

22   you would look through the form to the substance, and

23   the substance there is we will charge you X amount for

24   tuition and we are giving you part of that back as a

25   rebate.   That is no different from a subsidy.               Here is

 1   completely different, Your Honor.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Why is it any different

 3   from a tax credit?

 4               MR. BRUNSTAD:            Well here, Your Honor, as the

 5   Court made plain -- made plain in the Camps case, Camps

 6   Newfound/Owatonna, a tax exemption is not the sort of

 7   direct State involvement in the market that falls within

 8   the market participation doctrine.                   There is a key

 9   difference between a tax and a subsidy.

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But in that case, the only

11   thing the State was doing was taxing.                      Here in Justice

12   Breyer's hypothetical, in the case we've got, the State

13   is also participating in a bond market.

14               MR. BRUNSTAD:            No, Your Honor, not in -- the

15   part that they are taxing is not their participation

16   part.   I think a hypothetical will crystalize this.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Why do we draw that line?

18   I mean, you -- a moment ago you were talking about the

19   -- the realities of subsidy.              Why don't we confront the

20   realities of -- of the fact that the State's

21   participation in the bond market and the -- and the tax

22   exemption go together hand in hand?                       It's unrealistic to

23   divide them.

24               MR. BRUNSTAD:            Because, Justice Souter,

25   there is a fundamental difference between the two.                       A

 1   tax tears down; a subsidy builds up.                   If you want to

 2   subsidize your local park --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:            So what?          The economic

 4   reality is precisely the same.

 5              MR. BRUNSTAD:          But not constitutionally,

 6   Justice Souter, and here is why --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Not constitutionally, we

 8   have said, in cases in which the State is not acting

 9   purely as the regulator.        Here the State is not acting

10   purely as the regulator.        The State has a dual capacity,

11   and you say ignore one side of that capacity for the

12   other; and my question is why?

13              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Because, Justice Souter, here

14   what the State is taxing is the out-of-State commodity.

15   It is taxing -- it is doing a downstream regulation.

16   The State issues a commodity -- just like in

17   South-Central; the State issued the timber; the State

18   owned the timber, and then it imposed a downstream

19   regulation on the purchase --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but it's not taxing an

21   out-of-State commodity in the sense of a commodity which

22   is manufactured or produced out-of-State.

23              MR. BRUNSTAD:          But Your Honor, it's no

24   different than the Boston Stock Exchange case, where we

25   are talking about securities -- or in Fulton, Your Honor

 1   -- shares of stock.

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            In which case the State was

 3   not a participant, but the State is here.

 4                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          But the State is using its

 5   taxing power to regulate -- to regulate interstate

 6   commerce, whereas in United Haulers, Chief Justice

 7   Roberts, there was no tax.            There was no discriminatory

 8   tax.    And inherent in the power to create a monopoly is

 9   the inherent power to preclude competition.                   Here there

10   is competition.     There is economic gamesmanship, Justice

11   Souter.    They want to sell their bonds nationally but

12   hoard their own investment dollars locally, which is

13   precisely --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you want to

15   suggest -- I'm sorry.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No.     Please.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Are you suggesting

18   that the result in United Haulers would have been

19   different if there were a competing trash processing

20   facility out-of-State?

21                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          No, Your Honor, because there

22   again we have a monopoly.            The State took over the

23   entire market -- the trash disposal facility of

24   recycling and everything else in the United Haulers

25   case.     Inherent in the power to create a monopoly is the

 1   power to exclude competition.             There is no

 2   discrimination by definition.

 3                Here they have not taken over the market.

 4   They are imposing a downstream regulation by taxing the

 5   out-of-State commodity, and the distinction is

 6   exactly --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, they are not

 8   taxing the out-of-State commodity.                 Their tax is imposed

 9   simply on Kentucky taxpayers.

10                MR. BRUNSTAD:         I think, Chief Justice

11   Roberts, the analysis that the Court made in the New

12   Energy case is directly on point and addresses this.

13   There the Court said the Commerce Clause does not

14   prohibit all State action designed to give its residents

15   an advantage in the marketplace, but only action of that

16   description in connection with the State's regulation of

17   interstate commerce.      Direct subsidies of domestic

18   industry does not ordinarily run afoul of that

19   prohibition; discriminatory taxation does.                Again --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:           And this situation is

21   somewhere in between the two.             Because although we do

22   not have what in form is a subsidy, we have what in

23   economic reality is a subsidy for the benefit of the

24   State's own activity as a bond issuer.

25                So the question again is, why do we accept


                                       26
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   your characterization that this case should be treated

 2   exactly as if the State were acting merely in a

 3   regulatory capacity?

 4              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Because Justice Souter, the

 5   entire purpose of the dormant Commerce Clause

 6   jurisprudence is to protect the integrity of the market.

 7   If Kentucky wants to have a subsidy and say we are going

 8   to subsidize our own residents, fine.                  That builds up

 9   something in Kentucky.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And the whole purpose of --

11   of the combined effect of market participant for the --

12   acting for the purpose of providing an essentially

13   governmental service is to give the State a free hand.

14   Why do we ignore that in your argument in favor simply

15   of the regulatory side?

16              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Because, Justice Souter, what

17   they are doing here is imposing a facially

18   discriminatory tax.     They have the burden of saying,

19   under the Court's precedents, they have no other

20   alternative.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the question is whether

22   it will be treated as we treat a facially discriminatory

23   tax when there is no market participation, there is no

24   State participation for the purpose of providing a

25   fundamental governmental service.               If -- if in fact


                                      27
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there is a good reason to treat them differently, then

 2   we don't follow the -- the facial discrimination test.

 3              Let me -- let me ask a -- a question with

 4   that as the premise.     Assuming -- and I obviously do

 5   assume -- that we have a choice of analysis here, one

 6   good reason to choose the analysis that your brother

 7   has -- that the State is forwarding is the fact that we

 8   have historically a bond market which has grown up since

 9   New York issued the first tax-exempt or -- a bond.

10              MR. BRUNSTAD:          In 1919, Your Honor.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And we have an enormous

12   market, the effect of interrupting which we really, as a

13   Court, cannot tell very much.            And that seems to me a

14   very good reason to give the nod to the -- to the market

15   participant, the essential services side of what the

16   State is doing, as opposed to the regulatory side, and

17   simply confront the thing under Pike.

18              Why isn't that a good reason?

19              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Because, Justice Souter, this

20   case represents a classic race to the bottom where the

21   only reason why we have these discriminatory tax laws is

22   because New York started it in 1919.

23              It wanted to hoard its own local investment

24   dollars and yet sell its bonds nationally.

25              Every other State caught on, and that

 1   creates a problem in the marketplace which the dormant

 2   commerce claim --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:               Well, you have a perfectly

 4   good remedy in respect to that.                If the States don't

 5   like this race to the bottom, they need only create a

 6   compact or go to Congress.

 7              MR. BRUNSTAD:             But a compact is precisely,

 8   Your Honor, what the dormant commerce clause was

 9   designed to prevent -- States coming together and trying

10   to create regional compacts or trying to create favored

11   trade deals among themselves.

12              JUSTICE BREYER:               You know, I was only -- I

13   was only addressing your point that there was a

14   practical problem.      Insofar as there is a practical

15   problem, it seems to me the States have a perfectly good

16   remedy even if they lose this case.

17              MR. BRUNSTAD:             Even if they lose this case

18   --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:               Or win the case, whatever.

20              MR. BRUNSTAD:             But Justice Breyer, the whole

21   point --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:               However.

23              MR. BRUNSTAD:             I think -- I think that the

24   Court's analysis in Quill is on point here.               In the

25   Court's analysis in Quill the Court said look, we have


                                         29
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this very clear rule that says States cannot engage in

 2   facially discriminatory taxation.                  They can't do it.

 3              And if, in fact, we are wrong -- if, in

 4   fact, the Court's precedent creates a problem, then it's

 5   something that Congress can easily fix.                       The States can

 6   go to Congress.

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But our approach in

 8   the General Motors case was the exact opposite.                         There

 9   we couldn't figure out whether the market for natural

10   gas was captive or not captive.

11              It was a little of each, and we kind of said

12   well, you know, if it's kind of a close question, leave

13   it for Congress.   Because, after all, the Commerce

14   Clause talks about Congress' power.                       The dormant

15   Commerce Clause is not mentioned.

16              So this is an area where Congress can

17   regulate if it wants to, and it has never shown the

18   slightest interest in interfering with State tax

19   exemptions for their own bonds.

20              MR. BRUNSTAD:             But, Chief Justice Roberts,

21   the same could have been said for the problem in

22   Granholm, where 26 States had the same no direct

23   shipment problem; or the same problem in Bacchus where

24   36 States had the same discriminatory alcohol tax laws.

25   Congress didn't --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   It strikes me as

 2   much more fundamental, whether or not a State can issue

 3   a tax exemption for its -- its bonds.                    That seems more

 4   fundamental than the more specialized issues in those

 5   other cases.

 6              And I think we have said when you're dealing

 7   with a specialized issue that may not get the attention

 8   of Congress, we have a different approach.

 9              MR. BRUNSTAD:            But, Chief Justice Roberts,

10   Congress is as unlikely to address this problem now that

11   it's so pervasive as it was to address the problem in

12   Granholm, or the problem in Bacchus, or any of those

13   other cases, or the problem in Fulton.                   Congress has

14   plenty of other things to do.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:              That argument cuts against

16   you in context, I think.          You're saying in every case of

17   any kind of discrimination one could go to Congress.

18   Absolutely right.

19              And since that's true of every case, now we

20   are back to the more basic question, leaving the

21   practicalities that you were talking about out of it, of

22   whether this case is more like the cows.                   Is it more

23   like the garbage collection?

24              MR. BRUNSTAD:            Correct.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:              Or is it on the far side of


                                        31

 1   the garbage collection, even a stronger case for

 2   permission under the Commerce Clause?

 3                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Justice Breyer, this case is

 4   like milk.    That's what that --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's where I wanted you

 6   to begin.

 7                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         If you look at -- it is -- it

 8   is, Chief Justice Breyer.           If you look at bonds,

 9   municipal bonds -- and we have some samples of an

10   Alabama bond and a Kentucky bond in the supplemental

11   appendix.

12                 These are standardized forms that are traded

13   as commodities like any other securities.                  They have the

14   same regulatory overlay, which is distinct from General

15   Motors v. Tracy.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But it's not

17   distinct from United Haulers.              Garbage is garbage, too.

18                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         That's true.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But the fact that

20   bonds are bonds doesn't seem to me to be very

21   responsive.

22                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         But the point -- two points,

23   Chief Justice Roberts -- one is that in United Haulers

24   we did not have a tax on the out-of-State commodity

25   coming in.    Here we do.

 1               The second thing -- and I think this is

 2   critical -- we have a monopoly.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:             You didn't have a tax on

 4   the out-of-State.    You have an income tax charged to

 5   Kentucky residents on their income from that bond.                         It's

 6   quite different.

 7               MR. BRUNSTAD:           But, Justice Stevens, that

 8   points out how this is a downstream regulation.                      The

 9   State's participation ends when it is done issuing the

10   bond.   It goes to underwriters who then trade them in

11   the privately-owned national bond market, no different

12   than in South Central.

13               The State of Alaska owned the timber.                      It

14   sold the timber in the marketplace.                      Then it sought to

15   impose this downstream regulation.

16               It would be the same as if New York City

17   said, we have a local water company, and we have a

18   monopoly.   And now we have someone who we are licensing,

19   a private business, to bottle that water to sell.                      And

20   we are slapping a tariff on Poland Springs from Maine,

21   because we want to protect the local business.

22               That's what's happening here.                      The State has

23   already issued the commodity.              It is now in the

24   marketplace, and now they are basically prohibiting the

25   sale of it, or they are restricting the sale, by a


                                        33

 1   discriminatory -- in essence, tariff.

 2               If you live in Kentucky, we want to

 3   discourage you from buying a Michigan bond.                   And they do

 4   it by saying we will tax the interest on the -- on the

 5   out-of-State bond, and not tax the interest on the

 6   in-State bond.     They are giving themselves a leg up.

 7               And one of the pernicious aspects of this is

 8   that it has the effect of pooling capital within the

 9   national market.     It has the effect of creating this

10   discriminatory barrier.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:              The victims under your

12   approach, as I understand it, are the 49 other States,

13   and all of them seem to support your opponent in the

14   briefs that were filed in this case.

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:            True, Justice Stevens, but

16   they don't want to issue refunds.                  You can understand

17   that.   A short-term gain for a long-term solution that

18   would make them all better off, that would end this race

19   to the bottom.

20               My clients, the Davises, are penalized

21   because they are engaging in interstate commerce.                   They

22   are penalized.    Because they own out-of-State bonds,

23   they pay a tax.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Your argument that

25   you just presented in response to Justice Stevens'

 1   question, I think, relies on the discrimination against

 2   the out-of-State issuers.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Correct.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Your clients are not

 5   out-of-State issuers.

 6               MR. BRUNSTAD:         That's true.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We don't have an

 8   overbreadth doctrine under the Commerce Clause.                Why

 9   aren't their arguments limited to discrimination against

10   them rather than discrimination against out-of-State

11   issuers?

12               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Well, for the same reason

13   that it wouldn't be limited with the -- the taxpayer in

14   Fulton or the in-State taxpayer in Bacchus, where they

15   are basically arguing that this affects interstate

16   commerce.

17               And as illustrative of that, we are saying

18   look, in Bacchus you had the local brandy, and the local

19   pineapple wine got a tax rate.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So your Kentucky

21   taxpayers can argue about the discrimination against

22   out-of-State bond issuers?

23               MR. BRUNSTAD:         They can argue about the

24   discriminatory effects of this law on the marketplace as

25   a whole, because they are participants in the market.

 1   They are penalized for engaging in interstate commerce,

 2   the same way that all of the same arguments were

 3   presented in the Bacchus case with an in-State taxpayer,

 4   the Fulton case with an in-State taxpayer.

 5              And the Court has basically made that plain

 6   in the New Energy case.         You don't have to demonstrate

 7   that there is some overwhelming, you know, sky is

 8   falling problem.    Any discrimination with respect to

 9   interstate commerce, any discriminatory effect,

10   basically --

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   How do we know that

12   your clients will be better off regardless of how this

13   case is resolved?    One way to resolve it, of course,

14   would be to take away the Kentucky tax exemption, which

15   would hurt your clients.

16              Another way to resolve it would be to extend

17   the tax exemption to the Ohio bonds, which may hurt your

18   clients if the Kentucky bonds aren't competitive, and

19   the price of the Kentucky bonds goes down.                  They are

20   going to lose either way.

21              MR. BRUNSTAD:            The remedy, Your Honor, would

22   be for the State to decide whether it wants to make all

23   municipal bonds tax-exempt or to make them all taxable.

24              Now, in Kentucky there is a constitutional

25   provision which says they cannot -- they basically


                                        36
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   cannot have their own bonds other than tax-exempt.

 2                 So unless they change their constitution,

 3   the result would be to make all the bond, municipal

 4   bonds, tax-exempt in Kentucky, which, of course, would

 5   benefit my clients, who hold out-of-State municipal

 6   bonds.   But consider this --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But whether or not

 8   it benefits them, it seems to me, depends on how

 9   competitive they are with other States' municipal bonds.

10                 In other words, their advantage now comes

11   from the tax exemption for Kentucky bonds; and it's not

12   clear, if that is eliminated across the board, that

13   Kentucky bonds are going to be competitive with, you

14   know, bonds of whatever other State.                     So the value of

15   them may go down, and your clients may lose, whether you

16   win or not.

17                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         But, Chief Justice Roberts,

18   consider these two critical points:

19                 One cardinal principle of investment is

20   diversification.    These discriminatory tax laws

21   basically compel people to hold only the bonds within

22   their particular State.         Prospectuses for these

23   single-State bond funds say:             Warning -- not diverse.

24   The second thing is their higher cost.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I mean it -- it


                                        37
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   provides an advantage depending on the level of the

 2   State income tax and, I suppose, the level of the

 3   exemption.     It doesn't necessarily mean that that's the

 4   only bonds they are going to hold.

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:           But that simply means that if

 6   the State has a very high income tax, say, in

 7   California, that's all the more reason, all the more

 8   penalty, for people who want to engage in interstate

 9   commerce and diversify their portfolios.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And it's less of a

11   problem if it's like Kentucky, which, I assume, has a

12   lower income tax.

13                MR. BRUNSTAD:           Kentucky has a lower income

14   tax, but I think on the -- on the problem that was

15   raised, what if we -- if we affirm in this case, what

16   would the impact be?

17                Well, the State of Kentucky has said,

18   itself, that if it has to pay out refunds, we are

19   talking about a $4 million per year refund obligation

20   the State of Kentucky has said it will have to pay.

21                The sky is not going to fall.                  What would

22   happen is that bond prices might adjust, but we would

23   have the free national market with interstate trade and

24   municipal bonds unimpaired by these artificial

25   constraints.    These artificial discriminatory tax


                                         38

 1   regimes create artificial demand.                  They pull assets.

 2   They hoard assets, local investment dollars, within

 3   particular States.      And you have a problem where, say,

 4   cash-scarce States like, for example, Tennessee have

 5   more of a restricted access to capital markets like New

 6   York.   If you're an investor in New York and you have

 7   money to spend in municipal bonds, you're discouraged

 8   from buying Tennessee bonds; you're encouraged from

 9   buying New York State municipal bonds.                     The relatively

10   capital-scarce States are harmed.                  Again, people like

11   the Davises, they are harmed, they are penalized from

12   engaging in interstate commerce.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I can ask your brother who

14   represents Petitioner -- maybe I'd better should -- I'd

15   get a better answer from him so far as his position.

16               As you understand his position, as you

17   understand the State's position, would it be permissible

18   for State A to go to State B and say:                     We -- if you make

19   your bonds nontaxable to our residents, we'll make your

20   bonds nontaxable to your residents.

21               MR. BRUNSTAD:            We actually have that,

22   Justice Kennedy.    Ohio, when it enacted its

23   discriminatory tax scheme here similar to Kentucky's, it

24   basically said:    We will tax the bonds of an

25   out-of-State State, unless they do not tax Utah bonds.

 1   So -- but you can see that clearly illustrates, to me --

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Do you find that

 3   consistent with the vision of the framers for our

 4   national market under the Commerce Clause?

 5               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Inconsistent, Justice

 6   Kennedy.   Inconsistent.       This is nothing more than an

 7   ongoing low-level trade war.            It was started by New York

 8   in 1919, when it basically created this discriminatory

 9   tax scheme for itself.       It basically incentivizes all

10   the States to follow suit.          And it's easy to understand

11   why.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the example

13   that was given of a interstate compact, say, to operate

14   a port authority that covers a few States, and the

15   compacters agree that they are not going to tax the

16   income on bonds issued by the port authority, but they

17   are going to tax the income from out-of-State municipal,

18   but it's only the bonds from this port authority.                So

19   they -- it seems your theory would reach that too.

20               MR. BRUNSTAD:          It would, Justice Ginsburg.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And yet Congress has

22   approved compacts that say just that.

23               MR. BRUNSTAD:          But where Congress

24   specifically speaks to permitting a particular practice,

25   then it can't violate the dormant Commerce Clause.                Here


                                       40
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Congress has not spoken.         The States are doing this on

 2   their own.

 3                And, Justice Kennedy, again, it is

 4   completely inconsistent with the vision of the framers

 5   because what's happening here, again, is the race to the

 6   bottom, where New York said:            All right, we're going to

 7   sell our bonds nationally; ah, we're going to create an

 8   investment for all the capital in New York to stay in

 9   New York.

10                And you can see why every other State

11   afterwards said:   Oh, look what New York is doing.                   We

12   have to follow suit to try to equal the playing field.

13   And, again, that is at the heart of the ongoing

14   low-level trade war with the --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it assumes

16   it's all in the definition of your market.                 If your

17   market is tax-exempt bonds nationwide, it's one thing;

18   but your brother says the market ought to be people who

19   issue bonds for public works in Kentucky, and Kentucky

20   is the only one who does that so there is no

21   discrimination against anyone else because nobody else

22   is similarly situated to Kentucky with respect to

23   Kentucky public works.

24                MR. BRUNSTAD:         But, Chief Justice Roberts,

25   here it's easy to tell what the market is.                 Kentucky


                                       41

 1   municipal bonds, in spite of the tax discrimination,

 2   sell in a national, single market.                 There is a national

 3   Federal overlay.   Under Federal income tax purposes,

 4   they're all tax exempt.        They're all regulated under the

 5   same Federal securities laws.             The fraud parts of the

 6   securities laws apply.       They all compete for each other.

 7   It's the fact that they compete for each other.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is there any evidence in

 9   the record as to how much -- what percentage of the

10   Kentucky bonds are bought by Kentucky residents?

11               MR. BRUNSTAD:          There is no good data on that

12   information, Justice Stevens.             We do not have an answer

13   to that.   But I think the point --

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Does it -- do we have it

15   for any State?

16               MR. BRUNSTAD:          No, we do not, Justice

17   Stevens.   We do not.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought it

19   was inherent in your argument that most of them -- I

20   mean, if you're talking about hoarding capital, it

21   doesn't work very well if a lot of people outside

22   Kentucky are buying these bonds.               There's not much

23   Balkanization if they're circulated widely.                 I thought

24   that your argument depended on the proposition that most

25   of these bonds are bought by Kentucky residents.

 1                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          There is Balkanization, but

 2   it's not complete Balkanization, just like the tax in --

 3   that Hawaii imposed on the alcohol didn't prevent the

 4   sale of fine California chardonnay imported into Hawaii;

 5   it just promoted the sale of the locally produced wine.

 6   It doesn't have to be a complete ban, as this Court

 7   explained in Limbach, a complete ban or a discrimination

 8   that imposes a burden.         There's no constitutional

 9   difference.

10                 And that applies here too, but the market

11   criteria the Court applied in GMC versus Tracy, I think,

12   applies here.     You don't look to define the market by,

13   gee, what's going to happen or what's the purpose of the

14   particular discrimination?            You look at ordinary

15   commercial factors.       And here the ordinary commercial

16   factors are there is one national market in which these

17   standardized commodities trade.                They're issued by the

18   State.   They're owned by individuals.                    Kentucky doesn't

19   own the bonds.    Kentucky issues them.                   They are then

20   traded in the national market.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- not really standardize.

22   Even without a tax exemption, residents of Kentucky

23   would be interested in public improvements in Kentucky

24   and have -- give a slight edge in the market to all

25   Kentucky bonds.     I think there would be just a natural

 1   preference for locally issued bonds.

 2               MR. BRUNSTAD:            And if they choose to do

 3   that, that's fine.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:              And not totally fungible.

 5               MR. BRUNSTAD:            And of course that would not

 6   be prevented by having nondiscriminatory taxes.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:              No, but it's a fact of the

 8   market, it seems to me, that Kentucky bonds are

 9   characteristically more attractive to Kentucky citizens

10   than they are to out-of-State citizens.

11               MR. BRUNSTAD:            But, Justice Stevens, I think

12   that's an idiosyncratic value, not shared.                Most

13   investors care about yield and --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I assume there would be a

15   preference to Massachusetts milk for Massachusetts

16   buyers, to Michigan automobiles for Michigan buyers, and

17   the State did not subsidize.

18               MR. BRUNSTAD:            But, Justice Kennedy, that

19   strikes me as the argument that Japan made --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              -- authorities --

21               MR. BRUNSTAD:            Justice Kennedy, that strikes

22   me as the argument that Japan made when it said:                 We

23   should keep American made skis out of the Japanese

24   market because Japanese snow is different from American

25   snow.   I mean you can't use those kinds of

 1   justifications to say --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's not

 3   fair because Kentucky is going to use the proceeds of

 4   the bonds to build a hospital, a school that is going to

 5   serve Kentucky residents.

 6                MR. BRUNSTAD:          But --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So there's -- it's

 8   not just emotional attachment to Kentucky that would

 9   promote the purchase of those bonds by Kentucky

10   residents.   It's self-interest.              They want a public

11   hospital nearby, and, therefore, it makes sense to buy

12   the hospital bonds.

13                MR. BRUNSTAD:          But, Chief Justice Roberts,

14   every tax serves a public purpose.                  Every tax is for the

15   State's purposes.     If this Court opens the door in this

16   case to say that this facially discriminatory tax regime

17   is okay, this Court will open the door to all of the

18   discriminatory taxes the Court has heretofore struck

19   down.   This case -- this Court's discriminatory tax

20   precedents --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 There's a very --

22   there's a very big difference between -- and it gets to

23   the difference with the Wisconsin cows, which was

24   addressed in United Haulers.             That's a tax on private

25   activity, and private actors don't have the

 1   responsibility of providing government services.

 2   Kentucky does.

 3              MR. BRUNSTAD:            But every State does that.

 4   And I think we need to maintain three clear

 5   distinctions:    Taxes, monopolies, and subsidies.                   They

 6   are constitutionally distinct.               Why?        If you look at the

 7   Constitution, you see all kinds of restrictions on

 8   discriminatory taxes.       There is no --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You don't see a

10   dormant Commerce Clause, though.

11              (Laughter.)

12              MR. BRUNSTAD:            But the -- this Court's

13   dormant Commerce Clause precedents are directed to

14   preserving the integrity of markets.                     Once you stray and

15   you do not have those clear lines between monopolies,

16   United Haulers, discriminatory taxes, and subsidies,

17   then I think you make -- you take what is a very clear

18   monument of economic freedom, this idea of no

19   discriminatory taxes certainly not discriminatory taxes

20   on their face, and you blur those distinctions and you

21   pull down this monument the Court has.

22              As the Court -- for the reasons the Court

23   said in Quill, these distinctions are important.                     If

24   Congress, in this particular area, does not like the

25   result, it can change the result.                 But,

 1   jurisprudentially, we need to maintain a distinction

 2   between subsidies, between monopolies, and between

 3   taxes.   Again --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The Court, in that old

 5   Bonaparte case, it was just kind of very naive because

 6   the Court made a decision that didn't -- that State A

 7   can't create bonds that are going to be exempt from tax

 8   in other States, right?

 9               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Not quite, Justice Ginsburg.

10   That was a full-faith-and-credit case in which the

11   Maryland resident said:         Oh, I own out-of-State bonds;

12   therefore Maryland can't tax me because the out-of-State

13   State wouldn't tax me if I lived there.                  A completely

14   different issue, Your Honor.             This issue was not before

22               MR. TROWER:         Let's start with the idea that

23   the Kentucky tax penalizes Respondents for participating

24   in interstate commerce.         The answer there is no.           The

25   Kentucky tax affords a direct trading partner, that is

 1   to say a person that owns Kentucky bonds, a quid pro

 2   quo.     If a Kentucky taxpayer loans money to Kentucky,

 3   Kentucky gives a tax exemption to that person that loans

 4   money to Kentucky.      If a Kentucky resident chooses to

 5   loan money to California by buying California bonds, no

 6   tax exemption is afforded.

 7                 But that different treatment is not a

 8   penalty, we would submit, but rather a recognition that

 9   the Kentucky resident who loans money to Kentucky is

10   entitled to receive something in return.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, why do you

12   care, Mr. Trower?     I mean, if you lose your tax

13   exemption, it means you've got to pay more interest to

14   sell your bonds, but it also means you're going to get

15   taxes that you don't get now.               Isn't it kind of a wash?

16   Does it really matter.

17                 MR. TROWER:        It matters tremendously, Your

18   Honor.    Seventy-five percent of all municipal bonds

19   issued in America are issued by municipalities, local

20   agencies, and those bonds -- under $10 million in

21   principal amount -- those bonds account for only 7

22   percent of the total volume of bonds outstanding.                   We

23   pointed this -- citations for this are in our reply

24   brief.

25                 The significance would be that many


                                         48

 1   municipalities might have no market access at all for

 2   their bonds.   An investor could ignore 75 percent of all

 3   bonds that are issued.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Yes, but the State's

 5   going to have more money from their income taxes, and if

 6   they want to spend it on a project in a particular

 7   municipality, they will be free to do that.

 8              MR. TROWER:         They would be and that's

 9   correct, Mr. Chief Justice.            But that choice is a choice

10   that the Commerce Clause lets the States make, the

11   choice to either raise taxes or to have a tax exemption.

12              JUSTICE ALITO:           It seems to me you're making

13   a lot of arguments that, if accepted, would -- maybe

14   this isn't true of all of your arguments, but certainly

15   many of them would demonstrate that the Commerce Clause

16   jurisprudence is utterly incoherent.                    If taxation is the

17   same thing as a subsidy, if congressional inaction is

18   the same thing as approval, if Kentucky bonds are not

19   really in the same market as out-of-State bonds, what

20   would be left of Commerce, of dormant Commerce Clause

21   jurisprudence if those arguments were accepted?

22              MR. TROWER:         Well, all of the cases in which

23   the tax exemption or -- or other restrictive law favored

24   in-State private business would be left untouched.                    What

25   we're arguing for here is a rule that would apply only

 1   to a transaction between the State itself and the

 2   bondholder.

 3                 Market participation, contrary to my

 4   brother's suggestion, does not end when the bonds are

 5   issued any more than when you borrow money your

 6   participation with your lender ends once the loan is --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I think that's true.

 8   There's a national securities market.                    Everybody knows

 9   that.

10                 MR. TROWER:       Yes, sir.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And I don't think either

12   side can avoid that fact.           He's suggesting that it cuts

13   more in his favor than it does for yours because you are

14   creating artificial barriers to that market.                   So that

15   when a person who knows about Kentucky bonds and who

16   knows what the good ones are moves out of state, he all

17   of a sudden loses the advantage to purchase those bonds

18   anymore, or at least he does -- he takes a penalty for

19   doing that.

20                 Let me -- let me ask you this, the question

21   I asked your co-counsel.          A and D get together and agree

22   on reciprocal advantages for their -- for their

23   respective residents.       Is that constitutional?

24                 MR. TROWER:       If it's approved by Congress,

25   yes, sir.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Suppose it's not.   And --

 2              MR. TROWER:          I think that --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And isn't that exactly

 4   what's happening here?        Isn't that exactly what's

 5   happening here?    You have, in effect, a pact among

 6   States to favor their own residents.

 7              MR. TROWER:          You could make that argument,

 8   Justice Kennedy.   But the -- the idea that what has

 9   happened here is a race to the bottom is post hoc

10   reasoning extraordinaire.           The Kentucky constitution was

11   enacted in 1890, 40 years before Kentucky had ever

12   enacted an income tax.        The California constitution,

13   which also requires California to exempt its own bonds,

14   was enacted decades before California enacted an income

15   tax.

16              We would suggest that the record of history

17   is the States saw the opportunity to give their own

18   residents tax exemption as a way of finding a natural

19   market for their bonds, and they chose to do that and

20   that the fact that they chose to do that makes sense for

21   the States that did it.         It also made sense for those

22   states that didn't choose to do that.

23              I would note that the seven states that --

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I suppose any favored

25   legislation favoring local industry helps the State, and

 1   the State residents like it.              That's the whole point.

 2   That's why the Commerce Clause exists as a check.

 3              MR. TROWER:           Well, it's -- I wouldn't accept

 4   that as the reason that the Commerce Clause exists as a

 5   check.

 6              But let's examine that analysis.                   Where is

 7   the political check here?            Well, we know how the other

 8   States would vote because they support Kentucky.                  SIFMA,

 9   which represents 90 percent of the bond trading --

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               All politics is local.

11   All States want to protect their residents and make it

12   look like they're doing something for their residents.

13   And that's exactly the purpose of Commerce Clause

14   prohibition against explicit discrimination, which is

15   what this is.     There's no doubt that this is explicit

16   discrimination.

17              MR. TROWER:           There's no doubt that the law

18   on its face differentially treats two different kinds of

19   bonds or different bonds issued by different States.

20   We're not contending that at all.                  The question is, is

21   whether that different treatment is permissible?                  The

22   suggestion that the commerce --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Since we are talking here

24   about the negative Commerce Clause, we really should say

25   that's the reason the Commerce Clause doesn't exist.

 1                 (Laughter.)

 2                 MR. TROWER:        That's right.            That's exactly

 3   right.     And if we were -- if we were reading the -- the

 4   negative Commerce Clause, I would call your attention to

 5   the decisions in Reeves, which is exactly equivalent to

 6   a home embargo, because it kept all the cement in South

 7   Dakota; to the decisions in White and Alexandria Scrap,

 8   which were exactly equivalent to a border blockade,

 9   because they kept all the out-of-State workers from

10   working in Boston or at least up to the extent of 50

11   percent of the work forces; and under Alexandria Scrap

12   the effect of the legislation was to keep all of the

13   out-of-state towing companies from collecting the

14   bounties.    And then in United Haulers, yes, it wasn't a

15   tax case, but that's a distinction without a difference,

16   because what United Haulers was equivalent to was a home

17   embargo.

18                 And it's the home embargo, the border

19   blockade, and the discriminatory tariff or tax that are

20   always held up as the prototypes of things that our free

21   market prevents, as is the monopoly, which my brother

22   says is okay if a State monopolizes all the trade, but

23   it's not okay if a State still competes in the national

24   market in the issuance of bonds but yet offers a direct

25   financial incentive to its own taxpayers.

 1               We come back to the effect of a tax

 2   exemption of this type.        It is exactly equivalent to the

 3   payment of money by the State, because every dollar of

 4   that tax exemption represents a detriment to the State.

 5   The State is giving up revenue.

 6               Now, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, it may

 7   be a wash at the end of the day, but that's a decision

 8   that the Commerce Clause leaves to the States to make.

 9   And your reference earlier to General Motors v. Tracy is

10   directly on point here, because there you had a

11   well-established, long-established market that the Court

12   was loath to jump in without any institutional

13   competence or information to evaluate the effects, where

14   Congress could take action if any was necessary.

15               What do we know about the historical record

16   here?   We know Congress excruciatingly discussed, just

17   analyzed State tax and their effects on interstate

18   commerce and did nothing.

19               JUSTICE ALITO:           Do you want us to -- do you

20   want us to hold that if Congress is, quote, unquote,

21   aware of some sort of discrimination that the States are

22   engaging in, that there is, therefore, no dormant

23   Commerce Clause problem?

24               MR. TROWER:        No.      That's not what we're

25   arguing for.   We're not saying that what happened here


                                       54

 1   is equal to the kind of express approval of

 2   discrimination, which the Court's precedents have

 3   required.

 4               What we're saying is where what we got is a

 5   Congress that has studied this problem and done nothing,

 6   with a Congress that has routinely approved interstate

 7   compacts between the States that provide for

 8   differential taxation of bonds, with a Congress that has

 9   provided exemption from all tax for territory bonds,

10   Puerto Rico, Guam -- those are completely exempt per

11   acts of Congress, but Congress didn't go any further

12   than that, what is the conclusions for this Court to

13   draw?   Does this Court rush in where Congress has failed

14   to tread?   We think not.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:            What is the difference

16   between that situation and the sort of flow control

17   ordinance that was involved in Carbone?                   Wasn't Congress

18   aware of those?

19               MR. TROWER:          Yes.       In fact, Congress had

20   authorized the kind of flow control ordinance that was

21   set up in Carbone.      But as the -- as the Court decided

22   the Carbone case, the facility in Carbone, in the view

23   of the majority, was not a publicly owned facility.                   It

24   was a privately owned facility.                If Carbone came up

25   again today, maybe a different analysis.                  But the

 1   distinction between Carbone and United Haulers was

 2   discussed at length in United Haulers, and the Court

 3   found that a distinction --

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:          No, but why wasn't there the

 5   same kind of congressional whatever it is, acquiescence,

 6   in Carbone that you're claiming there was here?

 7                 MR. TROWER:        I don't know that there wasn't

 8   that same kind of congressional acquiescence.              The

 9   question is -- is what -- what is the Court to make of

10   that congressional acquiescence or congressional failure

11   to act?     That's what we are arguing for here.           We are

12   not saying Congress has sanctioned differential

13   taxation.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            We are talking about not

15   just a dormant Commerce Clause, but a dormant Congress.

16                 (Laughter.)

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What are -- what are

18   examples -- what are examples of Federal statutes that

19   have allowed explicit discrimination?

20                 MR. TROWER:        Prudential versus Benjamin.         I

21   guess that's the insurance case, which of course we've

22   got --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In the insurance industry?

24                 MR. TROWER:        Yes, sir, and that's obviously

25   huge as well.     I think that's enough.
