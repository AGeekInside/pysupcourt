 4   argument first this morning in Case 06-1666, and the

 5   consolidated Case 07-394, Munaf versus Geren, Secretary

 8                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 9                           ON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,

10                      SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.

11               MR. GARRE:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

12   and may it please the Court:

13               Under this Court's precedents and universal

14   international law norms, the government of Iraq, like

15   all sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and

16   jurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including

17   American citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders,

18   commit crimes in its country, and remain there.                   In two

19   independent respects, the court of appeals in the Omar

20   case lost sight of that principle and departed from this

21   Court's precedents:     First by exercising habeas

22   jurisdiction at all; and second by sustaining an

23   injunction that the court of appeals itself recognized

24   prevented the government of Iraq from trying and

25   punishing Mr. Omar for any crimes that he committed in


                                       4

 1   Iraq.

 2               As to the jurisdictional question, we

 3   believe that this Court's decision Hirota versus

 4   MacArthur points to the conclusion that habeas

 5   jurisdiction is lacking over these cases because the

 6   habeas petitioners are being held under international

 7   authority pursuant to determinations made by an

 8   international Multinational Force acting and carrying

 9   out a United Nations mandate, and in Mr. Munaf's case

10   pursuant to an order of the Iraqi courts that he remain

11   in custody while proceedings go forward in the trial

12   court.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Isn't the problem with the

14   argument that Hirota did not at any point in the per

15   curiam opinion saying -- say, we're coming to the

16   conclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because

17   there's an international force?              I mean, Hirota said,

18   you know, there's this, that, and the other thing, and

19   under all these circumstances we don't think there's

20   jurisdiction.   Well, one of the things that's different

21   here is you had Japanese soldiers in Hirota and you've

22   got American citizens here.

23               MR. GARRE:       Well, that is the difference,

24   Justice Souter.   And I think, to be clear, if this Court

25   does find jurisdiction in these cases, we think that


                                        5

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   citizenship would be a basis -- would have to be the

 2   basis for jurisdiction, and we urge this Court to limit

 3   its decision to that ruling, because that would have

 4   profound practical consequences.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There's another

 6   difference, too.    There was a conviction and a sentence

 7   in Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as

 8   far as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts,

 9   certainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the

10   conviction has been quashed.

11                  MR. GARRE:      That's true, and let me explain

12   why we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances

13   in this case, notwithstanding that this case involves

14   citizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in

15   Hirota had been the subject of an international

16   conviction.    First of all, we don't think that Hirota

17   would have come out differently if the habeas

18   petitioners had filed suit earlier and sought to enjoin

19   the international proceeding in Hirota and sought an

20   injunction that would have prevented the conviction from

21   taking case.

22                  Secondly, we do think that, although one

23   obviously has to take a careful look at the Court's

24   decision in Hirota, we think that what the Court did say

25   points to the conclusion that it was the international


                                          6

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   authority that was key to the Court's finding that there

 2   was no jurisdiction.     I think there's at least a couple

 3   --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:            If it is, there's

 5   something -- the implication of that I think is what is

 6   bothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is

 7   applied to this case, it means that the president acting

 8   alone can make an agreement for an international force

 9   or a cooperative force and that agreement of the

10   executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction

11   over an American citizen.         And that obviously is in

12   tension, if not inconsistent, with the suspension clause

13   and it's a little scary.

14               MR. GARRE:      Well, obviously the Court

15   reached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens.               With

16   respect to citizens, I think that the key for the

17   jurisdictional question under the habeas statute is

18   whether or not these individuals are in custody under

19   and by color of United States authority.               Just as the

20   Court presumably concluded in Hirota that the

21   petitioners in Hirota were not under custody under color

22   of United States authority, we think that the

23   Petitioners here are not.         And so we think --

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but in real world terms

25   isn't it the case that they are under United States


                                       7

 1   authority?    You've got an American commander, you've

 2   straight-line authority right through, and -- and one

 3   knows -- to be realistic, one knows perfectly well that

 4   if any order were given to the American military

 5   involved, they would not hand them over, i.e., they


 6   would obey the order, international -- agreement for


 7   international cooperation or not.


 8                 MR. GARRE:       If I can make --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Go ahead.


10                 MR. GARRE:       -- two points in response to

11   that.   First, ultimately the United Nations controls the

12   strings and the source and the scope of international

13   authority.    The -- the current Security Council

14   resolutions are set to expire in December.                It could --

15   it could eliminate those resolutions today and that

16   source of international authority would exist and we

17   wouldn't be here arguing that these individuals are

18   being held pursuant to international mandate.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Garre, just to

20   clarify one point.      The -- at the time of the briefing,

21   the U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of

22   2007.   Has it been renewed.

23                 MR. GARRE:       There has been a subsequent

24   resolution.    It's Resolution 1790, and that resolution

25   is set to expire this December.                And the -- the


                                          8

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   government of Iraq and the other parties have indicated

 2   that this will be the last extension.                   Obviously,

 3   they'll have to assess the situation in December.                    But

 4   the international authority that existed at the time of

 5   the briefing continues to exist.

 6                The other point I was going to make,

 7   Justice Souter, is your point about American domination

 8   or influence over the Multinational Force was equally

 9   true with respect to the force in Hirota.                   You had --

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I think -- I think you're

11   right.

12                MR. GARRE:      So I don't think that that's a

13   basis for distinguishing Hirota.               The --

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            It may be -- I mean, Hirota

15   was a literally, I think, a two- or three-day per curiam

16   opinion.   It occupied less than a page, and it had this

17   kind of whole ball of wax sort of reasoning involved in

18   it.

19                And as precedential authority, if this case

20   turned on the question of whether we look to the theory

21   of international authority rather than, I think, the

22   realistic fact of American domination, I don't think

23   Hirota is a very strong precedent against our at least

24   taking the realistic view of it.

25                MR. GARRE:      Well, again, I think that Hirota


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- the amount of influence that the United States forces

 2   have over the international force isn't a basis for

 3   distinguishing Hirota.

 4                But to get to your point about citizenship,

 5   I guess we would say a few things.                 One, we that think

 6   the Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Hirota

 7   and the court of appeals below recognized that the

 8   theory of the Court's decision in Hirota doesn't lend

 9   itself to a citizenship exception.                 The habeas statute,

10   as this Court emphasized in the Rasul case, doesn't have

11   a citizenship -- doesn't distinguish between citizens

12   and aliens, and it has since 1789 contained the

13   requirement that the person be in custody under or by

14   color of United States' authority.                 So --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So once again you're

16   relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?

17                MR. GARRE:      Not the concurring opinion.

18   We're relying on the Court's decision in Hirota, but we

19   look at the concurring opinion; we've looked at the

20   briefs.   We've tried to discern the best principle of

21   law from that decision.        And the principle that we think

22   it stands for is that where individuals are held under

23   international authority by the judgment of several

24   nations, not the law of any single nation, this Court

25   lacks jurisdiction to review the custody of such


                                       10

 1   individuals.

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Garre, it is at least

 3   equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor

 4   that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was

 5   going on its lack of power "to review, to affirm, set

 6   aside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed"

 7   there.    And here we have no judgment or sentence.

 8                  So I don't think you can pick one of these

 9   strands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it

10   isn't the judgment and sentence.                 So I think we know

11   your position.    This is an opinion that says "under the

12   foregoing circumstances."            I don't think you can take it

13   much further than saying citizenship was one of those

14   circumstances.

15                  MR. GARRE:      If I can make a couple of

16   points.    One, the parties in Hirota, the habeas

17   petitioners, made very clear that they weren't asking

18   this Court to review the international conviction.                   They

19   made very clear that they were asking this Court to

20   review the actions of American officers under United

21   States law.    They made that clear on page 14 of their

22   merits brief, where they said -- and I'm quoting here --

23   "We are not asking this Court to review the decision of

24   international court" -- end quote.                   And quoting again:

25   "All the questions deal solely with official actions


                                         11

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   taken by General MacArthur as citizen and U.S. Army


 2   officer." -- end quote.        And again on page 15, quote:


 3   "We repeat again that we bring into question only


 4   unlawful action taken by General MacArthur for us."


 5               The other point that I would make is these

 6   individuals -- they haven't been convicted pursuant to a

 7   trial, like the individuals in Hirota, but these

 8   individuals are being held pursuant to determinations

 9   made by the Multinational Force carrying out the

10   international mandate.

11               In Mr. Omar's case, he not only received a

12   three-judge tribunal shortly after his detention and

13   capture, but he also received a determination before a

14   nine-officer combined review release board, consisting

15   of six Iraqi officials and three Multinational Force

16   officials, who determined that he was a security

17   internee who should be detained in accordance with the

18   United Nations mandate.

19               Now, Mr. Munaf's case did proceed before the

20   Iraqi criminal court because an injunction was not

21   entered against those proceedings.                 The Iraqi court

22   initially did enter a conviction.               That conviction was

23   reversed on appeal by the court of cassation.                 We think

24   that -- that the recent decision is significant in a

25   couple of respects.     I think, one, it underscores there


                                      12

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is an Iraqi legal system, that that system is capable of

 2   processing these cases and hearing from these

 3   individuals, and is capable of granting relief where

 4   appropriate action isn't taken.

 5               And, two, the Iraqi court order setting


 6   aside the conviction, much like an appellate order in


 7   this country would, remanded the case for further


 8   proceedings but directed that Mr. Munaf and his


 9   codefendant --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If it's in the materials,

11   then perhaps I should have known, but did the -- I take

12   it Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?

13               MR. GARRE:       Yes, both.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But how did that work?

15   Was he present in American custody and then he goes to

16   the Iraqi court?

17               MR. GARRE:       The individuals are detained by

18   the Multinational Force while there are proceedings

19   before the Iraqi court --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            So then he just goes every

21   day to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night

22   to U.S. custody?

23               MR. GARRE:       Yes.       In Mr. Munaf's case, there

24   were four investigative hearings and a trial, after

25   which he was convicted.

 1                  In Mr. Omar's case, if he were -- if the

 2   proceedings were allowed to go forward, he would remain

 3   in MNF-I custody during the course of the Iraqi

 4   proceedings.    And then, if there is a conviction and

 5   that conviction is sustained on appeal, the Iraqi


 6   government issues an order, a transfer order, to the


 7   Multinational Force.        The Multinational Force makes a


 8   determination to carry out that order.


 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There are --

10                  MR. GARRE:      And, again --

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There are in the U.S.

12   custody a number of non-citizens.                  Is that -- how many

13   people are being held in the custody of

14   the Multinational Force that the United States controls?

15                  MR. GARRE:      There are 24,000 people

16   currently being held by the Multinational Force, the

17   vast majority of whom obviously are aliens.                   Two

18   thousand individuals held by the Multinational Force

19   have been transferred to Iraqi custody.                   Many if not

20   most of those individuals have undergone court

21   proceedings because the Multinational Force is obviously

22   working in close coordination with the Iraqi government

23   to bring to justice people who have committed crimes in

24   Iraq.

25                  And if I could turn to the second question,


                                         14

 1   because we think that there is --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            One more -- I'd like -- on

 3   the first question, in reading through this, my

 4   impression was that the government -- and the green

 5   briefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from

 6   the Military Justice Institute and the national security

 7   specialists really don't disagree.                That is that

 8   everybody seems to agree, to use the words General Casey

 9   said, that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are subject to the

10   authority, direction, and control of the commander of

11   the U.S. Central Command.         And you say in your brief

12   that really this multilateral force operates subject to

13   a unified American command, and the chain of command

14   ultimately runs to the President.               So as a practical

15   matter it's the President and the Pentagon, the

16   Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that

17   control what our American soldiers do.

18               I take it there's agreement on that point,

19   but where there's disagreement is that you say, well,

20   the same was true with that tribunal at issue in Hirota.

21   Am I right about that?

22               MR. GARRE:      We say the same is true with

23   respect to the allied forces --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.     So we're not -- we're

25   not -- I take its you say that, as a practical matter


                                      15

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and as a matter of the chain of command, it runs through

 2   American officers to American commanders to the

 3   Secretary of Defense to the President of the United

 4   States.   There is no disagreement about that, or is

 5   there?

 6                 MR. GARRE:       There is not, Justice Breyer.

 7   An American --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:             There is not.

 9                 MR. GARRE:       -- official has the supreme

10   command --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.     Okay.       Then if there

12   is not -- if there is not, am I right in thinking the

13   issue is whether, because the words -- there's some

14   connection with foreign governments, absolutely.

15   There's some, but it doesn't interfere with that chain

16   of command.   And now your point is:                      But the same was

17   true with the tribunal at issue in Hirota.

18                 MR. GARRE:       The same was true with respect

19   not only to the tribunal, but the allied forces --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes, yes.

21                 MR. GARRE:       -- in Hirota.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:             The same was true.          It was

23   General MacArthur.

24                 MR. GARRE:       That's correct.                And ultimately

25   the key point, we think, is that those forces were


                                         16

 1   acting under international mandate.                      The Far Eastern


 2   Commission in Hirota ultimately had say over what the


 3   force could do --

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well --

 5                MR. GARRE:       -- whereas the United Nations

 6   here ultimately has.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:             But that's because the

 8   President, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not

 9   because the chain of command would change.

10                MR. GARRE:       Well, I think that that's true,

11   but the point I wanted to make is that the United

12   Nations today could repeal the resolutions authorizing

13   this international force and the specific mission.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             And if that happened, these

15   people would be released?

16                MR. GARRE:       They would be under the

17   authority of the United States.               We wouldn't be here

18   arguing that this Court didn't have jurisdiction.                      So,

19   ultimately, an international body distinct from the

20   United States is controlling the strings --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:             But the relevance of that

22   is General MacArthur was an agent of several allied

23   powers.

24                MR. GARRE:       As is, in our view, General

25   Petraeus.   He is sharing now the authority --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:             Then, to me, it's a matter

 2   of Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you

 3   haven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the

 4   basic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a

 5   judgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal.

 6   And it was just beginning in the issue -- to question

 7   judgments in American tribunals.                And, therefore, the

 8   obvious question is:       Well, doesn't that explain Hirota?

 9                MR. GARRE:       I don't think it does, for the

10   reasons that I have already indicated to

11   Justice Ginsburg.    That wasn't the argument the parties

12   were making in Hirota.        They went out of their way to

13   say that they weren't challenging the international

14   conviction, that they were challenging the actions of

15   the American officers acting under international law.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the Court certainly

17   listed it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's

18   the only thing that's repeated in the opinion.                But I

19   think that we've come to a standoff on that.

20                MR. GARRE:       It did.         And if I could turn now

21   to the second issue, because we do think there is a --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask just one

23   question.   Would your argument be the same if the place

24   of detention was in the United States?

25                MR. GARRE:       Analytically, it would be the


                                        18

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   same, Justice Stevens.         As a practical matter, United

 2   States forces don't act under international authority;

 3   and, thank goodness, Multinational Forces don't act in

 4   the United States.

 5               It would make a difference as to the second

 6   question, which is to say if the individuals were

 7   detained in the United States and there was a question

 8   of transferring back to Iraq, that would be a classic

 9   extradition situation.         And we'd have a whole different

10   body of case law governing these individuals --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And I suppose if he

12   were -- it would make a huge difference whether such an

13   individual were released in the United States as opposed

14   to being released in Iraq.

15               MR. GARRE:         Absolutely.                In Iraq it's

16   undisputed that if the Multinational Force were to

17   release them, the Iraqi authorities could arrest them,

18   take them into their custody.               The injunction that we

19   face today is one preventing the Iraqi courts from going

20   forward with any proceedings against Mr. Omar,

21   preventing the Multinational Force from sharing

22   information with Iraqi authorities about the

23   circumstances of his release, and directly preventing

24   the Multinational Force from transferring these

25   individuals to Iraqi custody if they are convicted.

 1               The laws of this Court -- we go back to Reid

 2   versus Covert, The Schooner Exchange -- makes clear that

 3   when American citizens go abroad voluntarily into other

 4   countries, commit crimes in those countries, and remain

 5   in those countries, they cannot come back to this

 6   country and complain about the offenses they committed,

 7   nor complain about the modes of trial and punishment

 8   available in those countries.

 9               The Court made that express in the Neely

10   versus Henkel case.      And at least on the second

11   question, we think that that principle establishes that

12   the U.S. force, even assuming it has habeas jurisdiction

13   to review their detention by the MNF-I, shouldn't be in

14   a position of directly thwarting Iraq's sovereign right

15   and jurisdiction to try these individuals and, if they

16   find that they committed offenses, punish them for

17   offenses committed in Iraq.              American citizens --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is there a limit to

19   your proposition?    In other words, let's stipulate that

20   the individuals are going to be released in a situation

21   where you know that they won't receive anything

22   resembling due process and will be subject to abuse.

23   What happens in that case?

24               MR. GARRE:        I think we would maintain that

25   American citizens, when they go abroad, they have to

 1   take what they get.     I think there is some suggestion --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, could they be

 3   released to a lynch mob?

 4                MR. GARRE:      What -- I think what this Court

 5   said in Neely versus Henkel -- and I'm quoting from page

 6   122, and I think it partially answers your question,

 7   Justice Kennedy:   "The Suspension Clause has no relation

 8   to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the

 9   United States and against the laws of a foreign

10   country."

11                If this Court thinks that it would be

12   different if there were no system of fairness or

13   process, then it could reserve that question for another

14   case.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But habeas corpus is

16   concerned with the safety of the prisoner to the extent

17   that it's controlled by our authorities.                And if you're

18   in the United States, could an officer release a

19   prisoner knowing that a lynch mob was outside?               I should

20   think not.

21                MR. GARRE:      No.        And here, Justice Kennedy,

22   the Iraqi courts are functioning under principles that

23   require fundamental standards and --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Of course, this is just a

25   hypothetical question.

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MR. GARRE:      Right.


 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Of course.


 3                 MR. GARRE:      Right.


 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And do you agree


 5   that -- do you concede that habeas is concerned with the

 6   safety of the individual as opposed to his custody?

 7                 MR. GARRE:      Habeas, as this Court has made

 8   clear, is concerned with the fact or duration of

 9   custody.    I think if we're talking about things that

10   could happen to people that would be a different type of

11   action.    American courts might be open in that extreme

12   situation.    I don't think that would be an exercise

13   that's ever been available in habeas.

14                 I think that the closest analog of this

15   Court's cases to this situation is perhaps Wilson versus

16   Girard, where you had an American serviceman stationed

17   in Japan who committed alleged offenses in Japan, and

18   the Japanese authorities made a request that they take

19   jurisdiction of that person to prosecute him for

20   offenses in Japan, and this Court considered the

21   question.    There was an injunction against the transfer

22   of that individual to Japanese authorities.                  This Court

23   set the injunction aside because it found no affirmative

24   bar on the exercise of that discretion, recognizing the

25   sovereign right and jurisdiction of the Government of


                                        22

 1   Japan to prosecute individuals, including American --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There's an important

 3   distinction, I think.       At least in this case it has been

 4   alleged that if these people are released to Iraqi

 5   custody, there is a high risk that they will be subject

 6   to torture and other abuse.

 7                 You know the brief that was filed on behalf

 8   of the NGOs where there is a quotation from Iraq's

 9   deputy justice minister:          "We cannot control the

10   prisons.   It's as simple as that.                Our jails are

11   infiltrated by the militias from top to bottom, from

12   Gaza to Baghdad."

13                 MR. GARRE:      Let me make a practical and a

14   legal point on that, Justice Ginsburg.                     First, as a

15   practical matter, it is important to keep in mind that

16   reports of torture and abuses in the Iraqi system all

17   deal with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry

18   of Defense.   We point that out --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This is a quotation from

20   the deputy justice minister.

21                 MR. GARRE:      And I don't believe he was

22   pointing to any reports of systematic abuses within the

23   department, the Ministry of Justice.                     And that's what

24   our -- our own State Department concluded in its most

25   recent reports on this.         And if you look at all the


                                        23

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reports, including the most recent report that came out

 2   a couple weeks ago from the United Nations Assistance

 3   Mission in Iraq, they point to alleged abuses within the

 4   Ministry of Interior and Defense.                  These individuals

 5   would be going to the justice system.                     We don't have


 6   reports of systematic --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Doesn't that -- doesn't


 8   that issue that you raise at least deserve litigation


 9   before the court?


10               MR. GARRE:         No, and that was the legal point

11   that I was going to make.            Even in the extradition

12   context, where everyone agrees that there would be

13   habeas jurisdiction to review a transfer for some

14   reason, the courts have not entertained allegations of

15   torture, recognizing that those considerations are

16   uniquely for the executive, except when --

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why shouldn't they?        I

18   mean, if a -- if a court may consider the imminence of

19   lynch-mob action either sanctioned by the requesting

20   government or tolerated by it, why cannot the same point

21   be made about a claim of torture if there is at least

22   enough color in the claim to say there's something to

23   inquire into?

24               MR. GARRE:         I think because for centuries,

25   Justice Souter, the courts have recognized that these


                                         24

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   are matters for the executive to assess, because --

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then why don't you have --

 3   why isn't your answer different in the lynch-mob case?

 4                MR. GARRE:      Well, I think there we weren't

 5   talking about habeas.      I think if -- and my answer was

 6   if the Court is concerned about that situation, this

 7   isn't it.   It can reserve it for a different case.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            A lynch mob doesn't require

 9   investigation by American courts of the internal

10   workings of a foreign government.

11                MR. GARRE:      Well, that's true,

12   Justice Scalia.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, but I think it would be

14   quite extraordinary to investigate the Government of

15   Iraq.   That's a matter that the executive can take into

16   account.

17                MR. GARRE:      That's --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But It would be a strange

19   thing for an American court to do.

20                MR. GARRE:      That's what the district court,

21   the court of appeals, and maybe this Court would have to

22   do if it were going to entertain allegations of --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:         In answer to a previous

24   question, I understood you to say that if the

25   individuals here were tried by an Iraqi tribunal they


                                       25

 1   would remain in the custody of the Multinational Force

 2   during the course of the trial.              Is that correct?        Does

 3   that mean that they would simply be transported to court

 4   and then brought back to the custody where they are at

 5   the present time during the course of those proceedings?

 6               MR. GARRE:       That's right, and General Garner

 7   explained that on page 48 of the appendix.

 8               The other thing I want to make on torture --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, just to follow up on

10   that, at what point during that, during the trial, would

11   there be any potential for torture by Iraqi authorities.

12               MR. GARRE:       There would be none,

13   Justice Alito.   And these individuals are represented by

14   Iraqi counsel, by American counsel.                     They have access to

15   Iraqi ombudsmen.   They can make reports.                   They can make

16   reports, as some detainees have, to the Iraqi

17   investigative judges of alleged mistreatment; not

18   torture, but Iraqi investigative judges have directed

19   that mistreatment not occur.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Sure, but once they're

21   turned over to the prison authorities they're in the

22   situation that the NGO brief describes.                    I mean, that's

23   it seems to me ultimately what the concern is.

24               MR. GARRE:       It's not the situation that the

25   NGO brief described, because all of those reports are

 1   focused on Ministry of Interior and Defense, where these

 2   individuals are not going to -- U.S. court, even in the

 3   extradition context, don't review these allegations --

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, I guess that just

 5   gets me back to my earlier question.                      Isn't that

 6   something that ought to be explored as an evidentiary

 7   matter in determining whether there should be a

 8   permanent injunction?

 9                MR. GARRE:        I don't think so.               Respect for

10   the prerogative of the executive in making its

11   determinations, respect for the sovereignty of the Iraqi

12   courts.   You have a habeas court having discovery and

13   who knows what types of proceedings as to what is going

14   on in Iraqi's criminal justice system.                      I think this

15   Court would give respect to the justice systems of other

16   sovereign nations.      This is a system which, as we say in

17   our brief, is founded on principles of fairness.

18                If I could reserve the balance of my time.

 1   it please the Court:


 2                 To resolve any confusion about the habeas


 3   Petitioners' claims, I'd like to focus on two points


 4   this morning.    The first is we believe the


 5   jurisdictional question is governed by the following

 6   rule:    When a United States citizen is detained abroad

 7   by United States military officials who have effective

 8   authority and control over his continued detention, as

 9   Mr. Garre concedes is the case today, the United States

10   district court has jurisdiction over that citizen's

11   habeas petition.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Did General

13   MacArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in

14   Japan?

15                 MR. MARGULIES:         Frankly, Your Honor, the

16   record in that regard is unclear.                 As we point out in

17   our, brief, Solicitor General Pearlman argued precisely

18   the opposite.    But let us concede for the moment that he

19   would, that Justice Douglas had the better of that

20   position, which the Court in Hirota did not resolve.

21                 Our position, Your Honor, is that it is

22   irrelevant to this question, because the problems that

23   doomed the habeas applications in Hirota had nothing to

24   do with MacArthur's status in the chain of command.                 The

25   problems with Hirota were these:


                                        28

 1               Nothing in General MacArthur's status as an

 2   American officer would have transformed those

 3   petitioners from enemy aliens to American citizens.

 4   Nothing in General MacArthur's status would have

 5   transformed their complaint as something other than an

 6   attack on the judgment and sentences of an international

 7   tribunal imposed upon them.               That, in fact, is exactly

 8   what the Court said in its nine sentences in Hirota,

 9   that it was an attack on the judgment and sentences

10   imposed upon them by an international tribunal.

11               And lastly, vis a vis the narrow question

12   before the Court in Hirota, nothing in General

13   MacArthur's status would have made this anything other

14   than an improper attempt to invoke the original and

15   appellate jurisdiction of this Court.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:               Does your case -- does

17   your case depend entirely on the fact that these are

18   American citizens?

19               MR. MARGULIES:            It is a sufficient ground,

20   Your Honor, but it does not --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:               If they were not American

22   citizens, would there be jurisdiction?

23               MR. MARGULIES:            We believe there would be

24   jurisdiction, Your Honor, but no basis to proceed --

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:               So then citizenship is


                                         29

 1   irrelevant on the jurisdictional issue?

 2               MR. MARGULIES:           Only vis a vis jurisdiction,

 3   Your Honor, but I would stress we disagree very

 4   vigorously with Mister -- with the government that if

 5   jurisdiction were to extend here to foreign nationals, a

 6   position on which we take no issue -- that it would

 7   be --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:              I don't know how you can

 9   avoid taking that question.              That what bothers me.   How

10   can you avoid addressing that question?

11               MR. MARGULIES:           Frankly, Your Honor, we are

12   inclined to agree with Justice Scalia's position in --

13   my interpretation of the habeas statute accords with

14   Justice Scalia's view of the interpretation of the

15   statute giving a right to citizens --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Are you aware of any cases

17   in which we have held that habeas jurisdiction is

18   available to a citizen where it would be not available

19   to a non-citizen?

20               MR. MARGULIES:           No, Your Honor.

21               And as I say, what we know from -- certainly

22   with made explicit in Eisentrager, where the Court

23   described citizenship as a head of jurisdiction and then

24   reaffirmed for people detained abroad, some detained

25   pursuant to international authority, like Toth v.

 2   Hayes, Gualiardo --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this second

 4   question:   Do you think the place of detention has any

 5   relevance to the issue?

 6                MR. MARGULIES:           No, Your Honor.        And one of

 7   the worrisome positions --

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Do you think whether or

 9   not it's a -- there are ongoing hostilities would have

10   any relationship to the issue?

11                MR. MARGULIES:           We think that that question

12   is answered in Hamdi, Your Honor.                  We do not challenge

13   the zone of military discretion that exists at the

14   moment of capture.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But you say that does not

16   exist in Iraq today?

17                MR. MARGULIES:           Oh, no, we do accept that it

18   exists in Iraq today, Your Honor.                  And we are not

19   challenging -- Your Honor, in this case we did not file

20   the habeas petition until Mr. Omar had been in custody

21   for -- in United States custody, for more than a year.

22   We did not file in Munaf until Mr. Munaf had been in

23   United States custody for more than a year.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But the place of detention

25   has always been Iraq?

 1               MR. MARGULIES:           I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:             The place of detention has

 3   always been Iraq?

 4               MR. MARGULIES:           Yes, Your Honor.         The United

 5   States has made the decision to retain these people --

 6   they have moved them around within Iraq, but they have

 7   made the decision to keep them in Iraq.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Would the legal issue be

 9   the same if there were violent ongoing hostilities in

10   Iraq?

11               MR. MARGULIES:           Your Honor, we accept that

12   there are violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq, but the

13   United States government takes the position that the

14   Geneva Conventions, with which they are complying

15   here -- in this case the conflict is governed by Geneva

16   Convention 4 -- obligates the United States to move

17   prisoners to a safe location, and they have done that by

18   taking these prisoners to Camp Cropper.                  I have been to

19   Camp Cropper and I agree with the United States that

20   they are complying with the Geneva Conventions in that

21   regard.

22               And upon moving the Petitioners to Camp

23   Cropper, at that moment the case becomes functionally

24   litigable just as Hamdi would have been.                 That is, the

25   government will assemble its proof to defend the

 1   detentions and present it in a district court.             The only

 2   difference is that Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar won't appear

 3   personally.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I really wanted to get

 5   your answer to Justice Stevens's first question

 6   straight.    You think citizenship is not relevant?

 7                 MR. MARGULIES:         Oh, no, Your Honor, I think

 8   it's extraordinarily relevant, and I think that we

 9   are entitled --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I thought you were not

11   basing your case on the citizenship?

12                 MR. MARGULIES:         No, Your Honor.     I apologize

13   if I misspoke.    We are basing it on citizenship --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I might have --

15                 MR. MARGULIES:         -- but it is only one of the

16   grounds upon which we would distinguish this case from

17   Hirota.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let me ask you about

19   that, because if your basic point is that here is an

20   officer of the United States that has someone in

21   custody --

22                 MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- someone who is in

24   jeopardy, among other things, of being tortured --

25                 MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- that United States

 2   official has to safeguard a citizen?

 3               MR. MARGULIES:            Yes.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But can throw a

 5   non-citizen into the lion's den?                 Is that the

 6   instruction that the United States gives to its

 7   officers, take care of our citizens, but the rest of the

 8   world, we don't care?

 9               MR. MARGULIES:            Frankly, Your Honor, I do

10   not believe the United States makes that instruction to

11   its uniformed officers.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But you're making this

13   distinction now.   Justice Kennedy asked you does -- does

14   your case turn on citizenship, and you said citizenship

15   is very important.

16               MR. MARGULIES:            Yes.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               There are thousands of

18   noncitizens that are being held in the very same

19   circumstance.

20               MR. MARGULIES:            Your Honor, there are

21   important reasons embedded in the laws of war that

22   authorize the United States in this context to transfer

23   foreign nationals back -- in this case the overwhelming

24   number of which are Iraqis -- back to the custody of the

25   Iraqi government, that the laws of war do not allow

 1   for -- with U.S. citizens.            That is a distinction.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. Margulies, the prologue

 3   to the Constitution does say "to preserve the blessings

 4   of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."                  There is

 5   something to the notion, isn't there, that the

 6   Constitution provides constitutional rights, including

 7   the right to the writ of habeas corpus, to Americans or

 8   to anyone who is in America; but to say that the whole

 9   world has rights under the Constitution is extravagant.

10               MR. MARGULIES:            I take no position on

11   whether it's extravagant, Your Honor, but I certainly

12   take the position that that's not what we argue.                  And

13   there are grounds -- there are grounds predicated on the

14   laws of war, on the terms of the extradition treaty, on

15   the possible application of the Fifth Amendment, that

16   simply make differentiation between citizens and

17   non-citizens.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So a habeas court

19   here has to look at all those different factors and come

20   to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction?

21   There's no bright line?          It has to look at whether

22   hostilities have ceased or haven't ceased?                  It's got to

23   look at how far the prisoners have been removed from the

24   zone of hostility?

25               MR. GARRE:         No.        No, emphatically not, Your

 1   Honor.


 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So what is the


 3   bright line that determines whether there's habeas


 4   jurisdiction or not?


 5                MR. MARGULIES:          Control.            That is what

 6   habeas turns on, Your Honor.             And the bright-line test

 7   that we propose, which is the one that has been followed

 8   by this Court --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the control in

10   the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign

11   national allows -- creates habeas jurisdiction?                    That's

12   your bright line?

13                MR. MARGULIES:          No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

14   What I mean to suggest, the rule that I propose -- the

15   rule that I propose is that when a U.S. citizen is

16   detained abroad by U.S. military officials who have

17   effective authority and control over his continued

18   detention, that citizen can invoke the jurisdiction of

19   the United States district court.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, then it's not

21   just control.   It looks to citizenship, which brings up

22   the questions Justice Stevens was raising.

23                MR. MARGULIES:          Yes, Your Honor, and I

24   apologize.   What I said at the outset is that this is a

25   test which turns on the jurisdictional facts that I have

 1   identified, which is when a citizen is detained by the

 2   U.S. military abroad and the military has effective

 3   control.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do we have any -- any

 5   precedent in our cases for saying that that test would

 6   apply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?

 7                 MR. MARGULIES:         Toth v. Quarles, of course,

 8   Your Honor, involved a person who was brought from the

 9   United States to Korea when there was still hostilities

10   ongoing.

11                 But Your Honor, again I would suggest that

12   what the Court will have to inquire into has been

13   addressed already by Hamdi, because we will not look at

14   the period of time --

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It's a very different

16   place of detention.

17                 MR. MARGULIES:         Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.

18   But we are not focusing on the moment of capture.            The

19   United States already has --

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         I still don't -- I don't

21   understand what you're saying about citizenship.            You

22   said earlier it wasn't necessary, and it make as big

23   difference.   There are thousands of non-U.S. citizens

24   being held Iraq.   Your argument with respect to your

25   clients is that they have -- they can file habeas

 1   petitions in the District of Columbia and they can't be

 2   turned over except pursuant to the extradition treaty

 3   between the United States and Iraq; is that correct?

 4                MR. MARGULIES:         Not quite, Your Honor.       Our

 5   position is -- and I want to come back --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         If I could just then finish

 7   the question.   Pursuant to the extradition treaty or

 8   some other authorization; if citizenship isn't

 9   important, then why can't all of those thousands of

10   non-citizens -- or can all of those thousands of

11   non-citizens -- who are being held in Iraq file habeas

12   petitions in the District of Columbia and argue that

13   they can't be turned over except pursuant to the

14   extradition treaty or some other authorization?

15                MR. MARGULIES:         For several reasons, Your

16   Honor.   First of all, as the Court knows, the habeas

17   statute itself has been amended in a way that excludes

18   access for foreign nationals outside the country.             The

19   Court -- or rather Congress, very carefully did not

20   exclude it for U.S. citizens.             Second, there may be

21   limitations on whether foreign nationals can invoke the

22   protections of the Fifth Amendment.

23                Third, as I pointed out, the extradition

24   treaty bars the transfer of citizens, but does not bar

25   the transfer of non-citizens.             And fourth, the laws of


                                       38

 1   war allow the United States to transfer Iraqis, but

 2   contemplate the continued application of extradition

 3   principles that were in place prior to the start of the

 4   conflict.

 5                So there are four brakes, if you will, on

 6   the slippery slope.     There is no floodgates problem in

 7   this case.   So far as we are aware --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            But you have only the --

 9   the citizenship to stop the floodgate.                    What I'm

10   wondering is -- when I read the briefs, I put in my mind

11   a spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of

12   Japan, where there is basically peace but it's a

13   military occupation.      On the other side, it's a hot war

14   or a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up

15   troops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas.                    And

16   I had put this case quite close to the military

17   occupation in my mind because of the nature of these

18   particular individuals' offense and treatment.                    But was

19   I wrong to do that?     Should I assimilate this case to

20   either a hot war or at least a guerilla warfare, where

21   troops are actively engaged in rounding up those who

22   want to shoot them?

23                MR. MARGULIES:         You should definitely not

24   assimilate this case to the latter category, Your Honor.

25   That is not what this case is about.                    And let me turn

 1   then --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            In answering that question,

 3   would you go back, please, and clarify something that

 4   I'm not too clear on in your answers to comparable

 5   questions from Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens?               And

 6   that is, you say we do not claim that there would be

 7   jurisdiction within the zone of hostilities.              Is it your

 8   point -- and you then go on to say, well, they've been

 9   moved to this camp.     Is your point the simple point that

10   the camp gets them out of the zone of hostilities?                And

11   is that the reason that you answered Justice Breyer's

12   question by saying this is comparable to an occupation

13   rather than a war zone?        Is that the simple point?

14               MR. MARGULIES:         No, Your Honor.       What I am

15   -- what I am seizing upon is the conclusion in Hamdi

16   that there is a zone of military discretion within which

17   the judiciary ought not intrude.              And that has both

18   spatial and temporal qualities.

19               This is a person who has been moved from

20   that place, and the detention has been made, a decision

21   has been made to continue detention long after --

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            So you're saying within

23   what is technically a zone of hostility, there are

24   places, physical places, I take it, within which the

25   military has a degree of discretion; and that discretion


                                      40

 1   is what makes this situation comparable to an


 2   occupation?


 3                  I mean, I'm just not following how you're


 4   getting from A to B.        That's -- that's my problem.


 5                  MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, what we are

 6   suggesting is that we recognize that there are

 7   hostilities going on inside Iraq.                  But the United States

 8   has made a decision to move the person, as required by

 9   the Geneva Conventions, to a safe location.

10                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           So are you saying then

11   that the zone of hostilities does not include all of

12   Iraq?

13                  MR. MARGULIES:         Absolutely.         That is --

14                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           So what if we thought

15   otherwise?

16                  MR. MARGULIES:         I'm sorry, Your Honor?

17                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           What if we thought

18   otherwise?     What if we thought all -- all of Iraq is a

19   zone of hostilities?        Would we have a different result?

20                  MR. MARGULIES:         We would not, Your Honor.

21   We would not have a different result either

22   jurisdictionally or on the merits.                   If the United States

23   Government has custody and control of a United States

24   citizen, there is habeas jurisdiction.

25                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then you've got to say that


                                         41

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there is habeas jurisdiction within the zone of

 2   hostility.   I thought you said the opposite.

 3                MR. MARGULIES:         No, Your Honor.           I do say --

 4   our position is that the habeas statute would give

 5   jurisdiction, but there may be a period in which it


 6   would be inappropriate, unwise, just as in Hamdi, for


 7   the Court to intrude.      And that may be --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:            An abstention kind of


 9   doctrine then is what you are getting at?


10                MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.       It is abstention upon

11   --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that's pretty far

13   removed from the bright line.             I mean, now you've got to

14   decide whether it's in the zone of hostilities or not.

15   You've got to decide if this is within the time period

16   that the Court should not exercise jurisdiction or not.

17   And what's going to happen, of course, is that the

18   district court is going to look at this and say, I can't

19   decide all of that right away.              Let's enter an

20   injunction, a preliminary injunction such as at issue

21   here, while I decide these questions.                   And that's going

22   to have the effect of intruding quite extensively on the

23   exercise of executive authority.

24                MR. MARGULIES:         I -- we think not, Your

25   Honor.

 1                First of all, it does not alter in the

 2   slightest the jurisdictional rule.                  The jurisdictional

 3   rule given to us by the habeas statute is still a

 4   bright-line rule.    There may be some cases where the

 5   petitioner is asking to -- the Court to inquire into the

 6   lawfulness of -- the two inquiries in this case, the --

 7   both of them governed by the Due Process Clause -- the

 8   lawfulness of the detention for security threats, and

 9   the lawfulness of the proposed transfer.                  Those are two

10   different inquiries.       Those are the two inquiries.

11                There may be some instance where that

12   request is made fairly shortly after the decision was

13   made to continue to detain.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Margulies, could I ask

15   a few questions about the Multinational Force involved

16   here?   Do you acknowledge that in theory, at least, the

17   United States in its capacity here is subject to the

18   control of the United Nations?

19                MR. MARGULIES:          No.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You do not?

21                MR. MARGULIES:          We do not.          It is

22   emphatically not the case.           The resolutions which bring

23   the Multinational Force into existence say that it will

24   operate under the unified command of the United States

25   military, which is precisely the position that the

 1   government pressed in its brief, on page 2 of its brief.

 2   General Casey when he testified said that the MNF is a

 3   subordinate command to the United States military.

 4   There is nothing in the record which suggests that the

 5   MNF could, if it wanted to, give an order that the

 6   United States could not countermand.                      There is nothing

 7   that gives this anything other than -- and we do not --

 8   we do not denigrate or diminish the significance of any

 9   other country's participation.                But the buck stops with

10   the United States Government when it comes to these

11   detentions.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Let me try and move

13   you to the merits.

14                 MR. MARGULIES:          Please.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I had thought that

16   the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge

17   custody.   And it seems to me that the last thing your

18   clients want in this case is to be released.

19                 MR. MARGULIES:          That is incorrect, Your

20   Honor, and let me make it clear.                 There is some question

21   that emerged in the earlier argument on the potential

22   equivalence between release and transfer.                      So let me

23   address that directly.

24                 With respect to transfer -- again that's a

25   separate question from detention simpliciter -- with


                                         44

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   respect to transfer, there are two questions:                 The

 2   transfer will either be lawful or it will not; Iraq will

 3   either want him or it will not.

 4                That obviously produces four different

 5   possible outcomes, a matrix with four boxes.                 It is too

 6   early to ascertain which of those boxes we will be in,

 7   but let me give an illustration.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, but in the cases --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't want the

10   district court to say you win, you can be released

11   tomorrow at noon.

12                MR. MARGULIES:          Yes, we do.         In fact, Your

13   Honor --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought you

15   wanted to block the transfer.              I mean, the Iraqi

16   authorities can pick him up at the gate.

17                MR. MARGULIES:          Your Honor, let's say we

18   had -- my understanding of the evidence in Munaf leads

19   me to believe that on remand this is where we -- this is

20   where the state of play will go:                The transfer will be

21   unlawful, and the Iraqi government will not want him.

22                Transfer unlawful.              Iraqi government won't

23   want him.   He can be released to his home --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But he -- he is still

25   within the Iraqi criminal justice system.                 He wasn't --


                                        45

 1   his case wasn't dismissed.          It was sent back for further

 2   investigation.

 3                MR. MARGULIES:         Correct.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So what's happening in

 5   his case is he's undergoing a criminal process in Iraq;

 6   and we are holding him during that process.             So if

 7   you're not objecting to our holding him while the

 8   process is going on, what is -- what is he seeking

 9   through habeas?

10                He -- he can't get out from under the Iraqi

11   criminal justice system.         He is alleged to have

12   committed crimes within Iraq.             We are holding him safe

13   while that process is going on.              So what is the basis of

14   his petition?

15                MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, his petition,

16   like Mr. Omar's petition, seeks his release.             The only

17   complexity arises in one of the possible boxes; that is,

18   the Court concludes that the transfer is unlawful, but

19   there is no -- but the Iraqi government wants him.              The

20   transfer is unlawful, but the Iraqi government wants

21   him.

22                In that situation, in order to give effect

23   to the legal conclusion that the transfer is unlawful --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I don't get up to

25   transfer.   This man is now under investigation in the

 2                  MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.

 3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Now, we -- transfer isn't

 4   an issue.

 5                  What do you want done with him while he's

 6   subject to the criminal process in Iraq?

 7                  MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, you are correct

 8   that we do not object to the idea that, while the

 9   district court is determining whether it is lawful to

10   detain a U.S. citizen in this circumstances or transfer

11   a U.S. citizen in those circumstances -- those two

12   inquiries -- it is okay to detain Mr. Munaf for the

13   benefit of the Iraqi government.

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought the relief

15   that was awarded by the district court also enjoined

16   prosecution.

17                  MR. MARGULIES:         It does not, Your Honor, and

18   to the extent that the D.C. Circuit in Omar interprets

19   that, we do not -- we disavow that.                       There -- as the

20   court pointed out, the -- first of all, they can try a

21   prisoner in absentia.        All we object to is that -- a

22   physical transfer of Mr. Omar or Mr. Munaf, while the

23   lawfulness of that transfer is being determined.                       And

24   that is all we sought.

 3   says you want us to release him.                At noon tomorrow, we

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You want -- I'm

11   sorry.   I just want to make sure I understand.                 You want

12   the relief in both of these cases to be, okay, we will

13   release him tomorrow at noon?              And by the way, we're

14   going to notify the Iraqi authorities because we think

15   we're releasing a dangerous criminal and want to make

16   sure they have the opportunity to do whatever they want?

17                MR. MARGULIES:          There is -- there is no

18   question that we do not challenge any right of

19   sovereignance in Iraq to share information.                  The only

20   circumstance in which it potentially arises is one in

21   which release has the effect of being transfer and there

22   is a prior determination by a United States district

23   court that the transfer would be unlawful.                  So that --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, why didn't you

25   answer Justice Breyer -- and we've interrupted you a

 1   couple of times.    You have the box.                    He's going to be


 2   released.   They want him.          I don't see then why you


 3   didn't answer Justice Breyer's question differently.


 4                MR. MARGULIES:          Because what I understood


 5   the hypothetical to mean is that there had not been a

 6   prior determination that the transfer would be unlawful.

 7   In other words, if they just released him tomorrow --

 8   they said, we have lost interest in him; we're releasing

 9   him tomorrow -- there is no prior determination that the

10   transfer is unlawful.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, what we're doing --

12                MR. MARGULIES:          So you're not --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What we're doing is we're

14   testing the authority and the propriety of the district

15   judge to proceed.

16                MR. MARGULIES:          Yes.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And that's why we are

18   asking if, at the end of the day, the order is a

19   release, is there a problem?             And I should think you'd

20   yes.

21                MR. MARGULIES:          No.      Your Honor, if the

22   conclusion is that the transfer would be unlawful, then

23   you cannot release him in a way that effects the

24   transfer.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Who says?          I mean, a

 1   transfer is one thing and saying you're free to go and

 2   the Iraqi government picks him up is something else.

 3   Why -- why do you equate the two?

 4                MR. MARGULIES:         Because, Your Honor, we

 5   think that the district court can order, under 28 U.S.C.

 6   2243, as law and justice requires, a release -- or

 7   rather, relief that gives effect to the contours of the

 8   right.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But -- of course it can.

10                MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It can, but --

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:            What --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me that you're

14   begging -- you're begging a question -- you're inserting

15   a premise that we have to decide, whether the release is

16   unlawful.   We're asking, that's part of the equation.

17   I'm the district judge.        Can I say, I've looked at all

18   this, I want this prisoner released tomorrow morning;

19   and if the Iraqis pick him up, fine with me?                Can I say

20   that?

21                MR. MARGULIES:         Yes, you can.

22                But if there is a determination that the

23   transfer would be unlawful, then you need to release the

24   person in a manner -- for instance, Your Honor --

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:            All right.      Let's get to

 1   that.    What manner?     Tell me exactly what should such an

 2   order would look like.

 3                  MR. MARGULIES:         It -- we would ask the

 4   district court to order precisely what the military

 5   already does, which is to remove a person to a safe

 6   place.    When United States citizens are released from

 7   Camp Cropper, they are brought from --

 8                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            So Releasing at place A,

 9   not place B.

10                  MR. MARGULIES:         That's correct.

11                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Don't push him out the

12   gates; take him somewhere else, and then release him.

13   That's the order?

14                  MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.

15                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

16                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And don't tell --

17                  MR. MARGULIES:         That's the --

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And don't tell the

19   Iraqis where that's going to be?

20                  MR. MARGULIES:         They don't do that now, Your

21   Honor.    When -- when United States citizens are released

22   from Iraq, what they do is they put them in a car out of

23   Camp Cropper, the same thing when I left Camp Cropper.

24   They put them in a car from Camp Cropper.                  They drive

25   them to the American --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's within

 2   the executive's discretion.             I want to know if you are

 3   saying that the district court in this case can require

 4   the custodian not simply to release the person, but to

 5   release them somewhere else and to keep the point at

 6   which they're going to release someone whose been

 7   determined by the MNF-I tribunal to be a dangerous

 8   criminal, to keep the point of his release secret from

 9   the Iraqi government.

10               MR. MARGULIES:          If the determination has

11   already been made that the transfer would be unlawful,

12   yes, we think that in law and equity they can do that.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay.   Now the

14   determination that the transfer would be unlawful, I --

15   again, I get back -- maybe I'm repeating myself.                 I have

16   always understood habeas to be concerned with custody,

17   rather than this broad range of determinations about

18   what's lawful and unlawful, other than as are necessary

19   to rule on the question of custody.

20               In other words, of course, if there's been a

21   Fourth Amendment violation, you bring a habeas action,

22   you determine whether the custody is lawful or not.

23   Here you want a determination whether the transfer is

24   unlawful or not.

25               MR. MARGULIES:          Yes.       Because the United

 1   States Government simply lacks the power under the Due

 2   Process Clause to surrender a citizen to the custody of

 3   another sovereign.      That -- it just lacks that power.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Whether it does or

 5   does not, I just question whether habeas is an

 6   appropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's

 7   not concerned with the legality of transfer; it's

 8   concerned with the legality of custody.

 9               MR. MARGULIES:            Habeas has long been used to

10   test the lawfulness, under the Fifth Amendment, of a

11   proposed transfer.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:              How can you say that the

13   United States lacks the power to transfer?                  Suppose this

14   fellow had been arrested in the street by a sergeant in

15   the Army and he says, what will I do with him?                  I'll

16   take him to the Iraqis and turn him over.                  Would that be

17   an illegal transfer?

18               MR. MARGULIES:            It -- once the United States

19   has the authority to --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:              A sergeant caught this

21   guy, and he wants to turn him over to the Iraqis.                  Does

22   he -- is there some law that prevents him from doing

23   that?

24               MR. MARGULIES:            It may be the Constitution

25   and the habeas statute could combine to prevent that.

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           That applies to the

 2   sergeant in the city of --

 3                 MR. MARGULIES:         As I said before, Your

 4   Honor -- as I tried to say, and I apologize if I'm not

 5   being clear -- there is a zone of military discretion

 6   where it may not be appropriate --

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Why isn't all of this

 8   within the zone of military discretion?

 9                 MR. MARGULIES:         Because we filed this

10   application more than a year after the United States

11   made a decision to continue the detention.                    Think about

12   it this way, Your Honor:          If Hamdi -- exact same facts

13   -- had simply been kept in Afghanistan, instead of

14   brought to Charleston, South Carolina, we think there

15   still would have habeas jurisdiction.                    The court would

16   have undertaken the exact same inquiry.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if you had filed

18   it -- if you had filed it six months rather than a year

19   after, would there be habeas jurisdiction.

20                 MR. MARGULIES:         We think in six months, yes.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You see where I'm

22   going.   Three months?

23                 MR. MARGULIES:         There may be some cases that

24   become difficult, Your Honor.              In this case, for

25   instance --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The bright line is

 2   getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.

 3                MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, in this case --

 4   in both cases, after two months they made the

 5   determination to continue to hold them in the MNF-I

 6   tribunals.   So at the very least, at that point we're

 7   covered.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it seems to me your

 9   statement is wildly overbroad:              That there is a

10   due-process restriction on release by the United States

11   Government to another sovereign?

12                MR. MARGULIES:         Yes.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If we have an undercover

14   agent in Japan who finds a drug dealer, he gives him to

15   the Japanese police.

16                MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I don't understand that.

18   That's a sweeping statement.            That just can't be right.

19                MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, with all due

20   respect, it has been the law for over a century in this

21   country.   It ordinarily arises in the classic

22   extradition context.      But even when a person is already

23   overseas and the United States wants to transfer them to

24   the custody of another sovereign --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           You're talking about a

 1   transfer in what I assume you said was a zone of

 2   hostilities.

 3                  MR. MARGULIES:         I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 4                  JUSTICE STEVENS:            I thought you were talking

 5   about a transfer in an area that you say was engaged in

 6   active hostilities.

 7                  MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, we --

 8                  JUSTICE STEVENS:            Does that affect the

 9   decision at all?

10                  MR. MARGULIES:         It does not affect a

11   citizen's due-process entitlement.                   In the metes and

12   bounds, the way we would analyze it under Matthews

13   versus Aldridge, it may affect what inquiry the

14   government has to make in order to justify it.                   But it

15   does not affect the citizen's right, the citizen's

16   constitutional entitlement, to challenge the lawfulness

17   of a transfer at the hands of his government to another

18   sovereign.

19                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you've just said that

20   it's unlawful.    You said that an American law

21   enforcement officer working in another country who takes

22   custody of a wanted criminal cannot turn him over to the

23   government of that country.               That's just got to be

24   wrong.

25                  MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, just to finish

 1   the answer, the transfer may take place, but it may only

 2   take place as authorized by law.               That is, they have to

 3   show a legal and factual basis.              The legal basis is they

 4   have to show a treaty or a statutory authority; and the

 5   factual basis is they have to show that the person comes

 6   within it.

 7                So, of course, they can pass a person.

 8   Those -- those transfers take place all the time, but it

 9   must take place consistent with the requirements of the

10   law.

11                Thank you.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Margulies, let

13   me make sure there are no other questions.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            You need all that to win

15   this case.   That is, as I started the case I thought

16   this involved an American being held by the military for

17   over a year pending the resolution of criminal charges

18   in Iraq, which are charges of kidnapping in respect to

19   which whatever hot war is going on over there has very

20   little to do with his being held.

21                MR. MARGULIES:         Correct.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, you've been arguing

23   for all sorts of things that seem far broader than that.

24   So I'd like to focus you for a second on that matter.

25                MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, we -- all of

 1   these other matters we do not need in order to prevail.

 2   The district court, examining two claims under the

 3   due-process clause, will examine whether there is legal

 4   authority to detain a person, to detain these prisoners

 5   as security internees or security threats.                   That is a

 6   classic Hamdi inquiry.        And they will examine under the

 7   due-process clause whether it is lawful to transfer

 8   them.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, why do you say it has

10   nothing to do with the war, then?                 They are holding them

11   as security detainees.        Aren't they -- aren't they

12   worried that if they just let them go, they'll go right

13   back to killing Americans and Iraqis?

14                 MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, this is what

15   came up in Hamdi.    In Hamdi, you had a conflict, boots

16   on the ground.   They captured a United States citizen in

17   a battlefield situation.          And this Court made a

18   decision, made a determination, that that person can

19   challenge the lawfulness of his -- of his detention.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm not arguing that.        I'm

21   just questioning your statement that it's irrelevant

22   that this is occurring in a war zone.                    It is not at all

23   irrelevant.

24                 One of the -- the reason they're being

25   detained is precisely because this is a war zone.

 1                  MR. MARGULIES:         Your Honor, we think that

 2   point is answered by the suggestion in Hamdi that you

 3   don't want to create a perverse incentive to keep people

 4   there.   They have made a decision to keep them there.

 5   The inquiry that the district court will undertake is

 6   the same in Hamdi as in this case.                   There is nothing

 7   that -- there is nothing about that inquiry that is

 8   altered by the United States' determination to move them

 9   to a safe --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            One distinct difference

11   in Munaf's case:    He is undergoing a criminal process in

12   Iraq, and Omar has also -- it is alleged that he has

13   committed offenses in Iraq.

14                  Has no prosecution, no investigation been

15   started with respect to Omar?

16                  MR. MARGULIES:         That is correct, Your Honor.

17   What the district court did in its preliminary

18   injunction, the Rosetta Stone of the preliminary

19   injunction appears on page 143 of the joint appendix.

20                  And there you have an e-mail from the United

21   States Government, from opposing counsel to us,

22   indicating to us on February 2, 2006, that a decision

23   had been made to refer Mr. Omar to proceedings in the

24   CCCI, but telling us in the second-to-the-last sentence

25   of that page that we would not receive notice of when


                                         59

 1   that referral took place.

 2                 And it pointedly -- they did not say that

 3   Mr. Omar would remain in U.S. custody once the referral

 4   took place.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,


 6   Mr. Margulies.


 7                 MR. MARGULIES:         Thank you, Your Honor.


 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Garre, seven


 9   minutes.


10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Garre, would you

11   address this question at some point?                     Assuming -- assume

12   an officer in the national government arrests somebody

13   unlawfully in Portland, Oregon, and transfers the person

14   across the country to Portland, Maine.                    The person files

15   for habeas in the district court in Maine, and the

16   district court says:       Yes, you are right.               You are being

17   held unlawfully.

18                 Does the court have the authority to tell

19   the United States to take him back to Portland, Oregon,

20   and then release him?

21                      REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY GARRE

22                              ON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,

23                          SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.

24                 MR. GARRE:      I think this court confronted a

25   similar situation in the Padilla case a couple of years


                                        60

 1   ago.   And what it -- it -- there was a habeas petition

 2   filed in New York, and it -- the court held that that

 3   habeas petition was improperly filed and a different

 4   petition should be filed in South Carolina.

 5                 And it didn't get into the question of the

 6   transfer.   And we certainly -- we don't think that

 7   transfer --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you have a position on

 9   the answer to my question?

10                 MR. GARRE:      Whether the habeas court could

11   direct that he be brought back to Portland?

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

13                 MR. GARRE:      I think the habeas court would

14   --

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            The habeas court says,

16   look, it is not complete relief just to put him out on

17   the street in Portland --           in Maine.            He's broke, and

18   he's 3,000 miles from home.              Take him back to Portland,

19   Oregon.

20                 Does the habeas court have the authority to

21   do that?

22                 MR. GARRE:      I would say probably not,

23   Justice Souter.   I mean there are transfers all the time

24   where habeas petitions are filed, and people are going

25   from State authority to Federal authority.                     And the rule


                                        61

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is that those transfers, of course, can take place.              The

 2   habeas proceedings can continue.                The habeas has

 3   traditionally been used to block transfers.

 4                Here -- and I think it is important to focus

 5   on the injunction that the court of appeals sustained.

 6   It is an injunction against allowing the Iraqi

 7   prosecutions to proceed because the court enjoined

 8   American officials from presenting Mr. Omar to the Iraqi

 9   courts.   Now, Mr. Margulies said that they didn't enjoin

10   --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I didn't see that in the

12   junction, itself.    It just -- the injunction was very

13   spare.

14                MR. GARRE:       What the injunction says -- and

15   it is on page 59a -- is that it bars -- of the petition

16   appendix in the Omar petition, the gray petition, and I

17   am quoting now:   "Shall not remove the Petitioner from

18   the United States or MNF-I custody, or take any other

19   action inconsistent with this court's memorandum

20   opinion."

21                "Any other action inconsistent with this

22   court's memorandum opinion" is allowing the prosecution

23   to proceed, and the Court of Appeals makes this express

24   on page 25a of the petition appendix where the Court of

25   Appeals majority says, quote, "we agree with the dissent


                                        62

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that the injunction prohibits the military from

 2   presenting Omar to the CCCI for trial."

 3                 Now, Mr. Margulies said that the proceedings

 4   can go forward just without his client's presence,

 5   but that --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If one could go agree --

 7   let's say one could agree that was overbroad.                     Does that

 8   mean that the whole injunction falls?                     Let's say, take

 9   two pieces out of it:       No information sharing; that's

10   beyond the pale.   And you can't make an order that a

11   foreign court shouldn't hear a case.                     Take those two

12   out.

13                 MR. GARRE:      That would be a vast improvement

14   over the injunction that was held by the court of

15   appeals.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But how about the rest of

17   it?

18                 MR. GARRE:      And then you are dealt -- you

19   are left with the transfer, the injunction on the

20   transfer to the Iraqi authorities in the event that

21   Mr. Omar is convicted.

22                 And on that, I confess to being not -- not

23   being entirely clear as to what my friend's position is.

24   He says that we can release him because, of course, that

25   is the office of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.


                                        63

 1                  But then he goes on to say:                    But we can't

 2   release him in a way that would affect a transfer.                       I'm

 3   not sure what that means because I thought he also

 4   said that we --

 5                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, I think it means the

 6   same thing that the point of my question was.

 7                  He is saying you can't release him at point

 8   A, which would be tantamount to transfer; you've got to

 9   take him to point B, somewhere where his release will

10   not result in the automatic arrest.                       And that's why I

11   asked my question.

12                  MR. GARRE:      Just to underscore the affront

13   to the Iraqi sovereignty on this, his clients

14   acknowledge that they can be arrested by Iraqi officials

15   for crimes they allegedly committed in Iraq if they were

16   released.   But the injunction that they're asking this

17   Court to sustain is an injunction that prevents the

18   Multi-National Force in Iraq from telling Iraqi

19   authorities:    We are going to release these Petitioners

20   at 12:00 o'clock tomorrow.            In effect, they're asking

21   for an eight-hour head start so that these individuals

22   whom the Multi-National Force has determined pose

23   threats to the security of Iraq, who Iraq has determined

24   pose threats to the security of Iraq, that an American

25   court is enjoining the Multi-National Force from


                                         64

 1   conveying that information to the Iraqi authorities so

 2   that these individuals who went to Iraq voluntarily can

 3   be held to account in he Iraqi system for crimes that

 4   they committed.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you think an eight-hour

 6   lead is enough?   I don't know.

 7                MR. GARRE:      Well, I --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would make a good movie.

 9                MR. GARRE:      Yes.

10                (Laughter.)

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So we have a basic

12   question:   Is there habeas jurisdiction; and, as I

13   understand the posture of this case, the Federal courts

14   did not examine the merits of the habeas petition.                   They

15   were just hung up on the bare jurisdictional question.

16                MR. GARRE:      That's true.               But we think that

17   it is quite clear from this Court's decisions that if

18   they don't have the authority to enter the preliminary

19   injunctive relief that they did at the end of the day

20   they have no authority to enter it as a preliminary

21   matter.

22                I think on the jurisdictional point, the one

23   point I wanted to stress is that if this Court does find

24   jurisdiction we think it has to be because of a reading

25   of the habeas statute informed by the Constitution


                                       65

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that's limited to citizens.               Extending jurisdiction to

 2   everyone in Iraq would be an extraordinary expansion of

 3   this Court's decision in Rasul.                Just to be clear, Camp

 4   Cropper in Iraq bears none of the characteristics of the

 5   Guantanamo Bay that this Court discussed in its opinion

 6   in Rasul and that Justice Kennedy emphasized in his

 7   concurrence.    So any jurisdictional ruling by this

 8   Court, we would urge it to rule only to the

 9   circumstances here of the fact of citizenship.

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The the 20,000-plus

11   people being retained, are they all in connection with

12   security threats?     Or do they involve what I guess we

13   could call common criminals?

14                  MR. GARRE:      I think there are both.               This

15   have been 2,000 transfers of individuals from

16   Multinational Force to Iraqi custody, most in connection

17   with criminal proceedings.            The other individuals are

18   held because they're a security threat.                   A lot of

19   individuals come in and out of detention.

20                  Obviously the Multinational Force tries to

21   limit the detentions as much as possible.                   Here the

22   reason why these people have been subsidy contained so

23   long is because the American courts have stood in the

24   way of the Iraqi criminal proceedings where the Iraqi

25   courts have sought to bring justice to these people

 1   under Iraqi law.

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Garre, is it the

 3   position of the government that this is a war zone?

 4               MR. GARRE:       It's -- we don't take the

 5   position this is like a battlefield situation.                The

 6   occupation --

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Do you think any part of

 8   Iraq is like a battlefield situation?

 9               MR. GARRE:       Certainly there are active

10   hostilities in parts of Iraq.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Why isn't it a war zone?

12               MR. GARRE:       Well, the occupation has ended.

13   I think there are active hostilities in part of it.                  We

14   have not argued that there is no habeas jurisdiction

15   because of the hostilities there.                We've argued that

16   there is no habeas jurisdiction because they're being

17   held under --

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:             That means you haven't

19   made your strongest argument.

20               MR. GARRE:       Well, if the Court believes that

21   that's our strongest argument, certainly we don't have

22   any objection to having you address it.

23               (Laughter.)

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             But am I right to assume

25   the underlying situation to be that of Hirota?

 1                MR. GARRE:      That's jurisdictional.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, but you see what I

 3   mean by that?   I mean, these issues of the war zone and

 4   so forth are not really there in this case; that we're

 5   talking here about a person whose being held in a manner

 6   that's comparable for habeas purposes to the Japanese or

 7   aliens who were held in Hirota.              They're being held by

 8   the Army, which is in part, which is in relevant part

 9   serving as an occupying force, to be turned over to a

10   different tribunal.

11                MR. GARRE:      That's correct, Justice Breyer.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay, thank you.
