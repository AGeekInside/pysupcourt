 7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. FRANKLIN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                Acting with express statutory authority and

12   in furtherance of important foreign policies following

13   the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President

14   made inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of

15   law that had applied to countries that sponsored

16   terrorism.

17                Under the plain language of the statute,

18   those provisions included former section 1605(a)(7),

19   which was a provision of law that applied only to such

20   countries.   Because section 1605(a)(7) was made

21   inapplicable as to Iraq effective on the President's

22   determination, it cannot now serve as the applicable

23   statutory basis for abrogation of Iraq's foreign

24   sovereign immunity and therefore subject matter

25   jurisdiction in this case.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Franklin, even if you

 2   are right about that, the legislation was an emergency

 3   measure with a sunset.         It was revived for 1 year, but

 4   then no more.     So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack

 5   of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back?                Didn't

 6   the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency

 7   law sunsetted?

 8               MR. FRANKLIN:            No, Your Honor.      The language

 9   of the sunset provision to which you are referring

10   states only that the authorities contained in the

11   section would expire.        That means the authorities to the

12   President given to him to act.                Congress did not say

13   that the effect of what the President had done would be

14   nullified once his authority to act had expired.

15               And it's important to recognize that the

16   President not only made inapplicable provisions of law

17   addressed to state nations that had sponsored terrorism,

18   but he also suspended the Iraq Sanctions Act under the

19   same authority.    The Iraq Sanctions Act has never been

20   repealed.

21               So, if it were correct that the -- that the

22   -- everything that the President had done became

23   nullified upon the expiration of his authority to act,

24   then the Iraq Sanctions Act would not only currently be

25   in effect today, but would have been in effect since


                                          5

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   September 30th, 2005.     And if there's -- that is not

 2   what Congress intended.       The Iraq Sanctions Act has a

 3   huge panoply of sanctions, both dependent on and

 4   independent of the legislative determination of Iraq as

 5   a state sponsor of terrorism.

 6              But if there's any question about this, when

 7   Congress acted again, the same Congress acted in 2003 to

 8   extend the expiration date, Congress -- the -- when that

 9   Congress acted, the legislative history said quite

10   expressly that the extension was not necessary to extend

11   what the President had already done, because that had

12   already happened and that was permanent.                But it was

13   necessary according to Congress for other reasons.

14              So both because of the plain language of the

15   sunset provision and because of what Congress

16   subsequently did in 2003 to extend it, as well as the

17   interpretation of the United States on this point, the

18   President's actions didn't sunset.                It was emergency

19   legislation to be sure, but the emergency was to give

20   the President the authorities.             We were at war at that

21   time and our foreign policy was changing 180 degrees

22   almost overnight away from penalizing the government of

23   Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism, as an

24   outlaw regime, and immediately towards helping the

25   people of Iraq.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              And Congress gave the President the broad

 2   catch-all authority to, if he deemed it appropriate, to

 3   relieve the people of Iraq from all, not just some, of

 4   the very onerous restrictions and disabilities that had

 5   applied to them as a result of the prior regime's

 6   support for terrorism.

 7              The President did this in exercise of his

 8   foreign policy judgment in order that the people of Iraq

 9   could better rebuild their country and establish a new

10   democratic government that would in fact prove to become

11   one of the United States' most trusted allies in a

12   region that has not always had very many of them.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what do you make of

14   the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was

15   never its intention, it was never its intention for the

16   President to have the authority to -- to do this?

17              MR. FRANKLIN:          Two things, Justice Alito:

18   The -- the first point is that this was not the Congress

19   that acted in 2003.     This was a subsequent Congress.

20   And that statement occurred almost 5 years after the

21   legislation had been enacted and almost 3 years after

22   the President's authority to act had expired.          As such,

23   that statement is nothing more than subsequent

24   legislative history that cannot be determinative in

25   deciding whether the President acted validly in 2003.


                                       7

 1   That determination should be judged according to the

 2   statute that was in front of the President when he

 3   acted.

 4                 But if there's any question at all in the

 5   Court's mind about the application of that provision,

 6   the President waived it.          He waived its application as

 7   to Iraq.   It is important to remember that the President

 8   would not sign the version of the NDAA that just had

 9   that provision in it.       He vetoed the bill.             He vetoed it

10   only because of its effect that it might have on Iraq,

11   and he would not sign a replacement until he was given

12   the authority to waive any and all of the provisions of

13   section 1083 to the extent they may affect Iraq.                  So if

14   that --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Including -- including

16   the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7).                  So that would

17   be revived?

18                 MR. FRANKLIN:         Well, we don't agree with

19   that, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the

20   waiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive

21   application of extant provisions of law to the extent

22   they might affect Iraq.         The President wasn't given the

23   additional power to reenact statutes, to put a repealed

24   statute back on the book.           The waiver was just like the

25   EWSAA waiver, where the President was authorized to


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   waiver with respect to Iraq existing privileges --

 2   existing provisions of law.              But again, to the extent

 3   there is any question about that, Title 1, U.S.C.

 4   section 108 answers that conclusively.                      That section

 5   provides that even if Congress itself had repealed

 6   section 1083 in its entirety, that would not bring

 7   section 1605(a)(7), which had been repealed by that

 8   section.    And that is the plain language of 1 U.S.C.

 9   108.   Obviously the President by exercising a blanket

10   waiver authority can't have a better or more effective

11   ability to bring back into existence expired statutes

12   than Congress itself could have done.

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Because technically it's

14   just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment.                      I

15   suppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival,

16   but the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?

17                MR. FRANKLIN:          Well, we are talking here

18   about a waiver applied to a repeal.                      I think the

19   temporal point here is that the repeal happened

20   effective upon the President's signature of the NDAA, on

21   January 20, 2008.    That was already done.                    The repeal

22   happened.    At that point, section 1605(a)(7) no longer

23   existed.    It was not in the U.S. Code.

24                The President was authorized then

25   subsequently to waive existing provisions of law.                      And


                                         9

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   here I think that this -- to allow the President to

 2   re-enact statutes according to a waiver authority is

 3   contrary I think to 1 U.S.C. section 108, but also

 4   common sense as well.      He was -- he was allowed to --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:             I agree.

 6              MR. FRANKLIN:           Okay.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do we have any other

 8   instance in which a jurisdictional provision is

 9   withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress

10   having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?

11              MR. FRANKLIN:           Well, I think the closest

12   analogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the

13   precise circumstances we have here, and that is the

14   doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity.                 Prior to the

15   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, determinations

16   upon foreign sovereign immunity were made by the

17   executive, and they had the effect, as the Court stated

18   in the Republic of Mexico case and the Ex parte Peru, of

19   requiring the courts to, quote, "surrender their

20   jurisdiction," even if it had previously attached.

21              So here we have the precise situation that

22   had always happened.      It had always been this way prior

23   to the FSIA.   The President had always been able to make

24   determinations on foreign sovereign immunity that would

25   have the immediate effect of divesting the courts of


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   their ability to hear cases.           Now, there were of course

 2   jurisdictional provisions at the time that conferred

 3   jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, and the Court had

 4   no trouble -- and this was 150 years of practice, dating

 5   from Chief Justice Marshall's first recognition of

 6   sovereign immunity up until the Foreign Sovereign

 7   Immunities Act.

 8              So this is actually not any different really

 9   than what had occurred before.             We have also cited

10   numerous or several examples of jurisdictional statute

11   that do depend on executive determination.               So there's

12   really nothing particularly unusual about that as well.

13              I would like to turn at this point, if I

14   might, just briefly to our alternative argument in case

15   the Court might find it relevant.               This is an

16   alternative argument.     It's not one that the Court needs

17   to reach, but it is certainly another basis for reaching

18   the same result in this case.            And that is the simple

19   fact in 2008 section 1605(a)(7), regardless of what the

20   President had done previously to it, was repealed.               And

21   it was not just repealed, but it was repealed with a

22   simultaneous bestowal of a replacement jurisdictional

23   provision that encompassed every single pending claim

24   that was then pending at the time.

25              So this is the classic example of a


                                      11
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   jurisdictional repeal that applies to all cases.

 2   Congress didn't just repeal a statute, but it gave

 3   another provision that encompassed every pending claim

 4   and allowed every single pending plaintiff to be able to

 5   refile their cases.

 6                Now, to be sure, the plaintiffs against Iraq

 7   were not able to exercise their ability under the new

 8   statute -- that is 28 U.S.C. section 1605(A) -- but the

 9   only reason they were not allowed to do that was the

10   President's waiver, and the President's waiver was

11   expressly made applicable both to pending cases and to

12   preexisting claims.

13                So, for both of those reasons the

14   alternative ground is also one that warrants reversal.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Were there judgments,

16   outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments

17   outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on

18   appeal?

19                MR. FRANKLIN:         There is at least two that I

20   am aware of, two default judgments.                     They are cited in

21   our brief.   And the effective ability of those default

22   judgment creditors, as it were, to execute on those

23   judgments would depend on the application of the new

24   statutes that Congress enacted about judgment execution.

25   Those are not at issue in this case.                    But the answer to


                                       12
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   your question is yes, there were at least two judgments

 2   that I am aware of that were default judgments where

 3   Iraq had not appeared and did not contest the case.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And you're not claiming

 5   that those could be reopened?

 6                MR. FRANKLIN:         We are not claiming in this

 7   -- in this proceeding they could be reopened.                   We're

 8   actually not claiming -- we haven't claimed in any

 9   proceeding that they can be reopened.                   But there is a

10   serious question as to whether or not the plaintiffs

11   would be able to execute in the United States on those

12   judgments.   Also, they are default judgments and so they

13   are subject to all of the usual rules to the extent

14   about reopening default judgments, not on the grounds of

15   this sovereign immunity issue, but on the normal grounds

16   of reopening of default judgments.                 So, to the extent

17   there are such bases, I don't want to give up on those.

18                But we are not -- we are not making -- this

19   argument's immunity argument today applies to these

20   pending cases and the ability of courts to enter

21   judgments, not to existing default judgments, but the

22   execution on those judgments may well be affected by the

23   arguments we are making today.

24                In the final analysis, I think this -- this

 1   exercise of his foreign affairs powers as delegated to

 2   him by Congress.    The Court has traditionally given the

 3   executive a fair amount of leeway and deference in this

 4   field.   In this case I think that's particularly

 5   appropriate, given that these foreign policies are among

 6   the most significant facing the United States today.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I take it your

 8   argument would be no different if this involved some

 9   other area.    It doesn't depend upon the deference under

10   the foreign affairs --

11                 MR. FRANKLIN:         No, it doesn't depend on it,

12   but I do think it's important to recognize that the

13   President was acting in that -- in that field when he

14   made these determinations, and to also recognize that

15   these determinations -- the foreign policy of the United

16   States has not changed.         It is still towards supporting

17   the people of Iraq and it's supporting the ability of

18   the people to rebuild their country and also their new

19   democratic government, and all of those policies would

20   be thwarted or seriously disrupted if the Court were to

21   hold that Iraq's sovereign immunity has been abrogated

22   in these cases.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I also gather that the

24   ability of the President or the United States to seek

25   some compensation from Iraq through diplomatic channels


                                        14

 1   on behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by

 2   this outcome, right?

 3              MR. FRANKLIN:          Absolutely not, Your Honor.

 4   That is the way that these kinds of claims have always

 5   been addressed in the past and these are the way that

 6   these kinds of claims, particularly between friendly

 7   allies, ought to be addressed.             And I would think that

 8   in this instance the Court in its Republic of Peru case

 9   probably said it best and I'm just going to quote from

10   the last page of our brief.           The Court said:       "Our

11   national interest will be better served in such cases if

12   the wrongs to suitors involving our relations with a

13   friendly foreign power are righted through diplomatic

14   negotiations rather than the compulsions of judicial

15   proceedings."

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That is before the

17   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?

18              MR. FRANKLIN:          That is true, but this case

19   involve the doctrine of foreign immunity and it embodies

20   the same concerns of reciprocity that were at issue

21   then.

22              If I might, I would like to reserve the

23   remainder of my time for rebuttal.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

25              Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.

 1          ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

 2                   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 3                           AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 4                    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 5                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Mr. Chief Justice,

 6   and may it please the Court:

 7                EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President

 8   to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision

 9   of law that applies to countries that have sponsored

10   terrorism.   The terrorism exception to the Foreign

11   Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain

12   language of that authority.            But if there were any

13   question about that, certainly the President's exercise

14   of his authority under that statute would be entitled to

15   deference.

16                Even if one were to add the atextual

17   additional limitation that the Acree court majority

18   tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would

19   stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime

20   in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government,

21   still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear

22   his determination that the threat of billions of dollars

23   of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of

24   their assets by attachment constituted an immediate

25   threat to the foreign policy interests of the United


                                       16

 1   States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought we were just

 3   told that because there -- of the limitations on

 4   enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat

 5   to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the

 6   judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.

 7               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     That is because of

 8   the authorities that the President exercised under the

 9   second proviso of 1503.        There are exceptions to the

10   immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment.

11   There is one that specifically applies to countries that

12   have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and

13   that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq

14   pursuant to this same authority.

15               And so, again, it is essential to the

16   government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these

17   judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in

18   fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were

19   plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the

20   very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United

21   States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in

22   order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the

23   immediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein

24   regime.   These critical foreign policy goals would have

25   been frustrated had the President not been able to make


                                       17

 1   our Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our

 2   foreign policy.

 3                And, of course, the Court in Altmann

 4   recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an

 5   expression of our present foreign policy interests.

 6   That has always been the case.              And although Congress

 7   can establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA,

 8   section 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never

 9   been as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy

10   with respect to a country as happened in the spring of

11   2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of

12   sanctions and other provisions of law that had applied

13   to Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of

14   terrorism.   On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted

15   180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the

16   success of the new Iraqi regime.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is -- is all of this -- I

18   won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if

19   the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying,

20   well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's

21   no cause of action.

22                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No, Your Honor.

23   The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for

24   failure to state a claim was because counsel in that

25   particular suit was unable to identify a source of law


                                       18
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   for their claim.   The D.C. Circuit has correctly held

 2   that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of

 3   action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when

 4   pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.

 5               But numerous district court judgments exist

 6   where the courts have upheld the availability of

 7   transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under

 8   the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the

 9   law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to

10   provide a cause of action.          So --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Where the wrong occurred

12   would have been Iraq.

13               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     That's right.   And

14   -- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of

15   law analysis.   As I said, a number of these judgments

16   apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff

17   resided.   The United States has expressed its view that

18   there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a

19   State to project its substantive law to a tort that

20   occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I

21   don't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at

22   least.

23               So plaintiffs have successfully obtained

24   judgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7).                     And there

25   were billions of dollars in claims that were asserted


                                       19
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   against Iraq.   And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were

 2   actively going and trying to seek the actual money that

 3   the United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to

 4   pay immediate costs of the reconstruction.

 5              But this does not mean -- and I think

 6   Justice Scalia's question was critical here.                     It does

 7   not mean that the plaintiffs are left without any

 8   remedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on

 9   the same footing as any other claimant against a foreign

10   state that is not on the very small list of designated

11   state sponsors of terrorism.            Their claims are subject

12   to state-to-state diplomatic resolution.                     And, in fact,

13   there have been discussions -- there are ongoing

14   discussions -- to establish a framework for resolving

15   the claims against the Hussein regime.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Wouldn't any such

17   settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the

18   Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and

19   probably the worst victims of the terror?

20              MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                      Well, Your Honor, I

21   think that -- that that is one consideration.                     The

22   United Nations has established a mechanism for funding

23   many of the victims of the Hussein regime.                     And -- and

24   -- but the United States would have the obligation to

25   represent the interests of the United States citizens


                                       20

 1   that were injured.      But, as -- as Your Honor's question

 2   points out, there are a lot of considerations that go

 3   into the diplomatic or state-to-state resolution of the

 4   claim beyond those that would be available to a court to

 5   consider in just adjudicating the particular plaintiff's

 6   claims.   And that is why these have historically been

 7   reserved for diplomatic resolution.                       So --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, you don't

 9   doubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim

10   that could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity

11   Act?

12               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       No.   No, I don't.

13   And -- and Congress has established as a means to deter

14   further acts of terrorism by states that have been so

15   designated --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And that claim could

17   --

18               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       -- the abrogation

19   of immunity.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Putting aside the

21   waiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that

22   there has been a change in the governing authority in

23   Iraq?

24               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       That's right.   The

25   -- the general rule that Congress established in


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   1605(a)(7) was that the jurisdiction of the courts would

 2   continue for any claim that arose from acts committed

 3   while the state was designated.               But the authority that

 4   the President was given in 1503 was to render those

 5   statutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq.                      And, of

 6   course, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold

 7   that today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and

 8   authority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to

 9   1605(a)(7).    It would be application of that statute.

10                 So the only way that one can give full

11   effect to the plain language of the statute, "make

12   inapplicable," is to say that as soon as the President

13   exercised that authority, 1605(a)(7) became

14   inapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising

15   jurisdiction over Iraq.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You said that there

17   should be deference to what the executive did because of

18   his role in foreign affairs.             But in the Foreign

19   Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew

20   what had been the executive's traditional authority and

21   said:   President, no more; we are going to set rules of

22   how sovereign immunity will operate.

23                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    That is true.    And

24   in 1503, Congress restored to the President in a sense a

25   very small portion of the authority he had previously


                                        22
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   exercised before the FSIA's adoption.                  1605(a)(7) on its

 2   own terms turns on determinations by the executive.

 3   It's a statute that can be turned on and turned off by

 4   designating or de-designating a country.                  It has a

 5   particular temporal consequence, the rule that -- that

 6   the Chief Justice alluded to.

 7              In 1503, the Congress gave the President a

 8   different authority to turn that statute off, the

 9   authority to make it inapplicable only with respect to

10   one country, Iraq, and in the context of the most

11   dramatic transformation of foreign relations that --

12   that could transpire.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

15            ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

16                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

18   it please the Court:

19              The Court will want to have available to it

20   the blue brief for the Petitioners and Joint Appendix

21   Volume 2, which together reproduce the statutes that are

22   relevant to this case.      And I do want to talk about the

23   text of the statutes.

24              And the point that I'm going to make from

25   the text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General


                                      23
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   just correctly described to you what it was that

 2   Congress was trying to accomplish when he said that the

 3   structure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign

 4   Immunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by

 5   a nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and

 6   that designation changes so that you are no longer on

 7   that list, then you still have a cause of action under

 8   the FSIA.   The fact that the country changes its ways

 9   and gets de-designated doesn't change that result.

10               Now, what the Solicitor General says is that

11   Congress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate

12   in this case:   Did Congress when it said that the

13   President may make inapplicable various statutes which

14   they say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the

15   basic rule about what the effect of a designation and a

16   rescindment of a designation was, or instead was it

17   giving the President a special power to remove the

18   designation?

19               If all it was doing was giving the power to

20   the President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation

21   as a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power

22   rather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) "except

23   for Iraq," if it's just a power about rescindment, then

24   the rule of 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just

25   cited to you, that changing somebody's designation


                                       24

 1   doesn't affect their liability, would apply here.                    So

 2   just put it in terms --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why would -- why would

 4   Congress have wanted to make that distinction?

 5                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Let's -- let me take you to

 6   the reason, and that is in Joint Appendix Volume 2.

 7   Section 620A of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is

 8   reproduced at 344.      And this is the way that a

 9   country -- that a statute relating to torture and

10   terrorism is made applicable and made inapplicable under

11   ordinary processes to a nation.

12                 So to explain it to you, right now Syria,

13   Iran, and Sudan, this statute applies to them.                    It is

14   inapplicable to Libya and North Korea.                    And the reason

15   is that Libya and North Korea were originally designated

16   --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's a long section.        Which

18   part of the section --

19                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I am going to take you

20   straight to the text.        I am giving you the overview

21   right now.

22                 So, they were de-designated.                  It works in

23   two parts.    A is the prohibition.                This is how you get

24   designated.    Prohibition.          The United States shall

 6   designated:    "Prohibition.          The United States shall not

 7   provide any assistance under this Act" -- this is our

 8   principal foreign aid statute -- "the Agricultural

 9   Trade, Development, and Assistance Act of 1954, the

10   Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945

11   to any country" -- and here's how you get designated "if

12   the Secretary of State determines that the government of

13   that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of

14   international terrorism."            So we've designated Syria,

15   Iran, Sudan.

16                 Now, that designation can be rescinded and

17   that's usually what happens.              But there are important

18   restrictions on the rescindment that gave rise to the

19   enactment of section 1503, and they are in C, recision.

20   The Congress limited the President's ability to

21   immediately rescind the designation:                      "A determination

22   made by the Secretary of State under subsection A not --

23   may not be rescinded unless" -- and there are two rules.

24   It can happen in one of two ways.                  The first is you get

25   a new government:     "A, there has been a fundamental


                                         26

 1   change in the leadership and policies of the government

 2   concerned."     Or number 2, the old government changes its

 3   ways.     That's 2A:    "The government concerned has not

 4   provided any support for international terrorism during

 5   the preceding 6-month period.

 6                 So here's the dilemma and, Justice Souter,

 7   this is the complete explanation for why Congress gave

 8   the President the power it did in section 1503.

 9   Remember when the EWSAA is enacted there is a whole

10   discussion in the first 30 minutes about the new regime.

11   There was no new regime.             There was a discussion about

12   how the Saddam Hussein regime had been toppled.                     No, it

13   hadn't.

14                 When the EWSAA had been enacted -- was

15   enacted, Baghdad had fallen seven days earlier.                     There

16   was no new Iraqi government.                We would not recognize an

17   Iraqi government until June of 2004.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, there may have

19   not been a new one, but there certainly was not the old

20   one either.

21                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Yes.       But, Mr. Chief

22   Justice, I'm making a very particular point, and that is

23   that the President lacked the power under this statute

24   that I have just cited to you, 620A -- and it is also

25   the statute that is cited in 1503 -- the President


                                           27

 1   lacked the power at that time because there was no new

 2   government and there wasn't a change in policy in the

 3   old government.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But there's nothing better

 5   settled -- well, perhaps that's broad.                    It is very well

 6   settled that the President is the one to determine who

 7   is the lawful and legitimate government that he would

 8   deal with.

 9                MR. GOLDSTEIN:           That's correct.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's all that was

11   happening here.   And it's not just a question of one

12   against the other.      It's a question of what government

13   has survived.

14                MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Exactly right --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And that is under -- and

16   under the law something that has always been committed

17   to the very large discretion of the President.

18                MR. GOLDSTEIN:           I couldn't agree with you

19   more, Justice Kennedy.         And here's the relevant point.

20   In the spring of 2003 when Congress enacted this

21   statute, we had not recognized a new Iraqi government.

22   We did that in June of 2004.              So my point is, and I

23   think this is very clear from the history, Congress

24   enacted section 1503 of the EWSAA because the President

25   was powerless under the existing state of the law to


                                         28

 1   rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state.                    That's

 2   what --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But it was -- the text of

 4   it was not limited to rescinding that designation.                     I

 5   mean, that's the problem, it seems to me.

 6                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Okay.        Well, let's go to the

 7   text, if we could.      And that is in the blue brief.                 It's

 8   in the appendix to the blue brief.                   And it's at 4A.    And

 9   it's the second proviso, of course, and it appears seven

10   lines down.

11                 "Provided further, that the President may

12   make inapplicable" -- that's the language that we are

13   going to focus on, Justice Souter -- "make inapplicable

14   with respect to Iraq" -- and then it identifies the

15   statute -- "section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act

16   of 1961 or any provision of law that applies to

17   countries that have supported terrorism."

18                 Now, we are putting aside the debate of

19   whether section 1605(a)(7) is such a law.                  We are

20   assuming it is and you say it, Justice Souter, but he is

21   given the power to make inapplicable section 1605(a)(7).

22   He isn't just given the power to rescind the

23   designation.

24                 And the question just -- the term "make

25   inapplicable" doesn't appear in this context anywhere


                                         29

 1   else in the U.S. Code.       We have to figure out what it

 2   means.   And the way that laws that apply to countries

 3   that have supported terrorism apply or are rendered

 4   inapplicable, there is a method in the U.S. Code for how

 5   they are made applicable and inapplicable.

 6               So, to return to my examples.                  If you were

 7   to ask the United States or Mr. Franklin -- so this

 8   statutory scheme of laws -- sanctions that apply to

 9   nations that support terrorism applies to Syria, to

10   Iran, it applies to Sudan.          It is inapplicable to Libya,

11   North Korea, Guinea-Bissau, Britain, France.                  How is it

12   that they apply to some and not others?                  It's through

13   designation.   That's the process for taking something

14   that applies and make it inapplicable.                  And I can give

15   you a lot of other --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But this statute

17   specifically short-circuits that process.                  It says the

18   President may at once make inapplicable.                  The very

19   purpose of it is that the normal process is going to

20   take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an

21   emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.

22               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes, the de-designation

23   becomes effective immediately.              What -- the distinction

24   that I am drawing is that there is a strong version of

25   the words "make inapplicable," and there is a more


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   modest version of the words "make inapplicable."

 2               Iraq and the United States say that when he

 3   made it inapplicable he in effect essentially wrote it

 4   out of the U.S. Code or wrote in the exception that says

 5   "except for Iraq."      We say that "make inapplicable" in

 6   this context is a term of art that deals with

 7   designation and rescindment.              And that process is all

 8   that Congress was trying to do, was to allow the

 9   President to immediately --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:              All right.       Let's -- let's

11   assume --

12               MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Yes.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:              -- for the sake of argument

14   that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and

15   against the point you've just made are evenly balanced.

16   We are on the fence.        Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't

17   we resolve this in favor of the President's position,

18   simply because in the absence of the statutes that we're

19   talking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign

20   Immunities Act, the President would have had under the

21   foreign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop

22   suits like this dead in the water simply by taking the

23   position that that should be the result?                  So that if in

24   doubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently

25   with the traditional foreign policy authority of the

 1   President, in which case we get off the fence and we go

 2   in the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?

 3                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I would say, no, because

 4   that regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes,

 5   has been profoundly changed by the enactment of the

 6   FSIA.   We adopted a different --

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it's been profoundly

 8   changed if we accept your argument.                       I mean, at the

 9   moment the question is whether it has been profoundly

10   changed or not.     We've got a statutory mess.                   And in a

11   case in which the statutes are seemingly subject to --

12   to -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with

13   tradition?

14                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Okay.        Well, I do want to

15   come to whether we are in equipoise in just a second.                        I

16   do think the fact that Congress changed the model so

17   that we don't use, in effect, the Tape Memorandum model.

18                 Second, remember, Justice Souter, that this

19   isn't a return to that model.               What used to happen

20   before the FSIA is the President would come into court

21   and say I think that this nation has immunity and the

22   court would decide on the basis of that case by case.

23   But it was the President making the determination, case

24   by case.     This is something unknown.                   This is very

25   different, if I could just explain how on their --


                                         32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yes, but the President,

 2   quite apart from the immunity designation, the President

 3   had the authority to compromise suits.

 4              MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Well, fine, and if that is

 5   espousal power continues to exist, then the President

 6   can attempt to exercise it.

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:             I don't know whether it

 8   continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument,

 9   and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of

10   this argument.   I'm simply saying that if it is

11   otherwise unclear, given that that power was

12   traditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not

13   construe the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to

14   that point, in the President's favor rather than your

15   favor?

16              MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Okay.        So the -- two

17   reasons, the first is this is not an attempt at

18   espousal, unlike Dames & Moore and cases like that.

19   Remember the President hasn't set up some sort of

20   mechanism for resolving these claims.                   He is simply

21   saying that they are --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, he hasn't set it up

23   because he thinks he has got the authority under this

24   statute or had the authority under this statute.

25              MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Justice Souter, it wouldn't


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   work like that.     If the President were engaging in an

 2   act of espousal then he would have set up some mechanism

 3   for resolving the claims.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Oh, I -- I quite agree with

 5   that.

 6              MR. GOLDSTEIN:             So can I --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:               So I suppose the first step

 8   in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on

 9   now.

10              MR. GOLDSTEIN:             Well, the President

11   purported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six

12   years ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I

13   think he would have.

14              But can I just then just come to the premise

15   of whether we are --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But why -- why shouldn't

17   we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities

18   Act said Congress is setting the rules.                   But why doesn't

19   this emergency measure effectively restore to the

20   President under these special circumstances the power

21   that he once had?     Congress ceding back to the

22   President back to the President for the purposes of

23   dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control

24   authority he once had?

25              MR. GOLDSTEIN:             Okay.        So let's -- if I


                                         34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   could accept the premise that -- and not try to combat

 2   the premise of what we would do in the case of

 3   equipoise, let me turn to the question of what statute

 4   really means and why we shouldn't be in equipoise.                 The

 5   Court generally has not assumed that emergency

 6   appropriations measures issues, particular their

 7   provisos, changed the jurisdiction of the Federal

 8   courts, much less give the President the power to change

 9   the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.                 And it has in

10   related context taken language like "any provision" and

11   said well, we are looking for a clear statement of law

12   by Congress to make sure it has confronted this

13   situation.

14                When it attempts to -- when the argument on

15   the other side is that the Congress has passed a law

16   that shifts the balance of power between Congress and

17   the legislature and the executive in cases like

18   Atascadero, in cases like Raygor, Will, these are all

19   cases that had said statutes that said "any," and the

20   Court said well, because this a -- a relatively strange

21   thing to provide in the proviso to an appropriations

22   measure, for example, we would ask that there be a clear

23   statement.   So that would be one reason that we are not

24   in equipoise.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:         But as a practical matter,


                                       35
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   isn't this closely associated with appropriations and

 2   with foreign aid?     The issue is billions of dollars were

 3   going to be needed to reconstruct Iraq in -- in the wake

 4   of the war and the money could be provided directly by

 5   the United States through foreign assistance, which is

 6   part of the thrust of -- of this provision, certainly.

 7   And the argument is that this is closely related to it,

 8   because it freed up other money that would be used for

 9   reconstruction.     So why is there anything odd about this

10   being in an appropriations provision?

11                MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Because this -- well,

12   because what Congress was doing was confronting an

13   emergency.   There is not a breath, in either the

14   President's transmittal of the statute, the legislative

15   history of the statute, or anything else that says that

16   Congress was dealing with the sort of medium to

17   long-term health of the Iraqi population or the Iraqi

18   government or the Iraqi economy.                 It didn't -- one thing

19   you would have expected if that was Congress's intent is

20   that Congress would have dealt with Iraq's debts, Saddam

21   Hussein's debts, and would you also suspect that this

22   wouldn't sunset, which is the eighth proviso that hasn't

23   been discussed never much.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why -- why does it say then

25   any other provision of law?              You know, Congress could


                                         36

 1   have explained its more narrow purpose in a few words.

 2                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Well --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And I mean, just to add to

 4   that --

 5                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Yes.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           It said under 620A of

 7   Foreign Assistance or any other provision of law.

 8   Clearly they are going beyond, it seems to me, the --

 9   the premise which your argument rests on, the argument

10   that you've just made.

11                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Oh, Justice Souter, I don't

12   think that that -- let me, if I could take the

13   two points in turn.      In cases like Atascadero, Will,

14   Raygor, it's the same language; it's "any."                  And the

15   Court has said we require a plain statement when

16   Congress is going to do something that would change the

17   balance in the relationship between the branches of the

18   government or between the Federal and State governments.

19                 And Justice Souter, we don't deny it goes

20   beyond section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act; it

21   goes to other things that involve aid to the Iraqi

22   government.    What it doesn't do is reach pending --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       Fine.   But there is

24   no textual basis for drawing the line once you get

25   beyond 620A at the point you want to draw it.

 1              MR. GOLDSTEIN:            I actually do disagree and

 2   believe you can logically look at the statute -- in the

 3   sense that the word "any" means "every," that is true.

 4   But if you look at what Congress was trying to

 5   accomplish, it was much more focused on questions of the

 6   immediate economic impact of the need to begin

 7   reconstruction in Iraq right away.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Mr. Goldstein, could I ask

 9   this question?    You are reading into it the exception,

10   of the words "any other provision of law."                And I can

11   understand your argument one of two ways, and I want to

12   be sure which.    Are you saying it means any other

13   provision of the law, except those that affect the

14   jurisdiction of courts?         Or are you saying any other

15   provisions of law that relate to foreign assistance?

16              MR. GOLDSTEIN:            I am saying that except for

17   those that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the

18   kind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal

19   with correctly.

20              The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question in

21   the first 30 minutes is has this Court ever confronted a

22   statute and construed it to remove the jurisdiction of

23   the Federal courts without expressly saying so, is no.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:              Can you -- I would like to

25   follow up on Justice Stevens's question.                 Think of three

 1   categories, A is the category which you could see that

 2   other questions of law apply to.                 B, is this case, and

 3   C, is the other -- other things -- other things that it

 4   might apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd

 5   to apply them to that.         All right, what's in category C?

 6                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          If it's anything, it would

 7   be the export of military hardware.                       In the immediate

 8   wake of the fall of Baghdad, when there is no new

 9   government, right?      There is no replacement regime.                      If

10   you read "any" to mean literally "every" then you could

11   ship munitions, nuclear materials and the like when

12   there is no state there and it's silly to think that

13   Congress intended that.          Its reasons for enacting the

14   statute had to be --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Wait, wait.          After Saddam

16   Hussein falls --

17                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            -- and we have a new

19   government --

20                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          We don't have a new

 1   shipments?   I mean, is that a real problem when there is

 2   nobody over there to pay for them?                  You are worried

 3   about -- about armaments producers shipping -- shipping

 4   goods when there is nobody who has ordered them and is

 5   going to pay for them?        I mean, that's absurd.

 6                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Well, it's not -- it's not

 7   entirely clear there is still a government in Iraq.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right, is there any one

 9   other than that?

10                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          No.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            No.     Okay.

12                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I think -- I think --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            So basically, basically

14   your reading --

15                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- is the word "any other"

17   does apply to any other.

18                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            Except your case.

20                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            And possibly this thing for

22   a couple of days.

23                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that isn't exactly an

25   absurd result then, to say "any other" really means any

 1   other including this case.

 2               MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Well, Justice Breyer, in --

 3   the same point was made in cases like Atascadero and

 4   Raygor.   "Any" means "every" except for the States.          In

 5   that example.

 6               But can I just make quite clear, we have two

 7   lines of argument.      And I think it's important to

 8   recognize that.    We have the debate over what any other

 9   means and does that include section 1605(a)(7).           That's

10   what we have been discussing here, and the idea that any

11   means every, and Congress spoke broadly and so that's

12   what we have.

13               But we have the other incredibly important

14   arguments of what it means to make a sanction

15   inapplicable.    Which is separate and independent of that

16   point, and the question of whether the statutes sunset

17   as the Acree court did.          And I want to return First to

18   those point of what it is to make inapplicable a statute

19   that applies to nations that have supported terrorism.

20   And I want to return to the statutory text and explain

21   why our more modest reading of "make inapplicable" is

22   the right one.

23               So the statutory text again is at 4a.           Here

24   are, I think, the strong statutory indications that we

25   are right, that what Congress was trying to do was to


                                         41
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   allow the President to immediately de-designate Iraq as

 2   a terrorist state.      First, there is a direct parallel

 3   between the language "a statute that applies to

 4   countries that have supported terrorism" and the

 5   directive that the President can make it inapplicable.

 6   That tells you, look at how it is that these statutes

 7   apply in the first place, and the linguistic term of art

 8   is to do the reverse.        Take something that applies and

 9   make it inapplicable.

10                 And something that applies to an -- statutes

11   apply to countries that have supported terrorism under

12   American law only in one way, through designation.               And

13   what happens is that the President was allowed to

14   rescind it.

15                 The second textual reason for our more

16   modest reading of make inapplicable is reference to

17   section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act.               So we know

18   one thing:    even if we debate and disagree, Justice

19   Breyer, about what any means in this context, we know

20   the Congress told the President he could immediately

21   make inapplicable section 620A.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why did -- why did he need

23   the statute to do that?          In other words if the President

24   had the power to designate in the first place, normally

25   that assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.

 1               MR. GOLDSTEIN:           That's exactly right, but

 2   that's the point.    When I took you to the text of 620A,

 3   which was at 344 of the joint appendix volume 2,

 4   Justice Souter, he didn't have the power to do it right

 5   away.   Remember, Baghdad falls; there is no new

 6   government; and the old government hasn't changed its

 7   ways.   So he lacks the power to remove the designation.

 8   And I can prove that to you.             It wasn't until there was

 9   a new government that the President actually did

10   formally rescind the designation pursuant to the Foreign

11   Assistance Act.   It wasn't until 2004.                  After --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But that's -- that's

13   just a belt-and-suspenders act.               I mean, he -- he has

14   the authority here, and he -- although it may look

15   difficult, he has to envision there may be people who

16   challenge that -- his interpretation of the law.                    So

17   there's the other provision that will make it

18   inapplicable under that as well.

19               MR. GOLDSTEIN:           I -- I disagree, but we will

20   accept that.   Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't, hey,

21   look, he himself acknowledged that he needed to exercise

22   his de-designation power.           My point is different, and

23   that is the fact that he didn't do this under the

24   Foreign Assistance Act until 2004 is a strong indication

25   that he couldn't do it before.               If he could have done it


                                        43

 1   before, he would have.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:              And it may also be an

 3   indication that he thought he had effectively

 4   accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this

 5   statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.

 6               MR. GOLDSTEIN:            I -- I don't understand,

 7   Justice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new

 8   government is recognized, suddenly decide to

 9   de-designate Iraq.      There wasn't any -- the only --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:              I -- I don't know, either.

11   I mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an

12   interpretation that is quite possible consistent with

13   the text of this statute, that he thought that by acting

14   under 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do.

15   Why he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know,

16   I'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't

17   know.   But it would be consistent with the assumption

18   that he had the authority here.

19               MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Well, it -- I agree it would

20   be consistent with the assumption that he had the

21   authority here.   That's -- I'm not trying to negative

22   that.   What I'm trying to say is that the authority

23   under 620A -- the fact that he exercised it in 2004 is a

24   strong indication that that's -- it's not the only

25   possible reading, but it's a strong indication that

 1   that's when he thought he got the power.                    The --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But, Mr. Goldstein,

 3   before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what

 4   you think about the claim for relief.                    The D.C. Circuit

 5   said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it

 6   doesn't provide a private right of action; the new

 7   statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq.                    So, what

 8   was the source of the claim -- what is the source of

 9   these plaintiffs' claim for relief?

10                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          The Solicitor General has it

11   right.   Post-Acree, these claims -- these types of

12   claims were pleaded principally as State-law claims, and

13   that has been recognized as providing a substantive

14   cause of action.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which -- which State law?

16                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          The State law generally of

17   the home State of the plaintiffs.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So that -- by that

19   reasoning, people all over the world could sue the

20   United States in their courts alleging that the United

21   States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with

22   respect to their nationals.             The same theory would apply

23   -- use the law of the state where the national comes

24   from.    So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be

25   Yemen -- any place.      So -- but the claim you are saying

 1   exists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the

 2   United States could use it, any other place in the world

 3   could, too.

 4                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Well, that is clear -- well,

 5   in -- in terms of whether or not a foreign country would

 6   look to our law and say, well, we're just doing the same

 7   thing as you do, that would arise from -- also from new

 8   section 1605A.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            No.      Looking to their own

10   law.

11                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Yes, I understand,

12   Justice Ginsburg.    Section -- for example, section

13   1605A, the statute that's created by the 2008 NDAA,

14   creates an affirmative U.S. cause of action.                   There is

15   always going to be an underlying domestic cause of

16   action that underlies the FSIA, whether it's State law

17   or instead it's Federal law.             That is a -- a debate

18   about whether the FSIA is a good statute or not, but

19   it's one that Congress has resolved --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, no.        I mean, it's

21   also a debate as to whether the call on that question

22   should be a Federal one or a State one, whether -- there

23   are all sorts of conditions attached to the -- the suits

24   that are allowed under 620A.             And you are saying that,

25   even without those conditions, any State -- Oklahoma --

 1   can decide Americans can -- can sue foreign countries.

 2               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Well, Justice Scalia, the --

 3   the source of the underlying cause of action is not

 4   presented by this case.        The D.C. Circuit has resolved

 5   that question in our favor.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I know, but we have been

 7   talking about it --

 8               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Sure --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- for a couple of minutes,

10   so we --

11               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Okay.        I'm here to talk

12   about what you want to talk about, and all I'm --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I didn't start this.

14               (Laughter.)

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I did, and you can --

16               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          All right.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You can go back to your

18   jurisdiction argument.

19               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Okay.        Maybe I can finish

20   it.   The -- the -- I had said that I also wanted to

21   continue with the text, on the question of what it is to

22   "make inapplicable."      I pointed out how it is that all

23   of these statutes are applied and made inapplicable.                  I

24   also want to draw the contrast between the two operative

25   powers that are given to the President.                 At the

 1   beginning, the statute says the President may suspend

 2   the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions

 3   Act, which is the kind of power that they are talking

 4   about, essentially to lift the statute; whereas, the

 5   term of art, we think, "make inapplicable" in the

 6   context of these statutes is the narrow power to

 7   de-designate the state as a state sponsor of terror.

 8              But let me just return, if I can --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If I could just

10   pause --

11              MR. GOLDSTEIN:             Yes.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    -- for a moment.

13              The -- the President in exercising this

14   waiver purported to act not only under the statute but

15   under the Constitution as well.                So if we were to accept

16   your argument, we would have to decide whether or not he

17   had the power under the Constitution.

18              MR. GOLDSTEIN:             I don't think the question

19   is presented here.      It could have been an argument that

20   was made, but I don't believe it's presented by this

21   case.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, it's not

23   presented because your friends on the other side think

 1   seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has

 2   the argument that he has this authority under the

 3   Constitution.

 4              MR. GOLDSTEIN:            I agree he has that

 5   argument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case --

 6   in his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the

 7   cert petition, I should say, in the question on this

 8   Court -- on which this Court granted certiorari.

 9              I think to decide the debate, Justice

10   Souter, of whether we're in equipoise here and the

11   debate about whether or not the power was grand or

12   instead more modest, we have to resolve the -- the

13   question of what it is that Congress intended to do in

14   this proviso to this emergency appropriations measure.

15   Was it confronting a very specific moment in time at

16   which Baghdad had just fallen and we needed to get

17   emergency -- emergency aid to Iraq?                      Or was it, instead,

18   fundamentally changing our policy, making Iraq an ally

19   despite the fact that there wasn't even an Iraqi

20   government there?    Was he given -- was Congress giving

21   the power to the President to immunize Iraq permanently

22   from liability under the FSIA, which doesn't even exist

23   with respect to our closest allies, Britain and France?

24   That is a significant over-reading of what --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Why -- why do you say

 1   "permanently"?

 2                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Because --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Just under -- just under

 4   this statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind

 5   the action that made it inapplicable.

 6                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         I don't understand how,

 7   Justice Souter.    The -- the powers of the President

 8   expired.   This statute sunset.              Their whole point is --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well -- no, but during the

10   period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know

11   of any reason why he cannot change his designation of

12   inapplicability.    So that the argument of a permanent

13   change in the foreign policy of the United States or the

14   -- or the powers relating to the foreign policy of the

15   United States doesn't seem to me a legitimate argument.

16                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That's fine while it was in

17   effect, but it's not anymore.              Their point is that they

18   permanently made the FSIA -- the -- section 620A of the

19   Foreign Assistance Act in 2008 and 2009 inapplicable,

20   and that would be incredibly unusual.                    Why would we give

21   that power with respect to Iraq when we don't to our

22   very closest allies?       Remember the statute expired, and

23   they say it's still in effect.               That's their answer to

24   the sunset.    It makes no sense at all.

25                 The only thing that makes sense is to read

 1   it in its context of being a modest attempt to deal with

 2   an immediate problem.       And section 1605(a)(7) says what

 3   happens when you deal with that immediate problem.                  If

 4   you change the designation of a state -- if they become

 5   an ally, if they change their ways -- they are still

 6   liable for the acts of torture they committed while they

 7   were designated.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think -- I think what

 9   they say is that the designation remains in effect.                 I

10   don't think they say that the power to undesignate

11   disappears.

12                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         I don't understand --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'd be -- well, I'll ask

14   them, but I'd be surprised if it's --

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Let me -- let me ask the

16   same question with respect to the new statute, the

17   "capital A" statute.

18                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Yes.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Would there be -- and I

20   just -- I don't know the answer to this.                 Would there be

21   authority under the "capital A" statute to undo the

22   designation?

23                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         No.      That -- that entire

24   provision was waived with respect to Iraq.                And we're --

25   take section 620A --

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       He waived it, but

 2   the question is whether he would have had the authority

 3   to undesignate or -- or to rescind the designation of

 4   inapplicability if he had wished to exercise the

 5   authority under the "capital A" statute.

 6               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I have no -- I'm not aware

 7   of any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given

 8   the President any such power.             They say that on the day

 9   the President exercised his -- his powers that the

10   Foreign Assistance Act, section 620A, became

11   inapplicable to Iraq, that sanction, and that that

12   inapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in

13   2005.   How it would come back -- how it would come back

14   and continue to apply in Iraq in the case of a regime

15   change in Iraq, I have no idea at all.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Congress could pass a

17   law.

18               (Laughter.)

21           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

22                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23               MR. FRANKLIN:          Thank you, Your Honor --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You want to clarify this

 1                 MR. FRANKLIN:          Yes.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- we have just been

 3   discussing?

 4                 MR. FRANKLIN:          It is not the position of the

 5   Government of Iraq that in the very hypothetical

 6   instance in which something would change that they could

 7   not be redesignated.        We believe they could be

 8   redesignated.    We believe that is also the position of

 9   the United States.      When we say "permanent," we mean as

10   opposed to just temporary.            And I might add it is our

11   position that --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought you'd say that.

13                 MR. FRANKLIN:          It is our position that it

14   will be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now

15   a very strong ally of the United States in the fight

16   against terrorism, not a sponsor of it.

17                 Just a few other points based on the

18   argument that just occurred.              They are interpreting the

19   statute apparently now to say that the President only

20   had the power to rescind the -- the previous

21   designations, but that's not what the statute says.                     If

22   that's what Congress had meant, they would have done

23   that.   They said "make inapplicable."                    And their entire

24   case depends on that statute being applicable today

25   because it serves as the abrogation of Iraq's sovereign


                                         53

 1   immunity, and it serves as the predicate for subject

 2   matter jurisdiction.

 3              It cannot be both applicable and having been

 4   made inapplicable.

 5              The other point that was mentioned -- and

 6   also I would also say in this regard that our foreign

 7   policy towards Iraq is different than our foreign policy

 8   towards other former state-sponsored terrorism.                    Libya,

 9   for example, was taken off the list, but there was an

10   express requirement that Libya answer to the claims that

11   were before it.    And, of course, that was because the --

12   the government that sponsored that terrorism, the -- the

13   Khadafi Government, was still in power.

14              Here we had gone into the country with U.S.

15   military force aided by our allies, and we have ousted

16   the regime, and we were seeking to support Iraq in its

17   efforts to rebuild.

18              There was a point about the de-designation

19   that was done in 2004.         The Secretary of State -- and it

20   is cited on page 25 in the blue brief.                    The Secretary of

21   State said in the de-designation that it was largely

22   symbolic or perhaps a belt and suspenders, but he said

23   it was largely symbolic in light of the prior EWSAA

24   determination.    However -- and this is relevant to

25   something else that occurred.               The de-designation was


                                         54

 1   also necessary to allow military exports to Iraq because

 2   under the proviso 3 of the EWSAA, military exports were

 3   specifically exempted from the President's authority.

 4              That also shows that Congress knew how to

 5   make exceptions to the President's power when it wanted

 6   to.

 7              And, finally, I would say that we do agree

 8   with the analysis that Justice Souter has -- has

 9   posited, and that is that this involves a lesser power

10   than the President could have exercised on his own

11   authority to -- to completely espouse the claims.                  It,

12   therefore, fits entirely within what is normally done in

13   these kinds of cases.

14              And, Justice Ginsburg, it is also the

15   position of the Government of Iraq that Iraqi victims

16   ought to be included in any state-to-state diplomatic

17   negotiations.   But that is a matter for the two

18   governments to resolve between themselves, and that is

19   one of the reasons why these kinds of claims have always

20   been resolved in that manner in the past.               They are

21   reciprocal, bilateral concerns that affect two very

22   close allies.   Those governments ought to be negotiating

23   and resolving those claims, whatever claims there are on

24   both sides, between the two of them.
