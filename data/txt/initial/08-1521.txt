 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. GURA:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Although Chicago's ordinances cannot survive

12   the faithful application of due process doctrines, there

13   is an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing

14   the lower court's judgment.          The Constitution's plain

15   text, as understood by the people that ratified it,

16   mandates this result.

17               In 1868, our nation made a promise to the

18   McDonald family; they and their descendants would

19   henceforth be American citizens, and with American

20   citizenship came the guarantee enshrined in our

21   Constitution that no State could make or enforce any law

22   which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of

23   American citizenship.

24               The rights so guaranteed were not trivial.

25   The Civil War was not fought because States were

 1   attacking people on the high seas or blocking access to

 2   the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.                 The rights

 3   secured by the Fourteenth Amendment were understood to

 4   include the fundamental rights honored by any free

 5   government and the personal guarantees of the --

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Of course, this

 7   argument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which

 8   have been the law for 140 years.             It might be simpler,

 9   but it's a big -- it's a heavy burden for you to carry

10   to suggest that we ought to overrule that decision.

11                  MR. GURA:    Your Honor, the Slaughter-House

12   Cases should not have any stare decisis effect before

13   the Court.     The Court has always found that when a case

14   is extremely wrong, when there is a great consensus that

15   it was simply not decided correctly, especially in a

16   constitutional matter, it has less force.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What injustice has --

18   has been caused by it that we have to remedy?                 Meaning

19   States have relied on having no grand juries; States

20   have relied on not having civil trials in certain money

21   cases; they have relied on regulating the use of

22   firearms based on us, the Court, not incorporating the

23   Privileges and Immunities Clause in the way that you

24   identify it.

25                  MR. GURA:    State --

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What -- in which ways

 2   has ordered liberty been badly affected?

 3                  MR. GURA:    Justice Sotomayor, States may

 4   have grown accustomed to violating the rights of

 5   American citizens, but that does not bootstrap those

 6   violations into something that is constitutional.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Are you saying that the

 8   rights -- if you could clarify your conception of

 9   privileges and immunities.            Am I right in thinking that

10   to keep and bear arms would be included even if we had

11   no Second Amendment, as you envision privileges and

12   immunities?

13                  MR. GURA:    Justice Ginsburg, that is

14   correct.     The framers and the public understood the

15   term --

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But -- just tell us the

17   dimensions of what it is.         I mean, we have the eight

18   amendments, so I know you say that's included.             Keep and

19   bear arms would be included even absent the Second

20   Amendment.     What unenumerated rights would we be

21   declaring privileges and immunities under your

22   conception of it?

23                  MR. GURA:    Although it's impossible to give

24   a full list of all the unenumerated rights that might be

25   protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, just


                                       5

 1   as it's impossible to do so under the Due Process

 2   Clause, at least with respect to the Privileges and

 3   Immunities Clause we have wonderful historical

 4   guideposts.     There are --

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Gura, do you think it's

 6   at all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the

 7   Privileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it

 8   under our established law of substantive due process?

 9                  MR. GURA:    It's --

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is it easier to do it under

11   privileges and immunities than it is under substantive

12   due process?

13                  MR. GURA:    It's easier in terms, perhaps,

14   of -- of the text and history, the original public

15   understanding of --

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        No, no.      I'm not talking

17   about whether -- whether the Slaughter-House Cases were

18   right or wrong.     I'm saying, assuming we give, you know,

19   the Privileges and Immunities Clause your definition,

20   does that make it any easier to get the Second Amendment

21   adopted with respect to the States?

22                  MR. GURA:    Justice Scalia, I suppose the

23   answer to that would be no, because --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        And if the answer is no,

25   why are you asking us to overrule 150, 140 years of

 1   prior law, when -- when you can reach your result under

 2   substantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you're

 3   bucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty --

 4               (Laughter.)

 5               MR. GURA:      No.       No.     I have left law school

 6   some time ago, and this is not an attempt to -- to

 7   return.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I mean, what you

 9   argue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure,

10   but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence.

11   Why do you want to undertake that burden instead of just

12   arguing substantive due process?             Which, as much as I

13   think it's wrong, I have -- even I have acquiesced in it.

14               (Laughter.)

15               MR. GURA:      Justice Scalia, we would be

16   extremely happy if the Court reverses the lower court

17   based on the substantive due process theory that we

18   argued in the Seventh Circuit.             And, indeed, had the

19   Seventh Circuit accepted our substantive due process

20   theory, which was our primary theory in the court below,

21   we might not be here, or perhaps we would be here in a

22   different posture.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But that -- that court

24   does not have the prerogative to overturn any of this

25   Court's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much.

 1   So it was kind of a pass-through in the court of

 2   appeals.

 3               But I really would like you to answer the

 4   question that you didn't have an opportunity to finish

 5   answering, and that is:      What other enumerated rights?

 6   What does the privileges and immunities of United States

 7   citizenship embrace?

 8               MR. GURA:     Of the unenumerated rights,

 9   Justice Ginsburg?

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes.

11               MR. GURA:     Well, the framers clearly used

12   language that to them meant rights beyond those

13   guaranteed in the first eight amendments.        And whenever

14   they spoke about those unenumerated rights, they gave

15   some concrete examples.      So I think that there might be

16   two categories of unenumerated rights if a claim were

17   before the court under that provision.

18               If a right is, for example, the sort of

19   right that was mentioned in the Civil Rights Act of

20   1866, the piece of legislation enacted by a

21   supermajority of Congress, where the Congress said, over

22   President Johnson's veto, here are the rights of

23   American citizenship, and they are -- they listed:       To

24   make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give

25   evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and

 1   convey real and personal property.                 That's the sort of

 2   right that would be easy to find because there is a

 3   contemporaneous source for telling us --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Even though -- even

 5   though a large portion of the population at that time

 6   didn't have those rights?

 7               MR. GURA:       The large -- the population at

 8   the time that did not have those rights needed their

 9   protection, primarily in the South, which is why the

10   Civil Rights Act --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No, throughout --

12   throughout the nation at the time.

13               MR. GURA:       I'm sorry.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did married women at that

15   time across the nation have the right to contract, to

16   hold property, to sue and be sued?

17               MR. GURA:       Married women were considered

18   citizens of the United States, just like children were

19   considered citizens.      However, the law did not always

20   protect people fully, and we've made great strides in

21   this country giving a greater level of protection to --

22   to certain rights.     We understand certain rights better

23   today than we did 140 years ago, and the fact that First

24   Amendment rights weren't fully respected, Second

25   Amendment rights weren't always respected, Fourth

 1   Amendment rights were not always understood well --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Does it work just one

 3   way?   I mean, if the notion is that these are principles

 4   that any free society would adopt, well, a lot of free

 5   societies have rejected the right to keep and bear arms.

 6                 MR. GURA:    As we mentioned -- as we

 7   mentioned in our brief, this Court in Benton v. Maryland

 8   decided that henceforth American history and tradition

 9   are important to consider what rights are protected in

10   this country.    It's true that our friends overseas who

11   have more or less civilized, free societies don't

12   respect rights to the same level that we do.                   For

13   example, England, which is a free society, has a

14   monarchy.   They have hereditary lords in parliament.

15   They don't have First Amendment protection.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But this -- then it's not

17   one expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights,

18   or the rights that any free society -- basic to a free

19   society.    So you -- you have to trim your definition.

20   It's not basic to any free society.

21                 MR. GURA:    As understood by the people who

22   ratified the Fourteenth Amendment.                It's not a

23   free-flowing license, necessarily, for judges to

24   announce unenumerated rights.            However, to the extent

25   that we have unenumerated rights which the framers and


                                     10

 1   ratifiers didn't literally understand, they nonetheless

 2   left us guideposts that we can --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, what about rights

 4   rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people?

 5   Would -- would that do the job?

 6                MR. GURA:    Yes.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:        That happens to be the test

 8   we have used under substantive due process.

 9                MR. GURA:    That's correct and, as Judge

10   O'Scannlain --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.

12                MR. GURA:    -- in the Ninth Circuit observed

13   in the Nordyke decision, the Slaughter-House dissenters

14   seemed to arrive at the same point, perhaps, that this

15   Court did in the Glucksberg case.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Gura, can I ask you

17   the same question Justice Ginsburg asked about:            What if

18   there were no Second Amendment?            You say the right would

19   still be protected under the Privileges and Immunities

20   Clause.   What about -- would it also be protected under

21   substantive due process if there were no Second

22   Amendment?

23                MR. GURA:    It would be, Your Honor.         The

24   fact --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Because of the -- the

 1   importance of the right to protection -- and would that

 2   apply to the entire scope of the Second Amendment or just

 3   the right to keep the gun, a homeowner's right to keep a

 4   gun for self-protection against intruders into the home,

 5   under the -- without the Second Amendment, just the

 6   Liberty Clause?

 7               MR. GURA:     The Second Amendment is not so

 8   limited and neither is the right to arms, even outside

 9   the Second --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm assuming we don't have

11   a Second Amendment for purposes of the substantive due

12   process analysis.   I'm asking you what is the scope of

13   the right to own a gun that is protected by the Liberty

14   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?              Is it just the

15   right to have it at -- at home, or is the right to

16   parade around the streets with guns?

17               MR. GURA:     An unenumerated right to arms in

18   the absence of the Second Amendment would be, perhaps --

19   probably identical to that secured by the Second

20   Amendment, because the Second Amendment codified the

21   understanding of that right that people have

22   historically had in the country.           So there would not be

23   a difference between the right to arms if it were a part

24   of the Second Amendment or --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, I thought your --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In -- in that

 2   context, is your position that the rights that are

 3   incorporated as essential to the concept of ordered

 4   liberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them?

 5   When you say the First Amendment is covered, does that

 6   mean New York Times v. Sullivan is incorporated as well?

 7   Or is it only some lesser version of the incorporated

 8   right?

 9               MR. GURA:       With respect to the substantive

10   due process argument that we're making?

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

12               MR. GURA:       We are not challenging -- we are

13   not the party that's before the Court that is

14   challenging anything that has gone on before in terms of

15   substantive due process.        We believe that those cases

16   were by and large decided appropriately, and if the

17   Court wishes to reconsider any of them for some reason,

18   it -- that has really nothing to do --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              No, I understood the Chief

20   Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my

21   understanding of the question as important is this:

22   Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound

23   by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and

24   sophistication with which we interpret them for the

25   Federal Government.     It's the same.             You don't just


                                      13

 1   apply the core of the right.             You apply all of the right

 2   as it is elaborated by the cases.

 3                Is -- is that same consequence -- does that

 4   same consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and

 5   immunities interpretation that you are urging upon us?

 6                MR. GURA:     Yes, Your Honor, because --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:         Okay.        How does that work?

 8   I think that would be useful for either you or

 9   Mr. Clement, if you've thought this through.                Is this

10   right different from others?

11                MR. GURA:     Well --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:         There are two ways.        One is

13   that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the

14   briefs.   Look at the statistics.           You know, one side

15   says a million people killed by guns.               Chicago says that

16   their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including --

17   and they have statistics -- including lots of women in

18   domestic cases.   And the other side disputes it.               This

19   is a highly statistical matter.            Without incorporation,

20   it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided

21   by Federal judges.

22                Now, think of this, too:               That when you have

23   the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments,

24   there's always a big area where it's free speech versus

25   a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus


                                     14

 1   life.     When it's free speech versus life, we very often

 2   decide in favor of life.          Here every case will be on one

 3   side guns, on the other side human life.            Statistics,

 4   balancing life versus guns.            How are Federal judges in

 5   your opinion, rather than legislatures in the States in

 6   a Federal system -- how are Federal judges supposed to

 7   carry this out?     I want to see where we're going.

 8                 MR. GURA:     Federal judges should carry this

 9   out in the same way that was announced in this Court's

10   decision in Heller.       So --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Heller, I didn't think,

12   explained that with great -- I was dissenting,

13   though.    I didn't think it explained it with total

14   clarity, but that's a dissenter's view.

15                  (Laughter.)

16                 MR. GURA:     Heller stood for the proposition

17   that some activities are within the core boundaries of a

18   right, and so long as people wish to do something that

19   is literally understood to be a part of the boundaries of

20   the right, it is to be protected, and --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Let me be specific, suppose

22   Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the

23   hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside

24   the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human

25   lives every year.     And the other side says, we don't


                                       15

 1   think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't

 2   matter.   How do you decide the case?

 3               MR. GURA:     We decide that by looking, not to

 4   which side has the better statistics, but rather to what

 5   the framers said in the Constitution, because that

 6   policy choice was made for us in the Constitution.

 7   They --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:         You're saying they can

 9   have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have

10   guns even if they're saving hundreds of lives -- they

11   can't ban them.

12               MR. GURA:     The City cannot ban guns that are

13   within the common use as protected by the right to arms.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:         There's a lot of

15   statistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule

16   saves lives or not, whether it results in the release of

17   dangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but

18   the confession can't be used.           We don't -- we don't

19   resolve questions like that on the basis of statistics,

20   do we?

21               MR. GURA:     That's correct, Justice Scalia,

22   and as your opinion --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, why would this one be

24   resolved on the basis of statistics?             If there's a

25   constitutional right, we find what the minimum


                                    16

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   constitutional right is, and everything above that is up

 2   to the States.

 3                  MR. GURA:    That --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        If they want to have, you

 5   know -- I think we mentioned in Heller concealed carry

 6   laws.     I mean, those are -- those are matters that we

 7   didn't decide in Heller.        And you may have a great deal

 8   of divergence from State to State.                 And on that, I suppose,

 9   you would do statistics, wouldn't you?                Or the legislature

10   would.

11                  MR. GURA:    Well, Your Honor, we do agree

12   that statistics are not important to determine whether

13   or not a right --

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        For the judges.       For the

15   judges.

16                  MR. GURA:    That's right.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        But they would be for the

18   legislatures.

19                  MR. GURA:    A legislature should respect the

20   fact that there is a constitutional right at issue, and

21   this Court in footnote 27 in Heller explained that under

22   the Carolene Products paradigm, footnote 4, rights

23   enumerated in the Constitution are entitled to a greater

24   measure of respect.

 7                   IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MR. CLEMENT:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               Under this court's existing jurisprudence,

11   the case for incorporating the Second Amendment through

12   the Due Process Clause is remarkably straightforward.

13   The Second Amendment, like the First and the Fourth,

14   protects a fundamental preexisting right that is

15   guaranteed to the people -- -

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Clement, would you

17   comment on Justice Kennedy's question about whether that

18   necessarily incorporates every jot and tittle of the

19   Federal right into the Federal, keeping in mind that

20   with regard to trial by jury in criminal cases, there's

21   a difference.   It's nonunanimous juries.             Why does this

22   incorporation have to be every bit as broad as the

23   Second Amendment itself?

24               MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Stevens, I think

25   in that respect the Sixth Amendment is a bit of an


                                    18

 1   outlier.     For most of the provisions and as far as I

 2   know all of the substantive provisions of the Bill of

 3   Rights that have been incorporated against the States,

 4   this Court has incorporated basically all the

 5   jurisprudence that comes with that.

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, what is the last

 7   case in which we incorporated a substantive provision?

 8                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, I guess maybe it's Mapp,

 9   is one way of thinking about it.              I mean --

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mapp was a procedural

11   case.

12                 MR. CLEMENT: -- I could quibble about that --

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mapp was a Fourth Amendment

14   case.   I'm asking you cases involving incorporation of

15   substantive rights, as opposed to procedural rights.

16                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            The procedural cases come

18   in under the due process language, but the substantive

19   cases comes under the word "liberty," and "liberty"

20   picks up the First Amendment and so forth.                And I take

21   it it's the word "liberty" that picks up the Second

22   Amendment.    And if it does, why does it have to be

23   precisely the same scope as the Second Amendment?

24                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, sure.        We could quibble

25   whether -- I think of the Fourth Amendment as more of a


                                      19

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   substantive guarantee.      But in any event, with respect

 2   to certainly like the First Amendment guarantees that

 3   this Court has incorporated through the liberty -- the

 4   liberty subclause, if you will, of the Due Process

 5   Clause, there too I think this Court -- certainly I

 6   understand this Court's jurisprudence as incorporating

 7   all of the cases that go along with that.

 8                So New York Times v. Sullivan is the law of

 9   all 50 States, et cetera, et cetera.             And I think that

10   in a sense the virtue of that approach is probably even

11   more apparent with the Second Amendment than it might be

12   with some other jurisprudence --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:        I guess we -- I guess we

14   have applied substantive due process with regard to the

15   necessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with

16   respect to the necessity of permitting abortion on

17   demand.   We have not adopted a more rigid rule for the

18   Federal Government than we have adopted for the States

19   in either of those instances, have we?

20                MR. CLEMENT:     That's also right, Your Honor,

21   though I guess I would stress that I think that,

22   whatever the debate's about substantive due process when

23   it comes to unenumerated rights, I think the gist of

24   this Court's incorporation doctrine is that the textual

25   provisions of the Bill of Rights stand in a favored


                                    20

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   position with respect to incorporation.           And so Glucksberg

 2   has its discussion about the standard for unenumerated

 3   rights, but it starts that off by saying of course the

 4   Bill of Rights are different.           And, of course, the Bill

 5   of Rights, I think, as I read this Court's selective --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:           They stand in a favored

 7   position, but we've never said had to be literally

 8   all the way down the line, or we couldn't have done

 9   the criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case.

10               MR. CLEMENT:     Again, though, it's

11   interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where

12   the Court has not effectively translated all the case law

13   is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment

14   criminal jury right.   And I think with respect to the

15   substantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or

16   the similarity between the First and the Second

17   Amendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court

18   has incorporated essentially not just the amendment and

19   not just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as

20   well.

21               And, you know, I would -- just to dwell for

22   a moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second

23   Amendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if

24   this Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or

25   Immunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case


                                   21

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   actually stands as very good precedent for incorporating

 2   the Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this

 3   Court relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition

 4   rights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case.              And

 5   the reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that

 6   Cruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't

 7   privileges of national citizenship is because they were

 8   preexisting rights that didn't depend on the

 9   Constitution for their existence.

10                  That seems to me to be a pretty good working

11   definition of what a fundamental right is, one that is

12   so fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very

13   Constitution.     And so it's not surprising that De Jonge

14   cited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for

15   incorporation.

16                  I think the exact same logic would apply to

17   the Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the

18   consequence of that, certainly the most logical

19   consequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence

20   under the Second Amendment.           Now, right now, that's not

21   carrying over a lot, right?           That's carrying over the

22   Heller case.

23                  But I think in a way that points up to the

24   fact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that,

25   because the Miller decision of this Court sowed


                                      22

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   confusion, we don't have substantial Second Amendment

 2   jurisprudence.    And I would think that it's going to be

 3   difficult enough to develop the Second Amendment

 4   jurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more

 5   difficult by having to develop a Federal Second

 6   Amendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow

 7   version of that jurisprudence for the States.

 8                 And I think in the more recent incorporation

 9   cases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going

10   to adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal

11   guarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal

12   guarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating

13   not just the right but the jurisprudence that came with

14   that right.

15                 And so I do think that's in a sense

16   something that counts in favor of incorporating the

17   Second Amendment and doing so through the Due Process

18   Clause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other

19   substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights.       And I

20   think if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really

21   is very straightforward.       In fact, I think if you

22   compare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to

23   the Second Amendment, they have the same textual

24   guarantee to the people, they trace their origins to

25   preexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights,

 1   back to even earlier constitutional history.

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's true of the

 3   criminal jury trial right, too, all of those things?

 4   And yet we don't -- it's not exactly the same.               I just

 5   don't see why it has to be exactly the same.            I can

 6   understand your argument that it should be substantially

 7   the same, but I don't see that there's anything in the

 8   text of the Fourteenth Amendment that would justify

 9   saying it must be precisely the same, or of any of our

10   cases.

11               MR. CLEMENT:      Well -- and, again, Justice

12   Stevens, you know, since I think that -- that the

13   incorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation

14   jurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text

15   of the Due Process Clause --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Incorporation

17   jurisprudence is -- we haven't had an incorporation case

18   for 30 years or more.

19               MR. CLEMENT:      That's right.        That's right,

20   Justice Stevens.   But I guess I would say is that,

21   putting the Sixth Amendment to one side, which I think

22   is a bit of an outlier in the jurisprudence here, I

23   think the trend of all of this Court's incorporation

24   jurisprudence has been more towards complete

25   incorporation of the right and the jurisprudence.              So --


                                    24

 1   I mean, Mapp is a perfect illustration.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               That still allows

 3   scope, once you determine that the right is

 4   incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have

 5   broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't

 6   have.   But I would suppose that would come up in the

 7   application of the right, rather than in an effort to

 8   determine whether parts of it are incorporated or not.

 9                 MR. CLEMENT:      That's right,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be

11   said for any other one of the other incorporated

12   amendments.     So I think the same thing might be true in

13   the First Amendment.      There are certainly going to be

14   situations that the Federal government confronts that

15   the State governments won't confront the exact analogue

16   situation and vice versa.

17                 Now, you know, there may be unique issues

18   about national parks that the States aren't going to

19   have to confront, and the jurisprudence can take that

20   into account.    But I think that's far different from

21   saying that we really are going to have this shadow

22   jurisprudence for one of the provisions.

23                 And I think, again, to go back to Mapp just

24   as an illustration, when this Court first incorporated

25   the Fourth Amendment and said, well, we'll talk about

 1   the exclusionary rule later; maybe we won't incorporate

 2   the Fourth -- the exclusionary rule.             We'll just

 3   incorporate the Fourth Amendment's basic guarantee.            And

 4   the trend of later cases was to say, no, kind of in for

 5   a penny, in for a pound --

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           You're -- you're dead right --

 7                MR. CLEMENT:     -- let's bring the

 8   jurisprudence with --

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- about the majority of

10   the Court, but it's interesting that during this whole

11   period, Justice Harlan staked out a separate position on

12   whether it should be just the substance of the right or

13   the -- every detail.    And we have followed Justice Harlan,

14   rather than the majority in a number of cases in -- in

15   the recent years.

16                MR. CLEMENT:     Well --

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:           He is very much against you,

18    and he's a very important member of our -- of our history.

19                MR. CLEMENT:     Justice Harlan was a terrific

20   justice.   Justice Black was a terrific justice in --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:       Maybe we should go back --

23   incorporation --

25   shouldn't we go back completely to Justice Harlan's view

 1   about the way in which the Bill of Rights applies to the

 2   States?

 3                MR. CLEMENT:     Well, I think if we are going

 4   to go back, maybe we should go back to the first Justice

 5   Harlan, who actually had an -- an approach, I think,

 6   that would be much more similar to the approach --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:        But there is a difference.

 8                MR. CLEMENT:     -- that we take in this case

 9   and that Mr. Gura takes in this case.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:        There is a difference here

11   with the other amendments.        There is a difference, and the

12   other amendments -- you have the First Amendment's,

13   the First Amendment expression.

14                Here we have right in the amendment written

15   a militia-related clause.       And the way that -- the

16   way -- the way that the right might be incorporated in

17   respect to that is light years different from the way

18   it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the

19   right to have a gun to shoot a burglar.          They're just

20   two separate things.

21                And as to the first, it's pretty hard for me

22   to see why you'd incorporate it, for reasons I won't

23   go into.   As to the second, I understand it.         So we're

24   starting with a difference in purposes at the least.

25   And shouldn't that make a difference in how you

 1   incorporate?

 2                MR. CLEMENT:      Well, I mean, I guess what

 3   I -- what I don't understand is why, given the way that

 4   this Court wrestled in the Heller decision with how to

 5   basically apply the operative clause in light of the

 6   prefatory clause, why one would want to come to a

 7   different conclusion --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:         Because the -- one of the

 9   reasons --

10                MR. CLEMENT:      -- with respect to the States.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:         -- at least, is that --

12   you've read, I'm sure, that all the law professors

13   at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, London, et cetera, that say

14   even Blackstone in the 17th century thought that this is

15   primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament

16   to -- well, I can't go on here.           I'm just saying think

17   of that brief, and you'll see the differences, even

18   accepting Heller.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You can respond if

20   you want, briefly.

21                MR. CLEMENT:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22                I mean, obviously this Court was focused

23   very much on Blackstone's writings in the Heller

24   decision, and I think the majority read Blackstone

25   actually as being primarily concerned with the


                                     28

 1   self-defense right, which goes a long way to understand

 2   why the Heller decision came out the way that it came

 3   out.

 4                  And I would simply finish by noting that the

 5   one thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about

 6   Blackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on

 7   the right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right

 8   that should apply to the States.

12                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

13                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14               MR. FELDMAN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the Court:

16                  The Second Amendment should not be

17   incorporated and applied to the States because the right

18   it protects is not implicit in the concept of ordered

19   liberty.   States and local governments have been the

20   primary locus of firearms regulation in this country for

21   the last 220 years.

22                  Firearms, unlike anything else that is the

23   subject of a provision of the Bill of Rights, are

24   designed to injure and kill.              And the very same features

25   that make firearms valuable for self-defense as the

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        When is the last time an

 3   opinion of ours made that the test, implicit in the

 4   concept of ordered liberty?         It sounds very nice.       But

 5   when is the last time we used it?            I think it was 1937.

 6                MR. FELDMAN:     I don't believe it was, Your

 7   Honor.   The --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Has it been the basis of

 9   our decision in any case since Palko?

10                MR. FELDMAN:     I think the -- the Court

11   has -- the Court has used the term in a number of cases.

12   Since then, it has used it in -- not in corporation cases

13   as recently as the Glucksberg case.              It used it in Mapp.

14   It has used it in other cases, but I think --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And it was also the Harlan

16   view, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case

17   and in Poe v. Ullman.

18                Do you think that it best describes the

19   approach that the Court has used over the years?

20                MR. FELDMAN:     Yes, I do.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I was going to ask

22   Mr. Clement what test he thought the Court used.              If

23   you looked at all the cases, you think implicit in

24   the concept of ordered liberty?

 1   reason why.     In 1833, this Court has held in Barron v.

 2   Baltimore, in a -- in a ruling that Chief Justice

 3   Marshall said was not a difficult one, although

 4   important, that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the

 5   States.

 6                  As far as I know, no justice has ever

 7   disagreed with that -- with that ruling or suggested he

 8   was wrong in so ruling.        From -- it was -- the only

 9   reason -- and when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed

10   and ratified in the late 1860s, again, the -- the

11   framers did not directly apply the Bill of Rights to the

12   States.   They gave us some generalities.

13                  And the Court has always understood that

14   when it's applying the Due Process Clause, what it asks

15   is not just is something in the Constitution, but is

16   this something that's so fundamental it's a necessary

17   condition --

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is the right to trial by

19   jury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?

20                  MR. FELDMAN:     I --

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        My goodness --

22                  MR. FELDMAN:     I think that it --

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- there are a lot of

24   countries that don't give the right to trial by jury,

25   even England does not give it in all criminal cases.

 1                MR. FELDMAN:       I think it is in the following

 2   sense:   When you're talking about a procedural right

 3   that's embedded in a particular procedural system, you

 4   have to look at how that system operates and how the --

 5   the right works within that particular system.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I think that's

 7   exactly -- that's exactly right.             And that is what the

 8   Court elaborated on in Duncan.            I do think the focus is

 9   our system of ordered liberty, not any abstract system

10   of ordered liberty.     You can say Japan is a free

11   country, but it doesn't have the right to trial by -- by

12   jury.

13                The -- the concept only makes sense,

14   I think, if you limit it to our system.                 Under our

15   system, as you said, the -- the right to a jury is

16   essential.

17                MR. FELDMAN:       I -- I agree -- I -- I

18   think that's right.     I was just distinguishing

19   between --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, if you think

21   that's right, why wouldn't you think, for all the

22   reasons given in Heller, that the Second Amendment right

23   is essential to our system, whatever it may be with

24   respect to France or England or anywhere else?

25                MR. FELDMAN:       The question that the Court

 1   was addressing in Heller was not -- again, was not how

 2   important the Second Amendment right was, or how

 3   implicit it is in our system; it was what did it say and

 4   what did the -- what restrictions did the framers of the

 5   Second Amendment impose on the Federal Government.

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I thought its

 7   rationale was that because of its fundamental character,

 8   the right to bear arms must be understood as separate

 9   from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all

10   people, most people in the United States.                 The public

11   meaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an

12   individual right to bear arms, and that's because it was

13   fundamental.     If it's not fundamental, then Heller is

14   wrong, it seems to me.

15                  MR. FELDMAN:     No, I -- I -- I don't think

16   that that's right.     The question is what right -- what

17   did they impose upon the -- as restrictions upon the

18   government when the Second Amendment was ratified.                 And

19   as to that, it's not a question of whether it's

20   fundamental any more than with the Grand Jury Clause or

21   with the civil jury trial right --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I don't see how you

23   can read --

24                  MR. FELDMAN:     -- under the Seventh Amendment.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I don't see how you can

 1   read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the

 2   Second Amendment, whether you'd want to label it

 3   fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers

 4   in their view of what liberty meant.

 5               MR. FELDMAN:       I -- it was important, but

 6   actually what Heller says is this:                The Second Amendment

 7   preexisted the -- its inclusion -- or the right that's

 8   in the Second Amendment preexisted its inclusion in the

 9   Bill of Rights.   But the reason it was codified, the

10   reason it -- the reason it was put into the Bill of Rights

11   was because the framers were concerned about the Federal

12   Government disarming the militia.

13               The right of self-defense, which had been

14   previously recognized and highly valued, I would agree,

15   was -- had -- according to Heller, quote, "had little to

16   do with its codification" --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That may be --

18               MR. FELDMAN:       -- with its inclusion in the

19   Constitution.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That may be the reason it

21   was put there.    But it was put there.

22               MR. FELDMAN:       That's --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:          And that's the crucial fact.

24   It is either there or it is not there.

25               And if it's there, it doesn't seem to me to

 1   make any difference why they chose to put that one there

 2   as opposed to other ones that they didn't put there.

 3   It's either there or not.

 4                MR. FELDMAN:      That -- I agree as far as the

 5   Federal Government goes.       But now there's a different

 6   question being asked, and the Second Amendment in this

 7   respect is unlike any of the other amendments that have

 8   been incorporated.

 9                The same -- very same reason why the

10   First -- the various rights in the First Amendment were

11   put there in 1791 is exactly the reason why it was

12   held -- why it was incorporated and applied to the

13   States under the Fourteenth amendment.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:         So do we read the -- the

15   clause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we're

16   supposed to read the words of the Constitution, aren't we?

17   I guess --

18                MR. FELDMAN:      Yes.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:         -- the answer to that's yes.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:        And does that not give us a

 3   clue as to what they thought that --

 4                  MR. FELDMAN:     That's what --

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:        -- the ordered liberty

 6   was?   That's your point?

 7                  MR. FELDMAN:     That's what -- and that's what

 8   Heller said.     And here's the difference -- is, it is it

 9   is now urged that this right is fundamental because of

10   its importance, the importance of firearms in

11   self-defense.     That was true also in 1791, but it

12   wouldn't have been in the Constitution for that.                 That

13   had little to do with putting it in the Constitution.

14   This is a right that has always been subject to the

15   political process and --

16                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, sure, and it's

17   still going to be subject to the political process if

18   the Court determines that it's incorporated in the Due

19   Process Clause.     All the arguments you make against

20   incorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should

21   make in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment.

22   We haven't said anything about what the content of the

23   Second Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.

24                  MR. FELDMAN:     That's -- that's --

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And so the argument

 1   you make is, well, given this context, you should not be

 2   able to have concealed carry.            Well, maybe that's

 3   right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the

 4   Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of

 5   regulation.

 6                 MR. FELDMAN:     No, I don't think so.      I think

 7   -- the argument that I'm making is that States and local

 8   governments under the political process, which as far as

 9   we know, if the only issue had been self-defense, the

10   framers would have been satisfied to leave this to the

11   States and to leave this to the political process, and not

12   to put it in the Constitution -- that -- that -- that as

13   far as the right to self-defense goes, that's something

14   that has always been effectively regulated through the

15   political process and especially at the State and local

16   level.   And through our history, as technology has

17   changed, State and local regulation has altered to draw

18   the balance that has to be drawn.

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:       And your position is that a

20   -- a State or local government could completely ban all

21   firearms?

22                 MR. FELDMAN:     If the State and local

23   government did that, I think would it raise two

24   questions.    One question would be, there is always

25   review under the Due Process Clause and under the Equal


                                     37

 1   Protection Clause for provisions that are arbitrary.

 2   And I'd want to know why a State had done that.              It's

 3   certainly relevant that in the last 220 years, no

 4   State has done that or even come close, and, in fact, as

 5   the briefs on the other side of the case from some of

 6   the States show, they are quite in the opposite direction.

 7                But the second point would be --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I -- I don't understand.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What is the due process

10   liberty --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         What basis would there be

12   to -- to deny that?

13                 MR. FELDMAN:      Well, there's always --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Firearms kill people is

15   what the States say, and -- and we ban it.

16                 MR. FELDMAN:      Right, and that has --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Other countries have done

18   that.

19                 MR. FELDMAN:      It has not led to States doing

20   it in -- in this country.         The second question --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         But if they did do it, I

22   think you'd have to say it's perfectly okay.

23                MR. FELDMAN:       No, the second -- there would

24   be two questions actually.          One would be was this arbitrary,

25   or is that actually based on a reason that's --

 1   a sound reason?

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.     The reason is guns are

 3   dangerous.

 4                MR. FELDMAN:     The second argument would be,

 5   the Court at that point, if in the very unlikely event a

 6   that a State or local government tried to do that, then

 7   the Court might have to wrestle at that point with the

 8   question of the relationship between self-defense and

 9   the right to keep and bear arms.            In other words, this

10   Court has never said --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But would self-defense be

12   part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of

13   the Due Process Clause?

14                MR. FELDMAN:     I mean, if by that is, do you

15   have a substantive right to self-defense, the Court

16   actually has never answered that question, but I'm

17   willing to accept that there is such a right for --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And you've given -- you

19   said there were two reasons.            So you have given us both

20   in your answer to Justice Alito's question?

21                MR. FELDMAN:     Yes, and -- and what I'd say

22   about the right to self-defense is, if -- if the

23   challenge -- if a State or local government banned all

24   firearms it might raise the question of, given that

25   there -- if there is a constitutional right to


                                    39

 1   self-defense, has the State prohibited you from

 2   reasonable means of exercising that right?                 But that --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Without repeating that and

 4   just so I understand your position, how could some

 5   member of the Court write the -- this opinion to say

 6   that this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was

 7   correct?

 8                  MR. FELDMAN:     I -- the Court would just say

 9   that what Heller held was if you look at the meanings

10   that the words in the Second Amendment had, the common

11   meaning -- as the Court said in the Heller opinion --

12   the common meanings that the word had in 1791, it

13   imposed limitation on the state.             It took a preexisting

14   right that had not been -- it was not codified in the

15   Constitution, and it said, this self-defense right we

16   need in the Constitution in order -- in order to protect

17   the militia against being disarmed by the Federal

18   Government.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That sounds an awful

20   lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the

21   losing side.

22                  MR. FELDMAN:     Well, it's actually what the

23   Court said in its opinion.          What the Court said in its

24   opinion is the reason it was codified was the concern

25   that the framers had with the -- that the Federal


                                      40

 1   Government might disarm the militia.               Not self-defense.

 2   Self-defense according to the Court in Heller, quote,

 3   "had little to do with the codification of the right."

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:         They said that is the

 5   reason it was codified.      They did not say that that is

 6   the function of what was codified.               The function of what

 7   was codified was to enforce the traditional right of the

 8   people to bear arms.

 9               MR. FELDMAN:      And that -- that --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:         And to say that that wasn't

11   the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about

12   what it consists of.

13               MR. FELDMAN:      That -- that's correct, and

14   I'm not arguing today about what it consists of, but the

15   point being that this was a right that had been -- that

16   the framers as far as we know would have been satisfied to

17   leave to the political process if it was just a question

18   of the feature of it.     But today --

19               JUSTICE ALITO:        Let me see if I understand

20   your argument.   I thought you said a minute ago that if

21   a State or local government were to ban firearms

22   completely, this Court might hold that that violates

23   substantive due process because the right to use a

24   firearm for self-defense is -- might be held to be

25   implicit in the concept of ordered liberty; is that

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   right?

 2                MR. FELDMAN:     That's correct.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:       And -- but I thought you

 4   began by saying that the right to keep and bear arms is

 5   not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.

 6                MR. FELDMAN:     The right to keep and bear

 7   arms that was recognized -- I don't think actually the

 8   right to keep and bear arms itself is.           Perhaps the

 9   right to self-defense is, and then like other rights,

10   similar rights, if the Court were to hold that that is

11   constitutionally protected, the question would be is the

12   State now giving you sufficient means to exercise that

13   right?   Not whatever means you want, but sufficient means

14   so that you reasonably can exercise that right.           I

15   would think that would be the only way that that kind of

16   analysis could go, if you start off from self-defense.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:        But --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Feldman, let me take

19   your argument at -- at its face value.           Let's assume

20   that the only reason it is there and the only purpose it

21   serves is the militia purpose.          Isn't that militia

22   purpose just as much defeated by allowing the States to

23   take away the militia's arms as it would be by allowing

24   the Federal Government to take away the militia's arms?

25                MR. FELDMAN:     Yes, but I -- that --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Then so --

 2               MR. FELDMAN:     But that --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- even if you assume that

 4   the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that

 5   prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to

 6   the State's depriving the people of arms.

 7               MR. FELDMAN:     Yes, but I don't think the

 8   argument -- the primary argument that's being made today,

 9   that this is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or

10   sufficiently fundamental or whichever other formulas --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:        You're switching horses

12   now.

13               MR. FELDMAN:     No, I'm not.       No --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Let's just focus on your

15   argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue.

16   You say this is different because of that prologue.           But

17   that prologue has just as much force if the States take

18   away the militia's arms as if the Federal Government

19   does.

20               MR. FELDMAN:     I -- I think that few people

21   today would say -- and in fact few people in 1868 would

22   say that the concern to protect the State militias is

23   something that's so fundamental or essential to a

24   concept of ordered liberty or central to our system that

25   it has to be --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, suppose it is.

 2               MR. FELDMAN:     -- protected --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- Suppose it is.      Assume for

 4   argument's sake that it is.        Still, I take from what

 5   you are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary

 6   importance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to

 7   James Madison and the other framers.            And he would say,

 8   insofar as that right to bear arms is important for

 9   the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on

10   the ordered liberty chart.       Insofar as the right to bear

11   arms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered

12   liberty chart.

13               And if that's what they'd say, it's

14   conceivable that part of this amendment would go through

15   and be incorporated; namely, that part which would

16   prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent

17   they couldn't form militias.           But that part which would

18   disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot

19   burglars, that would not be incorporated.

20               MR. FELDMAN:     It -- that would be -- that

21   would be possible, but another -- another way to look at

22   it is that the question that the Court had -- the Court

23   has never answered the question, is this implicit in the

24   concept of ordered liberty or should this be

25   incorporated under any other test?

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:       But if we took the

 2   approach that --

 3                MR. FELDMAN:     By just --

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:       If we took the approach

 5   that Justice Breyer outlined, would -- why would we not do

 6   the same thing with respect to all the applications of all

 7   of the amendments that up to this point have been regarded

 8   as being completely incorporated, along with all of our

 9   decisions?   So why would we not look at all of our

10   decisions under the First Amendment and the Fourth

11   Amendment and the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth

12   Amendment, and rank all of those interpretations on some

13   scale of ordered liberty?

14                MR. FELDMAN:     I -- I don't think -- I don't

15   think the Court would.      And what I was really responding

16   to Justice Breyer was, we understand that the Second

17   Amendment is in the Constitution and binds the Federal

18   Government, but it has always been understood, from 1868

19   on, that before an amendment applies to the States, you

20   need something more than just finding that it's in the

21   Constitution, and --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, to get back to

23   Justice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered,

24   is your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of

25   is it in or is it out?      But you're saying, well, what is

 1   in and what is out, are you?

 2                MR. FELDMAN:       No, I -- actually my -- excuse

 3   me.   My answer to the question would be it's -- I think

 4   it's out, because all that shows is the framers certainly

 5   had --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you think it's in

 7   or out, right?

 8                MR. FELDMAN:       I think that -- I think the

 9   best argument is that it's out, for this reason:

10   When the framers --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I -- I know your

12   reasons.

13                MR. FELDMAN:       Okay.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm trying to get

15   you to take a position on whether or not you want us to

16   not only pick and choose among which amendments are part

17   of our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you

18   want us also to take amendments that might be in and

19   refine them and shave them off a little bit and say,

20   well, this part of the amendment is in, and this part

21   isn't.

22                MR. FELDMAN:       No, that's not the argument

23   that we're making.

 6   make my chart.    Step two is look at what's high.              Step

 7   three is, even though that high part, even that high part,

 8   nobody could think was incorporated.

 9                 MR. FELDMAN:     I -- in our view, the things

10   that the framers -- the framers had their reasons for

11   putting --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That's how you think

20   his job?

22   reasons to put everything in the Constitution that they

24   incorporated against the States is a different question

25   than whether they put it in the Constitution.

 1               And what you have in the Second Amendment

 2   -- and it's right clear on the face of it from the

 3   prologue; it's clear -- it's clear from the opinion in

 4   Heller -- is the reason they put it in the Constitution is

 5   not the primary reason why people today are arguing that

 6   this is a right that -- that is so fundamental that it

 7   has to be applied against the States.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Mr. Feldman, our

 9   selective incorporation doctrine under the Due Process

10   Clause does suggest that there are some rights that were

11   fundamental enough to be incorporated and some that are

12   fundamental, but not fundamental enough to be

13   incorporated.   We've drawn a line.

14               Is it the ordered liberty concept alone in

15   our jurisprudence that you are relying upon, or is it

16   any other articulation of our incorporation doctrine

17   that supports your view?

18               MR. FELDMAN:      I think that's the underlying

19   standard, but the Court has certainly looked at our

20   history and our traditions in answering this question,

21   and I think they are relevant in this area, as they were

22   --

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The Chief says:    Yes, if

 7               MR. FELDMAN:        Yes, and I think it's -- I

 8   think it's not.   We have discussed already 1791, and the

 9   reasons why -- the reasons even that the framers thought

10   that -- well, I've already discussed that.            I don't want

11   to go into it again.

12               The --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Eleven of the colonies had

14   a guarantee at the time the Constitution was

15   adopted, and I believe something like 44 States

16   currently have in their constitutions protection of the

17   right to bear arms.

18               MR. FELDMAN:        I -- I --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Does that suggest anything

20   about -- about how fundamental it is generally?

21               MR. FELDMAN:        I -- what the Court actually said

22   in Heller was that there were two States at the time, in

23   1791, that had a firearms right, and with -- there were

24   possibly two more where the evidence was a little bit

25   more ambiguous.

 1                  As far as today, it is true that 44 States

 2   have some kind of recognition of a right to keep and

 3   bear arms.     Now, some of those States -- a couple of

 4   them, at least, two to four -- recognize that only in

 5   connection with the militia, and it's really quite

 6   different from the right that this Court recognized in

 7   Heller.     Many other of the rights that are recognized in

 8   State constitutions include provisions that really would

 9   be unheard of, and that actually point to the reasons

10   why this is not fundamental, like, say, freedom of

11   speech or freedom of religion.            They have provisions

12   that say:     Subject to such regulation as the legislature

13   may prescribe, or the like.

14                  And that points out the other difference.

15   Because firearms are -- the same features that make them

16   useful for self-defense make them also useful as

17   instruments of violent crime, suicide, and accidental

18   death.    Their -- regulation of these items has -- is a

19   part of our tradition and --

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        "Subject to such

21   regulation" certainly excludes banning them entirely,

22   which is what you assert can be done.

23                  MR. FELDMAN:     No, I think that --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        What's the purpose of a

25   State constitutional guarantee which has at the end of

 1   it "subject to such regulation as the legislature may

 2   proscribe," if that regulation includes banning it

 3   entirely?   That --

 4               MR. FELDMAN:        With that --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- would make a nullity

 6   of the constitutional requirement.

 7               MR. FELDMAN:        The overwhelming consensus

 8   among the State courts in interpreting the wide variety

 9   of different types of provisions that they have is that

10   it imposes a reasonable regulation standard that is not

11   violated by banning a particular weapon or a particular

12   class of weapons, as long as you are allowing some kind

13   of firearm, and that is not the right that this Court --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           And is that what you're

15   asserting here --

16               MR. FELDMAN:        -- recognized in Heller.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- that the States have

18   to allow firearms?

19               MR. FELDMAN:        No.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that --

21               MR. FELDMAN:        I -- I didn't think I was.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I didn't think so, either,

23   so --

24               MR. FELDMAN:        No.       What I'm --

 1   make any sense?

 2                MR. FELDMAN:     No, what I'm saying -- I'm

 3   sorry.   What I'm saying is that the right that is

 4   embodied in the wide variety of different State

 5   constitutions -- the overwhelming consensus is that what

 6   the States have determined as a result of their own

 7   processes and in light of their own conditions is that

 8   you can't ban all kinds of firearms, but you can ban

 9   some kinds of firearms.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:        That's fine.

11                MR. FELDMAN:     And that is -- and the kinds

12   of firearms that have traditionally been banned --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:        We said as much in Heller.

14                MR. FELDMAN:     Right.       Well -- and the

15   kinds of firearms that have traditionally been banned by

16   the States and that actually the period around the time

17   of the Fourteenth Amendment is a good period to look.

18   At or around that time, there are numerous States that

19   had regulations barring the carrying and even that go up

20   to the point of possession of pistols and Bowie knives,

21   which are not firearms, but are also arms under the

22   Second Amendment, and so on.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, all those

24   may be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court

25   incorporates the Second Amendment.               Incorporation

 1   doesn't say anything by itself about whether those types

 2   of regulations, which you think are reasonable and your

 3   friends think may not be reasonable, are valid or not.

 4                  MR. FELDMAN:     I think the Court in Heller

 5   did hold that a ban on -- a ban on handguns is invalid.

 6   That was the holding of the case.             And these are --

 7   these were laws that were passed that are very close to

 8   that.     In the 1860s and the 1870s, in Texas, in

 9   Wyoming, places that -- not necessarily for the whole

10   State --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Handguns in the home?

12                  MR. FELDMAN:     They --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Handguns in the home?

14   That's what Heller addressed.

15                  MR. FELDMAN:     They banned -- I -- well,

16   not -- I can't say that they banned handguns in the home

17   per --

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        No, you can't, because they

19   didn't.

20                  MR. FELDMAN:     But if you look at the

21   decision -- no, if you look at -- actually, if you

22   look at the decisions, some of them banned the sale;

23   they banned carrying them anywhere in the jurisdiction,

24   and in such a way that -- and some of the judicial

25   decisions even say:     This was intended to eliminate

 1   these weapons from our jurisdiction.              And they were

 2   generally upheld at that time.

 3                 Now, those were responding to local

 4   conditions at the time, and generally, the history of

 5   firearms regulation, because of the risk that firearms

 6   pose, has been that in this country, it has been widely

 7   recognized that in many places it's appropriate to carry

 8   firearms.    And many jurisdictions have found, and

 9   reasonably found, that allowing broad use, carriage, and

10   whatever of firearms is appropriate, but there are some

11   jurisdictions that have found that's not to be the case,

12   throughout our history.

13                 And that has been a State and local decision

14   that has worked through the political process in those

15   jurisdictions.    And that political process here is

16   another distinction between the Second Amendment and

17   some of the other amendments that have been

18   incorporated -- is that one basis, I think, for

19   incorporating the other amendments and for applying them

20   against the States has been that there is a concern

21   about a discrete minority or a highly unpopular view

22   that's not going to get a fair shake in the political

23   process.    I don't think that has ever been the case

24   here.   And as far as I know, the framers didn't think

25   that was the case with respect to the right to keep and

 1   bear arms.

 2                It's a right that gets controlled in

 3   accordance with local conditions, with local cultures,

 4   and with local views about the necessarily difficult

 5   questions about how best to protect public safety.             That

 6   is -- that has been a part of our -- of our history

 7   since 1860, since --

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But there -- but there are

 9   provisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights,

10   that have been incorporated against the States, where

11   the States have substantial latitude and ample authority

12   to impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting --

13   rights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual

14   Punishment Clause.     We look to see what the political

15   process does.   We look to see -- why can't we do the

16   same thing with firearms?

17                MR. FELDMAN:      Well, it's just that the end

18   -- I have really two points I'd like to make about that.

19   One is the analysis the Court used in Heller.             In

20   Heller, what the Court said is:             This is not the time to

21   balance things; you cannot ban handguns.

22                Now, there may be local -- there have been

23   local jurisdictions before and there are now ones where

24   they feel allowing some firearms, but banning handguns,

25   is the best way to achieve public safety and to increase


                                     55

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the zone of ordered liberty for their people.           And those

 2   things would be apparently impermissible under Heller.

 3               But even more than that, Heller construed

 4   the Second Amendment's "bear" -- the word "bear," "to

 5   keep and bear arms" -- to mean the same thing as "carry"

 6   in this Court's case in Muscarello, much later.           And to

 7   carry -- generally to carry.

 8               Many -- there's a long history of

 9   regulation of not just concealed carry, as the Court did

10   recognize in Heller, but of banning open carry

11   in a variety of jurisdictions.           Again, generally, it's

12   someplace that is -- it has a particular problem; it's a

13   city or something like that.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you think there is

15   existing authority with reference to other provisions of

16   the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate

17   just the core of Heller with respect to the States?

18   Just the core of the Second Amendment with respect to

19   the States, along the lines to this question Justice

20   Stevens was asking earlier?

21               MR. FELDMAN:     Well, I think that there would

22   be --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And if so, what's -- what

24   case do we look to for that proposition?

25               MR. FELDMAN:     I think really this -- I


                                   56

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   cannot offhand think of a case that would lead you to

 2   that -- would lead to that.

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:           If you look to Justice

 4   Harlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the

 5   Fourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can

 6   be either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of

 7   Rights, and there's no reason in the world why this

 8   Court could not adopt the same position here and say:

 9   Insofar it's incorporated, it applies only within the

10   home.   The Court had ample precedent for that.

11                MR. FELDMAN:     And actually the other point I

12   make is if you approach it from the other point of view,

13   the case has not been made here -- it hasn't even been

14   brought -- that the City of Chicago is denying people

15   the -- the right to have any kind of firearm or the

16   right to have any kind of reasonable means of

17   self-defense.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm sorry.   Is it

19   the position of the City of Chicago that we should rely

20   on Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold?

21                MR. FELDMAN:     No.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, then your

23   answer to Justice Stevens is no, you're not going to

24   follow that approach, right?

25                MR. FELDMAN:     No, what I would say is that


                                    57

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   --   what I would say is that if the Court -- what I was

 2   saying is that if the Court approaches it from the

 3   standpoint of perhaps if there is -- if the Court

 4   chooses in an appropriate case to recognize a

 5   fundamental right to self-defense, it would then raise

 6   those kinds of questions.       And someone could make the

 7   case that they are being denied any right to

 8   self-defense or any reasonable right to exercise

 9   self-defense because of a jurisdiction's firearms

10   regulations; the Court could address that.           That's not a

11   claim that has been made in this case; that's not a

12   claim that could be made in this case because --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:        See, the right to keep and

14   bear arms is right there.       It's right there in the Bill

15   of Rights.   Where do you find the right to self-defense?

16                MR. FELDMAN:     Well, I --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:        You -- you want us to

18   impose that one on the States but not -- not the

19   explicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms.

20   That seems very strange.

21                MR. FELDMAN:     No, actually I -- I don't want

22   to impose that on the States.           I think it's very

23   unlikely that the Court would ever be called upon to,

24   because our history for the last 200 years -- 220 years

25   had been of reasonable State and local regulation of


                                    58

 1   firearms that responds to local conditions, to local

 2   threats of violence, and so on that occur.           And I don't

 3   see any reason to think that there will be a

 4   jurisdiction that would try to sufficiently ban firearms

 5   that people wouldn't have a reasonable means of

 6   self-defense.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:        The District of Columbia

 8   did.   That's what Heller said.

 9                MR. FELDMAN:     Well, the District of Columbia

10   in any event is controlled by Second Amendment as it --

11   as it's written.   That's not the question in this case.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Would you be happy if we

13   incorporated it and said reasonable regulation is part

14   of the incorporation?     And how do we do that?

15                MR. FELDMAN:     Well, there is the reasonable

16   regulation standard.    There's an article by Professor

17   Winkler that we cite in our brief, that goes very

18   extensively through the ways that State courts have

19   dealt with their own rights to keep and bear arms and

20   have adopted, really by overwhelming consensus, that

21   kind of a reasonable regulation standard, which

22   generally recognizes --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought that Heller --

24   Heller allowed for reasonable regulation.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought that the Heller

 2   decision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a

 3   few examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned.

 4               MR. FELDMAN:     Right.       Well, it's just our

 5   view would be that what Chicago has done here, which is

 6   permit you to have a -- permit you to have long guns but

 7   ban handguns, is the kind of regulation that throughout

 8   our history jurisdictions in their own -- that are most

 9   familiar with their own particular needs, their own

10   particular problems, and in a position to balance the --

11   the need for self-defense with the risks to the use of

12   firearms -- for violence, for accidental death, and for

13   suicide -- that the City of Chicago has come up with

14   something that is well within our tradition.          And --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:        What you're urging is

16   really a mixed blessing for gun control advocates.          To

17   the extent we sever the Federal guarantee from what the

18   States are obliged to comport with, we encourage a

19   stricter Federal Second Amendment, one that forbids all

20   sorts of regulations that the Federal Government might

21   otherwise be allowed to do, because it doesn't matter --

22   the States can take care of it.

23               I mean, you know, if -- if you sever the

24   two, you're encouraging a broader prohibition at the

25   Federal level, and that's what -- Heller was very


                                   60

 1   careful not to impose such a broad prohibition

 2   precisely because it realized that -- that this is a

 3   national problem.

 4               MR. FELDMAN:      I -- I think that, if I may --

 5   that the restriction that the Second Amendment imposes

 6   on the Federal Government should be and is controlled by

 7   what the meaning of that Second Amendment was in 1791.

 8   It shouldn't vary one way or the other with whether

 9   there's incorporation against the States.

14                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15               MR. GURA:     Sure.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Counsel, at the -- at the

17   very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the

18   question which, as I understood it, essentially said what

19   are examples of privileges and immunities that are being

20   denied by the States that -- which denial would be

21   remedied by following your proposal to overrule the

22   Slaughter-House case?

23               And let's leave the Second Amendment out.

24   Let's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either

25   going to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated

 1   the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges

 2   or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause.               Leaving

 3   the Due Process -- the Second Amendment out of it, what

 4   privileges and immunities are now being denied citizens

 5   of -- of the United States?

 6                MR. GURA:    Well, apart from the Second

 7   Amendment right, which is being denied to people in the

 8   United States by Chicago at least, there are other

 9   rights -- other rights enumerated in the first eight

10   amendments that were thought to be the personal guarantees

11   as well as certain unenumerated rights which were

12   understood to be part of --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What are examples of

14   those?   The jury trial in civil cases?

15                MR. GURA:    The jury trial --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And grand jury.     What

17   else?

18                MR. GURA:    There's not much left, Your

19   Honor.   Those are the only two provisions of the Bill of

20   Rights that have not been held incorporated under due

21   process, which informs us that perhaps we should have

22   the Second Amendment incorporated.               There's no reason

23   to treat it any differently.            With respect to the

24   unenumerated rights that perhaps are not being --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So you are saying that


                                    62

 1   under -- under your view, every State would have to use a

 2   grand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information.

 3   And that every State would have to have a civil jury, if

 4   any party in the case requested it.               Is that --

 5                 MR. GURA:    Yes -- well, it's not just what

 6   we're saying; it's what the framers of the Constitution

 7   said.   And as Justice Scalia noted in Apprendi, the right

 8   to a jury trial, for example, may not be efficient, but

 9   it is free.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That's a criminal case;

11   that's quite different.

12                 MR. GURA:    That's right.          We're talking

13   about the Grand Jury Clause; we have 28 States right now

14   out of the 50 that allow prosecutors to pursue felony

15   charges without indictment by a grand jury, but the

16   other 22 States do require it.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm -- we're using

18   up your time.    But --

19                 MR. GURA:    Sure.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- do you want me to leave

21   the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial

22   and jury case -- that's it.          There's no other -- what are

23   these other unenumerated rights?

24                 MR. GURA:    We can't give a full description

25   of all unenumerated rights that are going to be

 1   protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.                Either --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:          It doesn't trouble you.

 3               MR. GURA:      No, it does not, and it shouldn't

 4   trouble the Court because the Court addresses due

 5   process cases all the time without saying we're --

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, does it include the

 7   right to contract?

 8               MR. GURA:      The right to contract --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:         Isn't that an unenumerated

10   right?

11               MR. GURA:      That is literally understood by

12   the framers to be an unenumerated right under the

13   privileged immunities.      We know that because in the

14   Civil Rights Act of 1866, that's the very first right

15   that they mentioned as something that people in the South

16   should be enjoying, because they were not allowed to

17   pursue a livelihood.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Your approach --

19   your original approach would give judges a lot more

20   power and flexibility in determining what rights they

21   think are a good idea than they have now with the

22   constraints of the Due Process Clause.

23               MR. GURA:      No, Your Honor; our approach

24   might actually provide judges with perhaps no more than

25   what they have now, perhaps even less, because our


                                     64

 1   approach is rooted in text and history.               It's not a

 2   license for judges to make up unenumerated rights that

 3   they believe --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Privileges and

 5   immunities give you a lot more flexibility than due

 6   process, because it's not limited to procedural --

 7   where you don't have to deal with the hurdle that it's

 8   limited to procedural by the text.

 9                MR. GURA:    Sure.         If I may?

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Yes, you may.

11                MR. GURA:    Thanks.         We believe that it's

12   more limited because that -- that text had a specific

13   understanding and that there are guideposts left behind

14   in texts and history that tell us how to apply it, unlike

15   the due process.   But at least we know one thing, which

16   is that, in 1868, the right to keep and bear arms was

17   understood to be a privilege or immunity of citizenship,

18   and if the Court is considering watering down the Second

19   Amendment, perhaps it should look to text and history.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

21                MR. GURA:    Thanks.
