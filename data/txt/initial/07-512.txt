 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We will hear

 4   argument next this morning in Case 07-512, Pacific Bell

 5   v. LinkLine Communications.

 6              Mr. Panner.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. PANNER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              The Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's

12   decision because it asserts that this Court's holding in

13   Trinko and principles regarding unilateral pricing

14   decisions as explained in Brooke and elsewhere.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You are probably

16   feeling pretty good about your chances since your

17   opponent has given up, right?

18              (Laughter.)

19              MR. PANNER:          Well, Your Honor, it is correct

20   that this Court observed in Roberts that the

21   Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the

22   court below is incorrect, certainly should provide this

23   Court great comfort in reversing the decision in the

24   Ninth Circuit.   And, indeed, a decision on the merits

25   here is important because the Ninth Circuit's decision


                                         4

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts

 2   and sufficient particle integration.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Any question should

 4   we have about the Article III status of this aspect of

 5   the dispute?

 6                 MR. PANNER:       No, Your Honor.           The parties'

 7   agreement on a point of law does not deprive this Court

 8   of jurisdiction in any way, and the parties remain

 9   adverse in this case.       The Respondents continue to

10   pursue a section 2 claim, and the same intend to --

11   evidently intend to pursue the same relief.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, you might be

13   right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have

14   held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live

15   case broadly conceived.

16                 MR. PANNER:       Well, in Laidlaw the Court said

17   that it was for a particular type of relief, that the

18   plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at

19   issue here.    The Respondents continue to pursue a

20   section 2 claim and pursue, evidently, the same type of

21   relief based on the same course of conduct.

22                 I would also like to point out that

23   Respondents, while conceding that the position of the

24   Ninth Circuit was incorrect, have not clearly stated

25   that they would not take advantage of a decision by this


                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court affirming the Ninth Circuit.                And I think that

 2   that's important, because there really would be no

 3   reason for these Respondents to say that if for whatever

 4   reason the Court decided that the Ninth Circuit is

 5   right, that they would not go ahead and take advantage

 6   --

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought they asked to

 8   have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated.                They didn't

 9   ask us to affirm it.     They said vacate that decision is

10   wrong.

11              MR. PANNER:        That is right,

12   Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court

13   were to disagree -- for example, it is well established

14   that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for

15   example, or a State attorney general's confession of

16   error does not bind this Court.             Indeed, a party's

17   position with respect to the proper disposition of the

18   case never binds the Court.

19              So the Court certainly has the power to say,

20   now that the case is properly before it:               We think that

21   the Ninth Circuit got it right.

22              Obviously, we don't think that that's what

23   we think the Court should say; but, given that

24   circumstance, if the Court, for whatever reason, were to

25   affirm the Ninth Circuit, there would be nothing that


                                       6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would bar the Respondents from taking advantage of that.

 2   Even though they said that that was a legal error, if

 3   that were the established law, there would be no reason

 4   for them not to pursue it.

 5               And I think that that's relevant, again, to

 6   the question whether the parties remain adverse for

 7   Article III purposes.      As a jurisdictional issue, the

 8   adversity of the parties with respect, even to the

 9   section 2 claim, even if intended to pursue it

10   differently, the theory is sufficient.

11               But the point I am making is simply to

12   illustrate that adversity even with respect to the

13   narrow legal issue remains, even though they are not

14   contesting the proper -- contesting the proper

15   disposition of that legal issue.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             When this comes up, we

17   usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in

18   support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we

19   have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have

20   appointed a friend of the court to represent the

21   position of the circuit.

22               And here we don't have that.                We don't have

23   anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the

24   position.   You defend the position below.

25               MR. PANNER:        Well, that's true, Your Honor,


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   but there is an amicus arguing before the Court today

 2   defending the Ninth Circuit's decision.                 And there were

 3   two amicus briefs filed on that.               Had those not been

 4   filed, the Court could have sought additional help.                 But

 5   the positions -- the arguments in favor of the Ninth

 6   Circuit decision had been put forward in the amicus

 7   brief, and there will be argument in support of the

 8   Ninth Circuit's decision today.

 9                And I think -- I think that the

10   jurisdictional issue is answered by your question.                 That

11   is to say, the fact that the Court could appoint amicus

12   shows that this Court retains Article III jurisdiction.

13   And it's very important in this case for the Court to

14   reach the merits of the decision and clearly to rule

15   that there is no independent price-squeeze theory under

16   Section 2 because recognition of such a theory, as in

17   the Ninth Circuit's, decision is very -- very harmful to

18   consumers.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is there any way in

20   which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would

21   affect their Brooke Group Section 2 claim?

22                MR. PANNER:       I think it could, Your Honor.

23   In their brief they refer to the possibility that the

24   wholesale price that was charged could be in some way a

25   proxy for costs.   And this Court clearly stated that


                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there's a different issue as to whether a single

 2   economic unit is charging prices below cost; that the

 3   wholesale prices that may be charged are not an

 4   appropriate proxy.

 5                But I -- so, in that respect, I think that a

 6   clear declaration with respect to what is required -- I

 7   guess the distinction between the predatory-pricing

 8   theory of liability and a price-squeeze claim as

 9   recognized by the Ninth Circuit could have an impact.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I just clarify:     Are

11   you arguing there is never a price-squeeze claim under

12   Section 2?   In other words, are you challenging Judge

13   Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?

14                MR. PANNER:         Well, Your Honor, I believe, I

15   am challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in Alcoa.                 I think

16   that I would not go so far as to say that there would

17   never be a situation in which a price squeeze, that is,

18   an insufficient margin between wholesale and retail

19   prices to allow a competitor to compete -- that that

20   course of conduct could never support a claim under

21   Section 2.

22                But the basis for the claim would have to be

23   that there was a -- a duty to deal -- or a duty to deal

24   under Section 2, an antitrust duty to deal that was

25   effectively being debased through that sort of pricing


                                          9

                           Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   conduct.    But --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:              Was there such a duty in

 3   the Alcoa case?

 4                MR. PANNER:          Well, I think that the Alcoa

 5   case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, in several

 6   respects.   The critical point about -- the first point

 7   about Alcoa is that the conduct that was at issue was

 8   said to be unlawful because it was an abuse of the power

 9   in the ingot market and not monopolization of the

10   downstream market in sheet.

11                And so what Judge Hand said was that that

12   was unlawful.     But he expressed some doubt as to whether

13   it was appropriate to treat it as an independent basis

14   for -- or an independent wrong under section 2.

15                But the notion that the abuse -- that

16   charging too high a price at the wholesale level could

17   be an independent section 2 wrong is quite inconsistent

18   with what this Court said in -- in -- most recently in

19   Trinko where it recognize --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:              So there is regulation

21   involved there.      I mean, suppose you had no regulation

22   at all involved.     Why couldn't you have a monopolist at

23   the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist

24   wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary

25   stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely


                                          10

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that there would be a new entries to attack its primary

 2   monopoly?    That would -- suppose you have those

 3   circumstances?    Perhaps they would be rare, but if you

 4   have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2

 5   violation?

 6                MR. PANNER:        It -- it -- it wouldn't, Your

 7   Honor, for the following reason:                That I think it is --

 8   it is true that the -- the key point of the -- the basis

 9   upon which the question -- the question presented has

10   been granted and upon which the analysis has to turn is

11   that there is no duty to deal at all at the wholesale

12   level.

13                So that the ingot monopolist has no

14   obligation to provide an ingot to a downstream rival.

15   And that judgment is a judgment that it is not worth

16   protecting downstream dependent competitors in order to

17   promote the competitive process.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, that may be the

19   assumption on this case, but that may not be the

20   assumption on the next case.             And I understood you to be

21   arguing that you wanted us to hold that at -- well, you

22   wanted us to hold whether we are dealing with a

23   regulatory case or in Justice Breyer's example, where

24   there is -- where there is no independent regulation,

25   that the greater includes the lesser; that A, there is


                                        11
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   no duty to deal and therefore there is no obligation

 2   that can be violated under the antitrust laws by a price

 3   squeeze that does not rise to the level of predatory

 4   pricing.

 5              Is that your position?

 6              MR. PANNER:        Well, Justice Souter, trying to

 7   be clear about the relationship.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, the best way to do

 9   that is to start with a yes or no answer.                That way, so

10   I know where you are going.

11              MR. PANNER:        Thank you, Your Honor.           And I

12   think that's not precisely our position.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

14              MR. PANNER:        Our position is that in the

15   absence of a duty to deal, one does not look at an

16   allegation of insufficient margin as a potential section

17   2 --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       But what I think we

19   are trying to get at is, should we foresee a situation,

20   with or without the regulatory participation of

21   something like the agency here, in which there would be

22   a duty to deal, which would support a price squeeze

23   theory that did not amount to predatory pricing?

24              MR. PANNER:        Your Honor, I don't think that

25   the Court has to anticipate that.               I think what the


                                      12
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court should say is that there are narrow circumstances

 2   as recognized in Trinko, where there may be a duty to

 3   deal under section 2.       And in that circumstance there

 4   may be conduct that constitutes a refusal to deal, even

 5   a constructive refusal to deal.               There is really -- to

 6   give a simple example, if a widget, if the downstream

 7   product costs $10 and a widget is made available for a

 8   million dollars, that is not really dealing at all.

 9               But the point is that the section -- the

10   price squeeze piece of the allegation really does not

11   add to the underlying question of what is the section 2

12   duty that needs to be enforced.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, that's it -- I mean,

14   now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now

15   it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question

16   is yes.   Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's

17   opinion in Alcoa.    I always thought there were

18   circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that

19   did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested.

20               Well, it's quite a different battle if, in

21   fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator

22   who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC

23   or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those

24   circumstances, he has a place to complain that these

25   prices are out of line.

 1              But if there is no place to go, well, I'm

 2   suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa

 3   under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to

 4   deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an

 5   existing world where duty or no duty, there have been

 6   independent fabricators who for a long time have bought

 7   their ingot from this monopolist.

 8              MR. PANNER:          Well, Your Honor, the answer to

 9   that is two-fold.    First of all, because there is no

10   duty to deal, by assumption the producer of ingot, the

11   alleged wholesale monopolist, has the privilege to

12   withdraw the supply of that.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:              Then I would say that

14   shouldn't be the law.       The reason it shouldn't be the

15   law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or,

16   in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level

17   and charging just no room to remain in business, is

18   trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot

19   stage of the business.        And the fabricators are a number

20   one out there as possibilities to break down the

21   monopolist in ingot.

22              And if that is the motive, as shown by the

23   behavior, there should be a section 2 claim.             If you

24   want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the

25   answer to that argument?

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                MR. PANNER:        The answer to that argument,

 2   Your Honor, is the one that Trinko offers, is that it's

 3   very important in establishing the antitrust rules to

 4   recognize the incentive that those rules will create for

 5   investment and for innovation.

 6                If the monopolist is forced to share the

 7   benefit of the monopoly with downstream rivals on the

 8   basis there is potential entry, that is going to be a

 9   significant disincentive to innovation at the upstream

10   level.   And the establishment of clear rules, ones that

11   recognize that in the general run of cases there is not

12   going to be harm and recognizes that the very scrutiny

13   of that conduct will deter beneficial conduct and

14   beneficial innovation and beneficial investment by the

15   upstream monopolist, that recognition is the one that

16   argues in favor of saying, in the absence of a duty to

17   deal, where -- where the wholesale input could be

18   withdraw from the market and where, therefore, the

19   incremental harm from a price squeeze is really quite

20   hard to identify.    But that in that circumstance it is

21   inappropriate to recognize any sort of a duty under

22   section 2.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            Just out of curiosity, is

24   there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could

25   go, a place which has a label "regulator" under it?

 1                 MR. PANNER:        Yes, there is, Your Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And that place is --

 3                 MR. PANNER:        The Federal Communications

 4   Commission.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So we needn't reach the

 6   issue in this case?

 7                 MR. PANNER:        Well, Your Honor, I think that

 8   the -- significant regulation is not necessary.                 I agree

 9   with Your Honor that that is a factor that the Court

10   could allow to be placed somehow on the scale.              But the

11   analysis that took place in Trinko is, first of all,

12   whether there is an antitrust duty there at all and

13   whether to extend it in light of the regulatory scheme

14   that existed.     And so, in this case, even in the absence

15   of regulation, there should be no duty under section 2.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            With respect to your

17   argument that there is going to be an upstream

18   disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do

19   not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a

20   stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we

21   can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your

22   argument?

23                 And if the answer is no, then isn't the only

24   sensible thing for this Court to do to is leave it to

25   rule of greedy?

 1              MR. PANNER:        Your Honor, I think there is a

 2   consensus in all of the scholar literature that was

 3   cited by the American Antitrust Institute, there wasn't

 4   anyone who supported, there was no scholar who supported

 5   the recognition of a price squeeze claim under section

 6   2.  I do think that --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:            For the reasons you gave,

 8   in effect, the investment disincentive?

 9              MR. PANNER:        Well, I think the scholarly

10   literature that explains the recognition of price

11   squeeze duty would be harmful does indeed rely on the

12   sorts of reasons that --

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is that, in effect,

14   uncontested within the profession except for the

15   margins?

16              MR. PANNER:        I would assume as in any

17   academic discipline, there would be those who are trying

18   to find counterexamples.        But I think the point there

19   and one for example Professor Carlton stresses in his

20   article and stressed another scholarly works is that the

21   search for the rare case itself can cause very grave

22   harm in the conduct that is following.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:            I follow the argument.   The

24   trouble I have that I have is I don't know whether, in

25   the practical sense, that argument is a significant


                                      17

 1   argument or not.   I don't know what's going on out

 2   there.   And unless we reach the point in which the

 3   economic literature makes this a kind of slam dunk

 4   decision, then it seems for me the only thing for a

 5   Court to do is leave it for reasoning and analysis.

 6               MR. PANNER:        Well, I think that the Brooke

 7   decision -- and as reaffirmed the answer to that.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is there --

 9               MR. PANNER:        There is a certain kinds of

10   conduct where it is possible to create a model where

11   there would be some negative consequences of the

12   conduct, but that the very search for it risks deterring

13   conduct that is of obvious benefit to the consumers.

14   And that's true here.

15               The recognition of an independent price

16   squeeze duty would deter retail price reductions that

17   are immediately beneficial to consumers, and it deters

18   entry into the downstream market by a vertical -- by a

19   wholesale monopolist who may then encounter a duty to

20   protect downstream rivals; and, of course, it would

21   deter voluntary dealing.

22               And I think that that you know, discussions

23   with my client reflect that this is a real effect, that

24   they are on the margin, the concern about the potential

25   for litigation makes investment and certainly

 1   innovations not worth the gamble.

 3   will reserve the remainder of my time.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

 7                ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 8                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 9                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

10              MS. MAYNARD:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12              If a retail level rival can state a section

13   2 claim against a vertically integrated company by

14   alleging nothing more than a margin-based price squeeze,

15   one of two outcomes will result.                Either the vertically

16   integrated company will have to raise its retail prices

17   to its consumers or it will be forced to share the

18   benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals by

19   lowering its wholesale price.              Either outcome is

20   inconsistent with this Court's antitrust jurisprudence.

21              As we know from Trinko, in the absence of a

22   duty to deal, a monopolist cannot be forced to share the

23   benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals at any

24   particular turn.

 1   in your colleague's suggestion that we should overrule

 2   the Alcoa case?

 3                MS. MAYNARD:        I do think -- the government

 4   believes the Alcoa case is wrongly decided,

 5   Justice Stevens.

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do you think it's

 7   necessary to do so to decide this case?

 8                MS. MAYNARD:        I mean if -- I mean, one could

 9   say that Judge Hand didn't necessarily recognize a price

10   squeeze claim standing alone, because he has some

11   language about, to the effect of perhaps this isn't an

12   independent wrong, but the way that he analyzed it

13   separately and the way courts have ruled -- have relied

14   upon it, to suggest that a mere margin-based price

15   squeeze without more, does state a section 2 claim, is

16   incorrect.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:           My question is really, you

18   think it's necessary to overrule that decision in order

19   to decide this case correctly?

20                MS. MAYNARD:        Well, I don't think

21   technically it needs overruling.               It's a Second Circuit

22   decision, and I think it is -- has in effect --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do we have to say it was

24   decided incorrectly?

25                MS. MAYNARD:        I think the Court should say

 1   it was decided incorrectly.

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's not my question.

 3                MS. MAYNARD:         Yes, Justice Stevens, I think

 4   it's incorrect.

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I know you think it's

 6   incorrect.   I am asking whether you think we have to say

 7   it's incorrect in order to decide this case correctly?

 8                MS. MAYNARD:         Yes, unless you're willing to

 9   say Judge Hand didn't hold that a price squeeze claim

10   without more is an independent theory that supports the

11   section 2 claim.   As long as you think that's what he

12   did hold, and many people do think that is what he held,

13   then, yes, you do need to say that it was wrongly

14   decided and the government believes it is wrongly

15   decided, and that it has already been overruled.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why -- why can't we

17   just say Trinko is a case, as is this case, where there

18   is a regulator?    So, in fact, if you, Mr. Plaintiff, are

19   upset about this, and feel you are being very badly

20   treated and squeezed out under circumstances where

21   competition might be hurt as a result, then you go to

22   the Commission, and you say:             "This is an unreasonable

23   price. " All right?

24                Now I thought Trinko was a case where that

25   was involved.

 1                 MS. MAYNARD:         The regulation,

 2   Justice Breyer, in Trinko was relevant for two reasons

 3   that are not relevant to the question before the Court

 4   here.     First, the Court looked to the regulations, the

 5   regulatory duty, and made a decision whether the

 6   regulatory duty itself created an antitrust duty to

 7   deal, and the Court held it did not.

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Right.

 9                 MS. MAYNARD:         That holding is relevant here,

10   because it means that Petitioners' regulatory duty to

11   deal -- duty to deal does not create an antitrust duty

12   to deal.     But then the Court went on and looked at the

13   Court's existing antitrust jurisprudence, to decide

14   whether or not the Court's antitrust jurisprudence

15   recognized a duty to deal in that circumstance, and

16   concluded it did not.        It only looked to the regulation

17   that --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But it -- it -- it said

19   that the issue in that case was a duty to deal.                That's

20   not the issue in this case.              And it was about Aspen, and

21   whether you had a duty to deal.                And the Court said no,

22   you don't have a special duty to deal.

23                 Here we are dealing with quite a different

24   thing.     We are dealing with someone who has chosen to

25   deal in the past, and they are setting a price such that

 1   the plaintiff thinks he is being squeezed out.

 2              Now I can't find anything in Trinko that

 3   tells me I can't say, we're at least not worried about

 4   this where there is a regulator that you can go and

 5   complain to.   And if that's so, I don't have to reach

 6   the question of whether Judge Hand is right or wrong.

 7   What's wrong with what I just said?

 8              MS. MAYNARD:          Well, a couple of things.               To

 9   me, this case, as the case comes to the Court there is

10   no antitrust duty to deal.

11              And the -- the Petitioners here, the

12   district court determined weren't dealing voluntarily,

13   Justice Breyer; they were dealing as a result of

14   regulatory compulsion; but be that as it may, the -- the

15   important point from Trinko that is relevant here is

16   that a lawful monopolist without an antitrust duty to

17   deal has no duty to deal on any particular terms; and

18   Trinko specifically says that a lawful monopolist is

19   entitled to charge the monopoly price.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But --

21              MS. MAYNARD:          In that case --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, I didn't -- I didn't

23   want to interrupt your answer, go ahead -- just go

24   ahead.

25              MS. MAYNARD:          I'm sorry.             That takes the

 1   wholesale price and possibility of lowering that,

 2   Justice Breyer, off the table; and without the top

 3   pincer as it were, there is no price squeeze; and that

 4   leaves the Respondents with only a claim that the

 5   Petitioner's prices are too low.                And whenever a party

 6   claims that its rival's prices are too low for it to be

 7   able to compete, that triggers all of the concerns that

 8   this Court expressed in Brooke Group.

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Isn't it -- isn't it the

10   case that if in effect, we -- we refuse to come down

11   with a -- the kind of blanket answer, with a rule that

12   you want, that the parties here can go out -- the

13   complaining party here can go back to the FCC and say

14   there's something wrong with your wholesale pricing

15   order; look what's happening; and the FCC may adjust the

16   wholesale pricing order as a result of that.

17                 And if that is true, if they can do that,

18   and the FCC can act, isn't that a good reason for us not

19   to be developing new antitrust doctrine, if there is no

20   need of it?

21                 MS. MAYNARD:        Well, the government's view is

22   that the current antitrust doctrine already forecloses

23   this claim for the reasons that I was explaining.               Now

24   if the Court were going to consider this as whether were

25   you going to reach out and extend the antitrust law --

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, you're certainly

 2   asking us to -- at the very least -- to clarify the

 3   significance of Alcoa.      You're -- you are asking for an

 4   articulation of something -- of the significance of

 5   Alcoa today, which we have not done.                   So in that sense

 6   you are asking for something more than we've got on the

 7   books now; and my question is, if the agency in effect

 8   can deal with -- with -- with what the -- the monopolist

 9   is concerned with, and what the entrant is concerned

10   with, why do we have to take -- why is it wise for us to

11   take the step of making or clarifying new antitrust law?

12              MS. MAYNARD:         Well, the -- the Respondents

13   here were attempting to press, and the Ninth Circuit has

14   allowed them to go forward on, a treble damages claim

15   where they seek $40 million under a pure margin-based

16   price squeeze theory.     And in the government's view,

17   that -- such a rule would protect only competitors, and

18   doesn't allege any harm to the competitive process,

19   which section 2 requires.

20              Whether or not the FCC has regulatory

21   authority or not over the basic question -- over its own

22   issues -- isn't relevant to the antitrust question

23   before the Court here, which is, does the Court's

24   current antitrust jurisprudence foreclose such a pure

25   margin-based price squeeze.

 1               And the government is not saying that there

 2   might not be some exclusionary conduct, Justice Breyer,

 3   that could someday be alleged, if there was an attempt

 4   say, to claim an attempt of the upstream market, as you

 5   were positing.   That's not the claim here, nor in most

 6   price squeeze claims of which I'm aware; the claim is

 7   that they are attempting to monopolize the downstream

 8   market.   The government does not mean to foreclose; at

 9   this point it has recognized there are myriad ways in

10   which companies can engage in exclusionary conduct.        So

11   the government's position is a narrow one, which is that

12   a pure margin-based price squeeze, in the absence of a

13   duty to deal -- that is, this person who is dealing with

14   me is -- is charging me too much, so that I can't

15   compete against it at retail -- that is nothing more

16   than proof that they can't compete.

17               That doesn't show any harm to the

18   competitive process, which is what this Court has

19   repeatedly held is required for liability under section

20   2, and for good reason.        And Justice Souter, in response

21   to your question, the government is not saying that it

22   is not plausible that there isn't some anticompetitive

23   conduct that will go unchecked as a result of such a

24   rule, but the Court's analysis in Brooke Group is the

25   proper one, which is that ultimately what you will be

 1   doing is telling a retail level competitor that it must

 2   raise its prices in order to prevent liability.

 3              That really isn't, as Mr. Panner said, worth

 4   the candle, and it creates the risk of chilling

 5   legitimate price cutting, and it puts the courts in the

 6   role, essentially, of being a regulator, maybe not just

 7   at one level, but at two.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            So you are saying in

 9   practical terms that if there is a squeeze, it's highly

10   unlikely it's going to be anything but a Brooke Group

11   kind of squeeze, and therefore it's --

12              MS. MAYNARD:         That if there is something

13   anticompetitive going on, that section 2 cares about --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

15              MS. MAYNARD:         -- they would need to allege

16   that the Petitioners' retail prices are below some

17   appropriate measure of the Petitioners' costs; and what

18   they want to do is essentially what Alcoa does, which is

19   why it's mistaken, is it attributes -- it would

20   attribute to Petitioners the wholesale price they are

21   willing to sell their upstream input to others, and what

22   Brooke Group makes clear is that the relevant cost is

23   the internal cost to the Petitioners.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If I could just ask some

 1   -- everything you said is applicable to a predatory

 2   price claim as well as a price squeeze?

 3                 MS. MAYNARD:         We believe that if they can

 4   allege the elements of a predatory pricing claim under

 5   Brooke Group, then they would still have that claim even

 6   in the absence of a duty to deal, and then labeling it a

 7   predatory price squeeze doesn't add anything.                    The court

 8   just clarified that there isn't a separate price squeeze

 9   liability.     But there would remain a predatory pricing

10   theory under Brooke Group if those allegations could be

11   met.

12                 Does that answer your question?

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.   Thank you,

14   counsel.

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18                 MR. BLECHER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20                 I don't have a white flag and I don't think

21   we particularly have given up, but let me start by

22   suggesting that you don't need to decide the totality of

23   Alcoa.     I think you need to vacate the decision of the

24   Ninth Circuit -- not because it's erroneous, but because

25   it's incomplete.     Just send the case back to the

 1   district court to consider Judge Gould's suggestion that

 2   we file an amended complaint.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I don't understand what

 4   you just said.   Judge Gould dissented.                 He said the

 5   Ninth Circuit majority was wrong.                And you're urging us

 6   to accept Judge Gould's position.

 7              MR. BLECHER:          Not -- yes.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How can we do that

 9   without saying that the majority was wrong?

10              MR. BLECHER:          There is a difference between

11   being wrong and being incomplete.                The Ninth Circuit

12   decision responded to a very narrow question certified

13   by the district judge, which was whether or not price

14   squeeze taken as a generic violation was subsumed or not

15   subsumed by the Trinko decision.               It answered that

16   question correctly; but in doing that, it did not

17   consider whether or not price squeeze survived -- the

18   living margin part of price squeezing survived Brooke.

19              And to that extent, Judge Gould picked up

20   the -- the -- the argument and said, in effect,

21   especially in a regulated industry where the wholesale

22   price is -- is regulated, the offense of price squeeze

23   becomes predatory pricing, just as in a primary

24   Robinson-Patman case, the offense becomes predatory

25   pricing.

 1               There is no more Robinson-Patman primary

 2   line law.   It's -- it's -- like it or not -- I'm not

 3   saying we like it; I'm not saying we agree with it, but

 4   the state of the law is that when you are challenging a

 5   monopolist price under section 2 of the Sherman Act,

 6   Brooke and its predecessors determine the legality of

 7   the conduct.   And that's -- and that's what we are

 8   recognizing here.

 9               Now, understand that when the issue was

10   framed to the Ninth Circuit, the district judge, in a

11   footnote, said he thought that they ought to consider

12   the Brooke issue, but he did not decide that question,

13   and he did not certify it.           So when the Ninth Circuit --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, you don't certify

15   questions; you certify orders.               And in the certification

16   of this order, I take it, your position was in support

17   of what the district court did and in support of what

18   the court of appeals did, correct?

19               MR. BLECHER:          Partly, Justice Kennedy.       What

20   -- in part what we said was --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You made -- you made --

22   you made an argument, or did you not, that is consistent

23   with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?

24               MR. BLECHER:          Well, I question whether

25   that's what they held.        I view what they did is answer a

 1   question:     "Does a pure price squeeze get subsumed by

 2   Trinko as it involves the question that we heard

 3   articulated, the duty to deal?"                Now --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Was the court of appeals'

 5   decision consistent with the argument that you made to

 6   the court of appeals?

 7                 MR. BLECHER:         It is consistent, but it

 8   didn't say, we endorse Alcoa, and it didn't say we

 9   require a -- a -- predatory pricing.                       It was silent on

10   the elements of the offense of a price squeeze.                       It

11   answered this very narrow question:                       Does price squeeze

12   generically -- is it an existing kind of antitrust

13   violation that is not subsumed by the Trinko rule?

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, I am

15   confused --

16                 MR. BLECHER:         That's all that was decided.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I am confused about

18   what you mean when you say "the price squeeze claim."

19                 MR. BLECHER:         A non-predatory --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is that any

21   different -- is that any different than a Brooke Group

22   claim?

 4   prices --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- somehow violate

 7   Brooke Group?

 8                MR. BLECHER:          I am very content to go back

 9   to file an amended complaint purely under Brooke for

10   this no games --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And you -- you agree

12   that that requires --

13                MR. BLECHER:          We would --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That requires

15   below-cost retail pricing?

16                MR. BLECHER:          Yes.       We have below-cost

17   pricing.    I have no concern about that, because, unlike

18   what Mr. Panner told you, this is not proxy pricing.

19   This is a case in which AT&T is mandated by the FCC to

20   sell the DSL transfer to itself, to its own affiliate

21   and to outside independent companies like the plaintiffs

22   at the same price.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is the wholesale

24   price claim that the Ninth Circuit looked at in -- in

25   the case below, in the decision below, a necessary or

 1   significant or partial element of your Brooke Group

 2   claim, or is it totally irrelevant?

 3              MR. BLECHER:         More or less irrelevant.          Only

 4   -- it only sets the benchmark for the costs that the

 5   retail affiliate is selling below.                There -- there is no

 6   question the retail affiliate, in many of the time

 7   periods covered by the complaint, sold below -- just the

 8   DSL transport; and in addition to that, they threw in a

 9   modem, installation, and online services.                So, if you

10   put those into the cost bundle, they will be below cost

11   for the -- substantially the entire damage period that

12   we are complaining about; and --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is the first -- is the

14   first time that you indicated that you were in agreement

15   with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you

16   filed here in this Court?

17              MR. BLECHER:         Yes, directly, but we did

18   have --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it --

20              MR. BLECHER:         -- a predatory pricing --

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- it seems to me that, in

22   that instance, you seriously prejudiced the Petitioners

23   here, and that that should be weighed heavily against

24   you when you ask to -- for permission to amend your

 3   there have been costs and time --

 4                 MR. BLECHER:        See, see-- Justice Kennedy,

 5   you granted certiorari and agreed to review a decision

 6   that was essentially moot, because the complaint that

 7   you are talking about in this case has been superseded.

 8   Judge Wilson said it was superseded by a complaint

 9   charging predatory pricing, and he said, generously

10   construed, you have pled predatory pricing, and let's go

11   forward.

12                 Judge Gould said he didn't think the

13   complaint under Twombly's standard which intervened

14   satisfied the Brooke standard; And so he said --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I guess it

16   would have been nice if you thought the case was

17   essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert

18   opposition.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You didn't argue

21   that the decision below was essentially moot in your

22   opposition to certiorari here.

23                 MR. BLECHER:        In -- in the opposition,

24   that's correct.

 1   the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so

 2   you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.

 3                MR. BLECHER:          Well, I think what you are

 4   overlooking, though, is when we went to the Ninth

 5   Circuit, we endorsed Judge Wilson's suggestion that they

 6   decide the Brooke issue, so that, when we went back, we

 7   would have guidance as to what the appropriate standard

 8   was.   They elected not to deal with either Alcoa or

 9   Brooke.   They just decided the very narrow question he

10   certified.

11                In the Ninth Circuit, AT&T said, to the

12   Ninth Circuit, don't reach the Brooke issue; you don't

13   need to reach the Brooke issue to decide this case, even

14   though the complaint you are ruling on has been

15   superseded by an allegation in an amended complaint that

16   states a Brooke violation, or purported to or attempted

17   to state a Brooke violation.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:             So can we write this

19   following, we say:      In the district court, as of this

20   moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price

21   squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit.

22   There is a complaint that alleges a price theory under

23   Brooke -- a predatory pricing under Brooke Group.                 That

24   is what is there.     Nothing else is there.              Therefore,

25   that issue which the Ninth Circuit decided has no

 1   bearing on this case.       We therefore vacate their

 2   decision, leaving it up to the district court to proceed

 3   as it believes appropriate under the law with the Brooke

 4   Group claim?

 5              MR. BLECHER:           I think --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:              Is that a possible thing to

 7   say?

 8              MR. BLECHER:           And --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes or no, please.

10              MR. BLECHER:           It avoids the need to --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:              Is it, yes, we could do

12   that, or no --

13              MR. BLECHER:           Yes.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes we can?

15              MR. BLECHER:           Yes, you can.          That's what

16   we're suggesting.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:              Isn't it --

20              MR. BLECHER:           -- don't need to reach Alcoa

21   here, because the Ninth Circuit did not endorse Alcoa.

22   It just didn't reach that question.

 1              MR. BLECHER:            It was allowed.

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Yes, it was?

 3              MR. BLECHER:            Judge Wilson ruled that it

 4   was, a, quote, "generously construed," we stated a

 5   Brooke claim, and he would review it again at summary

 6   judgment stage.   Judge Gould disagreed with that, and he

 7   said, if you want to state a Brooke claim, you should go

 8   back and amend the complaint and do it.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Justice Breyer's

10   draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below.

11   Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the

12   price squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group

13   claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong.                       You don't just

14   throw it out and let everybody go home.                       You say whether

15   it was right or wrong.         And if you are saying it's

16   wrong, we would reverse.

17              MR. BLECHER:            That's certainly as an option,

18   but I think it would be more appropriate to vacate it

19   because I don't consider that they did a direct frontal

20   assault on Brooke.      They didn't consider Brooke because

21   AT&T suggested that they didn't need to read it.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                The Ninth Circuit had a

23   precedent that it thought it was following.                       Was it

24   Anaheim?

25              MR. BLECHER:            Yes.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So isn't it important

 2   that if you think that they were wrong and we agree with

 3   you, that we get -- not just vacate but say you were

 4   wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you

 5   were wrong in Anaheim.         And then the Ninth Circuit will

 6   not follow those decisions anymore.

 7                 MR. BLECHER:         Well, that's if you want to

 8   approach the rules and decide that there can only be a

 9   price squeeze claim if the price is predatory.                   You may

10   want to get there.      I'm saying you don't need to get

11   there here.

12                 You could simply say the Ninth Circuit

13   decision, I think, correctly decided the very narrow

14   question that was presented by the certification order.

15   They abided AT&T's suggestion not to go outside that

16   order, and, therefore, their decision can be viewed as

17   incomplete because they didn't go on to discuss what the

18   elements of a price squeeze claim were.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You are saying we

20   don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke

21   Group predatory pricing claim will say that the prices

22   here were below cost?

23                 MR. BLECHER:         Correct.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So we don't have to

25   consider, I guess, what I thought we had to consider --

 1                MR. BLECHER:          This is not a case where we

 2   are confronting you with the necessity of the settings

 3   or the vitality of Alcoa.            You --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And you are not

 5   going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on

 6   remand?

 7                MR. BLECHER:          I am going to file an amended

 8   complaint that will be limited entirely to the Brooke

 9   predatory pricing.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Which you understand

11   to require that the retail prices be below cost?

12                MR. BLECHER:          And we are very comfortable

13   with that.   The answer is yes, and we are comfortable

14   with that.   But we haven't given up, and we live to

15   fight another day on another field.

16                JUSTICE ALITO:           But if we follow your

17   proposal, then, you could, in a case filed next week or

18   the week after we decide the case, assert exactly the

19   same claim that you asserted here originally, and that

20   would be good law in the Ninth Circuit?

21                MR. BLECHER:          The answer to that,

22   Justice Alito, I think you can remand it --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:           I don't mean in this case.

24   I mean in another case.

25                MR. BLECHER:          Oh, we could raise that, and

 1   the Ninth Circuit --

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Either you or anybody else

 3   in the Ninth Circuit?

 4                MR. BLECHER:         I think if you abide my idea

 5   how to deal with this, the issue of Alcoa's vitality

 6   would remain open to be decided in another case on

 7   another day.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            If we vacate, you would be

 9   in favor of vacating their decision?

10                MR. BLECHER:         Yes, because a vacation can

11   rest on grounds that the Ninth Circuit did not reach the

12   issue.   They said, we are prepared to abide Judge

13   Gould's view that, in a regulated industry, we can only

14   have a, quote, "price squeeze" if the price is

15   predatory.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But the reason you

17   think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit

18   didn't decide the question, but because you are willing

19   not to press it?

20                MR. BLECHER:         No.      I don't think they

21   decided the Alcoa question.             That's the way I read the

22   decision.    Because I know what was certified.                I know

23   what they said.    They responded only to a very narrow

24   question, and AT&T said don't venture beyond that.

25   Don't --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So, I guess -- I

 2   guess that's where we are about to go.                    But in answer to

 3   Justice Alito's question, if you think the Ninth Circuit

 4   was wrong and don't want to see those claims raised

 5   again, we need to address the merits and reverse?

 6              MR. BLECHER:            Or you can simply say that the

 7   case is remanded, the district court may decide the

 8   propriety of an amended complaint, except that the

 9   amended complaint cannot state a non-predatory price

10   squeeze claim.    We are prepared to live with that.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

12              MR. BLECHER:            Thank you.

15            ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ANTITRUST

17                    SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

18              MR. BRUNELL:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20              We think the proper disposition of this case

21   is to vacate the decision below and to remand and let

22   the district court decide whether the complaint should

23   be amended or not.      Vacating the judgment would amount

24   to a dismissal with prejudice of the price squeeze

25   claim, and, therefore, this Court would have nothing to

 1   decide.

 2               The Court doesn't need to reach out to

 3   decide the vitality of Alcoa, the question of which is

 4   not even presented by the question raised in the cert

 5   petition.   And there are many reasons why -- and I am

 6   happy to address why Alcoa should remain good law, if

 7   the Court wishes to get into that.                 However, we don't

 8   think it's necessary.

 9               On the specific issue here, if the Court

10   decides not to vacate the judgment below and wants to

11   examine the correctness of the Ninth Circuit judgment,

12   the specific issue of whether the absence of a duty to

13   deal thereby dooms any kind of claim -- a price squeeze

14   claim or really any other type of antitrust claim,

15   including a predatory pricing claim, if the regulators

16   can address the issue.

17               We think that is -- that is the case, that

18   that is the incorrect view of the law, and indeed, to

19   some extent we agree with the Solicitor General that the

20   existence of a regulatory remedy is not sufficient to

21   bar a price-squeeze claim because there is no exhaustion

22   requirement under the antitrust laws, and this Court's

23   decision in Trinko, as the Solicitor General suggested

24   when it looked at the regulatory remedies, that was with

25   respect to expanding section 2 enforcement and not with


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   respect to traditional antitrust claims, which Alcoa

 2   certainly is.

 3                Now, with respect to the issue of the duty

 4   to deal.    What does that mean, that there's no duty to

 5   deal?    In our view --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that means

 7   they don't have to deal.          They don't have to sell you

 8   the stuff if they don't want to.

 9                MR. BRUNELL:         In our view, it means that a

10   court has found that there's no liability in the event

11   of a refusal to deal, which is what Trinko did.                  And one

12   has to ask whether the rationale for finding no

13   liability for refusal to deal also applies to a

14   predatory -- excuse me, a price squeeze claim.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You mean a Brooke

16   Group retail price squeeze claim?

17                MR. BRUNELL:         No, I mean a traditional price

18   squeeze claim.    That doesn't have to meet the Brooke

19   Group standard.    Mr. Panner suggested --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this:       I'm not

21   familiar on this point.         Apart from Alcoa, what are the

22   cases applying a traditional price squeeze claim?

23                MR. BRUNELL:         We've listed them in our

24   brief.   I believe that 9 out of the 12 circuits, not

25   including the Federal Circuit, have recognized an


                                        43

 1   Alcoa-type price squeeze claim.                And in the other three

 2   circuits, district courts -- in each of the other three

 3   circuits, district courts have recognized an Alcoa-type

 4   claim.

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Do you agree with your

 6   opponent's submission that antitrust scholars uniformly

 7   agree that the Alcoa case was incorrectly decided?

 8              MR. BRUNELL:            No, I do not agree with that.

 9   And, indeed, our brief cites an eminent professor, John

10   Vickers at Oxford, an economist who supports a

11   traditional Alcoa-type claim, that is a claim based on

12   what we've call the transfer price test, where one looks

13   at the margin between the retail and wholesale prices

14   and asks whether that is sufficient to cover the

15   monopolist's downstream costs.                Professor Vickers --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Does he support --

17              MR. BRUNELL:            Pardon me?

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               I thought somebody else was

19   -- does he support recognition of that claim in the

20   circumstances in which there was regulatory involvement

21   like the FCC here?

22              MR. BRUNELL:            I believe he does, Your Honor.

23   I believe the European Commission also recognizes such a

24   claim in the presence of regulation.                      I believe the

25   Federal Trade Commission recognizes such a claim.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why do we need to?

 2              MR. BRUNELL:            Why do we need to?           Because

 3   a -- you mean in the absence why can't regulation handle

 4   this or why do we worry about the anticompetitive

 5   effects of a price squeeze?

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why can't regulation handle

 7   it?

 8              MR. BRUNELL:            Well, in this case, regulation

 9   -- simply the -- the regulation that is referred to is

10   simply the prospect of the complainant going to the

11   Federal Communications Commission and simply asking for

12   some kind of post hoc relief, as opposed to a situation

13   as in Town of Concord or in Trinko where the regulation

14   at issue was quite extensive.               All of the conduct at

15   issue in Trinko was heavily regulated.                    And in this

16   case, we have wholesale rates that are lightly regulated

17   and retail rates that are completely unregulated.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:               So why couldn't you -- why

19   wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other

20   regulator and say:      Regulator, they are selling me this

21   widget or line at a dollar.              All right.        That's

22   considerably higher than their costs of producing it.

23   And, in addition to that, they sell the same service I

24   do for $1.20, even though it costs me or would cost any

25   human being at least 60 cents to provide that added


                                         45

 1   service.   So we are asking you to tell them that if they

 2   continue to sell it at $1.20, they lower their wholesale

 3   price to us so that we only have to pay at most 80

 4   cents, or whatever the right number is there.

 5                 I mean, they have someone to complain to.

 6   They could make the same complaint.                      I'm quite surprised

 7   that Vickers has written that under the circumstances I

 8   have outlined that there is a valid price squeeze

 9   antitrust claim or that the British Commission has held

10   that.

11                 I would be very interested to know the

12   citation of that.    Because he may have done.                   I don't

13   read everything.

14                 MR. BRUNELL:        The European commission --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm not saying the European

16   Commission.    They have done all kinds of things.                   I am

17   saying the -- the --

18                 (Laughter.)

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I am saying the British

20   Monopolies or Restricted Practices Commission of which

21   Vickers was the head.       I agree with you that he is very

22   knowledgeable, but I would be surprised if he had

23   written contrary to what I just said in that example.

24   But I am often surprised and willing to read it.

25                 MR. BRUNELL:        The question of the

 1   relationship between the regulatory authority to address

 2   a question and whether an antitrust claim exists is

 3   normally decided on the basis of implied antitrust

 4   immunity.    The mere existence of a regulatory remedy is

 5   insufficient under this Court's precedent in Credit

 6   Suisse, certainly, for -- for having implied immunity.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, would you say that

 8   absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to

 9   deal here?

10                MR. BRUNELL:         Absent the regulatory regime,

11   would there be a duty to deal?               Would the Court have

12   found -- in this case, the Petitioners may well have

13   voluntarily dealt with the Respondents --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No.      No.    My question was:

15   Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws?

16   Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a

17   duty to deal is because of the regulation.                   So, you use

18   the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then

19   you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the

20   price.   And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.

21                MR. BRUNELL:         Whether there is a duty to

22   deal can only be answered by asking whether a violation

23   -- a refusal to deal would constitute an antitrust

24   violation.   And in this case, had -- had there been no

25   required dealing and, therefore, no dealing whatsoever,


                                        47
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then the issue of antitrust duty to deal would be

 2   totally academic.     Furthermore --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's still seems to me

 4   that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to

 5   establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal.                And

 6   You rely on the regulation that far, but you don't want

 7   to go to the regulators to -- to argue about the price.

 8   You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust

 9   law second.

10                 Why can't we just look at this case as

11   purely antitrust; and then, as Justice Breyer said, if

12   it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.

13                 MR. BRUNELL:        Well, the mere fact that there

14   is a regulatory duty to deal does not completely oust

15   antitrust.    Otherwise, there would be no predatory-

16   pricing claim.

17                 The petitioner -- the -- the respondent

18   injured by a predatory-pricing claim could also go to

19   the FCC, presumably.       And we don't -- and no one is

20   contending that the -- that a predatory-pricing claim

21   wouldn't lie and --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would that lie here first?

23   I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think

24   that the regulatory agency would be acting properly if

25   it prescribed a price that was predatory or allowed the


                                        48

 1   charge of a price that was predatory, would you?

 2              MR. BRUNELL:            No.      I -- I don't think the

 3   regulators would -- would permit predatory pricing.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:               They wouldn't permit it.

 5   Then is there -- is there no such thing as primary

 6   agency responsibility to take care of that problem

 7   rather than rushing into a court and take care of it

 8   through the -- through the Sherman Act?

 9              MR. BRUNELL:            There certainly is the

10   doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which arises typically

11   when the agency is already dealing with a problem and

12   not --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, they are dealing with

14   the problem there.      They are decreeing the price that

15   could be charged, aren't they?                Don't they have to

16   approve the pricing?

17              MR. BRUNELL:            They certainly don't approve

18   the retail pricing, no.          The retail pricing in this case

19   is entirely unregulated.           It purports to be in a

20   competitive market.

21              But let me back up for one second.                 The --

22   the regulatory regime here is quite different from the

23   one in Trinko.   In -- in Trinko you had a regulatory

24   duty that essentially required the monopolist to

25   cooperate with its rivals in the monopoly market in


                                         49

 1   order to dismantle the monopoly.

 2              In this case you have a regulation that is

 3   designed to ensure that the monopolist does not extend

 4   its monopoly power into unregulated competitive markets.

 5   And so the -- surely, the regulators focus -- can focus

 6   on the wholesale rates and ensure in this case that the

 7   rate that the monopolist charges itself is the same as

 8   the rate it charges its rivals with the object of

 9   ensuring a competitive downstream market.

10              But that doesn't mean that that should oust

11   antitrust law.     The regulators may, in fact, think that

12   it's important to have antitrust law available to

13   enforce claims in order for them to cut back on their

14   regulations.     And indeed, in this case, when the -- when

15   AT&T sought to de-tariff its wholesale offering, the

16   regulators referred to the fact that one of the

17   justifications for de-tariffing would be that the

18   antitrust laws would be available in case there were a

19   problem.

20              So the -- the relationship between antitrust

21   and regulation is symbiotic and complementary.            And we

22   would suggest that in this case the mere fact that the

23   district court determined that the complaint of

24   insufficient cooperation by the Petitioner in this case

25   did not state a claim for refusal to deal shouldn't

 1   preclude a -- a price-squeeze claim any more than it

 2   should preclude a predatory pricing claim, which the

 3   government and the Petitioners seem to concede would

 4   still lie.

 5                 Now, finally, this point about an

 6   over-deterrence and whether there is any evidence that

 7   any monopolist at any time has ever been deterred from

 8   engaging in legitimate retail price-cutting or efficient

 9   vertical integration, I would submit that there is

10   absolutely no evidence anywhere in the literature, no

11   empirical evidence, that there is a problem of over-

12   deterrence.

13                 And had there been a problem over the last

14   63 years that Alcoa has existed, one would think it

15   wouldn't be too hard to find evidence of that.           There is

16   no evidence.

17                 Furthermore, in Brooke Group the Court did

18   not simply rely on the risk of over-deterrence as a

19   basis for holding that above-cost price-cutting was not

20   actionable.    In Brooke Group it relied on two factors:

21   The fact -- the fear that making above-cost

22   price-cutting illegal would deter legitimate

23   price-cutting, but also the fact that above-cost

24   price-cutting would not eliminate equally efficient

25   rivals.   Any equally efficient rival could meet an

 1   above-cost price.     The price squeeze doctrine under the

 2   transfer price test protects equally efficient

 3   downstream rivals.

 4                So that issue is quite different.                  The

 5   deterrence issue is -- is quite different when you --

 6   when have a price squeeze.            Furthermore, the notion that

 7   a monopolist would respond to a price squeeze complaint

 8   -- thank you, Your Honors.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You can finish your

10   sentence there.

11                MR. BRUNELL:          The notion that they would

12   respond to a price squeeze complaint by raising their

13   retail price, rather than lowering their wholesale

14   price, I would submit is certainly as belied by the

15   facts of the Alcoa case which in the district court

16   reflect that when the government started looking into

17   the price squeeze and the price squeeze was ended, it

18   was ended voluntarily by Alcoa lowering its wholesale

19   price, not raising its retail price.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

21                Now, Mr. Panner, you have two minutes

22   remaining.

23                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER

24                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

25                MR. PANNER:         I have two points I would like


                                         52
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to make.   First of all, I think, in agreement with

 2   Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy, and others, I do

 3   think that the presence of a regulatory remedy here is a

 4   critical factor arguing in favor of reversal of the

 5   Ninth Circuit's decision.

 6               The second point that I really want to make

 7   is the importance of clear rules.                In the antitrust

 8   context where we are talking about a system of rules

 9   that is going to govern decisionmaking by businesses

10   where most of those decisions are never going to lead to

11   litigation or are never going to come before the courts,

12   it is critically important to have clear rules that

13   avoid deterring beneficial conduct, that avoid having

14   the rules themselves harm consumers.

15               I think that was the point that

16   Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg were getting at in

17   the questioning.   It is critical to adopt a decision on

18   the merits explaining why the Ninth Circuit's price

19   squeeze decision -- not just here, but in the prior

20   decision, in City of Anaheim -- is incorrect and

21   inconsistent with this Court's precedents.

22               And, more broadly, it is critical to have a

23   clear rule stating that in the absence of a duty to

24   deal, an allegation of price squeeze, it doesn't stay a

25   claim.


                                       53

 1              And I think that it's also -- would be very

 2   valuable to say that the complaint that was before the

 3   district court -- and the amended complaint at a minimum

 4   is supplying one version of the facts that might try to

 5   be elaborated -- fail to state a claim under this

 6   Court's precedents.     The clear gravamen of

 7   that complaint, indeed the explicit gravamen of that

 8   complaint, was that the margin between the wholesale

 9   price and retail price was insufficient.                 And --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

11              The case is now submitted.

12              (Wherepon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the

13   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
