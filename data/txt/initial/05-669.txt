 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 7                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8            MR. LAMKEN:       Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10            Section 2415(a) established a limitations period

11   for every action for money damages by the Government which

12   is founded on any contract.            That provision, by its terms,

13   applies to every contract action, every adversary

14   adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach,

15   whether pursued before a court or an agency.

16            The contention that every action encompasses

17   only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for

18   three reasons.     First, it is inconsistent with the broad

19   language that Congress used.              It is inconsistent with the

20   statutory structure, in that it renders another provision,

21   the exception for administrative offset, totally

22   superfluous.     It also creates an irrationality in the

23   hierarchy of the Government's claims.              Finally, it robs

24   Section 2415(a) of its intended effect.

25            Turning to the text, Congress


                                       3

 1   and agencies   regularly use the term "action" to refer to

 2   adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and

 3   before the judiciary.      The term --

 4            JUSTICE SOUTER:          What --

 5            MR. LAMKEN:       -- denotes --

 6            JUSTICE SOUTER:          May I ask you, on that point --

 7   I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your

 8   authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a

 9   verbal distinction made between actions for money damages,

10   and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as

11   "administrative proceedings" in providing for the 1-year

12   supplementary rule.     Doesn't the statute, in effect, say,

13   "We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly --

14   what possibly might be included as an administrative

15   proceeding"?   If they had wanted an administrative

16   proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money

17   damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to

18   say in -- to refer, instead of to "administrative

19   proceedings," to "administrative actions"?

20            MR. LAMKEN:       Well, in fact, the -- it refers to

21   "administrative proceedings required by contract or law."

22   And that clause applies in the particular circumstance

23   where a law or a contract requires some sort of

24   administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the

25   action for money damages.         So, if you can bring your

 1   money-damages action without any prior administrative

 2   proceeding, regardless of where you bring --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:      I think your point has to be

 4   that there are administrative proceedings that are not

 5   actions.

 6              MR. LAMKEN:   That is absolutely correct.

 7   Nonadversarial administrative proceedings would,

 8   themselves, not be actions.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:      Right.

10              MR. LAMKEN:   And they also wouldn't be money-

11   damages actions.   So, the distinction the statute draws is

12   not between money-damages actions in court and money-

13   damages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages

14   actions, wherever brought, and the administrative

15   proceedings that have to be brought as a condition

16   precedent.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:      You contend that what commenced

18   the action here was the order demanding payment.

19              MR. LAMKEN:   That is correct.        That is the --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:      That's a very weird

21   commencement of an action, where what then follows is what

22   is referred to as an "appeal," within the agency.

23              MR. LAMKEN:   For historical reasons, the

24   denominations are quite strange, but for Grisa, quoted --

25   on subsections 1702 and 1724, quoted on pages 5 and 6 of


                                     5

 1   our reply brief, specifically state that the order to pay

 2   commences the proceedings.         And so, since that is the --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Which says that?

 4               MR. LAMKEN:    It's on page 5-6 of our brief.

 5   It's Section 1702 of our --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:       What page of your brief?

 7               MR. LAMKEN:    5 and 6 of the reply brief.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Of the reply.

 9               MR. LAMKEN:    Yes.        And it's 13 U.S.C. 1724, and

10   it talks -- or it defines the "demand" as the order to

11   pay.   And then, the definitional provisions, in turn --

12   when they're talking about what commences the action, it

13   says that the order to pay "commences" the action.           And so

14   --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:       I'm not finding it.    Where is

16   it, again?

17               MR. LAMKEN:    Page 6 of the reply, Your Honor,

18   very top.     The citation says "13 U.S.C. 1724(b), emphasis

19   added."     It defines "demand" to include an order to pay

20   issued by the Secretary.        And, in the next line down, we

21   say, "For Grisa thus recognizes that the so-call order to

22   pay, far from concluding the action, in fact, commences

23   it," because the statute of limitations prepared -- uses

24   the word "commenced" to describe what the action -- the

25   order to pay does.

 1            JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why is -- why doesn't it make

 2   much more sense -- as I understand the proceeding, this

 3   order doesn't come out of the blue.               As required, there

 4   has to be a letter to the -- to the payee saying, "We

 5   think -- we think you owe so much money."               He is allowed

 6   to respond, right?

 7            MR. LAMKEN:      That --

 8            JUSTICE SCALIA:         And then, after considering the

 9   response, the order issues.           Now, I would consider that a

10   -- you know, an -- that sounds to me like a complaint and

11   an opportunity to respond to it.            And then, finally, the

12   first decision of the agency, which is then appealed --

13   and CFR provides for an -- what he calls an appeal.              And

14   it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the

15   opinion on the appeal.

16            MR. LAMKEN:      In fact, that process, which isn't

17   even mentioned in the regulations, doesn't have any legal

18   operative effect.    It's more like a demand letter.            If the

19   lessee doesn't respond to the letter, he doesn't waive any

20   of his rights.   If the Government fails to include a claim

21   in its demand letter, in the -- well, in the audit letter

22   -- it doesn't waive any of its rights.              The --

23            JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, it doesn't --

24            MR. LAMKEN:      -- first document --

25            JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- waive it, but it can't issue

 1   the order without having issued the letter first, giving --

 2            MR. LAMKEN:     I --

 3            JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- giving the party an

 4   opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.

 5            MR. LAMKEN:     Well, in fact, there's nothing in

 6   the regulations -- and I think the Solicitor General would

 7   concede -- that actually requires this informal process.

 8   It happens to be typically done.           And the SG uses the word

 9   "typically" in the brief.       But there's nothing that

10   requires it.   And if you don't respond, there are no

11   consequences to failure to respond.

12            JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is there anything that requires

13   the order?

14            MR. LAMKEN:     The -- anything that requires the

15   Secretary to proceed by order?

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.

17            MR. LAMKEN:     That is the Secretary's traditional

18   way of doing things --

19            JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well --

20            MR. LAMKEN:     -- yes, but --

21            JUSTICE SCALIA:        So, you could say the same for

22   the other.

23            MR. LAMKEN:     Oh, but it -- but there is no

24   liability if the order fails to issue.           The order, if it

25   were the first salvo, you still would be required to

 1   respond.     And so, your failure to respond is very much a

 2   default.     The failure to respond to the letter, the audit

 3   letter, has no legal operative effect --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:        You don't -- you don't -- but

 5   you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from

 6   the order.

 7              MR. LAMKEN:     That's correct.           You file a --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:        It seems to me crazy to call

 9   that order a complaint.        I -- even if I grant your other

10   argument, that an administrative proceeding can be

11   commenced by a complaint -- or that the term "complaint"

12   can apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think

13   that what you've hung your hat on here -- namely, the

14   order -- seems to    me to fit that description.

15              MR. LAMKEN:     Well, Justice Scalia, it is the

16   first document, which is recognized in the regulations,

17   which provides the lessor of the notice of claims against

18   it, the first one that's required by the regulations in

19   order to commence the proceedings.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:        You mean --

21              MR. LAMKEN:     It's recognized --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:        -- the regulations don't refer

23   to the initial letter?

24              MR. LAMKEN:     No.     They don't -- the regulations

25   don't require this informal process.               It's typically done

 1   --

 2            JUSTICE SOUTER:       So, they literally could start,

 3   absolutely out of the blue, by issuing the order?

 4            MR. LAMKEN:    I think that's correct.        That is

 5   the way that it could be done.         There's an informal

 6   process that's typically followed; but you could ignore

 7   it, and there's no legal operative effect.         So, that --

 8            JUSTICE SCALIA:       I doubt whether --

 9            MR. LAMKEN:    -- informal process --

10            JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- that would --

11            MR. LAMKEN:    -- can't be a complaint.

12            JUSTICE SCALIA:       I doubt whether that would

13   conform with the Administrative Procedure Act.        I mean,

14   either -- even at the first level of agency decision --

15            MR. LAMKEN:    Well --

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- it seems to me you have to

17   give the individual an opportunity to reply.

18            MR. LAMKEN:    Well, that is perhaps why the

19   agency tries this -- to do the informal process.        But, in

20   fact, it does not have legal operative effect.        There --

21   you could completely ignore that initial demand letter,

22   and say, "Sorry, Agency, I'm not responding."        The agency

23   then files its order.   And that's the first time you must

24   register your defenses, upon failure or forfeiture --

25            JUSTICE SCALIA:       Of course you can ignore it.

 1   That doesn't prove anything.              You could ignore an agency

 2   complaint, too --

 3             MR. LAMKEN:      Right.

 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- I mean, a formal complaint,

 5   in which case you'll be found liable.              What does --

 6             MR. LAMKEN:      That's the --

 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- the fact that you don't have

 8   to respond have to do with anything?

 9             MR. LAMKEN:      The legal consequences.          It's

10   exactly right, Justice Scalia.             If you don't respond to

11   the demand letter, there are no legal consequences.                If

12   you don't respond to the letter by filing what's called an

13   "appeal," you lose.     And so, it's just like a complaint;

14   you default if you fail to raise your defenses at that

15   point.   In addition, Section 2415 --

16             JUSTICE STEVENS:         And it's also, I assume, true

17   that the demand letter would not toll a statute.

18             MR. LAMKEN:      No, we don't believe a demand

19   letter would toll a statute, because it's not required by

20   --

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, you --

22             MR. LAMKEN:      -- by law.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- you'd win in this case even

24   if it did.   I don't think that the difference between the

25   initial letter giving you an opportunity to reply, and the

 1   -- what you call the "complaint," the               order -- that time

 2   period doesn't put you out of -- out of the permissible

 3   period.

 4              MR. LAMKEN:   Oh, I certainly hope --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:      Right.

 6              MR. LAMKEN:   -- hope not.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:      Yes.

 8              MR. LAMKEN:   But, in fact, Section 2415(f),

 9   which is on page 4 and 5 of the appendix to our brief,

10   makes it clear that whether something is denominated a

11   complaint or not does not determine whether or not it's

12   covered by the limitations period.               2415(f) is an

13   exception for counterclaims and offsets by the Government

14   where a private party brings an action against the

15   Government.   But counterclaims and offsets typically

16   aren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the

17   answer, they're submitted in the answer.               Therefore,

18   whether it's denominated an "order," an "answer," or

19   something else, doesn't control whether or not 2415

20   applies.   2415 applies to any action for money damages

21   founded on a contract, however you might denominate the

22   initial filing which commences the proceedings.                  In --

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Mr. Lamken, the point has

24   been made that there are many indications that what

25   Congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court.

 1   In addition to finding this provision solely in title 28,

 2   the judiciary code, and not in title 5, there's also, if

 3   you read the following provision, 2416, time for

 4   commencing actions brought by the United States.           And then

 5   it tells us the tolling periods.          And, in doing that, it

 6   refers twice to the "defendant," which is a term that's

 7   used in civil proceedings, not administrative proceedings.

 8            MR. LAMKEN:    Well, starting at 28 U.S.C., why

 9   it's there, it, in fact, applies both to administrative

10   agency actions and actions in courts.           And sometimes in 28

11   U.S.C. there are provisions that apply to both.          The

12   Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, is in 28 U.S.C., and

13   it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims.

14   People must file their claims before an agency first, and

15   then the agency can do administrative adjustment.           That's

16   entirely separate from the attorney general's ability to

17   compromise the claim once it's filed in court.

18            Section -- title 5 also contains things that

19   apply to courts and agencies -- the right to judicial

20   review of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's

21   necessary for those -- in addition to standards that

22   govern judicial review of agency actions.           Those were all

23   in title 5, but they actually apply to courts.          These --

24            JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, 2415(a), (i), we -- you,

25   you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial

 1   actions, can you?

 2              MR. LAMKEN:    Oh, no.        That's --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes.

 4              MR. LAMKEN:    -- actually completely --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:       And that's in --

 6              MR. LAMKEN:    -- superfluous.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- and that's in title 28.

 8              MR. LAMKEN:    And that's in -- yes, that's in

 9   title 28, as well.

10              And with respect to the term           "defendants,"

11   Justice Ginsburg, Congress has often used the term

12   "defendants" even in the context of administrative

13   actions.   The Stockyard and Packers Act of 1921 -- it's in

14   7 U.S.C. 210 -- actually talks about a complaint against a

15   defendant for damages, all adjudicated before the

16   Secretary of Agriculture, and that was 85 years ago.              It

17   seems a little late in the day now to debate whether one

18   can be a defendant, the person who defends before an

19   agency, as well as the defendant --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It's not the typical term

21   used in agency proceedings to designate the responding

22   party.

23              MR. LAMKEN:    Well, you can talk about the

24   "responding party," or the "defendant," but the term

25   "defendant" is sufficiently broad to include one who


                                     14

 1   defends or denies, and that would be a term -- and it's

 2   been used in the past, as long as 85 years ago -- to

 3   discuss the person who might be liable for damages in --

 4            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And the content --

 5            MR. LAMKEN:       -- an adversary --

 6            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- the content of the tolling

 7   provision, as well, seems geared -- seems geared to a

 8   civil lawsuit.     It talks about a person being outside the

 9   United States; therefore, they wouldn't be amenable to

10   service of process.

11            MR. LAMKEN:       That's certainly right.          These are

12   all things that would apply, we would expect, both to

13   a civil action in court and an administrative-agency

14   action, as well.     They may work better for one or

15   the other in different particular circumstances, but they

16   are all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both

17   circumstances.     And the one the Government, in the

18   administrative context, would be most interested in would

19   be subsection C.     When the Government just doesn't know

20   the facts, or the Government reasonably couldn't know the

21   facts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it

22   reasonably could have known of the fact.           And that's just

23   as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be

24   in an action before a court.

25            In addition, the Government's contrary

 1   construction renders an entire provision superfluous.               And

 2   that is the one that Justice Scalia mentioned, Section

 3   2415(i), which is an exception for administrative offsets.

 4   That exception for administrative offsets would do no work

 5   at all if --

 6            JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't part of the

 7   original statute, was it?

 8            MR. LAMKEN:       No, that was added about 16 years

 9   later, Your Honor.     And it was added, but it clarifies the

10   scope of the statute.      And, as this Court admitted in --

11   pointed out in cases like Fausto and LaFranca, the later

12   amendment to a statute can clarify its meaning; and,

13   indeed, statutes are ordinarily read, once amended, as if

14   they existed in their amended form from the offset.

15            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought that (i) was added

16   because it's -- for a very specific reason, that there was

17   a debate between the Department of Justice and -- I forgot

18   the other agency --

19            MR. LAMKEN:       The Comptroller, Your Honor.

20            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Yes.

21            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- yes -- about whether an

22   offset would be subject to the time limit.

23            MR. LAMKEN:       That's exactly right.        And Congress

24   resolved that debate by providing an exception for

25   administrative offsets, and no other exception for any --

 1            JUSTICE SCALIA:         What --

 2            MR. LAMKEN:      -- sort of administrative

 3   proceeding.   And that raises the strong inference that, in

 4   fact, this applies to administrative proceedings, and it

 5   simply doesn't apply to administrative offsets, because

 6   they're an exception.

 7            JUSTICE SCALIA:         They could have said -- if the

 8   other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to

 9   administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have

10   said the provisions of this section do not apply to

11   administrative proceedings --

12            MR. LAMKEN:      That's --

13            JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- which would have -- which

14   would have handled the offset --

15            MR. LAMKEN:      Yes.        It would have --

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- but would have been well

17   beyond the offset.    And the fact --

18            MR. LAMKEN:      That's exactly right.

19            JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- that they only focus on the

20   offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking

21   about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.

22            MR. LAMKEN:      I could not have said it better,

23   and I will not attempt to.        In fact, in addition, it

24   raises another anomaly in the statute, the Government's

25   contrary construction.      And that is, it creates sort of an

 1   irrationality in the hierarchy of claims for the

 2   Government.     Offensive judicial actions to extract money

 3   from private individuals must be brought within 6 years.

 4   Administrative offsets for the Government to try and avoid

 5   paying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under

 6   the administrative offset provision that was enacted

 7   together with the exception in (i).                However, offensive

 8   administrative actions to extract money may be brought in

 9   perpetuity, forever.      It simply strains credulity to

10   believe that Congress, at the same time it was saying the

11   Government has only 10 years to assert administrative

12   offsets to avoid paying money, instead intended

13   administrative agencies to be able to extract money on

14   that very same claim --

15            JUSTICE SCALIA:          I can believe that they do --

16            MR. LAMKEN:       -- in perpetuity.

17            JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- I can -- I can believe that

18   they do that.

20            JUSTICE SCALIA:          But --

21            MR. LAMKEN:       Well, Justice --

22            JUSTICE SCALIA:          By mistake.        But I would not

23   assume a mistake unless it's very clear.

24            MR. LAMKEN:       I think that's exactly right,

25   Justice Scalia.    And that's, again, going back to Fausto,

 1   where there is a sensible hierarchy of claims, or a

 2   sensible hierarchy of preferences.              The Court doesn't

 3   ordinarily presume that Congress put in a structure that

 4   doesn't respect that ordinary hierarchy.              And the

 5   Government's construction here is inconsistent with the

 6   ordinary hierarchy which allows the Government to avoid

 7   making payment on more favorable terms; then the

 8   Government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from

 9   private individuals.

10            Finally, the Government's construction also

11   undermines the intended effect of the statute.             The effect

12   of statute -- the purpose of statutes of limitations --

13   and this one, in particular -- is to provide repose -- to

14   allow the individual to know that he will no longer

15   confront Government claims, to dispose of his documents,

16   and also to encourage the Government to be diligent in

17   pursuing its claims.     None of those purposes are achieved,

18   all of those purposes are defeated, if -- once the statute

19   of limitations period expires --

20            JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Mr. Lamken --

21            MR. LAMKEN:     Yes.

22            JUSTICE KENNEDY:       -- could we go back to Section

23   (i) for a second more?    Is it also possible to say that

24   there was this disagreement between the Department of

25   Justice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided


                                   19

 1   that the Comptroller General was right?             And, if that's

 2   true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's

 3   reading of the entire statute?

 4            MR. LAMKEN:       Well, if Congress had decided the

 5   Comptroller General is right, and had done that in

 6   subsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the

 7   way Justice Scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't

 8   apply to administrative claims at all.             What it did is, it

 9   said, "Ooh, this appears to apply to administrative claims

10   and the Comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are

11   important, so we will give a special statute of

12   limitations period in 31 U.S.C. for those, and exempt them

13   from the more general statute of limitations period in

14   section 28 U.S.C. 2415."        So, I don't believe that it

15   should be read that way.        Is it frivolous to suggest that

16   that's the reading?     No, the Government --

 2   the Comptroller on this issue.          And Congress actually

 3   stepped into the fray and created an exception.          But it

 4   created a limited exception --

 5            JUSTICE STEVENS:        Okay.

 6            MR. LAMKEN:     -- an exception that applies only

 7   to one context, and that's administrative offsets.          And

 8   that certainly raises a very strong inference that, where

 9   there isn't such an exception, the statute applies to

10   administrative proceedings, more generally.

11            JUSTICE ALITO:       Isn't the most likely answer

12   that they just -- they saw a small problem, and they

13   rendered a decision on the small problem, and they didn't

14   think about it any further than that?

15            MR. LAMKEN:     Well, I have a hard time

16   psychoanalyzing Congress, because it's sort of a corporate

17   body, and I can't tell what Member of Member of Congress

18   is saying what.   But when the Court of these statutes, it

19   generally reads them -- and it, in fact, avoids, whenever

20   possible, superfluity.     And if this provision applies to

21   administrative proceedings from the outset, subsection (i)

22   is superfluous, it's -- does no work whatsoever.         And so,

23   the -- when Congress amended this statute, it certainly

24   clarified that, where there is no exception, this statute

25   applies to actions filed in administrative proceedings.

 5                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 6                      ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 7               MR. JOSEFFER:      Justice Stevens, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9               The presumption is that the Government is not

10   bound by a statute of limitations.                 And, when read as a

11   whole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption,

12   but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in

13   court.     There are several reasons for that.              First, the

14   ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer

15   to suits in court.     Second, the statute expressly

16   distinguishes between administrative proceedings and

17   actions.     Third the statute's located in the judicial

18   code.    Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are

19   inclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's

20   ordinary meaning.     And, fifth, even if some administrative

21   proceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would

22   not, because they do not involve a complaint.

23               Now, on the first of those points, the term

24   "action" ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in

25   court, which just is why, just 7 years ago, in West v.


                                      22

 1   Gibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term

 2   "action" often refers only to suits in court, and not to

 3   administrative proceedings.

 4            JUSTICE SCALIA:        It often does.      It often does.

 5   But it does not, universally.           And there are a number of

 6   instances cited by the Petitioner that -- where this Court

 7   and -- and statutes use the term in context where it

 8   clearly applies to administrative proceedings.

 9            MR. JOSEFFER:        Well --

10            JUSTICE SCALIA:        So, the question is, How -- you

11   know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to

12   administrative proceedings in this case?          And I find it

13   pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it

14   way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations

15   whatever for the Government in these cases.

16            MR. JOSEFFER:       Well, the structure of the law

17   here is that in those instances where Congress does

18   authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides

19   a context-specific administrative limitations period, such

20   as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all

21   of the contract claims the Government can pursue

22   administratively.   Congress specifically enacted a 6-year

23   limitations period for the submission of a claim to a

24   contracting officer.

25            In this unique context, however, Congress had


                                    23

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   very good reasons for not applying a limitations period

 2   until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996.                 The

 3   reason is that what Congress found here, in context of

 4   mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent

 5   commission, was that the companies were historically on an

 6   honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties

 7   of up to half a billion dollars annually.              So, what

 8   Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current

 9   and past lease accounts.        One of the committee reports

10   said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress

11   that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some

12   of those vast underpayments back from the companies.

13            Now, when we fast-forward to 1996 --

14            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Wait.

15            MR. JOSEFFER:         -- at that point --

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Excuse me.       And this was the

17   Congress that enacted what?

18            MR. JOSEFFER:         No, I -- agreed.        What I'm

19   referring to now is the Congress that enacted the mineral

20   leasing provisions.

21            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Oh.

22            MR. JOSEFFER:         -- which is not a good --

23            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Which is not what we're talking

24   about here.

25            MR. JOSEFFER:         No, but -- well, we are, because

 1   the structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as

 2   we see it, governs court suits.         And that works, because,

 3   when Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it

 4   almost always provides a specific -- context-specific

 5   administrative limitations period.

 6            Also, when Congress was telling the agency to

 7   focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a

 8   statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in

 9   that contemporary context, did not understand that there

10   was a limitations period, either, because the orders that

11   issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9,

12   sometimes more, years than that.

13            JUSTICE SCALIA:       As late as 1978, the Justice

14   Department didn't think that way, did it?

15            MR. JOSEFFER:      No, the Justice Department--

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:       The opinion of the Office of

17   Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner

18   here would urge.

19            MR. JOSEFFER:      No, the OLC opinion was limited,

20   by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative

21   offsets, not to administrative adjudications.        And if I

22   could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the

23   situation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the

24   Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a

25   person, and, because it thought that person owed it money,


                                   25

                                 Official


 1   what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the

 2   retirement benefits.   What OLC opined is that that is a --

 3   nothing more than a prejudgment attachment.          And OLC

 4   thought that if the Government is time-barred from

 5   obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from

 6   obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

 7            An administrative adjudication is significantly

 8   different, because it does provide an actual judgment.

 9   So, there are a couple of important points from that.

10            First is that the dispute between OLC and the

11   Comptroller General was limited by its terms to

12   administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the

13   Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the

14   statute specifically applies only to suits in court.           But

15   the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets.           So,

16   when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice

17   Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.

18            JUSTICE SCALIA:       But -- excuse me -- how could

19   OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative

20   offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings?

21   I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which

22   you're urging here, which is that this statute applies

23   only to judicial proceedings.          I mean, that's the point.

24   Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position

25   taken by the Justice Department was that this statute


                                   26

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   relates to administrative proceedings.

 2             MR. JOSEFFER:        No, the position of OLC was

 3   limited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the

 4   important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the

 5   statutory term "action," or, frankly, any other statutory

 6   term.   Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong,

 7   that administrative offsets are unique because they are

 8   prejudgment attachment devices.            That's the dispute that

 9   went to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress

10   actually resolved.

11             And, in any event, going forward --

12             JUSTICE SOUTER:         Well, on that theory, then,

13   there was -- there was no time issue with respect to the

14   right to offset, then, in the OLC's position.

15             MR. JOSEFFER:        No, the OLC's view is that if the

16   Government was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under

17   Section 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from

18   obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

19             JUSTICE SOUTER:         No, but I thought your -- in

20   answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to

21   the -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a

22   prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment

23   without process.     If that's the case, then timing should

24   have nothing to do with it.            Conversely, as Justice Scalia

25   said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing


                                      27

 1   presumably derives from this provision; this provision,

 2   therefore, must have been assumed to apply to

 3   administrative proceedings.

 4             So, either there's no time question with respect

 5   to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with

 6   respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that

 7   this provision applies to administrative proceedings.

 8             MR. JOSEFFER:      Well --

 9             JUSTICE SOUTER:       What's wrong with that logic?

10             MR. JOSEFFER:      I think what's wrong with the

11   logic is what was wrong with the logic of the OLC opinion.

12   We don't mean to defend the --

13             JUSTICE SOUTER:       You put me --

14             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- reasoning of the OLC opinion --

15             JUSTICE SOUTER:       -- in good company, but --

16             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- but what OLC really did say --

17   and Comptroller General and Congress promptly disagreed --

18   was that -- it didn't see a problem -- OLC didn't see a

19   problem with procedurally imposing an administrative

20   offset.   What it saw a problem with was, it thought if an

21   -- a judgment would be time-barred, then a prejudgment

22   attachment should be time-barred, as well.       I mean, that

23   was the reasoning of the --

24             JUSTICE SOUTER:       No, but if it was --

25             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- OLC opinion, which --

 1             JUSTICE SOUTER:       -- a prejudgment --

 2             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- I agree was --

 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:       It was a prejudgment attachment

 4   in aid of what could be accomplished administratively by,

 5   ultimately, an administrative judgment.

 6             MR. JOSEFFER:      No, the -- I guess it was another

 7   point.   The OLC opinion was -- arose in the context where

 8   a judgment could be obtained at all only in court.

 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Do we have --

10             MR. JOSEFFER:      In the context of --

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- that opinion, by the way?

12   Both sides cited it.     The -- is it -- it was unpublished.

13             MR JOSEFFER:     It was unpublished, and --

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Does anybody give it to us?

15             MR. JOSEFFER:      Petitioners offered to lodge it

16   with the Court--

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes, I know they did offer, but

18   nobody did it.

19             MR. JOSEFFER:      I'll -- we'll do it this

20   afternoon.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Good.      I would like that.

22             MR. JOSEFFER:      The point's just -- the OLC

23   reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the

24   context in which Congress was responding to.           And, going

25   forward, it is not surplusage, because the issue still


                                    29

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   arises.   If the Government could pursue its suit only in

 2   court, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in

 3   court.    The question would then still arise, under the OLC

 4   opinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the

 5   Government could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment

 6   attachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment.           That's

 7   all that Congress was looking at there.           And, as this

 8   Court's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when

 9   Congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute,

10   oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more

11   than that.

12              We -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back

13   to the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always

14   have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do,

15   especially when a statute must be strictly construed.            And

16   here, the context confirms that "action" does have its

17   ordinary meaning, for several reasons.

18              First, the ordinary meanings of the other key

19   statutory terms, such as "right of action," "complaint,"

20   and "defendant," as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all

21   ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court.          A "right

22   of action" is the right to bring a suit in court; a

23   "defendant" is the person defending in court ordinarily;

24   and a "complaint" is the document that initiates

25   proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a


                                     30

 1   civil action, which is a suit in court.          Especially when

 2   those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in

 3   Unexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a

 4   action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a

 5   suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative

 6   agency.   The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose

 7   an action against an administrative proceeding by saying

 8   that the time to file an action does not run until after

 9   the administrative proceedings have concluded, which

10   certainly gives weight to the point that the action is --

11   an administrative proceeding is not an action.

12             JUSTICE SOUTER:       Would the -- at the time that

13   4515 -- is that the --

14             MR. JOSEFFER:      It's 2415.

15             JUSTICE SOUTER:       20- -- I'm sorry.    At the time

16   that was enacted, were there any limitations in other

17   statutes on the commencement of administrative

18   proceedings?

19             MR. JOSEFFER:      The ones that we have found were

20   -- I'm not 100-percent sure, but the ones that we -- that

21   we have found and cited in our brief do appear to be

22   enacted after that time.      I think the reason is that -- I

23   mean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court

24   suits have been around a lot longer than administrative

25   adjudications.   And, as Congress has authorized


                                    31

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a

 2   case-by-case basis.     And every time that it enacted a

 3   context-specific administrative adjudications period since

 4   1966 -- in theory, it could have just done an

 5   across-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but,

 6   instead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in

 7   part, because of the great variety of administrative

 8   procedure.

 9            I mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of

10   limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just

11   not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts.

12   Here, there's no complaint.            An "order" is a legally

13   binding order.   It doesn't seek relief, it imposes it.

14   And unless it is both appealed and stayed pending appeal

15   --

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:          How about the initial letter

17   that, in the agency practice, precedes the order?             I

18   gather there's a letter to the --

19            MR. JOSEFFER:         Right.       There's -- there are

20   basically three steps here.            First, there's an audit.

21   Then, if the audit reveals an apparent discrepancy, the

22   agency or a State with delegate authority would send an

23   issue letter requesting an explanation.

24            JUSTICE STEVENS:          An issue letter.

25            MR. JOSEFFER:         Yes.       It's called an "issue


                                      32

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                      Official


 1   letter."    And then would basically request an explanation

 2   of the apparent discrepancy.                And then, if the agency then

 3   decides, after consideration of the audit and the issue

 4   letter, that it's appropriate to issue an order to pay it,

 5   will do so.     It --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:          Sounds to me like a complaint,

 7   a response --

 8              MR. JOSEFFER:         An issue letter?

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- and an adjudication.         I

10   mean, you know --

11              MR. JOSEFFER:         I don't know whether you mean the

12   audit --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- "We think you owe this."

14              MR. JOSEFFER:         -- or the issue letter, but

15   either way --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:          The response comes back, "I

17   don't think we owe it, and here's why."               And then there's

18   a ruling, "You do owe it."           And that's the order.      And

19   then you can appeal it.          And the CFR refers to it as an

20   appeal.

21              MR. JOSEFFER:         Yes.       Well, there are a few

22   things.    First, on the -- with respect to the issue letter

23   -- I mean, a complaint, functionally, is a document that

24   initiates proceedings, stating it -- by stating the claim

25   for relief, is seeking relief in a civil action.               With


                                        33

                                  Official


 1   respect to the second of those, an issue letter does not

 2   -- is not an allegation of wrongdoing, and it does not

 3   seek relief; it seeks information so that the agency can

 4   determine whether or not an apparent discrepancy raised by

 5   an audit is, in fact, a discrepancy.             But there's --

 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:       It does not --

 7             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- no claim.

 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- assert that there's a

 9   discrepancy?

10             MR. JOSEFFER:      Well, what it -- what it asserts

11   is that, "We've done an audit, and the audit has raised

12   the following issues" -- that's why it's called an "issue

13   letter" -- "Please provide an explanation."            And it -- so,

14   at that point, the agency has not decided yet whether it

15   is, in fact, asserting a claim.          It's not -- and it's not

16   requesting relief, which a complaint definitely does.             All

17   it's requesting is information to help the agency assess

18   the issue.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Do we have an example of issue

20   letters anywhere?   That's not in the materials either, is

21   it?   In the --

22             MR. JOSEFFER:      No, in fact, it's not even -- in

23   fact, it's not even in the administrative record --

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Right.

25             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- which is one of the reasons

 1   it's not in the issue --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:      Do we know --

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:      -- what time lapse --

 5               MR. JOSEFFER:     -- which also reflects that it's

 6   not a formal complaint, or it would be in the record.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:      Do we know, in this case, what

 8   time lapse there was between the issue letter and the

 9   order?

10               MR. JOSEFFER:     I don't think it was more than a

11   year or two.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:      But --

 8   position, the result will be that there will be a 7-year

 9   limitations period for oil and gas leases, but, for Indian

10   claims and for minerals, there'll be no statute of

11   limitations?

12              MR. JOSEFFER:     Yes, and the reason is that

13   that's what Congress chose to do.           I mean, in the

14   prospective 1996 Act, it --

15              JUSTICE ALITO:     Did they --

16              MR. JOSEFFER:     -- enacted the limitations --

17              JUSTICE ALITO:     When they enacted the 7-year

18   limitation period, did they explain why they would treat

19   those two situations so differently?

20              MR. JOSEFFER:     No, there's no explanation.     As a

21   practical matter, though, the prospective 1996 legislation

22   governs a wide variety of aspects of the -- of the

23   relationship between the Federal Government and the

24   lessees.   And, on balance, that package was pretty

25   favorable to the oil companies, and I think Congress

 1   probably just decided not to -- to apply that to itself,

 2   but not to the Indians.

 3             Getting back to the order, though, it's not only

 4   that --

 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:      How do you defend against a

 6   claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years

 7   ago?

 8             MR. JOSEFFER:     Well, as a --

 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:      I -- I'm really very reluctant

10   to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the

11   statute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law

12   provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years

13   later, and say, "Oh, by the way, you owe all this money."

14             MR. JOSEFFER:     Well, first off, until --

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:      The company says "Gee, I -- you

16   know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago."

17             MR. JOSEFFER:     Right.      Well, there are a few

18   points, both legal and practical.          On the legal, until

19   1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no

20   limitations period ever applies against the Government.

21   And that's the reason for the strict construction canon,

22   that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies,

23   and thereby bars the Government from forcing the law in

24   the public interest.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:      Say that again.      Until 1966,


                                   37

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   there were no statute of limitations against any

 2   Government suits?

 3               MR. JOSEFFER:      Not contract.        I mean, the

 4   historic rule is that the Government is not bound by

 5   statutes of limitations, because what it's doing is

 6   enforcing the law in the public interest.              Now, in 1966,

 7   Congress enacted Section 2415(a) so that there would

 8   prospectively be a contract limitations period.              But it's

 9   strictly construed, because of the historical backdrop and

10   the importance of enforcing the law in the public

11   interest.     So that's why we do have a strict construction

12   canon here.     As a --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:       He didn't apply against the

14   Government either.

15               MR. JOSEFFER:      For the same reason laches is

16   never applied against the Government.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So, there's no limit at all,

18   and you concede that that's the case.              So, the Government

19   could go back on these royalties as long as it likes.

20               MR. JOSEFFER:      Well, as an abstract theoretical

21   matter, the Government could reach back many, many

22   decades.    As a practical matter, though, that's never

23   happened that we've gone back, say, 50 or 100 years

24   and there are practical reasons for that.              First is that

25   the agency does not have enough resources to audit --


                                      38

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1            JUSTICE KENNEDY:        Well, there's a case involving

 2   the Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways --

 3            MR. JOSEFFER:       That's true.        It's -- I meant in

 4   the --

 5            JUSTICE KENNEDY:        -- 200 years --

 6            MR. JOSEFFER:       -- leasing context here.

 7            JUSTICE KENNEDY:        Yes.

 8            MR. JOSEFFER:       I didn't mean in the leasing

 9   context here.   But in the leasing context, one -- there

10   are a couple of important points.            One is that the

11   Government does not have enough resources to audit all of

12   the current accounts in all of the years, which is one of

13   the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther

14   when we catch the violation.            As a -- but as

15   a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing

16   resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50

17   years ago, there's a reason that's never happened.

18            In addition, the farther we try to go back, the

19   greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the

20   companies have the information that shows what royalties

21   they would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records

22   after 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go

23   back, because of proof problems.

24            JUSTICE SCALIA:        That's another indication.      Why

25   would you allow them to destroy those records after 6


                                    39

 1   years if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that

 2   there was no statute of limitations to claims for these

 3   things?   I mean, that's just another inconsistency that --

 4   in the statutory scheme that's created.

 5             MR. JOSEFFER:      Well, no, the --

 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:       You say, "You can destroy your

 7   records after 6 years."      Well, why?           It doesn't make any

 8   sense.

 9             MR. JOSEFFER:      Well, first, it's optional, not

10   mandatory.   If they want to keep them, they --

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes.

12             MR. JOSEFFER:      -- certainly can.           But there's no

13   -- and, as a practical matter -- I mean, because the

14   Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if

15   the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on

16   balance, going to be in its favor.               But, in addition,

17   there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year

18   periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep

19   records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the

20   Secretary can require they be kept for longer.               In

21   addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of

22   tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful

23   destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof

24   issues in situations where the statute might, because of

25   tolling, be much longer.      So, there's not a strict


                                    40

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   congruence.

 2            There is also no indication that Congress

 3   enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was

 4   thinking about a 6-year limitations period.          There's never

 5   been any linkage between the two.

 6            If I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean,

 7   in addition to all the textual points, this is also

 8   located in the judicial code.          And, although it's true

 9   that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply

10   to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly.

11   Every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code

12   -- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time

13   the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers

14   to a suit in court, and only a suit in court.

15            When a provision of the judicial code applies to

16   something else, it will say so.         For example, 28 U.S. Code

17   2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty

18   proceedings, refers to an "action, suit, or proceeding."

19   The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what

20   it's talking about is submitting something to an agency.

21            So, if Congress was going to legislate against

22   the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms

23   that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the

24   provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a

25   totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially


                                   41

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   clear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to

 2   govern administrative proceedings.

 3               The committee reports also strongly confirm

 4   that, because they not only say that the statute defines

 5   the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S.

 6   courts, and not only use court terminology from front to

 7   back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware

 8   of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying

 9   is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not

10   expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings.

11               The committee has explained that the reason for

12   that provision was the great number and variety of

13   administrative proceedings.           So, in other words, Congress

14   was saying, "There's a great variety of administrative

15   procedure.    We're just not going to deal with that here.

16   We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations

17   period does not expire until a year after those

18   administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have

19   expired."

20               There's also some relevance in the fact that

21   this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as

22   part of an overall package of reforms that would govern

23   the civil litigation that the Department was handling in

24   the courts.    It was then referred to the Judiciary

25   Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees


                                     42

 1   that might consider administrative procedure matters, and,

 2   as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial

 3   code.

 4              From start to finish, this legislation has never

 5   had anything to do with anything other than court suits,

 6   which is why Congress has expressly provided for

 7   context-specific administrative systems -- limitations

 8   periods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant

 9   administrative procedures.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, except when you -- when

11   you say "this legislation," you limit it to the body of

12   2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's

13   "one."    Is it?   Little -- or --

14              MR. JOSEFFER:        It's (i).           It is (i).

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:         It's (i).          I mean, that clearly

16   does apply to administrative proceedings.                  And I could

17   understand the argument that Congress was just making

18   things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to

19   administrative proceedings.             I could understand that

20   argument if the way (i) was written is, "The provisions of

21   this section shall not apply to administrative

22   proceedings."      And then I would say, "You know, oh, well,

23   that was always the case, and this is just making it

24   clear."

25              It doesn't say that.            It says that -- the only


                                       43

                            Alderson Reporting Company

 1   administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these

 2   offsets.

 3              MR. JOSEFFER:     I think the reason is that --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:      And, you know, the normal rule

 5   is inclusio unius, exclusio alterius.            I would -- it

 6   means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and

 7   that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this

 8   section was adopted this year, and the other section was

 9   adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look

10   at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff

11   together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that

12   administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action"

13   is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.

14              MR. JOSEFFER:     I mean, it's -- there's no doubt

15   the statute should be read as a whole.           But, as this Court

16   has explained in cases like the O'Gilvie and Vonn cases

17   cited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of

18   a statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that

19   when Congress faces a specific dispute and amends a

20   statute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it

21   resolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative

22   inference, especially here, as the Court of Appeals

23   pointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:      That's the best thing you have

25   going for you, really, the strict construction canon.


                                    44

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1            MR. JOSEFFER:       Well, because -- I mean, and it

 2   is an important point, that the statute applies only if it

 3   clearly applies by its terms.           And it seems to me, the

 4   best that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the

 5   statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous.            But that --

 6   all that means, as I said, is that, under the strict

 7   construction canon, we would prevail.            And even if the

 8   statute governs some administrative proceedings, but not

 9   others, it would not govern these, for the reason I gave

10   earlier, which is that there's no complaint here.              We

11   talked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a

12   complaint.   It's another important point, though, that in

13   order not only -- it is -- not only does it not begin the

14   proceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are

15   only taken about a quarter of the time.           And in some

16   limited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal,

17   if the Assistant Secretary issued the order.           So --

18            JUSTICE SCALIA:        What if I didn't think the

19   order was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter

20   was a complaint?   Would the Petitioner lose?          Because they

21   never made that argument.

22            MR. JOSEFFER:       Correct.       It's -- the only

23   argument they've ever made --

24            JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.

25            MR. JOSEFFER:       -- is that an "order" is a


                                    45

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   complaint.   So, they haven't preserved the point.

 2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Because you're --

 3             MR. JOSEFFER:      But --

 4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- you made the point that

 5   the issue letter is just raising the issues, and it's not

 6   charging, as a complaint would allege, "You owe us," but

 7   this is, "Maybe you owe us."

 8             MR. JOSEFFER:      Correct.       There's no -- in an

 9   issue letter, there's no claim for relief, just a claim

10   for the request for information, and there's no allegation

11   of wrongdoing.   So, it's just not a complaint in those

12   ways.   Also, it doesn't -- it's not really fair to say

13   that it begins proceedings, because it comes between an

14   audit and an order to pay.       So it doesn't -- and plus,

15   it's, of course, not filed in a civil action.            And, in

16   that respect, it doesn't satisfy any of the -- any of the

17   elements of the -- of the ordinary definition of

18   "complaints."

19             JUSTICE ALITO:      Are you saying that this doesn't

20   apply to any administrative proceeding, or just those that

21   are structured like this one, where you don't have

22   anything that's labeled a "complaint"?

23             MR. JOSEFFER:      We -- well, our primary

24   submission is that it does not apply to any administrative

25   proceedings, for the reason -- reasons I've given, that


                                    46

                                 Official


 1   the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms

 2   are for suits in court.     A "complaint" itself is

 3   ordinarily defined to be --

 4            JUSTICE SCALIA:       Even if you have an

 5   administrative proceeding which is called a "complaint"?

 6   You know, I mean -- and some are, I think.

 7            MR. JOSEFFER:      There are -- there are some

 8   contexts in administrative procedure in which the word

 9   "complaint" is used.

10            JUSTICE SCALIA:       And that would not be covered

11   by 2415(a).

12            MR. JOSEFFER:      Because it's not filed in an

13   "action," which refers to a suit in court, following

14   occurral of a right of action, which refers to the right

15   to bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes

16   the terms "action" against "administrative proceedings" --

17            JUSTICE SCALIA:       And let's assume all those

18   terms are used in the agency procedure.              They're talking

19   about "action," "right of action."              All those terms are

20   used in the agency's procedural rules.             Would they then

21   come under this thing?

22            MR. JOSEFFER:      No.

23            JUSTICE SCALIA:       I think you have to say no --

24            MR. JOSEFFER:      Yes.

25            JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- because, otherwise, it would

 1   be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to

 2   come in or out, right?

 3            MR. JOSEFFER:      Well, and it's a much more --

 4            JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes.

 5            MR. JOSEFFER:      -- fundamental point than that,

 6   too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using

 7   these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across-

 8   the-board rule that applies to suits in court.

 9            And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize

10   is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive

11   administrative scheme.    Petitioners like to say that,

12   "Well, we could just as easily be in court."      There's a

13   reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever

14   been brought by the Government in a court.      And that's,

15   first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a

16   comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then

17   gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its

18   administrative orders.    The only way the agency could

19   administer thousands of leases with something like $9

20   billion in royalties every year is to do this in an

21   efficient administrative manner.

22            Congress has not only authorized that, and

23   ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the

24   agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old

25   leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a

 1   standalone administrative scheme, and it's never provided

 2   the administrative limitations period for the standalone

 3   administrative scheme.

 4            If there are no more questions --

 5            JUSTICE STEVENS:          Thank you, Mr. Joseffer.

 6            Mr. Lamken, as I understand it, you have about

 7   11 minutes left.     You don't have to use them all.

 9            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

10                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11            MR. LAMKEN:       I will endeavor not to.    Thank you,

12   Justice Stevens.

13            I wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of

14   the term "action."     I was somewhat bemused by the

15   Government's insistence that had -- the term "action" in

16   West versus Gibson was construed -- it must mean an action

17   before a court, and has that as its ordinary meaning.

18            The Solicitor General's own position in West

19   versus Gibson, on page 25 and -6 of its brief was,

20   "Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term

21   'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings.        The

22   statutory language, read in context, suggests that no such

23   limitation was intended."

24            Page 6 of the Government's reply, "The term

25   'action,' in Section 1981, can reasonably be construed as


                                      49

 1   encompassing both administrative and judicial

 2   proceedings."

 3               The term "action" is a term that's used for

 4   adversary adjudicative proceedings, whether those are in

 5   court or before an agency.        It is not limited to

 6   administrative agency proceedings, as the Government

 7   itself recognized in West versus Gibson.

 8               There are more general terms here.          There's also

 9   "complaint," there's also "defendant."            There's a number

10   of those.    But those general terms are also the terms of

11   adversary adjudication.       And Congress uses them, as far

12   back as 1921, for adversary adjudications before agencies.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:      Mr. Lamken, have you had any

14   second thoughts about your position that it's the order,

15   rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?

16               MR. LAMKEN:   Well, in fact -- no.        But the --

17   the answer is that we didn't -- no issue was engaged as to

18   what was the functional equivalent of the complaint below.

19   That raised -- was raised for the first time by the

20   Solicitor General in its merits brief, saying, "No, no,

21   no, there's actually some stuff that comes before the

22   order."

23               But if -- I would encourage the Court to look at

24   the definitions in FOGRSFA, 1724 and 1702(A), which tell

25   you what, under -- in Congress's view, commences the


                                     50

 1   proceedings here.   And, in Congress's view, what commences

 2   the proceedings, what triggers the new statute of

 3   limitations and stops it from running, is the order to

 4   pay, which Congress defines as a "demand."

 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, that's true.       That's

 6   true.   But the provision you're arguing that you come

 7   under does talk about a complaint.

 8             MR. LAMKEN:    That's --

 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:       And that's what -- you know,

10   that's what starts the 6 years running.            And it's -- seems

11   to me odd to call something a "complaint" which is, in

12   fact, an order.   They're not complaining about anything;

13   they're saying, "Pay the money."

14             MR. LAMKEN:    Actually, Justice Scalia --

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:       You know, usually a complaint,

16   you're -- you make your point, and say, "What do you say?

17   What's your answer?"

18             MR. LAMKEN:    Well --

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:       And this is an order.       "You're

20   -- boom, "Pay."

21             MR. LAMKEN:    It certainly has a hybrid quality,

22   Justice Scalia.   And it's not a hybrid quality that the

23   industry particularly likes.            But it is the first time

24   that the Government asserts its state -- its claims as to

25   what's wrong, in a binding legally operative document,


                                    51

 1   where the failure to respond results in default.          It has

 2   that function as complaint.         It is the first salvo in

 3   official, formal administrative proceedings.

 4            JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, that's only true if you

 5   consider an appeal to be the response.          And that's rather

 6   weird, that --

 7            MR. LAMKEN:      It is --

 8            JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- that the response to a

 9   complaint is an appeal.

10            MR. LAMKEN:    The language that has been used,

11   and -- as a result of very odd historical anomalies and

12   attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these

13   proceedings over time -- is odd, and it is awkward.          But

14   it's clear that when Congress wrote the scope of this

15   statute, it said it applies to "every action for money

16   damages by the Government which is founded in contract."

17   It doesn't say "actions that are begun by complaint."

18            Now, the complaint is what Congress assumes will

19   stop the provision from running.          And there is always, in

20   an adversary adjudication, some document that functions

21   like a complaint, that provides the defendant the notice

22   of what the claims are against it, and to which failure to

23   respond will result in default.

24            We believe that the most likely thing to be the

25   complaint here is, the thing that provided us with notice,


                                   52

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is that -- "Boys, you've got to respond; otherwise, you're

 2   in trouble" -- was the order to pay.               And Congress came to

 3   that same conclusion when it enacted -- when it enacted

 4   FOGRSFA and established a 7-year statute of limitations

 5   provision.     But if we lose 2 years of the claim, and only

 6   get 1 because it is the agency letter, in the Court's

 7   view, well, that's fine, but there's some document here

 8   that started these agency proceedings, and it is that

 9   document which is a complaint.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:         Could you get us -- we're going

11   to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion.

12   Could you -- could you get us a -- you know, a sample of

13   an agency letter?    Or, if you can't, maybe the Government

14   can?

15             MR. LAMKEN:      Yes, I -- that's true.          And in

16   terms of the OLC letter, we offered to lodge it in our

17   brief.   Unfortunately, by the Court's rules, we're not

18   allowed to lodge it, unless the Court specifically

19   requests it.    And so, that's why it's not there.            But we

20   will get that to you, or the Government will get it to

21   you, as soon as possible.

22             The actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in

23   the administrative record.         And it turns out that we

24   haven't been able to find it, and the Government hasn't

25   been able to find it.      And so, it's a letter.          It's a

 1   demand letter, but it is a letter, and that -- the order

 2   to pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings.

 3   And again, what opens the proceedings in -- the Justice

 4   Department regulations and other regulations --

 5            JUSTICE STEVENS:          May I suggest --

 6            MR. LAMKEN:       -- to try to define --

 7            JUSTICE STEVENS:          -- this, Mr. Lamken, that when

 8   the -- when the filing is made giving us the OLC opinion,

 9   you include a -- an example of such a letter?

10            MR. LAMKEN:       Yes.        Yes.    Of course.

11            JUSTICE STEVENS:          And so, we'll get a notion of

12   what it looks like.

13            MR. LAMKEN:       Right.         It may have to be from some

14   other proceeding; it wouldn't necessarily be from this

15   case.

16            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Your position is, this would

17   apply to the universe of administrative proceedings.               Now,

18   this particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an

19   express statute of limitations.               So, what we're talking

20   about, for the future -- what would change under your

21   interpretation?   Not gas leases, because -- there's a 7-

22   year limitation for both administrative orders to pay and

23   --

24            MR. LAMKEN:       Right.


25            JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- court actions.

 1             MR. LAMKEN:      Right.         It would be all leases on

 2   Indian lands.     It would be all leases which involve

 3   minerals other than oil and gas, whether it be coal, gold,

 4   silver, anything like that.            It would also be all claims

 5   before September -- all production before September of

 6   1996.   That introduces something of an oddity, if one

 7   accepts the Government's position.                 It would be that, for

 8   all claims going forward from September of 1996, the

 9   Government has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years,

10   those claims persist in perpetuity.                When Section 2415(a)

11   itself was enacted, Congress avoided precisely that result

12   by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date

13   the statute of limitations was enacted.                And the very fact

14   that Congress didn't do that here is evidence that

15   Congress -- to the extent it has anything to do with it at

16   all -- is evidence that Congress, in fact, understood that

17   there already was a statute of limitations applicable.

18   And, in fact --

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:         What --

20             MR. LAMKEN:      -- it also --

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:         What other areas would we be

22   messing up by finding for you?            I mean, here, you know, if

23   we don't find that this administrative action is covered

24   by this statute of limitations, there's no statute of

25   limitations.    But there may -- there are other -- may be

 1   other areas covered by this text -- namely, a suit by the

 2   United States -- founded upon any contract expressly or

 3   implied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a

 4   statute of limitations.

 5             MR. LAMKEN:     Right.        There are -- there are some

 6   contexts in which there already is a separate

 7   administrative regime which would have its own statute of

 8   limitations.   The Contract Disputes Act, as the Government

 9   points out, is one of those.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:       And that would prevail over

11   this --

12             MR. LAMKEN:    Yes, because the --

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- because it's more --

14             MR. LAMKEN:    -- Contract Disputes --

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- specific.

16             MR. LAMKEN:    -- Act has an exception at the

17   front and says "notwithstanding 2415."           It's its own

18   animal to itself.   And there is a clause at the front of

19   2415 that says "except as otherwise provided by Congress."

20   And so, Congress often takes exceptions.           And when it

21   modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an

22   exception to the 2415 regime.           So, Congress knows how to

23   conduct specialized situations and take things outside of

24   2415 when it needs to.     But it enacted Section 2415 as a

25   catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't


                                    56

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   managed to anticipate the circumstances.          And the

 2   Government's premise of the whole provision is that

 3   Congress botched it.    Congress provided a catchall that

 4   catches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free,

 5   in perpetuity, to persist -- to proceed on precisely the

 6   same claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest.

 7   And, because interest is calculated at a relatively high

 8   rate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable

 9   than the relatively more recent claims.          And it seems

10   implausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall

11   limitations period with a loophole so large that it

12   deprives the statute of limitations period of effect

13   almost entirely.

14             Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the

15   statute -- the canon of strict construction.         And that is

16   that it doesn't always require the court to narrow

17   otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where

18   doing so would have the effect of rendering another

19   provision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous --

20   introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and

21   depriving the statute of its intended effect, as the

22   Bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes

23   clear.   And Bowers case was virtually on point.        It

24   was the case where the -- it was a statute of limitations

25   that could have applied to administrative agency actions,


                                    57

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   or it could not have.    And the Court declined to accept a

 2   narrowing construction proffered by the Government under

 3   statute of strict construction because it would have

 4   rendered one of the provisions -- one for consent

 5   proceedings -- superfluous, because it would have resulted

 6   in anomaly, and because it would have undermined the

 7   premise of repose which undergirded the statute of

 8   limitations in that case.       Precisely the same things are

 9   true here.   And, for those reasons, the Court should reach

10   precisely the same result.

11            If there are no further questions, thank you

12   very much.
