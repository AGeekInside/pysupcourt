 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. FLAXMAN:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10              This case presents the Court with the

11   question it addressed in Heck versus Humphrey raised in

12   a slightly different context.

13              The context in Heck was of a prisoner whose

14   conviction had been affirmed who was in prison, who had

15   filed a civil rights case that would have had the

16   practical effect of collaterally challenging his

17   criminal conviction.     The context in this case is of a

18   civil rights plaintiff who has prevailed in his criminal

19   case, who was imprisoned for 8-1/2 years fighting the

20   criminal case and comes to Federal court with a Section

21   1983 action saying, I now seek a remedy for my

22   unconstitutional incarceration, and files his lawsuit.

23              The court in Heck held that this action, an

24   action to recover damages for unconstitutional

25   conviction or imprisonment, accrues when the conviction


                                       3

 1   is set aside.   That's the principle that we asked the

 2   court of appeals to apply and the court of appeals said:

 3   We're not going to apply that because we will adopt a

 4   categorical rule without any implied exceptions

 5   whatsoever that says when you're arrested you have 2

 6   years, which is the statute of limitations in 1983 cases

 7   in Illinois, to file your claim for damages.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Flaxman, one starting

 9   point.   You say that this case should be just like Heck,

10   but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983

11   and habeas, right?

12               MR. FLAXMAN:           Well, that was one view of the

13   core problem.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But at least this case

15   involves no such concern about habeas.

16               MR. FLAXMAN:           That's correct.              In Heck the

17   Court solves the core problem by concluding -- by

18   denying the existence of a cause of action for damages

19   until the criminal case had been resolved in favor of

20   the civil rights claimant, which is the rule, the common

21   law rule for malicious prosecution.                       That's the solution

22   that the Court came up with in Heck, which is the

23   solution that the petitioner believes should be applied

24   in this case.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:               But only if, only if the


                                          4

 1   challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if

 2   sustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial

 3   language -- invalidate the criminal conviction.

 4              MR. FLAXMAN:            That's what would have

 5   happened in this case, as the dissenting judge in the

 6   petition for rehearing --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:                Would necessarily have?

 8   You could have said that ex ante?

 9              MR. FLAXMAN:            Absolutely.              In criminal cases

10   there's discovery and the criminal defendant knows what

11   the prosecution --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:                You don't know what other

13   evidence there might have been in the criminal case.                         Ex

14   ante you can't tell.

15              MR. FLAXMAN:            You do know because it's

16   disclosed in discovery.          We don't do trial by ambush any

17   more in criminal cases.          The defendant knew that all the

18   evidence against him was the alleged --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but      he did

20   not know that for years later.                I mean, they don't have

21   to bring a prosecution immediately.                       They can wait until

22   the day before the statute of limitations runs.

23              MR. FLAXMAN:            Well, there is no statute of

24   limitations for murder in Illinois.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, then they can

 1   wait a long time.

 2              (Laughter.)

 3              MR. FLAXMAN:           If he's incarcerated that

 4   whole time awaiting the filing of charges, then his

 5   cause of action would not have accrued.                  But the more

 6   likely scenario is that he would be arrested --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, is that -- I mean,

 8   your friend on the other side says that the cause of

 9   action would have accrued at the moment at which he was

10   bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate.

11   At that point the false arrest and the incarceration

12   incident to the false arrest is over and if there is

13   ever going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather

14   it'ss going to be a common law action for false

15   imprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until

16   the imprisonment is over.           But so far as the arrest is

17   concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong

18   is completed at the point at which an independent

19   magistrate takes over.

20              MR. FLAXMAN:           If the claim was solely

21   directed at the arrest, then Your Honor would be

22   absolutely correct.      The claim in this case, the cause

23   of action, is not that he was taken off the street

24   without probable cause.         The core of the cause of action

25   is that the respondent police officers exploited that


                                         6

 1   arrest to get this untruthful confession that was used

 2   to hold Mr. Wallace in custody for 8-1/2 years, to seize

 3   him for 8-1/2 years.     It's not just the arrest.         It's

 4   the arrest plus exploiting it.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But all of that occurred,

 6   as I -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I

 7   thought all of that occurred prior to -- I don't know

 8   what they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over

 9   hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary

10   steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of

11   causation between what the police do and the subsequent

12   incarceration.

13              MR. FLAXMAN:         Under Malley versus Briggs, it

14   doesn't break the chain of causation if we adhere --

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but just as a factual

16   matter is it correct -- is it correct as a factual

17   matter that the confession that was given was a

18   confession that was given before there was any judicial

19   intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?

20              MR. FLAXMAN:         That's correct.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

22              MR. FLAXMAN:         There was no other evidence

23   presented to the magistrate or that could have been

24   presented to the magistrate other than the confession to

25   show --

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your

 2   argument limited to that situation, where there is no

 3   evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other

 4   than the illegally seized evidence?                      Or would it apply

 5   in some situations in which there is some additional

 6   evidence?

 7                 MR. FLAXMAN:        If there's some additional

 8   evidence, we could not say was necessarily -- would

 9   necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction.                       And

10   would be -- that's not our situation.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Any additional evidence,

12   even if it would be insufficient to support a

13   conviction, takes -- makes make this -- would make this

14   a different case.

15                 MR. FLAXMAN:        I would not say -- well, it

16   would make it a different case.               But if I was arguing in

17   a case where there was a little bit of evidence, but not

18   enough to say there's probable cause to accuse him of a

19   crime, I would say that suppressing or eliminating the

20   confession would necessarily imply the invalidity of any

21   conviction.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What, what does necessarily

23   mean?   Does it mean no additional evidence?                    Does it

24   mean no additional evidence that is insufficient to

25   support a conviction?       Does it mean no additional

 1   evidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of

 2   fact?

 3              MR. FLAXMAN:         What I think it means is that

 4   there's no conviction -- what I think it should mean --

 5   and I'm not trying to debate the dictionary, what I

 6   think it should mean is that if there is no evidence

 7   other than after -- that is excluded, to base a

 8   prosecution on, as in this case where the man is let go,

 9   because there is no evidence to prosecute him, that that

10   does imply the invalidity of the conviction.

11              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, in this case, let me

12   just me more question on it.           In this case, suppose

13   there had been a witness who said at about the time when

14   this murder took place, I saw somebody who was between,

15   I would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average

16   height, average build, running away.                   And let's say that

17   your client fits that description.                Now would that be

18   enough to take this case out of the rule that you're

19   arguing for?

20              MR. FLAXMAN:         No.      Unless that witness could

21   say and the man who I saw then is the defendant in

22   this -- is the criminal defendant, Mr. Wallace.                   There

23   was an eyewitness in this case.             And he could not make

24   an in-court identification of Mr. Wallace.                   And the

25   prosecutor realized that that wasn't enough evidence on


                                       9

 1   which to base a criminal prosecution, and gave up.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Again, you didn't, you

 3   didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at

 4   the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he

 5   was bound over.     You really didn't know that until the

 6   trial.   For all you knew, they might have found in

 7   addition to the confession, they might have found

 8   eyewitnesss who would have identified your client.                You

 9   couldn't tell that until the trial.

10               MR. FLAXMAN:           Well, that would have been

11   very unfair if they withheld -- they ambushed the

12   defendant with --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            No, well -- until the trial

14   --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Until the trial, until the

16   process of trial began.

17               MR. FLAXMAN:           Well, we didn't know that

18   because there weren't any, because this man didn't

19   commit that crime.      We are talking -- in the

20   hypothetical, I think we should set, start with

21   Mr. Wallace being an innocent man, who was arrested

22   unlawfully, who gives an involuntarily -- an involuntary

23   false confession.     And on the basis of that is held for

24   eight and a half years, finally wins the case, is set

25   free, and then sues the --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But, but you presume in

 2   your last answer that other than that, there is an

 3   absolutely fair prosecution.

 4                 MR. FLAXMAN:         Other than the fact --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean, why do we make

 6   that assumption when we start out with the allegation of

 7   a tort and a violation of the Constitution?                  I don't

 8   understand.

 9                 MR. FLAXMAN:         Well, the tort is against the

10   police officers who made an unlawful arrest and

11   exploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold

12   Mr. Wallace.     The, the problem with saying that

13   Mr. Wallace has to sue, as soon as he files his motion

14   to suppress, he should have filed his Section 1983

15   action, would produce a multitude of 1983 actions.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What about the fact --

17   suppose that there were even a more serious battery

18   here, a broken limb or something.                  Would you have to sue

19   for the damages for the battery right away?                  The police

20   officers injured --

21                 MR. FLAXMAN:         No.      If excessive force was

22   used against somebody when they're being arrested,

23   that's a claim that everyone agrees accrues at the time

24   of the injury.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, what about this

 1   case?

 2              MR. FLAXMAN:          This case would necessarily

 3   impair the validity of the conviction.                     If --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But the conviction in Heck

 5   existed at the time of the alleged tort.                     And what Heck

 6   said is where you have an outstanding conviction, and

 7   you have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that

 8   constitutional -- and where -- you cannot sue on that

 9   constitutional tort if the decision on the tort would

10   effectively contradict your conviction.                     Until the

11   conviction has been set aside.

12              Well, this is not that situation.                       There was

13   no outstanding conviction involved.                     So why did you have

14   to wait?

15              MR. FLAXMAN:          Well, you had to wait because

16   it would -- it would be a fruitless act to file the case

17   while the case -- file a Federal case while the state

18   criminal case was pending.          But --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'm still, I'm still

20   puzzled about my question.          Suppose there's a battery

21   resulting in a serious injury to the defendant.

22              MR. FLAXMAN:          That claim would --

23              JUSTICE KENNED:             But there's other evidence

24   and so forth.   Can you sue for the battery at once?

25              MR. FLAXMAN:          You can sue and you have to

 1   sue for the battery immediately.

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Why is that the situation?

 3              MR. FLAXMAN:            Why is that different?

 4   Because this --

 5              JUSTICE KENNEY:               And -- or is it just

 6   because of the assumption that the conviction might

 7   stand anyway.

 8              MR. FLAXMAN:            Well the conviction generally

 9   does stand with --      the battery generally has nothing to

10   with the conviction.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But if does, then you

12   wait?

13              MR. FLAXMAN:            If it is an element of the

14   offense, you wait.      Or if it is an element of what could

15   be the defense in a criminal case.

16              But getting back to the Heck question, in

17   Heck the court looked to the common law for the

18   appropriate rule to apply to the cause of action that

19   Mr. Heck was applying.

20              If we look to the common law for the

21   appropriate rule for Mr. Wallace, we don't come up with

22   the Seventh Circuit's rule of immediate accrual.                   We

23   come up with the rule --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But the point, the

25   whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end

 1   run around habeas.      But here you don't have that problem

 2   because you don't have any available relief under habeas

 3   under Stone versus Powell.

 4              MR. FLAXMAN:            Well, we don't know before the

 5   criminal case starts whether Mr. Wallace will receive a

 6   full and fair hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim.

 7   And until we know that we don't say Stone versus Powell

 8   would bar a Fourth Amendment claim.                       We don't know that

 9   the state will give Mr. Wallace an attorney who can stay

10   awake, who can file a motion, who knows that there is a

11   Fourth Amendment, and Mr. Wallace might end up not

12   getting a full and fair hearing and might have a valid

13   claim cognizable with Federal habeas corpus that --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Are there many cases in

15   which the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable

16   for that reason?

17              MR. FLAXMAN:            No.      But there are some.         It

18   is not a non-existent occurrence in.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:               What happens -- I'm trying

20   to think of what the problem is for you.                      On January 1,

21   your client's arrested unlawfully.                   Now suppose the rule

22   was you have two years to file it, starting now.                      What

23   is the problem for you?          The problem is maybe in a year,

24   or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him.                      In

25   the meantime, your trial is going forward because you


                                         14

 1   filed it on time.    So when they start to prosecute him,

 2   you don't yet know what's going to happen.               And it could

 3   happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal

 4   because of the arrest and necessarily so.

 5                 And therefore you have to stop the trial, I

 6   guess, because of Heck.

 7                 MR. FLAXMAN:        The civil trial will be stayed

 8   pending the --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That would work, I guess.

10   They'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it -- you'd

11   have to stop it and then you'd have to go through these

12   other remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.

13                 MR. FLAXMAN:        It would be on the district

14   court's docket for ten years waiting the final --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But that would work.

16                 MR. FLAXMAN:        It would, well, it would be a

17   horrible --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           A mess.

19                 MR. FLAXMAN:        -- a horrible mess for the

20   district court.    It would not work because --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Suppose I modify it.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why would it be a mess?   I

23   mean, it seems to me that the district court, once it is

24   filed -- something is filed within the two year statute,

25   the district court can tell virtually immediately

 1   whether there are criminal proceedings that are yet to

 2   be held, and the district court can simply, it can

 3   simply stay further proceedings until those criminal

 4   proceedings are over.       If there's a possibility of

 5   collateral attacks, the district court can simply say

 6   hey, are you going to file a collateral attack?                      And if

 7   the answer is yes, stay it further.                      If the answer is

 8   no, go ahead with it then.           What's tough about that?

 9                MR. FLAXMAN:         Well, the district judge will

10   not allow a civil case to go forward because it would

11   allow the criminal defendant --

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's the premise of my

13   question.   But I mean it seems to me to be fairly easily

14   administered.

15                MR. FLAXMAN:         Well, I mean, I, I shudder to

16   think of 20,000 cases on district court dockets being

17   stayed while criminal cases are being resolved.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            20,000 might make me

19   shudder.    But we got one.

20                (Laughter.)

21                MR. FLAXMAN:         We have one.             The criminal

22   defendant will be disinclined to file his civil rights

23   case on time because it will be used against him in his

24   criminal case to impeach his bias.

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well -- explain that.

 1               MR. FLAXMAN:         It will impeach his bias.        If

 2   he, when he testifies in the criminal case, he will be

 3   cross-examined, aren't you seeking money damage from the

 4   police officers?   Don't you want to make money from this

 5   case?   And the jury will consider that when they weigh

 6   the truthfulness of the --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            And don't you think that a

 8   civil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might

 9   be a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to

10   limit that kind of cross-examination?

11               MR. FLAXMAN:         Not in the Circuit Court of

12   Cook County.   That cross-examination will occur every

13   time a civil --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Are there appeals from the

15   Circuit Court of Cook County?

16               MR. FLAXMAN:         There are appeals and.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, don't you -- don't

18   you think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?

19               MR. FLAXMAN:         No.      I am absolutely confident

20   the Illinois courts at the highest level will say that

21   is proper cross-examination.

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Come -- come back here.

23               (Laughter.)

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose it is complicated.

25   I want to suggest a modification with this suit here.

 1   You say you have to file within two years.                       But wait,

 2   you have -- we tolled the statute.                   If the person is

 3   arrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time

 4   that is going on, it is just tolled, equitably.                       And

 5   after the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or

 6   he isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again.

 7              Now if he's convicted, as long as you have

 8   filed, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is

 9   tolled.

10              Now, would that -- that it seems to me would

11   help every problem you have, and it would be called

12   equitable tolling.      And that's been suggested by judges

13   in different forums and many states have it.

14              And what's the problem?                        That just solves

15   the problem, doesn't it?

16              MR. FLAXMAN:            Well, I have four answers.                I

17   hope I can get them out.

18              If Heck instead of adopting a rule of

19   accrual and denying existence of a cause of action had

20   established the Federal tolling rule, saying that these

21   causes of action are tolled while you're in custody,

22   that would have solved the problem.

23              JUSTICE BREYER:               All right, well, we could

24   do it in this case.

25              MR. FLAXMAN:            Well, I, I -- the Court

 1   certainly can do it.       It would require carving a hole

 2   into, into Tomiano with this --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yeah, it would

 4   require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your

 5   borrow state law --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What cases require

 7   overruling?

 8                 MR. FLAXMAN:        Unless state law is

 9   inconsistent with Federal Board of Regents versus

10   Tomiano, I think the Court could say that.                 The other

11   thing that the Court should be aware of is that the

12   Seventh Circuit, and I think four other circuits follow

13   the common law rule that you can't have a 1983 action

14   about a false arrest if you have been convicted of the

15   charge on which you were arrested.                  So these cases would

16   not be brought in the Seventh Circuit and the --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, it seems to me

18   identical to the rule you are advocating but with one

19   difference.    The difference with the rule you are

20   advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A

21   with your first case, is going to have to guess whether

22   it is in this case or not in this case necessarily

23   related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're

24   going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.

25                 MR. FLAXMAN:        I think --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:            There is no way to guess

 2   that.

 3              MR. FLAXMAN:         I think tolling, a Federal

 4   tolling rule for this cause of action, while someone in

 5   custody although a criminal conviction is, has not been

 6   resolved in favor of the defendant, criminal defendant,

 7   would be an excellent solution.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:            And is there anything that

 9   you are aware of that it would be contrary to?                I know

10   there are cases that say you look to states but you only

11   look to states where the state law is, in fact,

12   consistent with the Federal right.

13              MR. FLAXMAN:         No, I think the Court could

14   say without overruling anything that there, in this the

15   state law does not fully reflect or protect the Federal

16   rights at stake here.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So then you deny the

18   officers the purpose you have for the reason you have

19   statutes of limitation, which is repose.                They are going

20   to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out

21   if they are going to have to answer any claim for

22   damages.

23              MR. FLAXMAN:         Well, but the officers will

24   also get the benefit of not being sued if there is a

25   conviction based on the charge for which the person was


                                      20

 1   arrested.   That case would not be brought, especially in

 2   the Seventh Circuit where there is no cause of action --

 3   and it wouldn't be brought anywhere because there's no

 4   damages if you are arrested and properly convicted and

 5   serving sentence.     Those cases just are not going to

 6   exist; the officers would have that benefit.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought the Seventh

 8   Circuit said in -- quickly in passing that the damages

 9   would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful

10   arrest until the time of arraignment.                    That would, that

11   would be the -- be all of your damages.                    If there wasn't

12   an arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to

13   the seizure.

14               MR. FLAXMAN:          That's the Seventh Circuit's

15   view about what the cause of action is, which goes back

16   to what is the cause of action and when does it accrue?

17   In the Seventh Circuit the cause of action starts when

18   you're arrested and -- either at the time of arraignment

19   of, as they said in a subsequent case, when there's a

20   Gerstein probable cause hearing.                In I think every other

21   circuit, the cause of action doesn't end at the time of

22   arraignment.   It continues until the time that you're

23   released from being in custody.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You asked us to take that

25   case and we didn't.

 1                MR. FLAXMAN:        Well, I asked you to consider

 2   damages but I think -- as a question of damages, and

 3   there are many issues related to damages that would have

 4   been presented in question to --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But if that's the

 6   boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one

 7   happen later matter?

 8                MR. FLAXMAN:        Well, the common law false

 9   arrest claim would allow damages up until the time you

10   were released from the imprisonment, which is not at the

11   time of --

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Even on the basis of

13   innocence?

14                MR. FLAXMAN:        Not for a false arrest.        As

15   long as you're not convicted.             So malicious prosecution,

16   you would --

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:           The common law would give

18   damages in a case like this in which the release was

19   basically governed by a suppression which has nothing to

20   do one way or the other with the innocence of that

21   person?

22                MR. FLAXMAN:        That's correct.        The common

23   law element -- malicious prosecution requires that the

24   innocence or grounds not consistent with guilt, but

25   there's no such element in the common law false

 1   imprisonment, which would accrue when you are released

 2   from being in prison, which would benefit Mr. Wallace in

 3   this case.   When the Seventh Circuit talked about there

 4   are three alternatives that we have to choose from, the

 5   proof immediately, the case by case of when it accrues,

 6   or it only accrues at the end of the case, they didn't

 7   consider the fourth possibility of the common law rule

 8   that it occurs when the imprisonment ends.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:         What does somebody like

10   Mr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction

11   where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases.

12   He isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of

13   action accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.

14                MR. FLAXMAN:        But he's not going to file his

15   civil rights claim until his criminal case is over,

16   because he knows and his lawyer will tell him, that's

17   going to hurt you in winning the criminal case, and you

18   should be concerned about that.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But he's never going

20   to know, in the case where there's no statute of

21   limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal

22   case is going to be over because he may never know when

23   it's going to start.

24                MR. FLAXMAN:        Well, if Mr. Wallace had been

25   arrested and released, he would have had two years from

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So what happens if

 4   he files a suit after one year and then after one year

 5   and 350 days he's prosecuted?             His action accrued but

 6   then it didn't accrue?

 7               MR. FLAXMAN:         Well, I would suggest that it

 8   would be the same as when someone is convicted of

 9   battery, and then 10 years later, the victim of the

10   battery dies from the injury caused by the battery.

11   There would be a second prosecution for murder that

12   would not be barred from double jeopardy.                 I think

13   that's Diaz versus United States.                I think --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So his action

15   accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out

16   when they bring the prosecution, it should have never

17   have been brought because it never accrued.

18               MR. FLAXMAN:         No, I think he would have two

19   actions.   He'd have the action for being arrested and

20   then he'd have the action later when the -- when he was

21   seized because of the unlawful -- the fruits of the

22   unlawful arrest.

23               As a practical matter, though, those cases

24   are going to arise even less frequently than the Stone

25   versus Powell cases that are brought properly in Federal

 1   habeas corpus.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:             That problem is solved too

 3   if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested,

 4   and if in fact before the statute of limitations

 5   expires, your client is brought to the court and is

 6   going to be prosecuted.        Tolled.         They don't need two

 7   actions.

 8              MR. FLAXMAN:          A Federal tolling rule would

 9   solve these problems.

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             I want to be sure I

11   understood your position with regard to Justice

12   Kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested

13   and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him

14   up or something like that.          When does that cause of

15   action accrue?

16              MR. FLAXMAN:          At the time they beat him up,

17   unless the beating up relates to an element of the

18   offense.

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Suppose that they had beat

20   him up two or three times.          The first time it didn't

21   relate to it, but then they took him into the

22   interrogation room and they beat him up again.               What

23   about that case?

24              MR. FLAXMAN:          If the beating up is -- if the

25   beating up is related to, used to extort a confession


                                       25

 1   and the confession is used against him, then there would

 2   be a cause of action when the confession is used.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:             So there would be two

 4   causes of action?

 5               MR. FLAXMAN:          Multiple causes, yes.     There

 6   could be at least two.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Would he have to sue on the

 8   first one right away?

 9               MR. FLAXMAN:          If you want to get damages for

10   being beaten up, I would tell my client to sue right

11   away.   I would also tell my client if he's being charged

12   with a serious criminal crime offense, to wait until the

13   criminal case is over, because it will hurt you.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Flaxman, before you

15   save your time, I didn't understand why you're content

16   with Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind

17   that the way he put it is, so long as the -- as the

18   criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute

19   of limitations, how does that help you when the statute

20   of limitations has passed?           Then there's no tolling.

21               MR. FLAXMAN:          But criminal cases are not

22   commenced many, many years after the unlawful arrest, as

23   a practical matter.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And two years doesn't seem

25   to be unheard of.

 1                 MR. FLAXMAN:        Well, if we're talking about

 2   complicated financial crimes, that's not unusual.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You're willing to let those

 4   people go?

 5                 MR. FLAXMAN:        If we're talking about the

 6   kinds of crimes that are involved with this kind of,

 7   with street crime, with murder, armed robbery, rape, the

 8   defendant is not allowed to let them run over two years.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Those are the only

10   defendants you are concerned about?

11                MR. FLAXMAN:         Those are the defendants who

12   get unlawfully arrested and are forced to give

13   confessions.

17                ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON

18                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19                MS. SOLOMON:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

20   and may it please the Court:

21                Our submission this morning rests on the

22   proposition that the victim of an unreasonable search or

23   seizure has the right to sue as soon as that Fourth

24   Amendment violation occurs.             For purposes of accrual of

25   that claim, it does not matter whether the victim is


                                        27

 1   subsequently prosecuted or whether he is subsequently

 2   convicted.     Accordingly, petitioner's Fourth Amendment

 3   claim accrued for purposes of the two-year statute of

 4   limitations as soon as his unlawful arrest and detention

 5   occurred, and his lawsuit filed some nine years later is

 6   time barred.     The claim accrued --

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask, just to get it

 8   straight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a

 9   Fifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and

10   it's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim?                   What about

11   that claim?

12                 MS. SOLOMON:         I believe that the rule for

13   the Fifth Amendment claim, I believe the Court's view in

14   Chavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an

15   element of the claim, the use of that claim at trial.

16   So it would be our view if that is an element of the

17   claim, that that claim would not accrue until trial.

18                 A claim --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What about the beating of

20   the defendant?

21                 MS. SOLOMON:         Exactly.          A claim for

22   conscience shocking techniques to obtain the confession

23   or the excessive force to obtain the confession, both of

24   those claims, and use of the confession at trial is not

25   an element of those claims, and those claims would

 1   accrue at the time of those acts, just like the Fourth

 2   Amendment rule that we urge in this case.

 3              Only where there is a trial right and use of

 4   some evidence at trial, suppression of evidence at

 5   trial, something of that order, if the trial right is

 6   implicated, that claim would not accrue until at trial.

 7   That is different from the Fourth Amendment claim, of

 8   course, because --

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Miss Solomon, do I gather

10   from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth

11   Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue

12   until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a

13   pleading slip on petitioner's part?                       That is, if he had

14   alleged a Fifth Amendment claim based on the coerced

15   confession, then he wouldn't have a statute of

16   limitations problem?

17              MS. SOLOMON:            He brought two claims in his

18   criminal case.   He lost them both in the Illinois

19   Circuit Court at the time of his suppression motion.                       He

20   pursued only one of those on appeal to the Illinois

21   Appellate Court, and the circuit court made findings

22   that the confession was voluntary.                   So at the outset,

23   there were problems with that claim going into Federal

24   court.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                That's a puzzling feature


                                         29

 1   of it, too, because I thought at the end the second time

 2   around, the Court of Appeals held that the confession

 3   was no good.

 4              MS. SOLOMON:           The Illinois Appellate Court

 5   overturned the conviction on the basis that it was

 6   obtained through use of a confession in violation of the

 7   Fourth Amendment only.        The only findings that have ever

 8   been made regarding Mr. Wallace's confession, the

 9   voluntariness of the confession, were made in the

10   Illinois Circuit Court, and the finding was that the

11   confession was voluntary, that it was not coerced.                That

12   finding has never been reviewed.                Petitioner did file

13   both Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims in this civil

14   case, but we did not assert statute of limitations to

15   the Fifth Amendment claim for precisely the reasons that

16   I indicated to Justice Stevens.

17              And for that reason, although the question

18   was presented in the petition, we did not acquiesce in

19   the Fifth Amendment portion of question 1 of the

20   petition, and the court did not grant the Fifth

21   Amendment claim.   So I do not believe -- a short answer,

22   sorry -- I do not believe it was a pleading error.                It

23   is simply that that claim as the litigation developed is

24   not before this Court now, but not through a simple

25   pleading error.    It is a far more weighty problem than

 1   that.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But if the Fifth Amendment

 3   claim were before us, do I understand you to have said

 4   before that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest

 5   would also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth

 6   Amendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth

 7   Amendment claim, so that the statute would not have run

 8   on that?

 9                MS. SOLOMON:         I'm sorry.             If I indicated

10   that, I definitely misspoke.             In our view, all Fourth

11   Amendment claims except for those that do negate an

12   element of the offense, and those are described in

13   footnote 6 of Heck, with that exception, all Fourth

14   Amendment claims should be regarded as accruing at the

15   time that the act that actually violates the Fourth

16   Amendment occurs.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well then, my question is

18   going to be along the same lines.                 Suppose -- I assume

19   this is a rather frequent case -- the confession is

20   alleged to be the product of a beating.                    The two are

21   merged.    If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment

22   claim anyway, then as a matter of policy, matter of

23   convenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment

24   as well?

25                MS. SOLOMON:         Because the rule of accrual is


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that the act -- the claim accrues when the plaintiff

 2   experiences an injury.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, we're making up the

 4   rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon.              I'm asking, if we have to

 5   wait for one, why not wait for the other?

 6                 MS. SOLOMON:        Well, with respect, Justice

 7   Kennedy, I don't believe the Court is making up a rule

 8   of accrual.    I think those rules are quite well settled.

 9   Cases like Ricks and Chardon make clear, and the Fourth

10   Amendment cases make clear that a Fourth Amendment

11   violation, unlike the Fifth, where evidence is used at

12   trial, the Fourth Amendment claim violation is fully

13   accomplished at the time of the illegal search or

14   seizure.   Anything --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Who is the defendant in a

16   Fifth Amendment claim?        Is it the policemen who

17   extracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who

18   introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?

19                 MS. SOLOMON:        Well, the prosecutor would be

20   absolutely immune, of course.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

22                 MS. SOLOMON:        And some of those cases are

23   brought against the police officers.                     But, the reasons

24   that would suggest a certain accrual date for the Fifth

25   Amendment claim are very different from the reasons that


                                        32

 1   dictate the accrual of the Fourth Amendment claim at the

 2   time -- the only action the petitioner alleges violated

 3   the Fourth Amendment in this case was when his detention

 4   at the police station, which was consensual at the

 5   outset, became unconsensual, became involuntary at some

 6   point before he confessed.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But if he had also brought

 8   a Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be

 9   as follows:

10                 Number one, his Fourth Amendment claim, the

11   running of the statute, the Fourth Amendment claim would

12   be unaffected by that, so that would have to have been

13   brought within the two-year period.

14                 MS. SOLOMON:        That's correct.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Number two, I'm assuming,

16   and this is what I want you to tell me whether my

17   assumption is right -- I am assuming that if a Fifth

18   Amendment claim were brought by -- no, strike the

19   assumption.

20                 You, I take it, would -- let me ask a

21   different question.      I take it you would agree that so

22   long as a criminal case was pending, that it would be

23   sensible and maybe required for the court simply to

24   abstain from any proceedings on the Fourth Amendment

25   claim.

 1                 MS. SOLOMON:         We do -- our position is that

 2   they do occur when they happen and they must be filed

 3   within the limitations, yes.

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you would agree that

 5   the court, if there's a criminal case going on, I take

 6   it you would agree that the court should not proceed to

 7   trial in the 1983 action.

 8                 MS. SOLOMON:         If there is a Fourth Amendment

 9   claim being raised in the criminal case, and of course,

10   it might not be, but that is a very easy --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's the problem.        I

12   don't know if it is easy.            It seems to me if you take

13   your point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call

14   it an unconstitutional action allegedly.                  So, I don't

15   want to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and

16   Fifth.     On January 1 the event occurs.

17                 Then you say you have two years to file your

18   claim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for

19   example.

20                 Then that happens.              Let's say two months

21   later they file it.       The defendant files it.             A month

22   after that, there is a state criminal proceeding.                  Now,

23   you're the Federal judge.            What's supposed to happen?

24   It sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under

25   your theory, is going to have to make a decision.                  He's


                                         34

 1   going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's

 2   being argued in my court that the policemen did

 3   something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct,

 4   that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the

 5   correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that

 6   the conviction if there is a conviction in the state

 7   court later, will necessarily be vitiated.                  If the

 8   answer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead;

 9   is that right?

10              MS. SOLOMON:           Justice Breyer, that is

11   correct.

12              JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.       If that's

13   correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem,

14   whether we do it through a set of abstention rules,

15   which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it

16   won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal

17   tolling rules.

18              I don't see any way to get to a sensible

19   result here without either having clear abstention

20   rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I

21   suggested before.    Am I right?             If I'm wrong, let me

22   know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?

23              MS. SOLOMON:           I think those are essentially

24   the two choices, with one caveat.                 We would call it an

25   accrual rule as opposed to a tolling rule, for the

 1   reason that this court has always respected the tolling

 2   rules that states have whereas accrual is a Federal

 3   question.

 4               But with that slight caveat, I do believe

 5   that those are the two main options.                   But I don't

 6   believe the Court should be indifferent as between them.

 7   There are very serious practical reasons weighing down

 8   on our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and

 9   filing not immediately, of course -- the case need only

10   be filed within the period of the statute of

11   limitations.

12               Thereafter it might well be that some cases,

13   maybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a

14   stay of some sort while the Federal -- excuse me --

15   while the criminal case is ongoing.

16               But that question, figuring out whether a

17   stay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a

18   ongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out

19   than whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether

20   it's critical evidence, whether there was other

21   evidence.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I suppose -- correct me if

23   I'm wrong -- when the district court wants to determine

24   if he should hold something in abeyance, this is not

25   necessarily abstention; this is what courts always do

 1   when there are multiple actions.                 Other action pending

 2   is a general ground for a court to stay its hand.

 3              MS. SOLOMON:            That's exactly right, Justice

 4   Kennedy, and it's also --

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I suppose it would

 6   make a difference to the officers, a principle of

 7   equitable tolling.      They don't know if they're going to

 8   be sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long.                    Under an

 9   accrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're

10   going to be facing a civil action or not.

11              MS. SOLOMON:            That is the second major

12   advantage that we see to our rule, Chief Justice

13   Roberts.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:               If you do it with a stay, I

15   mean, I see that disadvantage.                If you do it with a

16   stay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there

17   with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence,

18   think what's going to happen in the trial at the

19   criminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then

20   make a determination.        It sounds like a very difficult

21   decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it

22   wrong, sometimes they'll get it right.                    The defendant

23   might be arguing two different things, you know, one in

24   the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the

25   other to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal

 1   court.

 2                 What do you --

 3                 MS. SOLOMON:        Accepting your earlier

 4   construct where there really are essentially two rules,

 5   we either delay accrual or we --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           If you delay accrual by

 7   tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some

 8   instances the policemen won't know for quite a while

 9   whether the case is being brought.                  That's true; and in

10   the other instance, he won't know for quite a while how

11   the case is going to come out, which may be worse.                 But

12   you don't have any uncertainty.               You have no

13   uncertainty.    You would know once the man is released.

14   It's no tolling.    Once he's convicted, it's tolled.

15   Then the conviction comes in.              Not tolled until they

16   bring a proceeding.

17                 MS. SOLOMON:        The rule that we propose,

18   which is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some

19   sort if the Fourth Amendment claim is being actively

20   litigated in the state court at that time, has two

21   advantages.

22                 The first is that it does serve the purposes

23   that all statutes of limitations serve, which is it puts

24   the defendant on notice you are now the defendant in a

25   lawsuit, you should be marshalling your evidence, you


                                        38

 1   should be preserving your records, and you are not in

 2   repose.

 3                 This Court has respected those as very

 4   important interests.        They are absolutely not served by

 5   a rule of delayed accrual.            At the same time, the rule

 6   to allow a stay where necessary - as I indicated, it's

 7   not going to be all of the cases, and it's far easier to

 8   figure it out.     The Federal district court figures it

 9   out by having the defendant, the criminal defendant, who

10   is a plaintiff in his court, come in and is asked a

11   question:     Are you currently --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 They're not going to

13   waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay

14   or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in

15   state court.     I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not

16   like they're looking for cases.                They're going to say in

17   most cases:     Stay granted, come back when this is over.

18   They don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation

19   with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter

20   whether they're precisely right or wrong.                   I mean, if

21   it's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to

22   me there's much prejudice from that.

23                 MS. SOLOMON:         Well, that's correct, Your

24   Honor, and we wouldn't have any objection to a rule

25   that --

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But isn't there this

 2   practical problem?      I think what you say fits together

 3   beautifully with regard to the law, but isn't it true

 4   that this will give an incentive in every criminal case

 5   for the defendant to file a 1983 action.                  So we may

 6   multiply the number of Federal cases that are filed and

 7   then sit there while a criminal case proceeds.

 8               MS. SOLOMON:           I think the assumption, Your

 9   Honor, should be that the number of cases is going to be

10   the same either way.        It's just a question of when are

11   they filed and, moreover --

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, if your opponent's

13   rule is adopted, they wouldn't file unless -- if they

14   get convicted and the conviction stands up, the case

15   would never be filed.

16               MS. SOLOMON:           Well, it's curious that they

17   make that argument, because of course every victim of a

18   Fourth Amendment violation has the right to damages for

19   at least the invasion of their privacy, for the

20   antecedent conduct between the time of arrest and

21   charging.   At a minimum, Mr. Wallace had that coming to

22   him because he was, according to the Illinois appellate

23   court, illegally seized.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:              The thing I just want you

25   to comment on is, my thought is every person arrested

 1   has a potential, and something follows and so forth, has

 2   a potential Fourth Amendment claim, even though he may

 3   not have one on the merits.             It just seems to me that

 4   there's a potential here of an awful lot of what may

 5   turn out to be frivolous claims filed, but it would seem

 6   to be routine procedure for defense lawyers who want to

 7   make a suppression motion to say, well, I better file my

 8   1983 case at the same time.             So you might get literally

 9   hundreds and hundreds of cases.

10                 MS. SOLOMON:        With respect, Your Honor,

11   we'll take that chance for the benefits that the statute

12   of limitations does bring to the officer.                And as far as

13   the burden on the court, whether all cases are stayed or

14   some cases are stayed, of course, we're content to have

15   this Court or the district court handling the case

16   figure that out.

17                 But the main point that I would make is that

18   a rule of delayed accrual wholly undermines the purposes

19   of the statute of limitations, and where the plaintiff's

20   interest, the claimant's interests, can be served, as I

21   indicated, at a minimum every victim of a Fourth

22   Amendment violation has the right to some damages.                That

23   is actually precisely why we say that Fourth Amendment

24   claims do not necessarily imply the invalidity of the

25   conviction.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I had missed Mr. Flaxman's

 2   point that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to

 3   say, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this

 4   case?     My initial reaction as the defense counsel, I

 5   would love that comment.           I would tell the jury:            Of

 6   course, it's our duty as counsel to point out that my

 7   client was beaten, he was terrified, he was beaten

 8   again, he had a false confession, and the damages we're

 9   not interested in; we'll get much more damages if you

10   convict and we show this 15 years later because the

11   policemen lied as they always do.                  You know, you hear

12   it.

13                 MS. SOLOMON:         It may be not in a --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But he has tried more of

15   these cases than I have and he indicates this is a

16   serious concern.

17                 MS. SOLOMON:         He has tried way more of them

18   than I have as well, and I can't speak to that

19   specifically.    It's not an argument that was ever made

20   in the briefs.     But again, I have no reason to believe

21   that the Federal district court can't take account of

22   whatever it needs to take account of in order to

23   avoid --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, no.         This is the Cook

25   County.    This is the Cook County court.

 1                 MS. SOLOMON:         Yes.       Yes, I understand.        But

 2   all that has to happen, of course, is that the complaint

 3   be put on file in the Federal court.                      It's notice

 4   pleading.     It can be a very, very long complaint.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, but he says the fact

 6   of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order

 7   to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim

 8   of a beating.

 9                 MS. SOLOMON:         Well, but as I indicated,

10   every victim of a Fourth Amendment rights, even those

11   who are guilty, even those who are convicted -- that's

12   the Herring case.     Herring exactly shows --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, but the point is if

14   the complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes

15   that point.

16                 MS. SOLOMON:         I would imagine that it would

17   cut both ways in many cases, Your Honor.                     I'm sorry, I

18   can't speak to it more specifically than that.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Does your position in

20   this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?

21                 MS. SOLOMON:         It does, Your Honor,

22   absolutely.    Equitable tolling is always available in an

23   extraordinary case when the plaintiff could not put a

24   complaint on file within the period of the statute of

25   limitations.    And unlike the accrual question, as


                                         43

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   indicated a moment ago, the tolling is governed by the

 2   states.    In this case, for example, because Mr. Wallace

 3   was only 15 years old at the time of the arrest, his

 4   claim was tolled.    He actually had nearly four years

 5   beyond the two-year statute of limitations to put a

 6   complaint on file and it still would have been toll --

 7   would have been timely.         He filed outside even that

 8   time.

 9                Illinois does not toll for prisoners, but

10   many states do, as the Court indicated in the Hardin

11   case.    So there's all sorts of tolling available,            or

12   could be under state law.           Mr. Wallace has actually

13   never urged tolling in this case and I assume that

14   that's because there is no basis for that under state

15   law.    He did get the advantage already of the time when

16   he was a minor and there is no other basis under

17   Illinois law that would allow him any basis for tolling.

18                But of course, tolling is proper when the

19   plaintiff does not know and could not know that his

20   rights were violated.       If Mr. Wallace was illegally

21   seized, he was right there when it happened.             He might

22   not have known that a court would ultimately accept his

23   argument on that, but of course the plaintiff never has

24   a right to be told that he has a successful claim before

25   he brings that claim.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is there any remedy that

 2   Illinois law provides for a case like this where a

 3   person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is

 4   ultimately released because the state never had enough

 5   evidence to try him in the first place?

 6              MS. SOLOMON:          In many cases, the state law

 7   of malicious prosecution will provide a remedy.              Of

 8   course, in Illinois and in all states, it requires

 9   favorable termination.       In this case, of course,

10   petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show

11   favorable termination because the circumstances under

12   which the criminal case ended did not -- were not

13   consistent with a favorable termination.

14              But, of course, he would have had a Fourth

15   Amendment claim if he had filed it timely.              He would

16   have had a state law malicious prosecution claim if he

17   had been able to show favorable termination.              In states

18   that don't have malicious prosecution, perhaps there

19   would be a due process claim as well.

20              The result that there are no damages

21   available to somebody when the conviction is overturned

22   solely by operation of the exclusionary rule, however,

23   should not be troubling because the conviction itself,

24   of course, was not an independent violation of the

25   Constitution.   Petitioner did receive the benefit of the

 1   exclusionary rule.      His conviction was overturned.

 2   We're not aware of any case indicating that deterrence

 3   purposes would require both the exclusion of evidence

 4   and a damages claim.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would it ever be proper

 6   for a district court to insist on proceeding to the

 7   merits of the claim, to dispose of the merits of the

 8   claim, while the prosecution was pending?                       Suppose the

 9   district court thought that it was seeing too many of

10   these claims and it wanted to get to the bottom of them?

11                 MS. SOLOMON:         Well, in our experience the

12   district courts don't tend to want to go ahead.                       But I

13   would suppose that if the -- if the court did, rules of

14   comity are sufficient to allow the state courts to have

15   the first crack at issues that are arising in the

16   criminal cases, to be the ones that --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We haven't written about

18   that other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and

19   in Younger?    That's about it?

20                 MS. SOLOMON:         In Heck and in Younger.

21   There's the concurrence in Deacons against Monahan

22   indicates that a claim for damages should be stayed and

23   not dismissed or gone forward with.                       Justice White's

24   concurrence specifically addressed the difference

25   between dismissing and going forward with the claim.                        Of

 1   course, the footnotes 8 and 9 in the Heck opinion are

 2   very powerful indications of the weighty reasons.      We

 3   have no reason to think that the district court would

 4   want to charge ahead with a claim that would -- with a

 5   case that will only get simpler if it waits for the

 6   state court proceedings to conclude, as well as of

 7   course the comity and respect for the state courts.

 8              In this case, of course, as I mentioned,

 9   the -- Mr. Wallace always had a claim available to him

10   for his initial seizure regardless of the outcome of his

11   criminal prosecution.     If he wanted to seek damages for

12   that prosecution and our primary submission, part one of

13   our brief is even assuming those damage might be

14   available on a Fourth Amendment claim, he was

15   nevertheless obligated to bring that claim within the

16   period of the statute of limitations, because otherwise

17   it would be time barred.

18                In our view, petitioner does not have

19   one claim for that arrest and another claim for his

20   trial and prosecution.      He has one claim for a Fourth

21   Amendment violation with two elements of damages.      But

22   mounting future or delayed damages do not delay accrual.

23   Even where the plaintiff does not know the full extent

24   of his injuries, he still must sue within the period of

25   the statute of limitations.

 1                  In fact, petitioner does not cite a

 2   single case including the ones newly arrived in the

 3   reply brief that uses either his accrual rule or his

 4   damages rule to award damages for the entire time of a

 5   lengthy period of incarceration.               And as I indicated

 6   petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show

 7   favorable termination.       And although he could have

 8   obtained some damages had he brought his claim timely,

 9   his claim did accrue he was seized and not when the

10   charges --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you agree with Judge

12   Wood that the limitation on damages would be from the

13   period, from the time of the arrest until the

14   arraignment?   That would be the measure and nothing

15   after?

16                MS. SOLOMON:        A number of courts have

17   reached that result, Your Honor.               Footnote 25 recites

18   five court of appeals decisions to that effect.               But our

19   primary submission in this Court is that regardless of

20   the damages that are available on a Fourth Amendment

21   claim, that the mounting of damages did not delay

22   accrual, and without a timely claim, it doesn't matter

23   what damages the plaintiff is seeking.

24                The reference in Heck to a claim for damages

25   for unconstitutional conviction, we take to be a

 1   shorthand for a claim of some sort of constitutional

 2   violation that can be brought through the vehicle of

 3   Section 1983 that would enable the plaintiff to recover

 4   damages for the incarceration.              1983 of course itself

 5   does not create any substantive rights.                 The plaintiff

 6   needs an underlying claim and in this case of course the

 7   plaintiff only has the Fourth Amendment claim.

 8                We do have, in our brief and argument why

 9   the Fourth Amendment should not be regarded as allowing

10   those damages, but our primary submission and we do

11   think the Court can decide the case without -- without

12   reaching that issue.

13                The only date to delay an accrual in this

14   case was the date that the charges were nol prossed.

15   But that date is meaningless for the Fourth Amendment

16   and it is therefore meaningless for accrual.                    We would

17   the judgment be affirmed.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

19   Ms. Solomon.

20                Mr. Flaxman, you have four minutes

21   remaining.

22           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN

23                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

24                MR. FLAXMAN:        The issue that has been

25   sitting in this case like the elephant in the room is


                                       49

 1   what is Mr. Wallace's cause of action?                     Is it a cause of

 2   action for being seized until he was arraigned?                     Or is

 3   it a cause of action for being seized for the eight and

 4   a half years that he was locked up until he was, the

 5   criminal case was resolved in his favor?

 6                 My sister argues that it was just, the

 7   Federal remedy is only until you're being arraigned, and

 8   that the state remedy for malicious prosecution doesn't

 9   exist if the Seventh Circuit has construed Illinois law

10   to say that there is no malicious prosecution when you

11   win the Federal case, when you win the criminal case,

12   because the evidence has been suppressed.                     The false

13   imprisonment, state false imprisonment was dismissed by

14   the district court, under his reading of Illinois law

15   that the cause of action accrued at the time of the

16   arrest.   Not at the time he was released.                    And the

17   Seventh Circuit when that issue was raised on appeal to

18   them in a brief by both sides chose to reject it without

19   discussion.

20                 What, the cause of action that respondent

21   proposes is none, for the eight and a half year seizure.

22   There is no state cause of action in Illinois.                     And

23   there is no Federal cause of action.                     It is just tough.

24   You are seized for eight and a half years, and you can't

25   go to state court, you can't go to Federal court.                        You

 1   should have sued immediately after you were arrested to

 2   get a little bit of damages, but that's all you can get.

 3   And have a nice day; we're sorry.

 4              That, I don't think is consistent with Heck.

 5   I don't think it is consistent with this Court's

 6   jurisprudence about the meaning of Section 1983.           I

 7   don't think it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment

 8   and it should not be the rule that the Court adopts.

 9              The statute of limitations problem isn't

10   really a problem because all of the evidence that's

11   material to the legality of the arrest, to the legality

12   and the -- whether the confession was the proximate --

13   was proximately caused by the arrest or proximately

14   caused by the incarceration, has been developed in the

15   criminal case.    When there's very strong interest in

16   seeing that the facts are fully determined and fairly

17   determined for both sides.           It is not that the police

18   officer who sued eight -- eight and a half years later

19   is much less is much less prejudiced than Mr. Wallace

20   is, who comes out of prison after eight and a half years

21   with no remedy.

22              The questions about the multiple causes of

23   action that can arise:        if you're beaten, you have to

24   sue immediately after you're beaten; if you're beaten

25   but a confession is extorted from you, your right to sue

 1   starts with the confession is used against you at

 2   trial -- and if there's some constitutional violation

 3   which necessarily impairs the conviction, then you can

 4   sue after you successfully defended a criminal case --

 5   is really an administrative nightmare that really could

 6   be solved by a Federal tolling rule that all Section

 7   1983 cases are tolled; the statute does not start to run

 8   until the criminal case has been resolved.

 9               In most cases, then, instead of being filed

10   in district court --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That in effect is saying

12   we can't have a statute of limitations rule; we're just

13   going to laches, we're just going to an equitable rule.

14               MR. FLAXMAN:         Well --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We're just throwing up our

16   hands and saying there is statute of limitations statute

17   of limitations.

18               MR. FLAXMAN:         No, there is a statute of

19   limitations.   It starts to run when the criminal case is

20   over.   That will weed out all of the really nonsensical

21   cases that would otherwise be filed under respondent's

22   rule, when you file the 1983 action the same day you

23   file the motion to suppress and the district judge says

24   well, this goes on my state calendar of 5,000 cases and

25   the clerk's office is troubled with collecting the $350

 2   by paying those installments every time there's $10 in

 4   more important things for the courts, the prisons to do.
