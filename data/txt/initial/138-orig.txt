 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We will hear

 4   argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original

 5   docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina.

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 9               MR. FREDERICK:          Thank you,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11               South Carolina seeks an equitable

12   apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River.

13   Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users

14   of the river within their boundaries.

15               For three reasons, this Court should not

16   adopt the Special Master's recommendation that

17   Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply

18   Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this

19   original action:

20               First, the report articulates the wrong

21   legal test for intervention.            Second, under the New

22   Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities

23   should be permitted to intervene.            And, third, the

24   report's approach to intervention involves this Court in

25   deciding intramural disputes between and among water

                                     3

 1   users in one State.

 2               With respect to the first point, the Special

 3   Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in

 4   deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should

 5   be allowed to intervene as a party.

 6               The Special Master sought to distill from

 7   this Court's cases three principles that we would submit

 8   are not the appropriate principles in deciding an

 9   intervenor's status.

10               First, the report overemphasizes the, quote,

11   "direct stake," although the master found that the

12   equitable apportionment had no specific impact on

13   individual users of the water.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I thought your

15   friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard

16   applied?

17               MR. FREDERICK:            Your Honor, part of what you

18   will be deciding in this case is the appropriate

19   standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we

20   respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New

21   York factors.   Instead, the report distilled from other

22   cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the

23   principles that she thought should apply to govern an

24   intervenor's status, and those three principles, we

25   would submit, are incorrect.

 1                Under the New Jersey v. New York standard,

 2   the master did not make findings that would be

 3   appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as

 4   appropriate parties.    There was no finding of inadequate

 5   representation by either State to support any of the

 6   intervenor's request to participate as parties.           There

 7   was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense

 8   that it was truly compelling.           It's hard to argue in

 9   cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in

10   the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors

11   would have met the compelling interest standard here.

12                And, finally, the New York-New Jersey

13   standard talks about having interests that are apart

14   from other interests.    But both Charlotte and the

15   Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on

16   behalf of all users of North Carolina water.           They

17   simply happen to be the largest ones.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mr. Frederick, we -- we had

19   a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in

20   which it was a State against State case, but we allowed

21   the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene.

22                Now, why is that any different from this

23   case?

24                MR. FREDERICK:         First, the interests were

25   different.   They were not an equitable apportionment

                                     5

 1   where the water --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why does that make any

 3   difference?

 4                 MR. FREDERICK:         This Court has said for 200

 5   years that water is a unique resource within the

 6   sovereign control of States.

 7                 In the Maryland case, the Court permitted

 8   intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued

 9   the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a

10   declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional.

11   There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in

12   Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and

13   eight other States who were not parens patriae of the

14   various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed

15   the original action, I think the Court appropriately

16   considered that interests of judicial efficiency called

17   for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the

18   original action in this case.

19                 And finally, the Court only devoted two

20   sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey

21   v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the

22   intervention.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes, well, these ­ these

24   are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to

25   when we are going to allow intervention or not?           Do ­-

 1   is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if

 2   I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected

 3   intervention that has been recommended by the Special

 4   Master?

 5               MR. FREDERICK:           I don't think I can recall a

 6   case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to

 7   Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court

 8   rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana

 9   citizens as parties in an original action over

10   Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an

11   interstate bridge.   And the reason --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I understand your

13   basic argument that each State should represent its own

14   constituents.   But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply

15   Project in a different category?            Because it straddles

16   both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it

17   would be treated as a stepchild by both States.

18               MR. FREDERICK:           No, in fact,

19   Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest

20   claim to intervention in this case.

21               Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union

22   County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part

23   of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District,

24   should be permitted to have water purchased from the

25   South Carolina side of the boundary.                So what's

                                      7

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   happening with that water project is the water is sucked

 2   out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union

 3   County's consumption under a Union County permit with

 4   the State of North Carolina.              Union County, therefore,

 5   is acting as any other user of water, along with

 6   Charlotte and all other users of water in North

 7   Carolina.

 8                  The Catawba Project is not here to intervene

 9   to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of

10   the boundary.     Those are adequately protected, we

11   submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the

12   State.     So in effect the Union County, North Carolina,

13   claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which

14   they are seeking to protect through their intervention

15   is no different than the other interests of North

16   Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect --

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, except that these --

18   these three entities are the principal entities that are

19   guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially

20   what the -- what the dispute is about.

21                  MR. FREDERICK:         The dispute is about the

22   transfer of water and consumption of water in toto.              The

23   Court --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, but the focus -- the

25   focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers,

                                       8

 1   isn't it?

 2               MR. FREDERICK:         The focus of the complaint

 3   highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they

 4   are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out

 5   of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be

 6   counted on --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Exactly.     And these three

 8   entities account for a very large proportion of those

 9   interbasin transfers.   Isn't it the case that any -- any

10   decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will

11   necessarily impact directly these three entities?

12               MR. FREDERICK:         No.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why not?

14               MR. FREDERICK:         Because in an equitable

15   apportionment case, this Court decides which share of

16   the water is allocable to each State.            It is a question

17   of State law how each State shall determine the

18   intrastate allocations of the water.            So --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:         I understand that, but I'm

20   talking about the real world.            If -- if indeed North

21   Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of

22   this Court says that it's taking too much because of

23   interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three

24   entities are going to be out of luck.

25               MR. FREDERICK:         We take the real world, Your

                                    9

 1   Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases

 2   tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding

 3   an equitable apportionment between two States -- water,

 4   of course, is fungible.    It's a series of molecules that

 5   do not accord property rights in any one entity or user.

 6   They all divine from the State itself.

 7               So if North Carolina, in its exercise of

 8   parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte

 9   should have a larger share than what it currently has,

10   that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as

11   a political entity to decide among its users.           It does

12   not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an

13   equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will

14   ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is.           That is

15   not what we are seeking, and that's not what an

16   injunction from this Court equitably apportioning the

17   Catawba River would necessarily decide.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are you --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Frederick, if this

20   were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the

21   rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in

22   dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect

23   to the trial judge's determination.

24               So even though the civil rules are not

25   binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a

                                   10

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   sound approach that we should adopt?             Just as a court of

 2   appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so

 3   we should give a healthy measure of deference to the

 4   Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful.

 5               MR. FREDERICK:        No, for several reasons,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.   First, in any appellate review

 7   Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal

 8   test that would be applied.         Our initial submission is

 9   the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test.

10   So you would first need to determine, we would submit,

11   what is the correct legal test for submission.            That is

12   a de novo review standard.

13               But secondly, the Court has said in numerous

14   original cases it does not apply deference, although it

15   gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so

16   there would be no basis for applying a deference

17   standard to a special master ruling on a question of law

18   that fundamentally is about what this Court's original

19   jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:         But, in fact, we've never

21   rejected a special master's desire to -- to have

22   intervenors in the case.

23               MR. FREDERICK:        Well, virtually every case,

24   Justice Scalia --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:         And that oil case that I

                                    11

 1   mentioned.   I forget the name of it.            The tax --

 2                MR. FREDERICK:       Maryland v. Louisiana.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.     What had the Special

 4   Master recommended in that case?

 5                MR. FREDERICK:       There was actually no

 6   special master recommendation in that case.            The Court

 7   decided it on its motion directly to this Court.

 8                Virtually all of the cases that we cited in

 9   the blue brief highlight the fact that special masters

10   routinely reject motions to intervene.            It is the rare

11   situation in which a special master would allow

12   intervention.

13                And the only example that the other side can

14   come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which

15   finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating

16   in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to

17   intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be

18   tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and

19   that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate.            You

20   --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Frederick, can we go

22   back a little?   I think you just said there was no

23   special master's recommendation in

24   Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745.            In

25   the footnote 21, it said:       "The master recommended that

                                    12

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   we grant the motion of 17 pipeline companies to

 2   intervene as plaintiffs."        And then it says:       "It is not

 3   unusual to permit intervention of private parties in

 4   original actions."

 5               MR. FREDERICK:         And the case that it cited

 6   is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from

 7   this Court's docket in the 1920s.             What the Court

 8   decided in 1932, Justice Ginsburg, in the Wyoming and

 9   Colorado case was that in situations involving

10   interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users

11   of a State are deemed to be represented by the State.

12   The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case

13   was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether

14   States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility

15   to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water.

16               The Maryland case, as I said before, did not

17   analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would

18   submit that in light of the other circumstances of the

19   case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge

20   involving Federal, State, and private companies, in

 1   were parties in the case.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I -- I guess I

 3   haven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's first

 4   question about whether there was a recommendation from

 5   the Special Master or not.

 6                MR. FREDERICK:       Well, I -- I will -- I

 7   obviously forgot about footnote 21 of the Court's

 8   opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg.                But

 9   I think --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, I don't know

11   that you've actually addressed the operative question of

12   what amount of discretion, if any, are we going to give

13   to special masters to determine when they require the

14   presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read

15   the Special Master to be suggesting.               These are the

16   three biggest users of water, at least one of them

17   straddles both States, another has a potential license.

18   And so that each of them has a different situation than

19   a normal water user.

20                So, you're -- all you're begging is the

21   question of whether we just say you can't.               But why is

22   the "you can't" compelled, either by our case law or by

23   any original jurisdiction principle?

24                MR. FREDERICK:       Well, let's start with the

25   original jurisdiction principle.           Those are actions that

                                    14

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction,

 2   which this Court could sit without a special master

 3   and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of

 4   nine.   The fact that it appoints a special master to

 5   assist and facilitate that effort does not imbue the

 6   actions of that person delegated that responsibility

 7   with something akin to the deference given to district

 8   judges in making various fact findings.

 9               Secondly, on a question of law, as

10   intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are

11   talking about the scope and contours of this Court's

12   exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has

13   said is that there are two interests that are ultimately

14   being protected:   One is the dignity interest of the

15   State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject,

16   water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is

17   doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it

18   allows the Court to expect each State to represent

19   adequately all of the users of water in that State.

20               So, for those reasons, we think that a

21   special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with

22   the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a

23   special master's --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, we've -- we've

25   allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States.

                                      15

 1   We have allowed one State to sue another State and a

 2   private party.

 3                MR. FREDERICK:        Not in an equitable

 4   apportionment.    And -- and I think the -- the scope of

 5   the relief is important.       And that is because the State

 6   seeking the relief is assuming the risk that the relief

 7   that it wants to get from that State is an inadequate

 8   form of relief.

 9                Here the form of relief South Carolina seeks

10   goes only against North Carolina.             We cannot get an

11   equitable apportionment with Charlotte or the Catawba

12   Project.   We can only get it from North Carolina.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I see your light's on, but

15   can we take this case on the assumption that nothing

16   that you obtain in the way of relief will affect Duke

17   Power under the comprehensive relicensing agreement?

18                MR. FREDERICK:          Yes --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Don't we have to take the

20   case on the assumption that their rights under that

21   agreement might be affected?

22                MR. FREDERICK:        They might be affected, but

23   only in an ancillary way.        It is an -- part of an

24   application to the FERC.       The FERC here is saying it

25   does not affect it because the license itself will not

                                     16

 1   dictate minimum --

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But are you saying you are

 3   not seeking a result that's inconsistent in any way

 4   with that agreement?

 5               MR. FREDERICK:         Neither the agreement ­- and

 6   this is at page 51 to 52 of our brief, citing 39 of the

 7   CRA -- says it doesn't affect water rights.                The final

 8   environmental impact statement from FERC says it doesn't

 9   affect apportionment interstate issues.                Both FERC and

10   the CRA itself disclaim any impact on the equitable

11   apportionment action pending here.

12               If I could save the balance of my time.

16                ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

20               MR. MILLER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22               In order to intervene in an original action

23   in this Court, a citizen of a State that is a party to

24   the action must show a compelling interest, separate

25   from that of other citizens, that is not properly

                                     17

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   represented by the State.        In an equitable apportionment

 2   action, the interest that is at stake is not a private

 3   property interest in water.          Rather, it is the sovereign

 4   interest of a State in a particular share of the

 5   waters of an interstate river.           For that reason, a

 6   private interest in water is not an appropriate basis

 7   for intervention in such a proceeding.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        It depends on, I suppose,

 9   on what you mean by "is not properly represented by the

10   State."    If you think the State does not have a

11   sufficient interest to defend that -- that particular

12   right vigorously, might that not be -- might not that

13   qualify?

14                 MR. MILLER:    Well, I think that the interest

15   that the private party has is a State law property

16   interest in water, and that's an interest that simply

17   isn't at stake in an equitable apportionment action.

18   The only thing that this Court is deciding is what share

19   of the river does each State get.

20                 The Court in an equitable apportionment

21   action does not decide the purely intrastate question of

22   how will that share be allocated.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        I think you could say that

24   realistically when you are talking about an individual

25   water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal

                                     18

 1   resident of Charlotte perhaps.         But when you are talking

 2   about the biggest entities that are going to be affected

 3   by the apportionment, it really doesn't ring true to me.

 4               MR. MILLER:    Well, that -- I mean, in New

 5   Jersey v. New York, Philadelphia, which sought to

 6   intervene in that case, constituted a majority of the

 7   water users within the State of Philadelphia.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Did the special master

 9   think Philadelphia should have been let in?

10               MR. MILLER:    I don't recall what the special

11   master --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:        The answer is no.

13               MR. MILLER:    -- said in that case.        But this

14   Court has held in, for example, Colorado v. New Mexico,

15   that even on purely factual questions, the special

16   master is -- who makes recommendations, and those

17   recommendations are reviewed by this Court de novo.          The

18   Court is not sitting in an appellate capacity.          This is

19   a case within its original jurisdiction, and this Court

20   has an independent responsibility to make a

21   determination, even on factual questions and a fortiori

22   on questions of intervention.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes, but we haven't -- we

24   haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what

25   would facilitate the proceeding.          Much of the discovery

                                   19

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   in the case has already focused on these three entities,

 2   hasn't it?

 3                MR. MILLER:    That's right.        And to the

 4   extent --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:        So to say that they are

 6   just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is ­- is

 7   really very unrealistic.

 8                MR. MILLER:    Well, to the -- I mean, to the

 9   extent that they have valuable information to provide,

10   third-party discovery can take account of that, as can

11   amicus participation.      It would be entirely appropriate

12   for parties that have information or a special

13   perspective on the case to present an amicus submission

14   to the Special Master or to this Court.           And it's -- but

15   that -- that's not a basis for allowing them to become

16   full parties through intervention.

17                And then, to the extent that there's a

18   concern about the management of this case, I think it's

19   important to keep in mind that the rule recommended by

20   the Special Master and the rule that the would-be

21   intervenors are urging this Court to adopt would, of

22   course, apply not just in this litigation, but in every

23   equitable apportionment action.           And not only does it

24   make the litigation of those actions much more difficult

25   to have additional non-State parties in, but it makes it

                                    20

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   much more difficult for those cases to be settled.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, if that -- if and

 3   when that is the case, the Special Master will not want

 4   them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters

 5   have not wanted them to come in, in the past.           I don't

 6   think that's going to change.

 7               MR. MILLER:     I -- I guess what I would

 8   say is that I don't think that, either in the

 9   recommendation of the Special Master in this case or in

10   the submissions of the -- the would-be intervenors, that

11   there's really any logical limiting principle that

12   would not allow, as a matter of routine, large water

13   users to come in to equitable apportionment actions.

14               And that's inappropriate for the more

15   fundamental reason that these original actions in this

16   Court are not ordinary cases.           This Court has said that

17   sitting in judgment between two sovereigns is one of the

18   most grave -- grave and delicate responsibilities the

19   Court has, and it's a sparingly exercised jurisdiction

20   reserved for the most serious of issues, issues of such

21   importance that, if the States were independent

22   countries, would be resolved through treaties or --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:         But not reserved

24   exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and

25   another State.   We've allowed it to cover suits between

                                    21

 1   a State and another State and private citizens of the

 2   other State.

 3                MR. MILLER:    Yes.        And when a State brings

 4   such an action or seeks to bring such an action, it

 5   can't simply file a complaint as of right.           It has to

 6   seek this Court's permission to file the complaint.              And

 7   this Court can review the complaint at that time and

 8   look at who the parties are and figure out whether it's

 9   an appropriate case for the exercise of this Court's

10   jurisdiction.   And that, in our view, is a much more

11   appropriate way to proceed, making that determination at

12   the outset on the basis of the State's complaint, rather

13   than through piecemeal litigation as different non-State

14   parties --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, here the complaint

16   was South Carolina's complaint, and these are

17   intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's

18   side.

19                MR. MILLER:    That's where they were seeking

20   to intervene on North Carolina's side as defendants.

21   That's right.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And as representing the

23   position of the United States, would you address the

24   FERC license that Duke Energy is raising?

25                MR. MILLER:    Yes, Your Honor.        Under section

                                    22

 1   27 of the Federal Power Act, which is 16 U.S.C. 821, the

 2   Power Act does not affect State law water rights.         So

 3   State law water rights are taken as a given, and it's up

 4   to the licensee to have the necessary State water

 5   rights, and a FERC license does not in any way alter the

 6   distribution of State law property rights in water.

 7               And what the commission has said in this

 8   case in the final environmental impact statement with

 9   respect to Duke's relicensing application, which is

10   available on the commission Web site, it cited section

11   27 and it said:   "Any license that is issued will not

12   impose requirements, including minimum flows, that

13   infringe on water rights or apportionments."         So the

14   commission is aware of the pendency of this case.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, it isn't a matter of

16   infringing on water rights or apportionments.         I mean,

17   that does not exclude, it seems to me, the revocation of

18   the license or the denial of a renewal of the license

19   because Duke Power does not have enough water.         That

20   wouldn't preclude that, would it?

21               MR. MILLER:     Well, the -- the nature of this

22   proceeding makes that outcome not -- not something that

23   would happen even if South Carolina were to prevail,

24   because what South Carolina is seeking is to get more

25   water flowing downstream to it, and so the -- the

                                    23

 1   licensing conditions, which generally impose minimum

 2   flow requirements at each of the various dams operated

 3   by Duke, would be easier to satisfy, not harder to

 4   satisfy, if South Carolina were -- had an entitlement to

 5   get even more water flowing through --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't -- I don't

 7   understand that.   I don't understand that.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What happens to North

 9   Carolina if it has less water?          What does it do with

10   respect to Duke?

11               MR. MILLER:     Well, Duke -- Duke's dams ­-

12   the licensing condition is that each dam allow a certain

13   amount of water to flow through, under the current

14   license that they are operating under, and there are

15   different minimum flow requirements under the renewal

16   license that is being sought.           But an order in effect

17   requiring that they let more water flow through would

18   not be in conflict with the licensing requirement, but

19   --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, why --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And why isn't Duke

22   Power -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then?

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               They have smart

25   lawyers.

 1               MR. MILLER:    Well, they -- I mean, one

 2   possibility is, of course, that Duke is -- in addition

 3   to obviously being an operator of dams, Duke is a very

 4   large consumer of water.     In fact, it's the largest

 5   consumer of water on the Catawba system because of its

 6   coal and nuclear power plants which use water

 7   evaporatively for cooling of the power plants.         So --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, it may also mean it

 9   when it has to increase the outflow, the level of its

10   impoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability to

11   generate power, which in turn may -- may affect its

12   license.

13               MR. MILLER:    It -- it may have some effect

14   on its ability to -- to generate power.         But that makes

15   it a large industrial user of water, akin to those that

16   the Court referred to in New Jersey v. New York, which

17   were not entitled to intervene.

18               I would also point out in further response,

19   Mr. Chief Justice, to your question, that Duke is a

20   North Carolina corporation, which may be why it's

21   seeking to come in on the North Carolina side of this

22   case.

23               But I -- I want to return to the idea that

24   these kinds of cases are not ordinary cases.         They

25   involve sovereign interests, and I think what's

                                   25

 1   important about that is that the interest --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Miller, if I -- if I

 3   understood your argument, you are saying that Duke's

 4   interests are really with South Carolina, or -- to

 5   increase the flow.     But I would think then it would be

 6   North Carolina who would be objecting to their

 7   participation in the case rather than South Carolina.

 8   And they don't.   They -- they welcomed them in, as I

10               MR. MILLER:      As I said, Duke is an operator

11   of thermal power plants that are large consumers of

12   water, and some of those are located in North Carolina.

15         ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CHRISTOPHER BARTOLOMUCCI

16                 ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENORS

17               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:             Thank you,

18   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

19               The Special Master correctly concluded that

20   Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply

21   Project should intervene in this original action.                Her

22   recommendation deserves some deference because she is in

23   the best position to know whether these parties would

24   assist her in the adjudication of this complex dispute.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                This is our original

 1   jurisdiction.     I regard the Special Master as more akin

 2   to a law clerk than a district judge.              We don't defer to

 3   somebody who's an aide that we have assigned to help us

 4   gather things here.     I think on legal questions of

 5   intervention we have to decide de novo.

 6               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:             Our claim is not that the

 7   Special Master should get deference on legal questions,

 8   but she should get deference on -- on the narrow

 9   question of whether it would be helpful to her to have

10   these intervenors in the case.            She has --

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But tell me what she

12   said that makes them helpful.             What can they provide

13   that couldn't be done by merely an amici submission?

14               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:             Well, she pointed out,

15   for example, that Duke Energy, which controls the flow

16   of this river and is participating in the FERC

17   proceedings, would establish a -- a direct link between

18   this adjudication and what's going on before the FERC.

19   And of course those two proceedings have -- have a lot

20   of interaction.    I think it's also fair to --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, your adversary has

22   just said none, according to the terms of the license

23   and what the FERC has said.           So why is -- why don't we

24   just take what FERC has said --

25               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:             Oh, I think --

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- at face value?

 2                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          I think FERC has not said

 3   that there will be no effect, that there would be no

 4   effect upon the licensing proceeding from the original

 5   action.   There could be a conflict between the decree

 6   that comes down, if one comes down in this Court, and

 7   the terms of the FERC license.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes, I think all FERC said

 9   is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would

10   require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina.

11   And that's quite different from whether -- whether a

12   severe reduction in the water that Duke can use would --

13   would affect the -- the nature of the license given by

14   FERC.

15                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Well, Duke of course

16   pulled together 69 other stakeholders to join the

17   comprehensive relicensing agreement to -- to smooth

18   FERC's acceptance of -- of the new license.               And this

19   original action is -- will pit the two Carolinas, each

20   of which seeks to maximize their share of the river, and

21   those interests work at odds with the CRA, which

22   endorses a compromise middle flow position that ­- that

23   neither of the Carolinas seeks to defend in this action.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, let me tell

25   you what I'm very worried about.           This is our original

 1   jurisdiction, a delicate jurisdiction that allows us to

 2   resolve disputes between sovereign States.            And I look

 3   out and I see all sorts of private parties intervening

 4   in a way that would give them party status.            And I think

 5   that's compromising what our original jurisdiction is

 6   supposed to be about.

 7                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Mr. Chief Justice,

 8   private parties and cities have intervened in the past

 9   in original actions and have been named as defendants in

10   original actions.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But even in the New

12   Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that

13   would have allowed the intervention did say that in

14   general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction

15   cases with non-State parties.            That was even the

16   dissenters.   So you start out with in general it's not

17   wise to let these people come in.

18                 And following up on the Chief's question, a

19   State can't be sued without its consent.            And it's true

20   here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but

21   it's initiating the action against a sister State.             The

22   Special Master's recommendation would require the State

23   to have as its direct adversary three parties who are

24   not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion

25   of original jurisdiction.        It's a controversy between

                                     29

 1   two States.

 2                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           Well, in -- Justice

 3   Ginsburg, in the case of New Jersey v. New York, New

 4   York City was a party defendant, and in this case the

 5   City of Charlotte occupies the exact same position as

 6   New York City.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That's because the State

 8   chose

 9   to sue it as a party defendant.

10                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           It did, but of course a

11   State can only sue a proper party defendant.                 Whether

12   the question is intervention or whether it's naming a

13   city as a defendant in an original action, both have to

14   pass the test of is this city or non-State a proper

15   party defendant?

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You're -- all of the

17   intervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to make

18   sure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right?

19                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           That -- that is not their

20   exclusive interest.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, their -- well,

22   they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water.

23                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           No.      Duke Energy, for

24   example, doesn't have an interest in maximizing the flow

25   on the North Carolina side of the river.                 Duke's -- Duke

 1   Energy's interest is in preserving the -- the flow

 2   compromise reflected in the CRA.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well -- to the

 4   extent they have differing interests, why aren't those

 5   interests fully satisfied by amicus participation?

 6                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Well, when -- when South

 7   Carolina first opposed, for example, Charlotte's motion

 8   to intervene, it said:     Oh, Charlotte, you can file an

 9   amicus brief as to any dispositive motion.               Well, that

10   kind of amicus participation is vastly different from

11   being able to shape the record on which the -- the key

12   issues in this case are finally decided.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Shape the record,

14   but intervention status would give you the right to

15   appeal, right?

16                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          It would allow us to seek

17   leave to file exceptions to an --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Right, and appeal

19   the normal case.

20                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Yes.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, that's my

22   question.   If we grant intervention in this type of case

23   and there is no reason it would be three -- I mean, in

24   the next case, it could be 20 different intervenors, and

25   they are filing exceptions every other week that we have

                                    31

 1   to review and adjudicate because they are not bound by

 2   whether or not the State that is on their side wants to

 3   file exceptions.

 4               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Well, let me say two

 5   things, Mr. Chief Justice:       If the proposed decree

 6   affects the interests of Charlotte or the joint venture

 7   or Duke, I think they ought to be allowed to file

 8   exceptions, which this Court can grant leave or not.

 9               As to the specter of 20 possible

10   intervenors --

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So how does that get us

12   to avoid involvement in interstate -- intrastate

13   disputes over water use?     That just drags us right into

14   your problems among your water users.

15               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Well, South Carolina and

16   the United States present this vision of an equitable

17   apportionment action in which the Special Master simply

18   divides up the flow of the river, and then it's up to

19   each State to subdivide among its users.

20               But that is not what has happened in

21   equitable apportionment cases.         In New Jersey v. New

22   York, for example, this Court entered a decree, which

23   enjoined the flow of the Delaware River to New York City

24   above a specified level.     I think 411 cubic feet per

25   second.

                                   32

                                  Official


 1                And -- and that is the kind of decree that

 2   South Carolina, I believe, is seeking in this case.               If

 3   you look at paragraph 2 of South Carolina's prayer for

 4   relief, they want an injunction against the interbasin

 5   transfers currently being carried -- carried out by

 6   Charlotte and the joint venture.           So this --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And North Carolina,

 8   as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of its

 9   constituents as it sees fit.

10                You and your fellow prospective intervenors

11   just have to do what citizens do all the time, which is

12   convince North Carolina, one, and you can help them, to

13   get as much water as they can; and, two, when they get

14   it or if they lose it, whatever they are left it, to

15   give it to you, rather than the other parties.

16                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Well, as to Duke --

17   Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained, Duke's interest is

18   not in maximizing the share -- North Carolina's share of

19   the river.

20                The joint venture of the Catawba River Water

21   Supply Project is not represented by either State

22   because it's a bi-State entity.           Neither -- and both of

23   the Carolinas is -- are affirmatively hostile to part of

24   the operations of the joint venture.

25                When the joint venture --

                                    33

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, then that's ­-

 2   then I just wonder why you are here in an original

 3   action.

 4                  What you are saying is they have all sorts

 5   of different interests, and it just -- they get to skip

 6   district court.     They get to skip the court of appeals.

 7   They can just come right in here, as if they were a

 8   State, and participate in the case.

 9                  MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   I think this -- this is not a novel proposition.                 The

11   City of Port Arthur was allowed to intervene in the case

12   of Texas v. Louisiana.

13                  Five Indian tribes intervened in Arizona v.

14   California, and New York City was allowed to be a party

15   defendant in the New Jersey case, even though the Court

16   could have dismissed it from the case, as it did to the

17   Indiana citizens in --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You are advocating a

19   rule that says, almost, you have a right to intervene

20   because you have an interest that won't be adequately

21   represented.

22                  MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          We --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Is that your position?

24   Then what happens to the Special Master who says, no, I

25   don't want all you guys here?             How do we say that that

                                      34

 1   master abused his or her discretion by saying no?

 2               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           We are saying that the

 3   Special Master got it right, when she said that you have

 4   to show a compelling interest that's not properly

 5   represented by a party State, and she applied the New

 6   Jersey v. New York test, finding, at page 27 of her

 7   report, that neither Charlotte nor the joint venture

 8   are properly represented.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So you see the issue

10   before us as being was she right or wrong, even though

11   Nevada said -- I'm sorry -- that North Carolina said

12   that it was going to adequately represent each of these

13   interests, but that just wasn't correct?

14               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           I think the question

15   is --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That North Carolina is

17   not telling us the truth?

18               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           I think the question is,

19   should the Court accept the Special Master's

20   recommendation?   And I would disagree with South

21   Carolina, when it says that she applied the wrong legal

22   test.

23               She did apply New Jersey v. New York.              She

24   did find that the intervenors were not properly

25   represented by the party States.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             You don't --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The intervenors -- the

 3   intervenors are users of the water from the river?

 4                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          But not mere users.     Their

 5   status is special.    Duke, of course, is unique.

 6   It controls the flow of the river, and there's no one

 7   else like Duke on the Catawba.

 8                 The other two intervenors are the cause of

 9   the harm for which South Carolina seeks injunctive

10   relief.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          They -- because they use

12   a lot of water.    And my question is:             How do we decide

13   once we say -- beyond the Special Master can let these

14   people in with party status -- what users can come in

15   where, obviously, we are not going to allow all users of

16   the river water to come in, so which ones can and which

17   ones can't?

18                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Certainly, our position

19   is not that mere users of water or all users of water

20   may intervene in original action.

21                 You have to show a compelling interest

22   that's not properly represented, and that's going to

23   depend upon the specific facts of the case.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        And is it automatic then?

25   Is it automatic then?     Or is it just that, when that

 1   condition is met, the Special Master can permit the

 2   intervention?

 3               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          No, Justice Scalia.      I

 4   would say it's not automatic because there are some

 5   other considerations the Special Master can bring to

 6   bear.

 7   For example, timeliness -- you can't show up 20 years

 8   after the litigation has started, like the City of

 9   Philadelphia, and expect to get in.             You --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:        And, also, how helpful the

11   intervention will be to the management of the case.

12               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Correct.     Or, conversely,

13   how --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:        And, of course, the Special

15   Master's determination of that is not final.             It's

16   ultimately up to us.

17               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          That's correct.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:        But it is a discretionary

19   intervention you are arguing for, not a mandatory one.

20               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          It is discretionary, and

21   if -- if the Special Master believes that -- that this

22   complex multiyear water rights dispute would be aided by

23   the presence of a -- of a limited number of intervenors

24   who have a very special interest in the case, then

25   that's something that, for institutional --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, what's special

 2   about it?   I mean, let's say I own a little farm on

 3   the banks of the Catawba, and I take water out to -- so

 4   the cows have something to drink, why does Charlotte get

 5   a special status just because they take a lot?

 6               I'm affected by how much water runs through

 7   there.

 8               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:            Well, Charlotte has

 9   special status because South Carolina seeks specific

10   relief -- injunctive relief -- against Charlotte's

11   interbasin transfer.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, and that

13   relief will affect how much water is available for me to

14   draw out and use on my farm.            That's a compelling

15   interest.

16               I -- you know, in times of drought, this

17   water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, the

18   farm is going to go down.       It seems to me that, when you

19   say they have a special interest, you are just saying

20   they have got a big interest.

21               MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:            It's not just that it's

22   -- it's a big interest, and it surely is, but they are

23   singled out in South Carolina's complaint, and

24   injunctive relief is sought against them, which, I

25   think, brings into the play the rule this Court

                                    38

 1   announced in Kentucky v. Indiana, which is that, if a

 2   plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is

 3   seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that

 4   citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the

 5   litigation and defend its interests.

 6                 That's what Charlotte is seeking in this

 7   case.   The joint venture, of course, is not represented

 8   by either State fully because both States are hostile to

 9   at least part of what the joint venture does.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, let's say the

11   interest -- the dispute is really in effect between

12   company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South

13   Carolina.    I mean, do we -- we would not accept an

14   original action if they sued each other, right?

15                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          No -- well, of course ­-

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do we let them just

17   use the States as, you know, a façade to get into

18   this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here?

19                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          No.      As in Kentucky v.

20   Indiana, if there are improper parties in original

21   action, they -- they can be dismissed, but I think it's

22   noteworthy that the Court allowed the New Jersey

23   litigation to proceed with New York City as a party

24   defendant.

25                 And Charlotte's position is truly

                                     39

 1   indistinguishable from the position of -- of New York

 2   City in that action, with -- with the sole exception

 3   that Charlotte seeks to intervene, whereas New York City

 4   was named as a party defendant.

 5                 South Carolina invokes the principle that it

 6   is the master of its complaint, and we would agree with

 7   that, in part.    A plaintiff is the master of the

 8   allegations in claims it seeks to make, but a plaintiff

 9   is not a master of the universe of -- of interests that

10   -- that may be affected by the lawsuit they have -- they

11   have brought.    That's --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Do you think the same --

13   the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a

14   private party defendant, as you would urge for

15   intervention by a private party defendant?

16                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Yes.     I think there would

17   be a very similar analysis.          I think that the question

18   whether a proposed defendant -- and of course, you need

19     leave from this Court to file an original action or to

20   name someone as a defendant in an original action.               I

21   think, in both cases, it raises the question:               Is ­- is

22   this entity a proper party defendant or is the entity a

23   proper

24   intervenor?

25                 I think it's a similar analysis.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question:

 2   In what respect does the relief sought against the city

 3   differ from the relief sought against the State?

 4                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           In this respect, Justice

 5   Stevens:   The -- the complaint prays for North Carolina

 6   to stop authorizing the interbasin transfers being

 7   carried out by Charlotte and the joint venture.               But --

 8   but Charlotte and the joint venture are the entities

 9   whose primary conduct, if you will, would be affected by

10   that injunction.   They are the parties who are carrying

11   out the interbasin transfers, and they would have to

12   stop those transfers if -- if authorization was

13   withdrawn by North Carolina.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Wouldn't it ­ would

15   it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that

16   all the issue that she was going to address was the

17   relative equitable apportionment between North Carolina

18   and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina

19   wanted an injunction directed against the City of

20   Charlotte, that's up to North Carolina?              North Carolina

21   can divvy up its water however it wants.

22                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           I think it would not be

23   surprising if she came down -- if she were to come down

24   with a decree, it would not be surprising that -- that

25   it would decide whether or not to allow Charlotte's

                                    41

 1   interbasin transfers to continue.

 2                 Because that's -- that was much like what

 3   was decided, for example, in New Jersey v. New York.

 4   There was the proposed diversion of water to New York

 5   City, and the Court there ultimately entered a partial

 6   injunction that banned flows to New York City above a

 7   certain level.    So --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, in -- in deciding

 9   what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the

10   -- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master,

11   initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one

12   State or the other are not equitable uses --

13                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          And, Justice Scalia --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- and go beyond what is

15   reasonable.    So I don't see how you could decide the

16   case without deciding whether especially particularly

17   massive uses are appropriate or not.

18                 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:          Not just massive.

19   There's -- it's no accident that South Carolina focuses

20   upon these interbasin transfers, because they inflict a

21   special injury, in South Carolina's view.

22                 The interbasin transfers take water out of

23   the river basin, and -- and so it doesn't come back to

24   South Carolina within the basin.            Other types of uses of

25   water are non-consumptive, in the sense that the water

                                     42

 1   can be treated and eventually gets to South Carolina

 2   within that basin.

 3                But South Carolina has targeted these

 4   interbasin transfers because they are entirely,

 5   100 percent consumptive, in the sense that -- that once

 6   the water has left the basin --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Dead losses to South

 8   Carolina.

 9                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           -- it does -- it does not

10   come back.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:         What is the percentage,

12   approximately, of the river that flows into South

13   Carolina that the three intervenors account for?

14                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           I don't think I have done

15   that math, Justice Breyer.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, about.

17                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           Yes.     I can tell you that

18   Charlotte's authorization is -- is 33 million gallons a

19   day.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:         Out of what?       Out of what?

21                MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           Well, the flow of the

22   River -- the minimum flow of the river, under the ­-

23   under the CRA is 1100 cubic feet per second, so

24   unfortunately you'd have to -- you'd have to convert from

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, I mean, do they

 2   account for, like -- there's a certain amount of water

 3   in dispute.     There are some people who want to

 4   intervene.     Are the people who intervene -- do they

 5   account more like 1 percent of all the water that's in

 6   dispute, or do they account for more like 50 percent?

 7                  That seems like a pretty relevant question

 8   to me.

 9                  MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           Well, I -- it's a

10   significant proportion.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            You must have some idea.

12                  MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:            It's a significant

13   proportion.    It's not --

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, significant ­ is

15   that more like 3 percent, or is it more like 90 percent?

16   I mean, nobody has ever bothered to look at that in this

17   whole case?

18                  MR. BARTOLOMUCCI:           Well, I haven't done that

19   calculation.     I will say that they are significant

20   enough that South Carolina seeks a specific injunction

21   against those interbasin transfers.

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        And I guess it depends on

23   what you mean by the water in dispute.              If the main

24   gravamen of the complaint is interbasin transfers, they

25   -- they occupy a huge proportion of that.

 1   Scalia asked Mr. Frederick, but I think his response

 2   needs clarification from North Carolina's perspective.

 3                  The first question dealt with Maryland v.

 4   Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case,

 5   in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to

 6   intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in

 7   that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to

 8   those 17 pipeline companies.              That is factually

 9   incorrect.     In that case, two of those pipeline

10   companies -- the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Company was

11   a resident of the State of Michigan, one of the

12   complaining States in that case, as well as the National

13   Gas Pipeline Company of America was an Illinois

14   corporation.

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Maryland v.

16   Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies,

17   and they were allowed to intervene.                This is not that.

18   This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of

19   the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with

20   the water whatever it will.

21                  It strikes me as very different than

22   Maryland v. Louisiana.

23                  MR. BROWNING:      Your Honor, in Maryland v.

24   Louisiana, that was a taxation case, a case that goes to

25   a fundamental interest of the States, the power of

 1   taxation.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Did -- did the decree only

 3   apply to taxing these particular companies?                 Could the

 4   -- could the State have taxed other companies after the

 5   decree issued?

 6                 MR. BROWNING:       Yes, Your Honor, as the

 7   Plaintiff States were seeking to attack the Louisiana

 8   tax at issue.     So it would have general applicability.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               As -- as the

10   allocation would in this case, presumably.

11                   MR. BROWNING:       Well, I don't -- and that

12   question --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Is that yes or no?          I --

14   you say yes, it would have general applicability.

15                 MR. BROWNING:       Yes, Your Honor.          Yes,

16   Justice Scalia.

17                 Your Honor, South Carolina has said that

18   this case is about consumption of water in toto.                   But

19   when you look at their bill of complaint, that is simply

20   not the case.     When you look at the question presented

21   in their leave for -- their motion for leave to file a

22   bill of complaint, it starts out whether North

23   Carolina's interbasin transfer statute is invalid under

24   the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.

25   And when you look at the allegations in the bill of

 4   interbasin transfers.      We --

 8   about is interbasin transfers and that you account for

 9   100 percent of them, you three.              Is that -- is that

10   right?   Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody

11   might tell me it's not right.

19   look, if Alaska sued California and the complaint was we

 6               MR. BROWNING:         Yes, Your Honor.          The -- the

 7   two intervenors that have interbasin transfers account

 8   for the vast majority of the water that is consumed as a

 9   result of an interbasin transfer.

10               In the 2006 study that was done by Duke

11   Energy, the largest interbasin transfer is the City of

12   Charlotte at 9 million gallons per day.                 The second --

15   more to the answer.     I'm sorry.

16               Private parties are going to hijack our

17   original jurisdiction, and it was highlighted for me

18   when I read your motion, the motion of private parties

19   for divided argument.      Your proposal was that they be

20   divided 10, 10, and 10.       You didn't even want to be

21   here.

22               As they view the case and as you view the

23   case, it's got so little to do with the State that the

24   State didn't even want to come here and argue the case.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You thought their

 4   participation here before this Court on a question in

 5   original jurisdiction was more important than yours, and

 6   you represent the State.

 7                MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, the intervention

 8   motion directly affects each of these intervenors, and

 9   they have a right to be heard with respect to that

10   intervention motion.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why can't you

12   represent them?

13                   MR. BROWNING:       Well --

14                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             They are your

15   constituents.     You are the State.           You are coming here

16   directly, not even going to district court, and you seem

17   to be ceding your sovereignty over to them.

18                MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, we do not believe

19   that we are ceding our sovereignty.                With respect to

20   Duke Energy and the Catawba River Water Supply Project,

21   North Carolina does not and cannot adequately represent

22   their interests with respect to Duke Energy.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Why?

24                MR. BROWNING:        Okay, with respect to Duke

 2   controls the flow of the river into South Carolina.                    As

 3   --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But you are going to

 5   defend all of their interests as it affects North

 6   Carolina, right?     You are not incapable of protecting

 7   their North Carolina interests.

 8                  MR. BROWNING:      Your Honor, their

 9   interests are inseparable, specifically with regard to

10   Duke Energy.

11                  Duke negotiated, over a period of several

12   years, a comprehensive relicensing agreement, with

13   various agencies of North Carolina, various agencies of

14   South Carolina, and stakeholders up and down this river.

15                  As a result of that negotiated agreement,

16   there was -- the CRA was put in place, which is

17   essentially a request that FERC issue a license in

18   accordance with the provisions of that agreement.

19                  That agreement would set a minimum flow of

20   water into South Carolina that is much, much higher than

21   the previous license.      Now, South Carolina has come into

22   Court and has attacked that agreement.

23                  Duke has a very real and substantial

24   interest with respect to that agreement.                 But --

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What is -- what's

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You are standing

 4   there telling me why Duke has an interest.               What's North

 5   Carolina's interest?

 6               MR. BROWNING:       Your Honor, North Carolina

 7   will defend these interbasin transfers, but with respect

 8   to Duke Energy, we are not aligned with Duke Energy

 9   because Duke has a very real interest in preserving --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So oppose their

11   intervention.

12               MR. BROWNING:       Well, we believe that they

13   have a right to be heard because of their compelling

14   interests that are affected in this case.

15               South Carolina is seeking to change the CRA,

16   to have a flow of water that is much higher than is set

17   out in the CRA.   Although North Carolina supports --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Isn't it your interest

19   to -- to resist that?

20               MR. BROWNING:       Yes, Your Honor.          Not only

21   are we resisting that --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And your interest is

23   to defend the CRA, right?

24               MR. BROWNING:       Your Honor, North Carolina

25   will resist having South Carolina have a greater flow

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You haven't answered my

 3   question.

 4               MR. BROWNING:        I'm sorry.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Is it in your interest

 6   not to support the CRA?

 7               MR. BROWNING:        Yes, Your Honor.     It is in

 8   our interest because even --

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You would like -- you

10   would like, in this litigation against the two States,

11   for the Special Master to undo the -- your obligations

12   under the CRA?

13               MR. BROWNING:        That will, ultimately, be our

14   request in this case because South Carolina has attacked

15   that agreement.

16               From North Carolina's perspective, South

17   Carolina is receiving much more water under this

18   negotiated agreement than they could ever hope to

19   achieve in an equitable apportionment action.

20               So at the end of the day, we will be asking

21   this Court to issue a decree that sets a flow of

22   water less than --

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So you are prepared to

24   tell us right now -- this is what you are saying to us:

 4   the same thing with respect to your city?

 5                MR. BROWNING:      With respect --

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And to your -- and to

 7   the CRWSP?

 8                MR. BROWNING:      With respect to the city, we

 9   have said in our briefs that we will defend this

10   interbasin transfer.   We believe that we will represent

11   the City of Charlotte with respect to that regard, but

12   we also support their intervention motions because we do

13   not believe that it would result in them impeaching the

14   interests of North Carolina.

15                And more importantly, the Special Master got

16   it right, that there is -- this is a specific attack on

17   the City of Charlotte and its unique interests.               It is

18   seeking injunctive relief that will cripple the largest

19   city in North and South Carolina.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, if it's an

21   attack on -- if it's an attack on Charlotte, I would

22   expect the State to be standing there protecting it and

23   not feel that they can't do that without Charlotte,

24   itself, coming into the case.

25                MR. BROWNING:      Your Honor, we will defend

                                    54

 1   this interbasin transfer, but the fact of the matter is

 2   injunctive relief is sought as against Charlotte, and

 3   there is something to be said for fairness in allowing

 4   that entity to be present in this Court.

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Are you --

 6                 MR. BROWNING:        Now, turning --

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Are you prepared to say

 8   that you are not adequately defending the interest of

 9   the CRWSP?

10                MR. BROWNING:       Correct, Your Honor, that

11   that is an interstate entity.            It -- its interests have

12   been expressly attacked, the interbasin transfer.              South

13   Carolina singles it out in the bill of complaint.

14   What's more important --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You haven't answered my

16   question.    You said, with Duke, that you won't support

17   --

18                MR. BROWNING:       Yes.      We --

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- them.     Are you not

20   going to support this -- the joint venture in property?

21                MR. BROWNING:       We -- we cannot represent the

22   interests of the joint venture.            They have an interbasin

23   transfer, pursuant to the North Carolina statute for

24   Union County.

25                But what the complaint doesn't disclose is

                                     55

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that the other half of that joint venture also has an

 2   interbasin transfer with respect to Lancaster County,

 3   South Carolina.

 4               So South Carolina can hardly attack the

 5   Union County interbasin transfer while simultaneously

 6   defending the Lancaster County, South Carolina,

 7   interbasin transfer.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let's go back to the

 9   question of couldn't the Special Master receive the

10   information she wants if these three entities come in as

11   amici?

12               Coming in as intervenors, they have full

13   party status.   They can engage in discovery.           They can

14   protract the case.     They can appeal any adverse

15   judgment.

16               Why isn't the most reasonable accommodation

17   to say, well, we will listen to you, but we are not

18   going to give you full party status?

19               MR. BROWNING:        Your Honor, if that were

20   the -- the standard, there would never be intervention

21   motions in any of these proceedings.

22               The fact of the matter is that these

23   entities have unique interests, and with respect to two

24   of those interests -- Duke Energy and the Catawba River

25   Water Supply Project -- their interests are not

                                     56

 2                All three of them have been expressly

 3   attacked in the complaint, and fairness dictates they

 4   should have an opportunity to be heard.

 8           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 9                     ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

10                MR. FREDERICK:         I have four points,

11   Mr. Chief Justice.     First --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Tell me, are you seeking

13   injunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors?

14                MR. FREDERICK:         No.     We seek an injunction

15   enjoining the interbasin transfer statute to the extent

16   it exceeds North Carolina's equitable apportionment.                 We

17   are here to get our fair share of the river vis-à-vis

18   North Carolina.

19                And Duke's CRA application expressly

20   disclaims any -- any ability to go into the interbasin

21   transfer.   That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion

22   for leave to file exceptions.

23                The FERC has said it will not affect, in

24   giving its license, the equitable apportionment action

25   now pending before you.

                                      57

 1               In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it

 2   does not affect State water uses.              So the only issue

 3   here is whether or not those expressed disclaimers

 4   should be given effect when South Carolina is simply

 5   seeking to determine, as between the two States, the

 6   rights.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But it affects the

 8   agreement on which the license is based.             The license

 9   was based upon a very hard negotiated agreement among a

10   number of entities.

11               MR. FREDERICK:          The license hasn't been

12   issued, Justice Scalia.       It's still pending.

13               And that's what FERC has before it, and FERC

14   has said that the CRA will not affect what license is

15   issued, but I want to go back to a fundamental --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Are you willing to

17   concede that if whatever you ask for here affects that

18   license, once its issued, that then Duke's

19   intervention is proper?

20               MR. FREDERICK:          No, because the United

21   States can enter -- can affect the interests and

22   represent the interests of its licensees.

23               Duke's interest is completely derivative of

24   the United States' power to confer a license on an

25   energy producer.   And the United States here is saying,

                                      58

 1   no, they should not be allowed to intervene.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:        I thought Duke said the

 3   problem is not the United States -- so much the United

 4   States granting a license.       It's the license we

 5   requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among a

 6   number of entities, and that agreement goes out the

 7   window once -- on the basis of this lawsuit.

 8               MR. FREDERICK:       The agreement is a private

 9   contract among various water users, and it is no

10   different than the fact that all users of this river

11   will be affected, one way or the other, by whatever

12   decree this Court issues, whether they are on the South

13   Carolina side or the North Carolina side.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

15               The case is submitted.
