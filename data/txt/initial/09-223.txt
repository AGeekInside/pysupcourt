 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. MIZER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Respondents are natural gas suppliers who

12   object to the way Ohio taxes them.                   Their suit belongs

13   in State court rather than Federal court for two

14   independent reasons.      First, principles of comity and

15   federalism dictate that the State court should resolve

16   challenges to the validity of their own tax laws.                   And

17   second, the Tax Injunction Act squarely prohibits

18   Federal courts from issuing declaratory judgments

19   holding State tax laws unconstitutional.

20               Although either of these grounds would

21   independently support reversal of the Sixth Circuit

22   here, the analysis can really begin and end with the

23   comity doctrine, because that is where the lower courts

24   have shown confusion in the -

 1   have a question that there may be an obvious answer to,

 2   but I haven't found it.          My understanding is -- it's a

 3   standing question.      My understanding is that they are

 4   asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is

 5   to raise the taxes of a competitor.                       Am I right?

 6               MR. MIZER:         That is how they have -- that is

 7   the case, correct.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay.        If that's correct, I

 9   have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard,

10   but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there

11   is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a

12   competitor where the remedy is:                 Raise his taxes.        If

13   there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm

14   surprised that there aren't competitors all over the

15   country doing business out of State bringing diversity

16   cases in Federal court, saying:                 My competitor's taxes

17   should increase; it's all very complicated, but the

18   Commissioner didn't properly follow State law.

19               Now, I have found no case, certainly not in

20   this Court, which said:          Where all you want is to raise

21   the tax of a competitor, you have standing.                      So perhaps

22   this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I

23   would raise that for both of you at the beginning in

24   case there is something you want to say about it, which

25   might save me a little time looking it all up.

 1                 MR. MIZER:      Well, I think there is a good

 2   reason that there -- there aren't cases in the Federal

 3   courts to that effect, but it's not a standing problem.

 4   And to address the standing point directly, it's because

 5   they do claim an injury that is cognizable.                   Under

 6   Dennis v. Higgins, they are claiming a dormant Commerce

 7   Clause injury.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I have no doubt, and the

 9   standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying

10   because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -

11   you must give me reduction in my tax.                    That's what those

12   cases say.    I have no problem with that.                  Absolutely

13   clear.   You can do it.

14                 But where all you want is to raise somebody

15   else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably

16   wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential

17   standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit.

18   And I don't see why you should be able to.                    It seems to

19   me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't

20   surprise.

21                 So there we are.           That's the question.            And

22   you will tell me:    No, it's all clear; they can do it.

23   And I would like some citation or something and explain

24   why they should be able to do it.                  But you don't want

25   to, anyway.    It's really for them.

 1                  MR. MIZER:      I am not aware of any prudential

 2   standing rule, Your Honor, any case, but that's because

 3   the Tax Injunction Act and the comity doctrine have

 4   always prohibited such a case.                And so that's why

 5   there's a lack of citation in the -

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I suppose in

 7   discrimination cases, if there is a discrimination men

 8   versus women one way to resolve it would be to have

 9   either -- either rule apply to both sides.

10                  MR. MIZER:      That's right.               And the Court has

11   said that in cases like Davis and McKesson, where a tax

12   credit has been struck down as unconstitutional for

13   either dormant Commerce Clause or equal protection

14   reasons.   And this Court, in Davis and McKesson, said:

15   Well, you can extend the credit if you wish or you can

16   also contract the credit, but either way -

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           On the other hand, until

18   the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, which -

19   which eliminated all prudential bars to standing -- it

20   clearly was the law that you could not complain about

21   preference, unlawful preference, being given by the

22   government under regulatory provisions to a competitor.

23   The law was:     That's tough.           There was no standing.          And

24   that was a prudential law, I assume.                      And I don't know

25   why it's any different from the tax law.

 1                MR. MIZER:        And cases would have existed

 2   challenging State tax laws, regardless of the APA for

 3   Federal challenges, because the -- and those cases all

 4   would have been adjudicated in the State courts, because

 5   that is where State tax laws and State administrative

 6   procedures are best challenged.

 7                  The -- the rule of comity holds that the

 8   Federal courts should not entertain a challenge to a

 9   State tax law where that challenge would either disrupt

10   the operation of the State tax regime or would intrude

11   into the meaning or application of the State tax law.

12   Both of those elements are true here.                     This suit is

13   disruptive because the suit goes to the very core -

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- State law is unclear

15   here that would require Federal interpretation?

16                  MR. MIZER:      At pages 27 to 33 of the blue

17   brief, we identify all of the ways in which the parties,

18   the State and the Respondents, dispute the application

19   and meaning of State tax law, particularly as to what

20   taxes should be compared for apples and oranges

21   purposes.

22                  And the tax -- the Ohio tax question that's

23   at issue is:     What is a franchise tax versus what is a

24   State tax?

25                  There is also the disruption of the

 1   application of State tax law here, because any remedy

 2   that would be afforded would necessarily alter the way

 3   that the State can -- can tax.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So why can't the Pullman

 5   doctrine or the Burford doctrine, abstention doctrines,

 6   be enough to counsel Federal abstention in this case?

 7   Why do we have to create another exception to Hibbs and

 8   not go to another established abstention doctrine?

 9                MR. MIZER:       The Court doesn't have to create

10   anything, Your Honor, because Fair Assessment and Great

11   Lakes already say that the Burford and Pullman

12   principles get sort of bonus points in the tax context.

13   And then -

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So why did you -- did

15   you argue Pullman in the court below?

16                MR. MIZER:       Yes, the principles of

17   abstention were argued in the district court and -

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              No, no, no, no.   Did you

19   cite Pullman and did you argue it on a Pullman

20   abstention basis?

21                MR. MIZER:       To be frank, I don't know if

22   Pullman was -- was specifically cited, but that's

23   because Fair Assessment itself, which was heavily cited

24   in the lower courts, incorporates the principles of

25   Pullman and Burford and says that these tax questions


                                         8

 1   raise -- that these tax challenges raise questions about

 2   the meaning of State law, about the operation of a

 3   complicated regulatory regime, and so they are better

 4   left to the State court.

 5                The -- the application of the State law here

 6   is particularly disruptive, because the tax laws being

 7   challenged intersect integrally with the regulatory

 8   regime.   Just to give one example, among the taxes that

 9   Respondents are objecting to is the gross receipts tax,

10   which public utilities, the local distribution

11   companies, pay, but the non-public utilities like

12   Respondents do not pay.

13                The gross receipts tax is relevant on both

14   the tax and regulatory side of the ledger, because it's

15   a tax but it's then also a cost that as we explain at

16   page 6 of the blue brief, may be included in the gas

17   cost recovery formula for the rate that the public

18   utilities may charge their customers.                   And those rates

19   are approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

20                So if the gross receipts tax is eliminated,

21   it will affect the regulatory side of things as well.

22   And that distinguishes this case from Hibbs.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:            Do you think it's -- it's

24   correct -- in relation to Hibbs, is it accurate to say

25   that you think that this case is different from Hibbs


                                        9

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   for essentially three reasons:                That this one involves a

 2   complicated analysis of State law and Hibbs did not;

 3   that this one would potentially have a substantial

 4   financial effect on the State and in Hibbs that would

 5   not happen; and this case involves claims under the

 6   dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection rather than

 7   the Establishment Clause?            Does that -- are those -

 8   does that capture it or is there something more?

 9               MR. MIZER:         The first two especially capture

10   it, Your Honor.     And I think the third point is really

11   just an additional explanation of the first two points,

12   because in an establishment clause challenge like Hibbs,

13   the remedy is often going to be very simple.

14               In Hibbs, for example, there was a credit

15   being challenged.     And the Federal court could simply

16   pull the thread of that credit, and the rest of the

17   fabric of the Arizona tax scheme would remain intact.

18   Here, by contrast, if the thread of the gross

19   receipts -- sorry, of the sales tax and the commercial

20   activities tax is pulled, the fabric of the State's

21   taxation and regulatory regime will unravel.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, suppose if this -- you

23   have the dormant Commerce Clause claim and it doesn't

24   require a complicated analysis of State law.               You have

25   different rates of taxation, let's say, for two


                                         10

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   different categories of entities, and it's really not a

 2   very important tax credit, so pulling the thread isn't

 3   going to have much effect.          And this case -- then the

 4   case would come out differently?               Comity would not bar

 5   that action?

 6               MR. MIZER:      I think it would be a much

 7   closer case, Your Honor, but still there would be an

 8   interest in allowing the State courts to resolve that

 9   challenge, because as the Court has explained, when a

10   State court is -- is trying to address a constitutional

11   challenge that involves the application of State law, it

12   can engage in constitutional avoidance in ways that the

13   Federal courts cannot.

14               The State courts also have greater

15   competency, of course, with their own tax law, and they

16   have a greater remedial panoply available to them.

17               So, in your hypothetical, Justice Alito,

18   the -- the Federal court could not order a decrease in

19   the taxes of the challenger because that, as Hibbs

20   explains, would be revenue depleting, whereas if it were

21   in State court, the State court could decrease the

22   revenue -- sorry -- decrease the taxes of the

23   challenger, and then that would allow the State courts

24   most naturally to remedy the -

25              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Let's assume that States

 1   have a law that said, we are going to do different tax

 2   schemes for African Americans than from whites.                   And

 3   they do exactly what is done here.                 They are going to

 4   tax on one thing but not on another.                   They are going to

 5   give an exemption in one area, but not another.

 6               Is that a case that would have to be -- an

 7   equal protection challenge that would have to be decided

 8   in State court?

 9               MR. MIZER:      Fair Assessment says in footnote

10   4 that if it doesn't -- if such a challenge doesn't

11   require scrutiny of the meaning and application of State

12   laws, then it may -- Fair Assessment suggests that such

13   a case might be able to proceed in Federal court.

14               But if the -- if the challenge does require

15   scrutiny of State law or resolution of -- of unclear

16   State law questions, then it should be in State court,

17   and there is no reason -

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I don't know if that is

19   an answer to my question or not.               I -- I -- the only

20   thing I changed in the hypothetical was that the

21   challenge was an equal protection challenge race -

22   based on a suspect classification.                 But the credit

23   system is no different.       Would or would not that

24   require -

25               MR. MIZER:      I see, Your Honor.              And if it

 1   were equally complicated, then it is a challenge that

 2   should go to the State courts, because there is no doubt

 3   that the State court can handle Federal constitutional

 4   questions and along the way, they might be able to

 5   construe the State law in a way that avoids the

 6   constitutional shoals -

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And you reach that

 8   conclusion under the comity principles of Fair

 9   Assessment?

10                 MR. MIZER:       I do, but also because the Tax

11   Injunction Act would exclude the case if it would have

12   revenue depleting effects -

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Revenue depleting.

14                 MR. MIZER:       -- on the State coffers.               And

15   the remedy might, in that case, have such an effect

16   if -- if the -- if the result is to tilt the balance

17   heavily against a party who then needs to have its own

18   taxes assessed.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I am curious to know why

20   neither opinion in Hibbs addressed the comity principle

21   and I would like your view on that.                       I know what you are

22   thinking.     Your answer is:          Well, you tell me, -

23                 (Laughter.)

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- but, why wasn't that

25   addressed in your view?

 1                MR. MIZER:      Well, it was fully briefed in

 2   Hibbs, and that is I think why the Court addressed

 3   comity in footnote 9.      And footnote 9 of Hibbs simply

 4   says that the comity doctrine doesn't cover such a

 5   challenge.   And the explanation, I think, of footnote 9

 6   is that the Court cited both Fair Assessment and Great

 7   Lakes.   And those cases stand for the proposition that

 8   when a -- a tax challenge has a disruptive effect, for

 9   all practical purposes, on the collection or

10   administration of the State tax regime, then comity bars

11   it.

12                And so when the Court in footnote 9 of Hibbs

13   said challenges are barred by comity if they arrest or

14   countermand State tax collection, it was -- it was

15   speaking about the kind of cases at issue.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It wasn't brought up -

17   comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if

18   there was an alleged constitutional violation, then

19   there was only one way to go.             The parochial -- the

20   payments to the parochial schools could not be -- had to

21   be eliminated, so there was no question of abstention

22   versus invalidation or doing something else that was

23   fancy.   That's -- that's why this case is nothing like

24   that, because there was only one way -- only one cure.

25                But you mentioned here there were various

 1   things.   What -- the Federal court could -- is -- is

 2   being asked to increase somebody else's taxes.                  That's a

 3   very strange notion.     But what could the State court do?

 4   The same case in State court -- and let's assume there

 5   is a constitutional violation, either the Commerce

 6   Clause or the equal protection.               What could the State

 7   court do that a Federal court couldn't?

 8               MR. MIZER:       I think there are three options

 9   available to the State court.             First, it could decrease

10   the -- the taxes on the challengers, even if they don't

11   ask for such a decrease.

12               They could also increase the challenges -

13   the taxes on the local distribution companies, or they

14   can do what the Ohio Supreme Court has done in the

15   education context, for example, which is to declare

16   unconstitutionality and then leave it for the General

17   Assembly, the Ohio legislature, to fix the problem and

18   then come back with a remedy.

19               If -- if that kind of relief were ordered by

20   the Federal court, it would mean Federal court oversight

21   essentially of Ohio budgetary processes, which this

22   Court has repeatedly discouraged.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:           May I come back to your

24   answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?                  Would it be

25   beyond the ability of the Arizona courts, had that case

 1   been -- had Hibbs been brought in Arizona, to hold that

 2   under whatever principles of severability Arizona has,

 3   the tax credits for some private schools could not be

 4   stricken without striking the entire provision?

 5               MR. MIZER:         I think the entire provision

 6   would have to be stricken in Hibbs because of the nature

 7   of the as-applied challenge there.                    They were saying

 8   that all the money was going to private schools, private

 9   religious schools.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:             The point is that -- that

11   one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause

12   violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for

13   payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but

14   allow the credits for other private schools.                    But under

15   principles of severability, couldn't an Arizona court

16   say that can't be severed from -- from allowing the

17   credits for payments to secular private schools?

18               MR. MIZER:         That's probably right, Your

19   Honor, and the -- what it illustrates is that often

20   State courts have available to them remedies that

21   Federal courts may not, particularly when plaintiffs

22   have pleaded the case in such a way as to tie one hand

23   behind the Federal court's back.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:             Doesn't that suggest Hibbs

25   should have come out the other way?

 1                  MR. MIZER:      Well, to be frank, Your Honor,

 2   the State of Ohio joined an amicus brief urging the

 3   opposite outcome in Hibbs.             But we are not urging the

 4   overrule of Hibbs here.          We think that, even on Hibbs'

 5   own terms, the Tax Injunction Act applies here to

 6   preclude this challenge in Federal court.                 And to return

 7   to Justice -

 8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If -- just one more.    If

 9   the remedy is likely to be we will leave it up to the

10   legislature -- you had -- you had two or three different

11   optional remedies -- would we say that that is an

12   adequate State remedy?

13                  MR. MIZER:      Yes, I believe so, Your Honor.

14   Because so long as the challenger would be able then to

15   -- to seek some sort of contempt action if the -- if the

16   remedy were not -

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Contempt of the

18   legislature?     Contempt did you say?

19                  MR. MIZER:      Of the -- of the tax

20   commissioner.     If the tax commissioner is continuing to

21   collect unconstitutionally unbalanced taxes, then I

22   should think that there should be some enforceability

23   there.

24                  But the adequacy of the challenge available

25   is -- is measured, as this Court explained in Rosewell,


                                         17

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   purely by procedural measures.               And so for -- in

 2   Rosewell the question was whether or not the parties

 3   could go to State court and would procedurally be able

 4   to get access to State court to resolve their claim and

 5   that is clearly true and no one contests that here.

 6                 The -- to return to Justice Sotomayor's

 7   question about the -- the racial cases, that may seem

 8   troubling, if a racial challenge is excluded from

 9   Federal court, but -- but there is no doubt that State

10   courts can resolve such claims and in fact the Ohio

11   Supreme Court handles tax cases as a routine matter.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Where is -- the cases

13   running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved

14   racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal

15   courts.

16                 MR. MIZER:      They were, Your Honor, and in -

17   in every case that we have examined one of two things

18   was true:    Either the party was claiming standing not

19   based on the fact that he himself was subject to

20   unconstitutional taxes; or the party was not -- did not

21   have an adequate remedy in the State court.              For

22   example, in the Griffin case this Court said that the

23   problem was that in Virginia nothing was being done to

24   remedy the -- the unconstitutional burdens imposed

25   there.    And so the lack of an adequate remedy both under


                                        18

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the comity doctrine and under the Tax Injunction Act

 2   allowed the plaintiffs there access to the Federal

 3   court.

 4               And so the comity rule that we are

 5   advocating, which is clearly laid out in both Fair

 6   Assessment and Great Lakes, would not have any effect on

 7   those cases because of the lack of an adequate remedy.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:           Is there anything -- I see

 9   in their complaint, they ask for "such other relief to

10   which plaintiffs are entitled," and therefore the judge,

11   despite what they say, might just say:                 Well what you

12   are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes.

13               Is that a plausible thing, in which case it

14   would interfere with the revenue collection of the

15   State.

16               MR. MIZER:      We think -

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           What is -- what's your -

18   you better give me your accurate assessment, not just

19   agree with me, because I would like to know what you --

20   I want to know both sides.

21               MR. MIZER:      The Tax Injunction Act would bar

22   the Court, I think, from entering an order that says the

23   taxes on the challengers are decreased, which

24   illustrates the reason that the State of Ohio with its

25   sovereign interest in its own tax policy -

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:              But I have no idea -- why I

 2   am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea

 3   of the underlying State law merits.                       And my suspicion is

 4   in about 10 or 15 minutes I will hear that the State law

 5   merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they

 6   are going to say to us:          Pay fewer taxes.               Rather they

 7   will say to our competitors:              Pay more taxes.           So now is

 8   your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just

 9   in case they make it.

10                  (Laughter.)

11                  MR. MIZER:      Well, first of all, Your Honor,

12   the -- the merits of this case are very much like the

13   merits of General Motors Corporation v.                       Tracy, which

14   this Court decided about 13 years ago.                       But the merits

15   also illustrate the complexity of any remedy that -

16   that would be ordered in this case, because if it's so

17   simple as the Federal court simply saying that the local

18   distribution companies, the public utilities, now must

19   pay the sales tax and the commercial activities tax,

20   then suddenly those entities would be subject to five

21   taxes, a -- a much greater burden then is imposed on the

22   Respondents.

23                  And then the General Assembly would have to

24   go back to the drawing board to adjust the taxes on the

25   local distribution companies.               So even if the simple


                                         20

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   remedy that they ask for is entered by the Federal

 2   courts, still the State of Ohio has to respond by

 3   readjusting its sales tax and its commercial activities

 4   tax; and in that event it first of all could easily end

 5   up in a net revenue loss for the coffers of the State of

 6   Ohio.

 7               It also would mean that the regulatory side

 8   of thing would be affected, which brings us back to the

 9   Burford principles we discussed earlier, because the

10   taxes, as I said, are integrally connected to the way

11   Ohio regulates public utilities.                 And those public

12   utilities have obligations to a captive market that the

13   Respondents don't have to meet.                They serve customers in

14   their area no matter what, whereas Respondents don't

15   have to -

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yes, but this -- but this

17   doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that

18   argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to

19   the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with

20   State regulation.    That -- that's a different doctrine.

21               MR. MIZER:        But Your Honor, I think that

22   Great Lakes and Fair Assessment stand for the

23   proposition that when a Federal court issues an order

24   that invalidates a State tax law, that has a disruptive

25   effect on the collection of taxes; and that would be


                                        21

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   true here because the State of Ohio would no longer be

 2   able -- would not be able to collect five different

 3   taxes from local distribution companies without being -

 4   turning around and facing a new challenge on -- on

 5   unconstitutionality of that burden by the local

 6   distribution companies.

 7                And so the -- the complicated nature of the

 8   tax-regulation interplay here is all the more reason

 9   that this case belongs in State court, for the State

10   courts to resolve those interconnected questions in ways

11   that they are fully equipped to answer.

12                The other factor that was relevant to the

13   Court's analysis -

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm just a little puzzled.

15   I think you are giving the State court an awful lot of

16   power.   Can it do it without new legislation?            They have

17   to adjust these other taxes, maybe the expenses they

18   deduct in their regulatory filings and all the rest.

19   But I don't know that the State court has any more

20   authority to grant a judicial remedy than the Federal

21   court would have.

22                MR. MIZER:       The State court might be able to

23   enter a remedy, Justice Stevens, that is so simple as

24   enjoining the sales tax exemption and the commercial

25   activities tax exemption for local distribution


                                        22

 1   companies, and then also saying that because the LDCs

 2   have to pay those taxes they no longer have to pay the

 3   gross receipts tax and the other two taxes that are

 4   imposed on them.    That's an order that the Federal court

 5   couldn't issue because under principles of both the Tax

 6   Injunction Act and the -- and comity -

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But the Tax Injunction Act

 8   goes to the authority or the jurisdiction of the court

 9   to entertain the case in the first place.                I'm not sure

10   the Tax Injunction Act prohibits the remedy that you

11   describe, because there is a difference between filing

12   the suit and entering relief after the suit's been

13   filed.

14                 MR. MIZER:      With respect, Your Honor, I

15   think that Great -- that Grace Brethren squarely stands

16   for the proposition that a Federal court shouldn't enter

17   an order that says that the State tax law is -- that

18   declares the State tax law unconstitutional and then

19   enjoins it.    And that is exactly what would be required

20   in order to eliminate the additional taxes on local

21   distribution companies.         And that analysis is done at

22   the front end, not at the end after the Court has

23   resolved the constitutional merits and then says, well,

24   I guess I am not able to enter the order that makes the

25   most sense here to resolve the constitutional question.

 7               MR. FITCH:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9               Justice Breyer, if I can go directly to your

10   question with respect to standing.                    Standing has never

11   been raised in this -

12               JUSTICE BREYER:              That's all right.       It's in

13   the jurisdictional amount.

14               MR. FITCH:         I understand, Your Honor.             But

15   because it has never been raised.                   I do not have a good

16   answer for you.     What I can say to the Court is that in

17   Hibbs -- recognizing Hibbs was an Establishment Clause

18   claim -- the Court struck down the credit.                    There is a

19   recent case out of the First Circuit in Coors where

20   Coors reversed their prior case out of -- involving the

21   Butler Act out of Puerto Rico, and that involved beer

22   distributors challenging a credit or an exemption that

23   Puerto Rico was -

24               JUSTICE BREYER:              They might want to -- in

25   all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said:

 1   I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money

 2   back.

 3                  MR. FITCH:      Well -

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So that -- that should be

 5   your case, I would have thought.                  But you're not saying

 6   it so you can get into Federal court.                     Now, that's how I

 7   read it.    And that seems -- that's worrying to me.

 8                  MR. FITCH:      Well, Justice Breyer, so -- what

 9   I would say is that -

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The Establishment Clause, I

11   would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's

12   special in respect to standing, because there is no

13   other way to challenge the Establishment Clause.                     And

14   that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court,

15   but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything

16   else.

17                  MR. FITCH:      And I understand that, Your

18   Honor.     And I guess the point that I'm trying to make is

19   because that issue was not raised, based upon Hibbs,

20   based upon the decision in Coors, we did not see a

21   standing issue based upon this competitive situation

22   you're talking about.        If in fact that is an appropriate

23   question for additional briefing, we would obviously

24   welcome that opportunity.

25                  JUSTICE BREYER:           But you see what is

 1   worrying me.     What's worrying me is, is there are

 2   businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax

 3   law, too.    And suddenly people begin to think:                   Hey,

 4   this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my

 5   competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they

 6   should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will

 7   face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes.

 8   That's what is worrying.

 9                  MR. FITCH:      Okay.        And I would disagree with

10   you, Justice Breyer, for this reason.                     There are already

11   substantial limitations on when this type of case can be

12   brought.    We start with the TIA.                It says if we are -

13   we can't restrain the collection of taxes.                     We have the

14   abstention doctrines that have been mentioned.                     We have

15   the fact that the Court in a merits situation has to

16   give deference to the States.

17                  And so the point I'm trying to make is that

18   we believe this is a very narrow window.                     There is only

19   a very narrow window open.             What we are doing is

20   challenging an exemption granted to a competitor.

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:           And this is not true of the

22   other cases.     What do you think of the other half of

23   their argument?     I'll have to think about the standing

24   thing to see if I want to press it or not.                     But the

25   other half is:     Look at your case.                 Your case would just

 1   be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said:

 2   Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases.

 3                 But you haven't said that, because that

 4   would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.                      Rather, what

 5   you have said is:     Raise their taxes.                  So the point of

 6   the State is:     Now, wait a minute.                 Leaving all of the

 7   things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief,

 8   and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court

 9   could -- would say:      Give them the exemption.                 And if

10   it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is

11   now not within Hibbs.        So what's your response to that?

12                 MR. FITCH:       Your Honor, I don't -- as my

13   friend Mr. Mizer said, I don't believe a court could

14   say:   Give them an exemption.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Why not?

16                 MR. FITCH:       It would be in violation of the

17   TIA.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no.          There's a lot of

19   things they could say -

20                 MR. FITCH:       It would interrupt -- interrupt

21   -- it would impede the collection of taxes.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Of course.         Of course.

23   Absolutely right.     That's what worrying me.                   That isn't

24   the answer.     That's the question.                And -- and the -

25   it's what Justice Kennedy said in respect to


                                         27

 1   discrimination problems.           Usually, either remedy is at

 2   issue.   You can't control the remedy because you asked

 3   for all other appropriate relief.                   Ergo, it falls afoul

 4   of the Tax Injunction Act.             What's your response to

 5   that?

 6               MR. FITCH:         And I -- I'm -- I'm sorry,

 7   Justice Breyer.    We are saying that if we ask for the

 8   other relief, if we ask for us to get the exemption,

 9   that would impede State taxes.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              You didn't ask only for the

11   other relief.     You asked for such other relief to which

12   plaintiffs are entitled.           And what they say -- now I

13   repeat the argument.       Okay.

14               MR. FITCH:         We did include that phrase.           The

15   relief we are seeking, Your Honor, is the declaratory

16   relief and injunctive relief that we have spelled out

17   with respect to the exemption.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I think your -

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Suppose the answer -

20   suppose the answer -

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I think your answer is that

22   relief that would violate the Tax Injunction Act is not

23   appropriate relief.

24               MR. FITCH:         That's correct, Your Honor.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              And therefore not covered

 1   by your plea.

 2                  MR. FITCH:      And that was not what we were

 3   seeking.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Makes sense to me.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, there's another

 6   little problem.     Do you know of any case where a benefit

 7   that A enjoys is taken away from A in a suit where A is

 8   not a party?     I mean, you are fighting the Ohio tax

 9   commissioner.     You want to take a benefit away from

10   these LDCs, but they are not in the suit.                    Don't -

11   isn't there a little due process problem with that?

12                  MR. FITCH:      The response, Justice Ginsburg,

13   is this.     Number one, in part it takes away a tax

14   benefit from the LDC; in part it takes away a tax

15   benefit from the customers of the LDC.                    I know that

16   doesn't make us any more sympathetic.                     But the sales tax

17   is paid by the customer.

18                  Now, with respect to the joinder of

19   necessary parties, the motion that was filed by the

20   State, which started all of this 3 years ago after a

21   complaint, also included a motion to dismiss for failure

22   to join necessary parties.             That has also never been

23   addressed.     We responded to that.                The court decided not

24   to refer to it.     We made an argument that it was not

25   necessary in this case to join the LDC's.                     The Court has


                                         29

 1   deferred and did not rule.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What was that argument?

 3   That you're taking a benefit -- you're saying:             The only

 4   relief we want is to take this benefit away from people

 5   who are not in the lawsuit?

 6               MR. FITCH:       Well, our argument was simply,

 7   Your Honor, that we are challenging the exemption issued

 8   by the State.   If the -- two points, quickly.            If the

 9   LDCs -- at that time, four; now two -- were -- wanted to

10   be involved, they could certainly move to intervene.

11   The second point was if the Court, of course, ruled that

12   they were necessary parties, then we would have the

13   opportunity to adjoin them.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, in Hibbs, were all the

15   beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged

16   parties -

17               MR. FITCH:       I'm sorry?

18               JUSTICE ALITO:           In Hibbs, were all of the

19   beneficiaries of the provision that was challenged

20   parties in that case?

21               MR. FITCH:       They were not, Your Honor.        They

22   were not.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:           Was there a due process

24   problem there because of that?

25               MR. FITCH:       I cannot identify a due process

 1   problem there, Your Honor.            There is an issue that has

 2   been raised by several of the justices I'd like to

 3   address, I think Justice Stevens in particular, with

 4   respect to:    What if this went to State court?                 And I

 5   would disagree with my friend.               If this went to State

 6   court, we believe that under State law in the education

 7   cases that Mr. Mizer were referring to.                   It's called the

 8   Duroff case, and we have the citation if the Court would

 9   like it.   What the Court said was, once we declare the

10   matter unconstitutional, our job is at an end; that it

11   had to go back to the legislature.                   We challenged the

12   proposition raised in the amicus brief and raised today,

13   the notion that if this was in a State court, that a

14   State court could go rewrite this statute.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You conceded -- I'm

16   sorry.   You conceded below, to quote footnote 2 of the

17   opinion below, that there is an adequate State court

18   remedy available.

19                 MR. FITCH:      In State court.             We conceded

20   that we could bring this action in State court.                   We

21   could seek the injunction in State court.                   We could seek

22   the declaratory judgment in State court.                   But when we

23   speak to remedy, the point that we are trying to make,

24   Your Honor, because it is the remedy where the Federal

25   court interference becomes the greatest.                   What we are

 1   saying is:   We do not believe a State court has

 2   necessarily brought our remedies.                  And our -

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So you are claiming that

 4   the Federal court could only power -- only power would

 5   be to declare it unconstitutional and send it back the

 6   State legislature to decide what to do?                  Or you are

 7   claiming the Federal court has a power the State court

 8   doesn't have, which is to order the exemption to be

 9   rescinded?   I'm not sure what your point is.

10                MR. FITCH:       Okay.        The point, Your Honor, is

11   this:   We believe the Federal court and the State court

12   would have the power to declare under the dormant

13   Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause, that this

14   exemption is unconstitutional, that either court could,

15   at that point, enjoin prospectively the operation of

16   that exemption.    The question then becomes:                What

17   happens then?

18                JUSTICE BREYER:            So then, in your opinion,

19   your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and

20   says:   Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year

21   because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal.                   You see

22   that?   You see?   Now I'm trying to bring it home.                   There

23   is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite

24   put my finger on it.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Your next-door neighbor has

 1   to be a competitor of yours before it would be an exact

 2   parallel, right?

 3                MR. FITCH:      I believe that is correct,

 4   Justice Scalia.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean, your next-door

 6   neighbor in your business, which would be a competing

 7   law firm.

 8                MR. FITCH:      Yes.       Yes.        But if I can try to

 9   bring that point home, because I -

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            But they don't actually

11   bring you into the case.

12                (Laughter.)

13                MR. FITCH:      If I could try to bring that

14   point home, Justice Sotomayor.              What we say is we are

15   asking the Federal court to rule on the

16   constitutionality on our Federal claims, enjoin this

17   exemption and the court's work is at an end at that

18   point.   What we believe will happen at that point is

19   that the legislature will be faced with a choice.                    How

20   to deal with this -

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why should -- why should

22   the Federal court make that choice?                     I mean, in the -

23   in the Federal cases where extension versus invalidation

24   has come up, those were all Federal laws and the court

25   said in the interim, we are going to extend the benefit,


                                       33

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   we are not going to take away benefits from anyone.

 2   Every one of those cases they extended a benefit

 3   until -- unless and until Congress acts, but there was

 4   some comfort there because they were dealing -- the

 5   Federal court is dealing with Federal legislation.

 6                It seems to me that -- that there is that

 7   choice, the State courts are much better equipped to say

 8   what should happen in the interim until the legislature

 9   acts.

10                MR. FITCH:        We do not believe that the

11   Federal court could extend that benefit.                    I think we are

12   in agreement there, Justice Ginsburg.                     We -

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The State court could.

14                MR. FITCH:        We questioned whether the State

15   could.   We questioned whether if the State court found

16   it constitutional, whether under Ohio law the State

17   court could extend that benefit.                  We think this is a

18   legislative issue.      And there is a point I need to make,

19   because in the briefs and in the argument today you are

20   saying there are two choice.              The two choices are you

21   either extend the exemption to everyone or you eliminate

22   the exemption.

23                I need to make this point tying into

24   Mr. Mizer's comments about regulation.                    There is another

25   option which is the regulatory option.                    What we are

 1   dealing with here is our utility mandate.                    It may be

 2   that the legislature opts on a regulatory basis to

 3   eliminate this problem and that goes to footnote -- the

 4   footnote we have in the brief -

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:             That raises another -

 6   another problem for me.         Your basic standing is

 7   similarly situated competitors, one is being taxed and

 8   the other is not.    But you are not similarly situated

 9   competitors because they are regulated utilities and you

10   are unregulated.    Isn't that right?

11                MR. FITCH:       No, Your Honor.              No, Justice

12   Stevens, that's -- that is not correct and that is the

13   whole basis for our filing this complaint, if you looked

14   at the complaint.    That is what the Court said in

15   General Motors v. Tracy.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Right.

17                MR. FITCH:       And what our -- what our

18   complaint lays out is sea change of change, we have gone

19   from a regulated situation to essentially an unregulated

20   situation on the gas commodity piece.                    There are two

21   pieces.   There is delivery, there is gas commodity.                     The

22   gas commodity piece has been essentially deregulated and

23   that is what the Court was focused on in Tracy.

24                What our complaint very clearly lays out is

25   we believe there has been a change, a factual change in

 1   circumstance that will result in a different ruling in

 2   Tracy.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Counsel, I -- I hate to

 4   introduce another procedural glitch into this thing, but

 5   as I -- as I understand it, the State's motion to

 6   dismiss was under -- under 12(b)(1), which is a motion

 7   to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and

 8   that was granted by the court.               The TIA is assuredly a

 9   jurisdictional statute, but I had never thought that the

10   comity doctrine was a doctrine of jurisdiction.                  In

11   fact, by -- almost by definition it says the court has

12   jurisdictions but nonetheless should decline to exercise

13   any.    You didn't make that objection, though.

14                 MR. FITCH:      I'm sorry, Your Honor?

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You did not make that

16   objection.

17                 MR. FITCH:      We did not -- we did not make

18   that objection, I do not believe.                  That is the entire

19   discussion of Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion

20   in Fair Assessment, and we think it is an -- an

21   extremely important point.

22                 The district court has jurisdiction in this

23   case.    It has jurisdiction.           The question is, does

24   comity -- should comity tell it not to use that

25   jurisdiction.    And what we are really fighting about

 1   here is what are those standards that a district court

 2   is going to use to decide whether to -- to use comity to

 3   not exercise that jurisdiction.

 4                  And what we are saying -- what we are saying

 5   in our case is Hibbs did address comity.                      The issue was

 6   before the Court in comity and Hibbs said, and now four

 7   circuits have followed that ruling in Hibbs as well as

 8   lower courts and have said, if you are not seeking to

 9   impede State tax collection, comity does not bar -

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that's because there

11   was only one way to go.          Either the benefit is removed

12   or it's not.     There wasn't the other possibility of

13   decreasing the taxes on your client.                      There wasn't an

14   extension versus invalidation.                It was if the

15   constitutional claim was good, it had to be invalidated,

16   the credit had to be invalidated.

17                  MR. FITCH:      And -- and I think what we are

18   trying to say, Justice Ginsburg, in our -- in our case

19   is we are not trying to seek invalidation.                      We -- we -

20   we are not going to seek the benefit for us.

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It is not up to you to

22   make that decision, if the State can go either way.                         I

23   mean in the extension versus invalidation cases this

24   Court made it very clear, you could go one way or the

25   other, and that was a decision for the court to make,

 1   not the litigant.

 2               MR. FITCH:        But, Your Honor, the point we

 3   are making is that some court somewhere has to make the

 4   decision whether this exemption violates the dormant

 5   Commerce Clause in the equal protection case.                     And it

 6   was our judgment that the best forum for that was in

 7   Federal court.

 8               And again, and I -- and I -- if I am not

 9   responsive to your question, I apologize, but what we

10   are saying is that, we want to reach the merits on that

11   question of constitutionality.

12               And once that is done, the remedy is going

13   to lie with the State.        We are not going to ask the

14   Federal judge to decrease our taxes.                     We question

15   whether a State judge could decrease our taxes.                        We want

16   that declaration and we want that injunction.                     That's

17   what -- that's what we are seeking in this case.                        And

18   we -

19               JUSTICE ALITO:            Do you -- do you recognize

20   that comity is broader than the Tax Injunction Act, and

21   if it is, how do you justify your argument that would

22   essentially limit the comity doctrine to the contours of

23   the Tax Injunction Act?

24               MR. FITCH:        Justice Alito, what the court

25   has said, not only this Court but the First Circuit said


                                        38

 1   in Coors, is what the Sixth Circuit says is that comity

 2   extends broader than the TIA.              What they point to

 3   repeatedly is Fair Assessment, because Fair Assessment

 4   got damages and it was on a comity basis that the Court

 5   held in Fair Assessment that you couldn't get around

 6   your own liability by bringing a damage claim.              So

 7   there's one example.

 8                We believe to some extent, National Private

 9   Truck Council is an example.             Because in National

10   Private Truck Council, recall we are dealing with a

11   State court action, not a Federal court action.                In a

12   National Private Truck Council what the court held was

13   under 1983, a State court -- a -- a -- a Federal court

14   would not order -- a State court was not obligated to

15   grant injunctive relief to grant attorneys fees under

16   1988, and that was based on comity.

17                In that case there was still an issue of tax

18   collection and impeding tax collection, but certainly

19   that appeared to us to be at least an example of where

20   comity would be brought in to TIA, because the TIA

21   didn't apply in -- in National Private Truck Council.

22                There was reference to Burford before, as

23   Justice Scalia mentioned.           This is not an abstention

24   case.   There is no question of State law that has to be

25   interpreted here.    There is no doubt who pays the tax


                                        39

 1   and who doesn't pay the tax.              There is no doubt who is

 2   an LDC and who is not an LDC.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Let me just go back to my

 4   question before.     I understand your point about

 5   regulation and nonregulation, but -- but your

 6   competitors are subject to a different taxing regime

 7   than you are; is that correct?

 8               MR. FITCH:         They are, Your Honor.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:              And isn't -- is not the

10   reason they are subject to a different tax regime is

11   historically they were in regulated utilities?

12               MR. FITCH:         To -- to -- to some extent I

13   believe that's correct, Justice Stevens, but my response

14   would be this:     If we want to get into them, what taxes

15   do they pay, versus what taxes do we pay -- that's a

16   merits question.     That's a merits question.

17               Is this a compensatory tax?                   I mean, have we

18   made our case -- do they have a defense because they pay

19   different taxes than we do -- that we do, and therefore

20   the State should be permitted to do that?                  We would like

21   to reach that question.          But that's a merits question,

22   that's not a -- not a jurisdictional question.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                And you don't think that

24   the very question of what taxes you compare and don't

25   compare is a matter of interpreting State law?                   You


                                         40

 1   don't think that the meaning of State law in terms of

 2   what is comparable or not, is not implicated by any of

 3   these questions?

 4                MR. FITCH:        We -- we believe it is not,

 5   Justice Sotomayor.      You can -- you can look at the taxes

 6   and see who they apply to.             It -- it is not a matter --

 7   I -- I strongly disagree with -- with my counterpart.

 8   This is not a matter of interpretation.                      And one of the

 9   justices asked the question about, was extension -- was

10   Pullman -- was Pullman ever raised?                       Pullman was never

11   raised.   My recollection is that in the original motion,

12   they raised Younger, but they quickly dropped Younger

13   because there is no, you know, pending State -- pending

14   State proceeding.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But the other view was

16   the Federal court should abstain.                   Abstention doctrines

17   are not the most easy to grant, so -- but they did bring

18   up abstention.

19                MR. FITCH:        Well, but -- very early on they

20   raised it.   They dropped it.             It was -- it was not

21   followed up on, Your Honor.

22                So -- so the point we are -- we are -

23   here's the point we are trying to make, as we see it.

24   We believe the footnote in Hibbs was correct; in all of

25   the Court's prior cases there has been an issue of a


                                         41

 1   taxpayer trying to avoid their own tax and thus impede

 2   State tax collection.        We read Hibbs to say under the

 3   TIA or comity, you are not precluded from original

 4   Federal court jurisdiction if you are not attempting to

 5   impede State tax collection.

 6               We do not believe there is any significant

 7   difference between our case or that analysis and the -

 8   the case in Hibbs.      As I said, that -- we now have four

 9   circuits that have followed that.

10               But if I -- if I can bring us -

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                When you say that there

12   is no impeding of State court process or taxes, because

13   neither a Federal or State court could order the

14   reduction of the exemption -

15               MR. FITCH:         That -- that is correct, Your

16   Honor.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                That is -- even though

18   the practical consequence is that that is a remedy that

19   the State could choose, or must consider.

20               MR. FITCH:         It -- it could, Your Honor.

21   But -- but -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                That wasn't an issue,

23   however, in Hibbs.

24               MR. FITCH:         That -- that's right.         And the

25   line that is repeated in a number of cases is, the net


                                         42

 1   effect, whether you are talking about the credit in

 2   Hibbs or whether you're talking about the exemption in

 3   our case, is if the Court puts on that order and the

 4   legislature does not come up with a remedy, is that the

 5   State would have more money.             In fact it is a question

 6   to us, why -- since we have chosen to limit our remedies

 7   by seeking a Federal court forum, it -- it -

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Or why isn't this a Hibbs?

 9   You read the -- clearly the other side says to read the

10   footnote, not as destroying the comity principle.                   You

11   know, this is right on the merits.                   It still exists,

12   comity.    And you say a strong case for withholding the

13   -- the Federal court's jurisdiction on grounds of comity

14   or withhold -- not hearing the case, is the natural

15   remedy -- which is to give you a refund -- is available

16   in State court.    Go apply for a refund.                 No problem.

17                 And that --- and the answer, you know, and

18   then you don't get into all the problem of trying to

19   assess somebody else's liability, et cetera.                   What is

20   wrong with that, precisely?

21                 MR. FITCH:      What's wrong with it, Your

22   Honor, is because what we are trying to do is fix a

23   problem.    The question is, are we forced -- are we

24   limited only to seeking a refund?

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why not?

 1               MR. FITCH:        What we're -- because that's

 2   not.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:             So not give it -- up to the

 4   State?   You could say give us a refund or raise their

 5   taxes, one or the other.          What's wrong with that?

 6               MR. FITCH:        The point that we tried to get

 7   across in our brief, Your Honor, is that we are in a

 8   competitive situation where we are trying to solve a

 9   problem, the problem of policy that has been adopted in

10   Ohio or freeing up this -

11               JUSTICE BREYER:             If doesn't solve the

12   problem for you if you get a refund?

13               MR. FITCH:        It does not.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             Why not?

15               MR. FITCH:        The problem remains.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:             Why?

17               MR. FITCH:        Well, the problem remains

18   because the exemption still exists.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, no, no, you have it,

20   too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies

21   to everybody including your clients, so you are all on

22   the same footing.    Now what is the problem with that?

23               MR. FITCH:        And I guess we have to be

24   careful with the term "refund," because what I am saying

25   is -- is that we are dealing with primarily -- we have


                                        44

 1   three taxes to deal with.          One of them is the sales tax,

 2   that's what is paid by the consumer; that would require

 3   all the consumers to seek, you know, refunds.                 It's much

 4   cleaner in our view to simply go and get a determination

 5   whether this exemption was unconstitutional.

 6                We have forgone the --the request for

 7   damages, we have forgone request for attorneys fees

 8   because we have not alleged the 1983 claim.                 We are

 9   trying to fix a problem.

10                Justice Breyer, if I can in wrapping this

11   up.   We recognize -- we recognize that this Court has

12   competing interests that it has to weigh in resolving

13   this question.   What we are trying to say is that as I

14   said a minute ago, if you put that in context, the

15   context is there are numerous protections that are

16   already in place for the State to protect them from

17   Federal court interference, and we believe that the

18   decision in Hibbs and the circuits that have followed

19   Hibbs strikes a proper balance for this reason:                 You -

20   you -- first of all you protect State tax collection,

21   which has been the historic concern of this Court.

22   Second, the broad jurisdiction that Congress has given

23   in 1331 in a declaratory judgment statute, is harmonized

24   with the historic comity concerns.                  Third, the Court -

25   as this Court spoke in -- in Hertz, just very recently,


                                       45

 1   as opposed to some vague intrusion test, you have got a

 2   clear test that the Court can apply early on to decide

 3   whether I got jurisdiction or not.

 4                And finally, the historic right of a

 5   plaintiff, which this Court has long recognized -- if

 6   there is concurrent jurisdiction, the historic right of

 7   a plaintiff to choose the forum in which to have their

 8   claims adjudicated is preserved.

 9                If there are no further questions I -- I

10   yield my time.

18                MR. MIZER:      First off, Justice Scalia's

19   question about the 12(b)(1) dismissal motion.                    This

20   Court, just a couple of terms ago in the Sinochem case,

21   said that the -- that a Federal court can answer

22   questions of Younger abstention before answering

23   questions of Article 3 abstention.                  And so both of

24   these, both the comity and TIA questions in this case,

25   are threshold non-merits questions that can be reached

 1   under -- under the Steel Company approach.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           All threshold non-merits

 3   questions are jurisdictional questions?

 4                 MR. MIZER:      No.       The point isn't that they

 5   are jurisdictional; the point is that in Sinochem -- the

 6   holding in Sinochem, for instance, was that -

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What is the case you're

 8   citing.

 9                 MR. MIZER:      It's Sinochem v. Malaysian --

10   Malaysia International Shipping.                 And the holding was

11   that the -- the formula -

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do you have a volume

13   anywhere?

14                 MR. MIZER:      I don't have a volume number at

15   the moment.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

17                 MR. MIZER:      But the -- the holding was the

18   forum non conveniens doctrine can be addressed before

19   jurisdictional questions, and along the way the Court

20   said that Younger -- specifically said that Younger can

21   be answered before Article 3 standing.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay, fine.      It can be

23   answered before jurisdictional questions, but you moved

24   to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.

25                 MR. MIZER:      Well -

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              And -- and that is not a

 2   basis for dismissal here.            The -- the basis is failure

 3   to state a claim, I guess, on which a Federal court can

 4   grant relief.   But I -- anyway.

 5               MR. MIZER:         Well, in any event, Your Honor,

 6   we do submit that the Tax Injunction Act and the

 7   jurisdictional doctrine which would prevail.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That is so -- okay.

 9               MR. MIZER:         And on Justice Stevens' question

10   about the similarly situated or not similarly situated

11   nature of public utilities and nonpublic utilities,

12   Mr. Fitch has pointed to the continuing deregulation in

13   the wake of General Motors Corporation v. Tracy.               But as

14   the Ohio Supreme Court just explained in the Columbia

15   Gas case that we cite in our brief, that continuing

16   deregulation does not change the -- the fundamental

17   holdings in Tracy:      That when there is a regulatory

18   burden imposed on a public utility to serve a captive

19   market, that makes that entity not similarly situated to

20   other entities.

21               And the other point about Tracy and Columbia

22   Gas is that both of those challenges came up to this

23   Court through the lower courts, through the State courts

24   of Ohio.   And so the State courts are perfectly capable

25   of handling this case.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could you answer your

 2   adversary's point that neither the Federal nor the State

 3   courts would have the power to -- to order the reverse,

 4   to order the exemption to be eliminated vis--vis -- or

 5   to order them to have the exception?                     They are claiming

 6   that's a -- even in State court, that would not be a

 7   remedy that could be ordered.

 8                 MR. MIZER:      I disagree with that contention,

 9   Your Honor.    The -- Ohio's courts have struck down tax

10   credits on dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection

11   grounds, and so there is precedent for Ohio courts

12   dealing with a challenge like this.                      It provides no

13   citation of the inability of State courts -

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can you -- can you give

15   me the cite for that case?

16                 MR. MIZER:      Sure.        The MCI Telecom

17   Corporation v. Limbaugh.          It's available at 625

18   Northeast 597, and that's a 1994 Ohio case.                      Also, SSA

19   Folio Collection v. Tracy at 73 Ohio State Third 119.

20   The Seligman citation, Justice Scalia, is at 549 United

21   States 422.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Have you found any

23   authority on the following proposition:                      That a

24   plaintiff, an out-of-State company, brings a suit in

25   Federal court, where the normal relief would be to give

 1   him a refund.     He says:       I don't want a refund; I just

 2   want a declaration; I want to you declare this

 3   unconstitutional.       Have you found any case like that?

 4                  MR. MIZER:      Yes.       I think Mr. Fitch was

 5   correct to cite the Coors Brewing and U.S. Brewers cases

 6   out of the First Circuit.            And those cases illustrate

 7   the point that Justice Alito asked about, which was the

 8   continuing scope of the comity doctrine, because -

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Wait.        Wait.   Forget

10   comity.     I'm just asking you -- I want to read the right

11   authority.     Can a person, in other words, get around the

12   Tax Injunction Act by pleading his claim and just

13   saying:     I don't want an injunction; all I want is a

14   declaration?     It seems to me it should have come up in

15   history.     So I can have the First Circuit cases to look

16   at.    Anything else?

17                  MR. MIZER:      The First Circuit cases are the

18   most on point, but the other sister circuits who have

19   joined the First Circuit in the circuit split at issue

20   in this case hold to the similar effect, and those -

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, then why don't they

22   win?     Because their first thing, they say:                  Declaration.

23   They just want a declaration.               Strike their second

24   claim.     All they want is a declaration.

25                  MR. MIZER:      Because of Grace Brethren, Your

 1   Honor.   If we are talking about the Tax Injunction Act,

 2   Grace Brethren holds that even a declaration of

 3   unconstitutionality is problematic under the Tax

 4   Injunction Act.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

 6               The case is submitted.
