 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. McALLISTER:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10                 The Court has always held that the

11   defendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation

12   of constitutional standards may be used for impeachment

13   purposes when the defendant testifies at trial.

14                 The Court has excluded statements for all

15   purposes only when they are involuntary or have been

16   compelled.     The question in this case is whether

17   voluntary statements obtained in violation of the rule

18   of Massiah v. United States should be treated

19   differently than all other voluntary statements.

20                 The answer is "no" for at least three

21   reasons.     First, permitting the impeachment use of

22   voluntary statements obtained in violation of

23   constitutional standards is necessary to prevent perjury

24   by criminal defendants.

25                 Second, in terms of the effect at trial,


                                          3

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there is no basis for distinguishing a voluntary

 2   statement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from

 3   Fourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or

 4   violations of the rule of Michigan v. Jackson.

 5                In all of those situations the resulting

 6   evidence may limit defense counsel's options at trial,

 7   but there is no basis in that respect for distinguishing

 8   a Massiah violation.      It has no different effect than

 9   those others.   Also, the Sixth Amendment right to

10   counsel does not include a right to commit perjury or to

11   have the assistance of counsel in presenting false

12   testimony.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            When does -- when does the

14   Sixth Amendment violation occur?

15                MR. McALLISTER:            That question, Your Honor,

16   as you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs, it's --

17   Kansas for purposes of deciding this case, is willing to

18   accept the position of the United States and the

19   Respondent that it occurs when the statement is admitted

20   at trial, although the cases have not necessarily

21   definitively resolved that question.                    We, frankly, think

22   it is unnecessary to answer the question, because it's a

23   minimal point in terms of potential deterrence --

24   deterrence that operate in this segment --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you -- do we have any

 1   other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching

 2   testimony, a constitutional violation results?

 3              MR. McALLISTER:                Well, that's the -- that is

 4   one of the intricacies of this particular question,

 5   although arguably in the Fifth Amendment context

 6   certainly the Miranda warnings are given.                 The police

 7   don't do that.   And if that is the completion of the

 8   violation, it's analogous in many ways, if one looks

 9   back at the cases.

10              The Court has suggested that the actual

11   violation is the use of the statement at trial against

12   the defendant, not simply obtaining it without the

13   necessary warnings being given.                So we would argue that

14   is, in fact --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:                It's parallel to the Fifth.

16              MR. McALLISTER:                It's parallel to the Fifth

17   in this respect, and certainly, it's distinct from the

18   Fourth in that respect.          But we don't think it matters

19   at the end of the day.         If one were to treat it like the

20   Fourth Amendment, so that the violation is complete when

21   the police send in an informant and he works hard to

22   elicit statements in violation of the Messiah law, if

23   it's complete at that time, then all of the analysis

24   from the Fourth Amendment cases is equally applicable

25   here.

 1                If the violation does not occur until it's

 2   presented at trial, then it's analogous more to the

 3   Fifth Amendment and also to the Michigan v. Jackson and

 4   Michigan v. Harvey cases, which were Sixth Amendment

 5   right to counsel violations, in which case the Court

 6   said it was wrong for the police to initiate

 7   interrogation after he invoked his right but will let

 8   the statement be admitted for impeachment purposes.              So

 9   it is exactly analogous to what the Court did in Harvey

10   itself.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Would it make no

12   difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had

13   been a police officer who was pretending to be a

14   cellmate?    In this case it was a snitch, but it could be

15   a police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't

16   do outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to

17   interrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda

18   rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to

19   be a jailbird and they can get the information that way.

20   Is that --

21                MR. McALLISTER:             Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

22   believe that is correct if -- if it's for example, an

23   undercover officer, someone has gone in -- in fact,

24   there are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that

25   involved an undercover agent who was present for


                                         6

 1   meetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the

 2   Court indicated that the presence alone would not

 3   violate the right to counsel.               It's the deliberate

 4   solicitation and use of statements obtained from the

 5   defendant that would violate the Sixth Amendment.

 6                 So if a cellmate, another defendant, is the

 7   informant who listens and hears, it wouldn't make any

 8   difference under the Court's cases if, in fact, it was a

 9   police officer pretending to be a cellmate who listens

10   and hears.     Just as it wouldn't make -- it wouldn't be a

11   violation if there were a recording device in the cell

12   and the defendant talked to himself, which there are

13   cases of that, and it was picked up on the recording

14   device.     The mere listening, that goes to whether there

15   is a violation at all.         But the who, there is -- it

16   wouldn't matter for our purposes.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So, the police know that

18   they can get around the clear prohibition of their

19   questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be

20   a jailbird?

21                 MR. McALLISTER:             Potentially, yes.   But,

22   again, the violation would go to what happens in the

23   cell.     So if the police officer is pretending to be

24   another defendant and sits in the cell and the defendant

25   starts telling the officer things, that would not


                                          7

 1   violate the Sixth Amendment at all under the --

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No, I am assuming we are

 3   not in the area where the jail mate is simply passive.

 4   In this case, the jail mate made a statement that

 5   encouraged the defendant.          He wasn't just passive.        He

 6   was encouraging the defendant to speak.

 7               MR. McALLISTER:             There was certainly

 8   testimony about what he was told to do and what he did.

 9   It does not suggest aggressive efforts, certainly, to

10   find out.   He may not have been completely silent, but

11   he certainly didn't say, tell me what you did, let's

12   talk about your crimes.        But he did make one arguably

13   suggestive statement to the --

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Anyway, your answer is

15   the police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?

16               MR. McALLISTER:             No, not that he could

17   affirmatively elicit.      That's the dividing line between

18   the Massiah and Kuhlmann case.              He was in the cell --

19   well, I guess what I'm suggesting is --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And for your -- you are

21   talking about impeachment only.              We are not talking

22   about the case in chief.         So if the police -- he

23   can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and

24   gives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?

25               MR. McALLISTER:             Outside -- well, it would


                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   still be admissible for impeachment.                     We are asking for

 2   basically the same rule.          It would be the same thing if

 3   he were in the cell, deliberately elicits, knows he is

 4   violating Massiah, it couldn't be used in the government

 5   case in chief, but it could be used for impeachment

 6   purposes.    But that would be true of Miranda, if the

 7   officer deliberately failed to give the warnings, got a

 8   statement, they would not be admissible in the case in

 9   chief; but the Court cases are very clearly, it would be

10   admissible for impeachment purposes.

11                So we are asking for a precise parallel

12   rule.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You are making no

14   distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth

15   Amendment?

16                MR. McALLISTER:             Well, there may be

17   distinctions, and there is an distinction in the text of

18   the Fifth Amendment that suggests actually a rule of

19   exclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a

20   compelled statement.       And the Court has recognized that

21   in cases such as Portash, where the witness has given

22   use immunity, testifies before the grand jury and the

23   government later tries to use it against him.                    The Court

24   says, no, you cannot use that testimony for any purpose.

25                So there is a difference between the Sixth


                                         9

 1   Amendment and Fifth Amendment in that respect.

 2                 But what I was suggesting is the way Massiah

 3   and Miranda operate is similar in this context, that a

 4   violation results in suppression of the evidence from

 5   the government's case in chief, but it remains available

 6   for use as impeachment.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the argument

 8   that essentially this is like taking a pretrial

 9   deposition, only one side isn't represented?

10                 MR. McALLISTER:            Well, with all due respect

11   to that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that.

12   There are strong incentives for the police, frankly, not

13   to do this.     And in part one of the reasons -- well,

14   there is two.     One is the police know if this is truly

15   in violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be

16   used in the case in chief.            So, at most, it is

17   impeachment if the defendant testifies and if the

18   defendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is

19   elicited.

20                 But furthermore, given the line the court

21   has drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on

22   with the informant in the cell, if they can hear the

23   statements without deliberately eliciting them, if you

24   will, if the informant is present, the defendant wants

25   to talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those


                                         10

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   statements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are

 2   admissible for all purposes, because they are not a

 3   Sixth Amendment violation at all.

 4                 So, the police do have some strong

 5   incentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if

 6   they are going to, in a way that makes it usable in the

 7   prosecution's case in chief.              It's much less value to

 8   having it solely for impeachment, which is always going

 9   to be speculative if it were ever going to be used.                   It

10   would depend on if the defendant testifies and if he

11   testifies inconsistently with what he has told an

12   informant.

13                 And in that regard, there are other

14   deterrents I would like to mention here as well.                The

15   informant in this case, for example, in jail recognized

16   that he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or

17   obvious as a government agent.                In fact, he said, I

18   didn't really want to ask him questions because I was

19   afraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get

20   hurt.   So, the informants have their own incentives to

21   be careful here.

22                 And in this case, it's also important to

23   remember that deterrence is simply one side of the

24   balance.     And the Court has said many times even if

25   there would be some deterrent effect to extending the


                                         11

 1   rule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the

 2   question whether it should, in fact, be excluded.               That

 3   still must be weighed against the costs on the other

 4   side.

 5               And the Court has numerous cases emphasizing

 6   the costs that are present on the other side of this

 7   case.   Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one,

 8   but also cases talking about the importance of allowing

 9   the jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.

10               The jury here gets to evaluate and did, I

11   would argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris's

12   standpoint, evaluate the defendant's credibility.               The

13   jury was informed, cross-examination, of the informant's

14   circumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all

15   the things they might want to know in deciding whether

16   to believe him.   His testimony went not solely but

17   primarily to the question of who was the shooter in the

18   murder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris

19   of the murder charge, so they did not believe, at least

20   beyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the

21   shooter.   And that is precisely how this should work.

22               We are not saying informants are always

23   100 percent reliable, but we are saying the court has a

24   long tradition, the country has a long tradition, of

25   putting this evidence in front of a jury.               It's tested


                                       12
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   by cross-examination, knowledge of what the incentives

 2   are, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then

 3   the jury decides.    There are many of these cases where

 4   -- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, "he was

 5   the shooter," the other defendant saying, "no, she was

 6   the shooter."

 7               And the informant simply had information

 8   that was relevant to the credibility.                    And that's the

 9   way it was used in this case, was as impeachment on

10   rebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony in whether

11   the jury believed him or not.

12               The other thing I would remind the Court is

13   we are simply saying that the rule should be no

14   exclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment

15   purposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules

16   of evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not

17   apply.   They do.   And they might well result in the

18   exclusion of some potential informant's testimony.                   So

19   if the government were to want to put on an informant

20   who had been convicted many times of perjury and the

21   judge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is

22   credible enough to even put in front of the jury, not

23   this person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial

24   procedure would operate.          Furthermore, as happened in

25   this case, the judge can, and often will, give

 1   cautionary instructions, limiting instructions.                  All of

 2   that remains appropriate, but there is simply no reason

 3   to exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth

 4   Amendment right to counsel.

 5              It would be inconsistent, frankly, with --

 6   with, really, the general tone and holdings of the cases

 7   in the Fourth Amendment, Miranda, and even Sixth

 8   Amendment territory, including primarily

 9   Michigan v. Harvey and Nix v. Williams.

10              Unless the Court has further questions, I

11   will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

14              ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

15                ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

16                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17                  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

18              MS. SAHARSKY:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20              This Court has consistently allowed the use

21   of voluntary statements obtained in violation of

22   constitutional standards for impeachment purposes, and

23   that same rule should apply here.                 There is no question

24   that Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the

25   substantial societal cost of allowing him to commit

 1   perjury unchecked greatly outweighs any speculative

 2   deterrence benefit that would flow from a per se rule of

 3   exclusion.

 4                The purpose of the right to counsel is to

 5   provide an adversary process to ensure that the

 6   defendant gets a fair trial.            And to effectuate that

 7   right, the Court has excluded deliberately elicited

 8   statements from the government's case-in-chief.                  But not

 9   allowing the statements for impeachment purposes doesn't

10   further that right.      Instead, what it does is allow the

11   defendant to distort the truth-seeking process, and

12   that's just too high a price to pay.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you say there

14   is no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not

15   going to do this if they know they are not going to be

16   able to use this in their case-in-chief.                  But there is

17   also no down side, is there?

18                I mean, you say it's only for impeachment

19   purposes, but, you know, why not?                He -- he may take the

20   stand.   He may lie.     It is better to have this in the

21   bank instead of not.

22                MS. SAHARSKY:         But there is a down side.             I

23   mean, as this Court recognized in cases versus -- like

24   Hudson v. Michigan, for example, the police have their

25   own codes of conduct.       They have training on


                                       15

 1   constitutional rules and standards.                    And if they violate

 2   those constitutional rules and standards, it has real

 3   effect for the police.      It has effect in terms of

 4   internal discipline, in -- in terms of limiting their

 5   career opportunities.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is that internal

 7   discipline verifiable?      Do police officers who engage

 8   snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they

 9   are then able to accomplish what was accomplished here?

10   That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able

11   to testify after the defendant testifies.

12              MS. SAHARSKY:          I don't think that there is

13   any evidence in the briefs, and I am not aware of

14   specific instances of discipline, but I think that that

15   is because this situation arises pretty infrequently.

16   You know, when this came up in the Kansas Supreme Court

17   it was a case of first impression.                And as General

18   McAllister noted, there are a lot of reasons why the

19   police would want to follow the rule in Kuhlman and send

20   the informant in to be a passive listening post.

21   Because if --

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             On the Federal level is

23   there anything one way or another, any manual that

24   instructs a U.S. Attorney about the use of snitches to

25   extract confessions?

 1                 MS. SAHARSKY:         I think the Department of

 2   Justice Manual sets out this Court's rules in terms of

 3   the Kuhlman case and the Henry case.                     And then, of

 4   course, there are also State and the Model Professional

 5   Ethics Rules that talk about when a prosecutor can

 6   contact a person who is represented by counsel.                     And

 7   there are limitations there as well, both in terms of

 8   the prosecutor contacting a person represented or using

 9   an agent contacting a person represented.

10                 But I mean, those are -- those are

11   deterrents.    I think the police discipline is a

12   deterrent.    But I think we also need to -- to focus on

13   this Court's cases in the Fourth and Fifth and Sixth

14   Amendment Jackson context that taking the evidence and

15   making it unavailable in the government's case-in-chief

16   is a substantial deterrent.

17                 This Court said in each of those previous

18   case that not having the evidence available in the

19   government's case-in-chief is a very high price to pay,

20   because that means that the government has to come up

21   with other evidence that can meet its burden of proving

22   all of the elements of the case beyond a reasonable

23   doubt.

24                 And, as General McAllister noted, it is

25   really very speculative, and the police certainly


                                        17

 1   wouldn't know at the time they are asking questions of

 2   the defendant, whether this rebuttal impeachment

 3   evidence could ever be used.             It's entirely within the

 4   control of the defendant.           It is only if the defendant

 5   -- if the government first meets its burden of proof

 6   with other evidence at trial, and then the defendant

 7   decides to testify, and then he testifies inconsistently

 8   with his prior statements.

 9                And our position is at that point that the

10   jury should hear the conflicting evidence just as it has

11   heard it in all of these other previous cases and be

12   allowed to make a decision about who is telling the

13   truth.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It seems to me you are

15   just confirming the answer to the Chief Justice's

16   question.    There really isn't any down side.           The worst

17   that -- the worst that happens is maybe they can't use

18   the stuff.    But what -- what is the down side?

19                MS. SAHARSKY:          Again, I -- I think that

20   there is a down side in terms of police discipline and

21   the deterrence --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Has any police officer

23   ever been disciplined for doing this; do you know?

24                MS. SAHARSKY:          I -- I --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I would find it rather


                                        18

 1   amazing if he has.

 2                 MS. SAHARSKY:          Again, I think that most

 3   police officers just follow the rule that this Court set

 4   forth in Kuhlman, so that this issue has not arisen

 5   frequently.     But, you know, even if you thought that

 6   there would be some type of minimal deterrence benefit

 7   that would arise from -- from not making the evidence

 8   available for impeachment purposes, you have to balance

 9   it against the cost to the truth-seeking process that

10   would be incurred if the defendant could --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            The defendant could

12   sometimes lie.    But sometimes people who are in this

13   position in prison are not the most trustworthy people,

14   either.

15                 MS. SAHARSKY:          I think --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            You could bring that out

17   on cross-examination.        I understand that.

18                 MS. SAHARSKY:          That -- that is what I was

19   going to say.    I mean, as General McAllister noted, that

20   -- that happened in this case.                The prosecutor himself

21   got up and talked about the -- the informant's prior

22   offenses, why the informant was in jail, whether the

23   informant received anything in exchange for his

24   testimony, the fact that the informant had actually gone

25   back to jail after testifying -- or after serving as an

 1   informant in this case.

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It seems to me that that

 3   all confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose.

 4   Maybe we have one witness who is not very persuasive,

 5   but no harm in giving it a try.

 6                MS. SAHARSKY:          I think that the -- the fact

 7   that the evidence would be unavailable in the

 8   government's case-in-chief really is a strong price that

 9   the government pays.       And -- and this Court recognized

10   it in in Havens, in Walder, in Harris, in Hass, in

11   Harvey, and in all of those prior cases.                 And there is

12   just -- there is not any reason to depart from them,

13   because the -- the other side of the balance is that,

14   you know, you are letting a defendant to get up and take

15   the stand and -- and not subject himself to this prior

16   statement.

17                And this -- this prior statement, if

18   believed by the jury, is incredibly important to his

19   credibility, probative with respect to whether the

20   crimes were committed and the defendant is telling the

21   truth.

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:            If it is truthfully

23   reported.    Of course, that is always -- that is an issue

24   of credibility in all of these cases.

25                MS. SAHARSKY:          Yes, every case has a


                                        20
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question about someone's credibility, some witness's

 2   credibility, and that's for the jury to decide.                 And in

 3   -- in this case there was ample cross-examination, and

 4   there was the limiting instruction that the State

 5   mentioned.

 6                I mean, clearly the jury did its job here

 7   because it went back and it considered all this

 8   information.   And it didn't come back with a -- a

 9   verdict -- although you, of course, never know exactly

10   what the jury is thinking, it didn't come back with a

11   verdict suggesting it just reflexively believed the

12   informant's testimony.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Ms. Saharsky, I am still a

14   little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a

15   constitutional violation.          General McAllister said that

16   in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow --

17   allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that

18   is the actual constitutional violation.                 Isn't that the

19   case other than in the Miranda situation?                I mean,

20   suppose you have a generally coerced confession.                   Would

21   we -- would we permit that to go in?

22                MS. SAHARSKY:         Certainly not.        In the Fifth

23   Amendment context, the text of the amendment itself

24   would prohibit the use of that statement for any

25   purposes.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Exactly, but why -- why is

 2   not that the case with the right to counsel?

 3              MS. SAHARSKY:           Because the text of the Sixth

 4   Amendment doesn't say anything about the exclusion of

 5   evidence at trial. What it does is it guarantees counsel

 6   for a purpose, and that purpose is to ensure an

 7   adversary process at trial. And if counsel is not

 8   afforded, then it's up to the court to determine what

 9   the remedy is --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But its real meaning is

11   that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?

12              MS. SAHARSKY:           I'm sorry.           I missed the

13   first --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Its root purpose is that

15   counsel is guaranteed at trial.              And here we're saying

16   it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's

17   refuting a lie by the defendant.

18              MS. SAHARSKY:           That's not true. I mean,

19   certainly counsel is available at trial. The question is

20   just whether statements that were obtained without

21   counsel prior to trial can be used for impeachment

22   purposes. The answer --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So you say that -- you say

24   the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?

25              MS. SAHARSKY:           I'm sorry if I suggested


                                       22
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that.    No, the Sixth Amendment violation occurs when the

 2   statements are introduced in the government's case in

 3   chief at trial.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's right.

 5                MS. SAHARSKY:          And that's because the

 6   government should not be allowed to go behind counsel

 7   prior to trial and gather up statements, and then use

 8   them to prove guilt at trial. That subverts the

 9   adversary process. When you are talking about

10   impeachment, you are not talking about proving guilt at

11   trial. You are not talking about the government

12   distorting the adversary process.                 If there is any

13   distortion of the adversary process, it's with the

14   defendant attempting to commit perjury at that point.

15                The Sixth Amendment is different from the

16   Fifth Amendment in that it doesn't say anything about

17   statements that are obtained and if it can be used at

18   trial.   And that means it's up to courts to balance the

19   cost and benefit of exclusion of evidence.                 And in the

20   case of the government's case in chief, that balance

21   means that that the statements cannot come in because it

22   would be too much of a cost to the adversary process

23   that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to allow the

24   statements in.

25                But, when you switch over in looking at


                                        23
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   impeachment, this Court said 50 years ago impeachment is

 2   a very different story than the government's case in

 3   chief. The interest that you are talking about

 4   furthering there, the adversary process interest, would

 5   not be furthered by allowing the defendant to take the

 6   stand and be able to commit perjury unchecked. It would

 7   not be furthered, and it would not lead to greater

 8   deterrence by simply allowing the statements to be

 9   unavailable for impeachment purposes, because the great

10   deterrent comes with the statements being unavailable in

11   the government's case in chief.

12              We just don't think there's any reason to

13   depart from this Court's rule that, so long as

14   statements are not involuntary, they can be used for

15   impeachment purposes.

16              If there are no further questions, we submit

17   the judgment below should be reversed.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

21                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22              MR. EDGE:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23   please the Court:

24              I guess I have basically three arguments

25   with the -- or problems with the State's position. First

 1   of all, what we are dealing with in the Sixth Amendment

 2   case here is a violation of a core enumerated trial

 3   right, and this makes it a very different animal from

 4   all the other cases that we are talking about. If we are

 5   talking about the Fourth Amendment, we are talking about

 6   something that isn't a trial right. It's a right of the

 7   people to be secure in their homes and possessions. The

 8   violation occurs when the police commit whatever

 9   misconduct makes the search of the evidence illegal. But

10   the use of that evidence at trial doesn't work any

11   further constitutional --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            Wasn't this individual

13   represented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?

14              MR. EDGE:      Yes, he was.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            And he was represented by

16   counsel at the time that the informant took the

17   statement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?

18              MR. EDGE:      No, I don't think so --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            I have my memo that I

20   haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite

21   interested. I thought he asked for counsel.            He was

22   given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement

23   was elicited. I would like to know that because the

24   Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of

25   counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had

 1   a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, "Don't talk to

 2   informants in the jailhouse."              He could have said, "I'm

 3   going to talk to who I want." Or he might not have. But

 4   I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance

 5   of counsel at the time the statement was elicited?              It's

 6   one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't.

 7   Don't know?

 8                 MR. EDGE:     No.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           How can I find out?

10                 MR. EDGE:     No, the -- I don't know exactly

11   the day that this happened. I do know that he was

12   arrested on the 16th of January of 2004, and there was a

13   search of his cell on January 20th. And we know from

14   that testimony that -- why that's relevant that he was

15   cellmates with Mr. Doser by that time, and Mr. Doser

16   testified that he was the cellmate of Mr. Ventris for

17   two days.   And on the second day, Mr. Ventris supposedly

18   made these statements.

19                 So my best guess is that the -- this

20   conversation occurred sometime between the 17th and the

21   20th. Now, the order of appointing counsel was entered

22   on January 21st, and counsel doesn't enter his

23   appearance until January 27th.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So it might be he asked for

25   counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?

 1               MR. EDGE:     Correct, Your Honor.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, do I

 3   understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to

 4   concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting

 5   the introduction of these statements for impeachment?

 6   The sentence says, "A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule

 7   that allowed use of uncounseled statements for

 8   impeachment would not deter violations of the right to

 9   counsel."

10               MR. EDGE:     That's correct, Your Honor. And

11   the reason I believe this is that, as long as there's

12   some kind of incentive for the prosecutor to use

13   informants in this manner, then the only -- then even if

14   they are not usable in the case in chief, there is still

15   an incentive to use this kind of evidence, and the

16   prosecutor and the police will attempt to obtain it.

17   There's simply very little downside. The prosecutor

18   instructs the informant not to deliberately elicit the

19   statement. The prosecutor is still responsible for the

20   informant, because the informant is his agent, so even

21   if -- when the informant goes ahead and deliberately

22   elicits the statement, it's still a constitutional

23   violation. But so long as you allow it for some kind of

24   purpose, then there isn't a deterrent effect, and to --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:         So in a situation like we

 1   have here, where the law enforcement officers do not

 2   instruct the informant to do anything that would violate

 3   the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their

 4   testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is

 5   consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no

 6   deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the

 7   statements for impeachment purposes?

 8                MR. EDGE:      I mean         -- I guess, maybe I am

 9   confused. There is a deterrent -- there is a deterrent

10   effect from suppressing it in the case in chief, but

11   it's not sufficient unless it's also extended to use in

12   rebuttal as well.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:          But what do you want to

14   deter? You want to deter them from using informants at

15   all, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth

16   Amendment?

17                MR. EDGE:      No, Your Honor. What I am

18   attempting to deter is the sort of up-ending of the

19   adversarial system that this represents. There was a

20   question that was presented earlier about when does this

21   violation occur? And I think that gets to the manner of

22   -- or the nature of the Sixth Amendment violation. Our

23   contention is that the violation occurs when the

24   statement is extracted, and then it's further aggravated

25   when it's used at trial. When the police obtain these

 1   kinds of statements, even if they are not used at trial,

 2   it does work a harm on the defendant and his

 3   relationship with counsel. It affects defendant's --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:               I see the problem. I wonder

 5   if you have an answer to another question. You may not.

 6   I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since

 7   this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the

 8   Michigan case. The other cases were decided even

 9   earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has

10   never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the

11   question of whether the State can introduce into

12   evidence a statement made when the State questioned an

13   individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of

14   the presence of the counsel.

15              I mean, does that normally happen, or does

16   it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do

17   you have any idea?

18              MR. EDGE:         I do not, Your Honor. And I am

19   really at a loss to speculate as to why that would be.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You agree with the

21   representations on -- from your friends on the other

22   side that there is no case of ours where we have

23   excluded a statement of evidence submitted for

24   impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in

25   this case in chief?       If you prevail here, it would be

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the first time that any evidence or statement has been

 2   excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?

 3                MR. EDGE:      It would be a very different

 4   rule.    I think the only rule that this would be the case

 5   so far is in Portash, the self-incrimination clause.                      We

 6   are saying that the same type of rule should apply to

 7   the Sixth Amendment.       Otherwise, no, that's correct,

 8   whenever you are talking about the Fourth Amendment or

 9   one of the prophylactic rules like Miranda or Jackson,

10   then they are admissible for impeachment purposes.                      What

11   makes this case different is that it -- it involves a

12   violation of an enumerated Constitutional trial right.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's what I'm not certain

14   about.   And this is why I ask -- have been asking these

15   questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is

16   this.

17                I ask for a lawyer.              The State has some

18   period of time to give me a lawyer.                      Now it's one thing

19   if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State

20   should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they

21   are supposed to do it.        But that isn't as basic --

22   that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil

23   context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if

24   I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give

25   me one, though it should.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 That's a different violation, a different

 2   kind of violation.      One is a kind of a rule of ethics

 3   incorporated in the Constitution.                  The second is what

 4   the case is -- is what the Constitution is really about,

 5   give him a lawyer when he asks for one.                      And which is

 6   this case?    That -- that's why I'm having hard time.                      Is

 7   it the first or the second?

 8                 MR. EDGE:      Well, in -- I think one of the

 9   complicating factors here, Your Honor, is that the State

10   in this particular case didn't try a straightforward

11   interrogation.    They sent in an undercover informant.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, no.          I will

13   amalgamate that for you.           I will say they are exactly

14   the same thing.    But what I want to know is what rule is

15   violated, what Sixth Amendment rule.                      The rule -- you

16   heard what I said, the rule "don't talk to a guy who

17   wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer."                      No

18   communications with a client.               It's a communication with

19   the lawyer.    That's one thing.

20                 And the other rule is he has asked for a

21   lawyer but you never gave him one.                   Now which is this

22   case?   I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a

23   lawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I

24   thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a

25   lawyer, and they haven't violated that second.

 1                 If you have any view on that, it would be

 2   helpful to me.

 3                 MR. EDGE:      I don't know whether he had asked

 4   for a lawyer or not.        I know that he was entitled to one

 5   at the time, and one would be appointed for him.                  But

 6   otherwise--

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But we do know that

 8   unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no

 9   warning here at all.        I mean, he thinks he is talking to

10   a cellmate.     Nobody tells him, "remember you've got a

11   right to be represented by counsel," and he's

12   essentially giving a statement without the Miranda

13   warnings.

14                 MR. EDGE:      That's correct, Your Honor.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the other side says

16   well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to

17   say something that's really involuntary when he is

18   confronting police officers, that the reason that we

19   exclude in the case of a police officer is this

20   intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the

21   police station or in the cell and there are these police

22   officers.     Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so

23   there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that

24   there is when the police do the questioning.

25                 MR. EDGE:      Well, Your Honor, I think that


                                         32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there certainly can be a coercive atmosphere even if you

 2   are not talking to a known police agent.                Now, those are

 3   not the facts of this particular case and there is no

 4   claim that the statement was involuntary.                However, one

 5   of the advantages of speaking to known police officers

 6   is that a defendant can simply end the interrogation by

 7   invoking his right to counsel, and that is not

 8   necessarily a course of action that is available to him

 9   if he thinks he is merely talking to a cellmate,

10   somebody who whether he wants to speak to him or not is

11   going to be in the cell with him for some time.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, you've --

13   you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from

14   the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would

15   be excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment

16   purposes is that this is a trial right.                But the Sixth

17   Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right

18   to the assistance of counsel.            Well, he had assistance

19   of counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did

20   was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's

21   evidence and all the bad things that he did.

22              But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth

23   Amendment violation where we allow the evidence to be

24   admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you

25   know, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength


                                      33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of that distinction.

 2                MR. EDGE:       Your Honor, I think it goes to

 3   the nature of the harm that comes from a Sixth Amendment

 4   violation.   The Sixth Amendment simply doesn't limit

 5   itself to the trial.        The exact wording of the -- the

 6   constitutional provision is in all criminal

 7   prosecutions.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, it seems to me

 9   you are getting away from the basis for your

10   distinction, then.      Saying well, it's not just at trial.

11   Well, these other constitutional rights where we have

12   allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are

13   indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right,

14   outside of trial.

15                MR. EDGE:       Well, because the harm isn't

16   something that just affects the outcome of the trial, it

17   also affects the -- it affects the litigation in a much,

18   much deeper way.     It affects counsel's trial strategy,

19   it affects the defendant's decision whether or not to

20   testify.   It also --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Just to pause on

22   that, it affects his decision to testify because it

23   makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if

24   he is going to testify.

25                MR. EDGE:       Not necessarily.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The focus -- the

 2   focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword

 3   because the harm that we are facilitating under your

 4   rule is to allow perjured testimony.

 5               MR. EDGE:      Yes, Your Honor, in some contexts

 6   it would.   I think one of the underlying assumptions of

 7   the State's argument with regard to perjury is that the

 8   mere existence of a prior inconsistent statement is

 9   necessarily indicative of perjury, and we know there are

10   many reasons why the defendant may have given a prior

11   inconsistent statement.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yeah, and if he has

13   the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth

14   Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out.

15   He was -- he was he is not lying now.                   The reason he

16   said something different then was, you know, he likes to

17   brag in prison or whatever the basis is.

18               MR. EDGE:      In some cases it will be possible

19   for counsel to vigorously cross-examine the informant.

20   In others it may not.      But in addition to that, Your

21   Honor, I would also say that it doesn't simply affect

22   the decision whether or not to go to trial or whether or

23   not to testify at trial; it also affects the litigation

24   in a very deep way, inasmuch as the defendant is

25   burdened in trying to negotiate a favorable plea deal.

 1              Every statement or every piece of evidence

 2   that the State has affects their willingness to plea

 3   bargain, and when the State obtains this kind of

 4   evidence illegally, it puts the defendant in a bind for

 5   -- puts the defendant's counsel in a bind.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I think -- I think

 7   that's quite right.      But I don't see how excluding the

 8   evidence even on impeachment helps that.                  I mean,

 9   they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you

10   know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will

11   get some leads from it even if they can't use it.                    But

12   excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't

13   eliminate that harm.

14              MR. EDGE:        It would, Your Honor, inasmuch it

15   would remove any disincentive for the police to obtain

16   this evidence by this manner in the first place.                    So

17   there would be that marginal deterrent factor.

18              JUSTICE ALITO:            Which of the things that

19   you've just said result from the use of this for

20   impeachment would not be true with respect to the other

21   situations where illegally obtained evidence has been

22   used for impeachment purposes?               Take the Fourth

23   Amendment, for example.

24              MR. EDGE:        I think they would be largely the

25   same, Your Honor.    The difference would be in the

 1   interest protected.      The self-incrimination clause in

 2   the Fifth Amendment is aimed primarily at coercion of

 3   the defendant; whereas, the Sixth Amendment aims

 4   primarily at the preservation of an adversarial process,

 5   the relationship between counsel and his attorney.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         You don't dispute that there

 7   was a Sixth Amendment violation at the time this

 8   statement was taken, do you?

 9                MR. EDGE:     No, I do not.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You urged a -- a

11   fall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there

12   should be a determination by the judge that the

13   defendant intentionally testified falsely.                And I was

14   wondering how that would operate.                You are here in the

15   -- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I

16   want to call snitch so-and-so.              And then what do we do,

17   just interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial

18   to test the credibility of the -- the informant?

19                MR. EDGE:     Yes, you could, Your Honor.

20   Also, you could have it as part of the pretrial

21   suppression hearings.      I would anticipate that even if

22   the -- if the Court were to adopt our position, these

23   kinds of Sixth Amendment cases are still going to be

24   litigated.   The issue is simply going to be whether or

25   not the States or the police agent is deliberately

 2               So there is -- there is likely going to be

 3   some kind of pretrial litigation regarding the

 4   admissibility of the statements, and it could be handled

 5   at that time.

 6               If there are no further questions, I will

 7   reserve the remainder of my time.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 9   Mr. McAllister, you have six minutes remaining.

10               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

11                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12               MR. McALLISTER:              Two points by way of

13   rebuttal.   The balancing of the interests here is

14   sprinkling water under the bridge even in the Sixth

15   Amendment context.      In both Nix versus Williams and

16   Michigan versus Harvey where the Court was dealing with

17   Sixth Amendment interests and the Sixth Amendment right

18   to counsel violations, the bulk of those cases make

19   clear that the question of what exclusionary effect to

20   give a violation is subject to a balancing analysis.

21   And that's what we are asking for here.                   That's why it's

22   treated for these purposes like the Fourth Amendment in

23   the Miranda context.

24               And Nicks itself, to paraphrase the Court,

25   makes a fundamental point which I think illustrates how

 1   this works, and it worked effectively to defendant's

 2   advantage in this case.

 3                In Nix v. Williams, the Court said the Sixth

 4   Amendment right to counsel -- and I am paraphrasing

 5   slightly -- protects against unfairness by assuring an

 6   adversary process in which proffered evidence is tested

 7   by cross-examination.      And it's done in front of a jury.

 8   It is not about requiring the exclusion of entire

 9   categories of witnesses or types of evidence for all

10   purposes.

11                So the right to counsel was exercised.                It

12   was exercised effectively in this case when Mr. Doser

13   was strongly cross-examined by defense counsel.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would that apply equally

15   for statements under oath?

16                MR. McALLISTER:           It could, Your Honor.       I

17   realize a logical extension is you could say just test

18   all of it.   But that is where the -- the police here and

19   prosecutor pay the price of the way in which the

20   evidence was obtained.       It's excluded from the

21   government's case-in-chief.

22                Unless there are further questions, we would

23   respectfully ask that this Court reverse the decision

24   below.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.
