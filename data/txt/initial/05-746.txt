 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8           MR. PHILLIPS:    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

 9   may it please the Court:

10           The fundamental question in this case is whether

11   the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant

12   negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the

13   FELA.   The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most

14   clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts,

15   which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the

16   middle paragraph.    And I think it is worth taking a

17   second to read it.

18           The rules which determine the causal relation

19   between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm

20   resulting to him are the same as those determining the

21   causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct

22   and resulting harm to others.            That is a principle of law

23   that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers

24   Liability Act was enacted.        It is obviously a restatement

25   of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear


                                      3

                                  Official


 1   statement of the law as it applies today.

 2           There is nothing in the Federal Employers

 3   Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of

 4   equivalence.   The two provisions, section 51 talks about

 5   negligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in

 6   part.   And section 53, which describes the contributory

 7   negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about

 8   negligence attributable to.          None of that deviates at all

 9   from any kind of common law doctrines.           Negligence

10   inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.

11           JUSTICE SCALIA:     Except that the -- what was it,

12   the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate

13   whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that

14   the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the

15   negligence of the defendant.

16           The basis for that holding was that in whole or in

17   part language which is used for the negligence of the

18   defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence.

19   So if you believe that that case was at least decided for

20   the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument

21   that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.

22           MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, even if that were true, we

23   would still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it

24   doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence.          It doesn't

25   say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect


                                     4

 1   to the -- our clients --

 2         JUSTICE SCALIA:      But nobody does --

 3         MR. PHILLIPS:      The plaintiff would be.        That

 4   doctrine is unaffected by that holding.           Now, I'd like

 5   to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you

 6   want, at this point.     But it seems to me the doctrine of

 7   equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine

 8   of proximate causation.      And therefore, you can change one

 9   without affecting the other one whatsoever.

10         JUSTICE GINSBURG:       Mr. Phillips, the fundamental

11   problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was

12   no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the

13   judge gave on negligence.       There was an instruction

14   requested by the defendant on contributory negligence,

15   which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in

16   whole or in part to cause his injury."           That was the

17   only instruction objected to, because the refusal to

18   give that instruction.     But you seem to be using that as

19   a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which

20   no objection was made.

21         MR. PHILLIPS:      That's not our attack, Justice

22   Ginsburg.   Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of

23   the cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and

24   I think the current MAI instruction has a different

25   causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that


                                     5

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such

 2   negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause

 3   -- to cause the injury.      And that misstates the law,

 4   because of the doctrine of equivalence.

 5         That's our initial argument, is that no matter how

 6   you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate

 7   cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate

 8   way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to

 9   be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence.

10   That's the core doctrine.       That's what we sought

11   certiorari on.

12         The argument with respect to Rogers was not an

13   argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg.       It's

14   an argument that the Respondent put into this case.

15         JUSTICE SOUTER:      I take it you would be satisfied

16   -- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if

17   we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and

18   we think the instruction on contributory negligence was

19   correct.   Because that would mean in the next case, you

20   would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's

21   negligence.

22         MR. PHILLIPS:     We would regard that as certainly

23   at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf.      But

24   at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this

25   case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide


                                     6

 1   whether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the

 2   law.

 3            JUSTICE SOUTER:       If we came out the way I just

 4   described --

 5            MR. PHILLIPS:      You wouldn't have to address that

 6   issue.

 7            JUSTICE SOUTER:       We wouldn't have to.

 8            MR. PHILLIPS:      Absolutely don't have to address

 9   that issue.     On the other hand, the question is squarely

10   presented.     And --

11            JUSTICE KENNEDY:        But I thought you argued the

12   Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri

13   court?

14            MR. PHILLIPS:      We clearly did that, Justice

15   Kennedy.     And we didn't raise -- we are not here

16   complaining about Rogers as an argument for why we

17   shouldn't be liable.        That's not our -- we're not

18   criticizing that.

19            What we're saying is, in response to the

20   Respondent's argument which seeks to undermine the

21   doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would

22   argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect.

23   And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect,

24   we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two

25   different reasons.

 1           The first one that Justice Souter described.             And

 2   the second one would be that to the extent that there's

 3   any equivalence, there's no problem here because

 4   proximate cause is required in every case.            And we think

 5   that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to

 6   decide, but certainly could.            I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 7           JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Mr. Phillips, the defendant

 8   requested a charge on contributory negligence that read,

 9   "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in

10   part to cause his injuries."            You didn't want the direct

11   relationship, you didn't ask for that.            You asked for one

12   that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in

13   whole or in part to his injury."            Now you are saying that

14   that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.

15           MR. PHILLIPS:   No, what we're saying, Justice

16   Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they

17   were going to use slight negligence with respect to our

18   negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's

19   negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as

20   well.

21           That's our fundamental argument.           That's the issue

22   we have put on the table.       And candidly, I don't think

23   there's an answer to that that's been offered in this

24   case, other than a harmless error argument, which I think

25   is candidly without substance.

 1            The issue, then, is whether in evaluating the

 2   doctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain

 3   the plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument,

 4   which is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental

 5   change, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence

 6   as it applies to FELA.

 7            And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the

 8   doctrine of equivalence at all.            And, two, to the extent

 9   it does speak to it, it was never meant to change the

10   fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.

11            JUSTICE SCALIA:     Except we've rejected petitions

12   for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times.

13   Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers

14   required.    You --

15            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, at least one circuit clearly.

16            JUSTICE SCALIA:     Do you really expect to get five

17   votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive

18   change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50

19   years?

20            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, I think the -- well, the

21   answer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for

22   that.

23            JUSTICE SCALIA:     But you were wise enough not to

24   ask for that.

 1            MR. PHILLIPS:     But you know, the basic -- the

 2   point here is that if you look at the decisions that have

 3   analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think

 4   any of them has analyzed it with much care.           And the

 5   reality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with

 6   care, and reached the opposite conclusion.

 7            We think there is a split in the circuits.         And at

 8   some point, if not through this vehicle to address that

 9   issue, then through another vehicle to address that

10   issue.    But, yes, it seems reasonably clear that, first

11   of all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court

12   dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also

13   with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to

14   Rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation.

15            There is nothing in the statute that remotely

16   meant to change that.      There is nothing that's been

17   identified in that context.           It is at least clear to me,

18   and I hope clear to five of you --

19            JUSTICE SCALIA:    Rogers said, in whole or in part.

20   Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it.

21   But Rogers said that it did it.

22            MR. PHILLIPS:     But what Rogers saying in whole or

23   in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation

24   standard existing in Missouri.           And Missouri's proximate

25   cause standard talked about sole causation.           And this


                                     10

                                  Official


 1   Court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation

 2   can not be the right standard for proximate cause.

 3         The Court was not asked to decide, and I don't

 4   think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is

 5   traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door,

 6   or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury

 7   instruction that calls for proximate causation to be

 8   given to both parties -- I'm sorry.

 9         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Mr. Phillips, I may be

10   lost a bit here.   But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the

11   instructions that were given.           And it seems to me it is

12   hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's

13   part because it tracks the statutory language.           The

14   statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction

15   says in whole or in part.

16         So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence,

17   your objection seems to be to the directly contributed

18   language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff.

19   Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a

20   typical proximate cause instruction?

21         MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes, that is a typical proximate

22   cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was

23   heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're

24   saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're

25   entitled to the equivalent instructions.           Whatever they


                                    11

 1   are.     If it is slight cause or proximate cause.

 2            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Right.   But on the other

 3   hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause.                  You

 4   are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.

 5            MR. PHILLIPS:     Right.         But we are only doing that

 6   in response to the Respondent's argument.               I'm not -- we

 7   didn't bring to this Court an affirmative argument that

 8   said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate

 9   cause.     That's not the argument we made.            The argument --

10            JUSTICE KENNEDY:      How is the blue brief in

11   response to Respondent's argument?

12            MR. PHILLIPS:     Because if you look at the

13   opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task

14   for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on

15   page 6, "inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let

16   alone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its

17   entire discussion of FELA's causation standards."

18            Against that kind of an attack, we felt it

19   incumbent on us to deal with Rogers.

20            JUSTICE BREYER:     As we're supposed to decide the

21   case, in your view, there was instruction 13.

22   Instruction 13 used the word direct.

23            MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes.

24            JUSTICE BREYER:     You object to 13.         You said it

25   should use the word in whole or in part.

 1         MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes.

 2         JUSTICE BREYER:      You then argued to the lower

 3   courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part.                  And

 4   then you say you've argued that here.               So what you're

 5   saying is now we're supposed to decide, should

 6   instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's

 7   what it is.

 8         I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of

 9   the blue brief.   I thought you were arguing something

10   else about railroad negligence.          But you're not now, you

11   say, arguing about railroad negligence.               You're arguing

12   about plaintiff negligence.

13         MR. PHILLIPS:     Right, we're arguing both.

14         JUSTICE BREYER:      All right.            So if I reread the

15   blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination,

16   that your real objection, not responding to the other

17   side, has simply been about the standard to use in

18   respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence.               And what

19   you want this Court to say is, you're right about that,

20   we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory

21   negligence.   End of case.

22         MR. PHILLIPS:     Right.

23         JUSTICE BREYER:      Yes?

24         MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes.

25         JUSTICE BREYER:      It says that in the blue brief?

 1            MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes, it does say that in the blue

 2   brief.    Because what we say is that the doctrine

 3   of equivalence is the principle that should apply.              And

 4   you know, it is not specifically before the Court whether

 5   that means slight cause or proximate cause.

 6            JUSTICE BREYER:     I would say it sure is before the

 7   Court, because what we are considering before the Court

 8   is your objection to instruction 13.              And you said it

 9   should use the words in whole or in part.              And I have to

10   admit, I don't know why it shouldn't.             But I'll have to

11   ask them that.

12            MR. PHILLIPS:     That's fair.

13            JUSTICE BREYER:     You're going to say yes.

14   So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether

15   -- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad

16   should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole

17   or in part.

18            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, I don't know that it's --

19            JUSTICE BREYER:     Causation.

20            MR. PHILLIPS:     I don't know that it's extraneous.

21   It clearly is not something that the Court needs to

22   decide.    On the other hand, it is something that the

23   Respondents, to my mind at least, put into the case.                And

24   then we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in

25   urging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right --

 1   whether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts

 2   of appeals have.

 3         JUSTICE GINSBURG:       Perhaps my memory is faulty,

 4   but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were

 5   devoted to what instruction should have been given on

 6   railroad negligence.    You were dealing not simply with

 7   what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the

 8   instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it

 9   said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language.

10   Instead it said directly caused.

11         So that's the limit of what we can deal with,

12   whether the in whole or in part should have been in the

13   contributory negligence.      But it was your brief that

14   spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for

15   the railroad's negligence.

16         MR. PHILLIPS:     There is no question about that,

17   Justice Ginsburg.   But the point is that we made both

18   arguments.   And they are in some ways intertwined, in

19   part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence

20   itself is based on proximate cause as the standard.             And

21   so if you go back and look at all of the common law

22   analyses here, which are the predicate --

23         JUSTICE GINSBURG:       But you didn't object to the

24   charge that was given on negligence.             You didn't object

25   to the in whole or in part.          So that should be out of the

 1   case.

 2           MR. PHILLIPS:     Except to the extent that the

 3   Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a

 4   mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence.

 5   Now, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two

 6   ways.

 7           You can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia,

 8   Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and

 9   therefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should

10   just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the

11   courts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time.

12   Or alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that

13   in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence,

14   you should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea

15   change in the law.

16           And we took them up on that argument, and said, we

17   don't think it did.     And that if it didn't work a sea

18   change in the law, then there is no basis at all for

19   doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in

20   these two cases.     And that's the guidance you would give

21   to the lower courts on remand.            Because this case would

22   have to go back for a new trial.

23           JUSTICE GINSBURG:       You're not taking them up on

24   any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about

25   what the proper standard was for the railroad's

 1   negligence.

 2         JUSTICE KENNEDY:       And I would add to that that we

 3   don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the

 4   Petitioner is presenting.

 5         MR. PHILLIPS:     And you know, Justice Kennedy, I

 6   understand that.   But the reality is we raised the

 7   doctrine of equivalence as our question presented.             The

 8   other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its

 9   pages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers.           We answer

10   that in the reply brief.      The Court grants certiorari.

11   We decided under those circumstances that the sensible

12   way to proceed was to address the Rogers issue.

13         Now, to be sure, I suppose we could have said,

14   here's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence.

15   That's a 10 page brief.      Maybe the better way to do it is

16   just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief

17   on Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers.

18         But we anticipated that they were going to do

19   precisely what they did, which is --

20         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            So you would have us

21   announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence

22   without saying which way it should be made equivalent?

23   Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the

24   employee's?

25         MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, because -- courts of appeals


                                    17

                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    have been doing that for years.         There have been a lot --

2    you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower

3    standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence

4    requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight

5    cause, then the defendant gets slight cause.              So that's a

6    ruling that's been rendered for years and years.

7          Is that the most sensible way?              I don't know.      I

8    think it would make sense for this Court to address the

9    more fundamental issue of Rogers.          Because I think it is

10   an important issue that needs to be decided.              I don't

11   think the Court needs to decide it.              I do think it has

12   been thoroughly vetted for the Court on both sides, and

13   it would certainly provide significant guidance to the

14   lower courts.

15         JUSTICE STEVENS:      Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this

16   question.   Assuming you're right on the doctrine of

17   equivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the

18   moment.   Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is

19   perfectly clear there was no harmless error here.

20         MR. PHILLIPS:    Yes.

21         JUSTICE STEVENS:      It seemed to me that a possible

22   interpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment

23   of the record -- is that the jury either believed the one --

24   one truck driver or the other.          And that the direct causation

25   thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of



                                    18
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   damages.

 2         And I was going to ask you to comment on that and

 3   to tell me whether during the argument of the case before

 4   the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect,

 5   that he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of

 6   proving a causation than we do?

 7         MR. PHILLIPS:     Let me take the first question

 8   first, and then I'll address the second one.          There were

 9   three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the

10   negligence of the railroad.          Not just that the one driver

11   drove the other driver off the side of the road.          There

12   was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed

13   properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given

14   adequate safety instructions.

15         And there's no way, given that this was a general

16   verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories

17   was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that

18   theory might line up with a causation theory, based on

19   the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's

20   arguments in this particular case.

21         So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said,

22   and that's it.   They were more theories in it.         And you

23   know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions

24   count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's

25   imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to


                                    19

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a

 2   harmless error determination.

 3            It is also a question of State law.          It ought to

 4   be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance

 5   in any event, I would think, rather than this Court

 6   trying to sort through the record.

 7            With respect to the argument at the close of

 8   the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that

 9   either side made with respect to the burdens, because the

10   jury instructions were what they were.            And I think each

11   side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything

12   wrong.    And so that's basically the way that it was

13   presented.

14            But I think given the way the jury instructions

15   played out, that there's no way at this time to

16   unscramble that.

17            JUSTICE BREYER:     I think I'm seeing now, I think

18   the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on

19   it, but saying this:       Look, we objected to the

20   contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it

21   couldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from

22   the railroad instruction.        And we said they should be the

23   same and they should both be in whole or in part.

24            MR. PHILLIPS:     Correct.

25            JUSTICE BREYER:     And we now want you to say that


                                     20

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it

 2   violated the equivalence.       But as soon as you do that,

 3   you're going to have to think about what the right

 4   standard should be for a new trial.

 5         MR. PHILLIPS:      Right.

 6         JUSTICE BREYER:      And if you stop there, probably,

 7   they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the

 8   right standard.

 9         MR. PHILLIPS:      Correct.

10         JUSTICE BREYER:      And if you really think about it,

11   you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one

12   that the court gave, is the right standard and should

13   have been given in the other case, too.          Now, we wouldn't

14   have to say that.

15         MR. PHILLIPS:      Right.

16         JUSTICE BREYER:      But you're saying unless you say

17   that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what

18   happens in the future.     Now --

19         MR. PHILLIPS:      You know, that's --

20         JUSTICE BREYER:      Now let's think back for a minute

21   on the merits.

22         MR. PHILLIPS:      I'm sorry?

23         JUSTICE BREYER:      How could it be wrong?      How could

24   it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole

25   or in part language for the railroad, since that's the


                                    21

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   language of the statute itself?

 2            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, I think if we were entitled

 3   to go back to the trial court, and if the issue was

 4   what's the proper instruction, we would have asked for

 5   and we should have properly received a proximate cause

 6   instruction.     And that's what -- that's the question that

 7   will be at issue on the remand.

 8            JUSTICE BREYER:     What possible -- you have two

 9   sides.     One, you write a proximate cause instruction in

10   whatever language you like.

11            MR. PHILLIPS:     Right.

12            JUSTICE BREYER:     The other side submits a proposed

13   instruction with in whole or in part.                 I'm a trial

14   judge.     I've never heard of this case, kind of case

15   before.     I just was appointed.         I read the statute.         And

16   I say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and

17   yours doesn't.     I'll play it safe.              I'll go with the

18   statute.     All right?    Now, how could that be an error?

19            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, it is not a correct statement

20   of the law.

21            JUSTICE BREYER:     All right.

22            MR. PHILLIPS:     Is the answer.

23            JUSTICE BREYER:     In other words, what the statute

24   said it is not a correct statement of the law?

25            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, because it doesn't adequately

 1   explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go

 2   through in order to evaluate this case.           I mean, it is

 3   true, it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that

 4   there's nothing wrong with it.           But it is not an adequate

 5   statement because it doesn't deal, it is not sufficient,

 6   it doesn't deal with the proximate cause issue.           I mean,

 7   it seems to me --

 8         JUSTICE SOUTER:       Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on

 9   exactly the point that I think you're addressing with

10   Justice Breyer?    As I understand your argument, you're

11   saying one view of Rogers is that the in whole or in part

12   language eliminates the proximate cause instruction.            We

13   all agree that that is one view of Rogers.

14         MR. PHILLIPS:      Right.

15         JUSTICE SOUTER:       But it also does something else.

16   And I don't think we disagree about that either.          It

17   specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation

18   may be present.    And if it is, if the defendant is at

19   least one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers

20   even slightly --

21         MR. PHILLIPS:      Right.

22         JUSTICE SOUTER:       -- that that will suffice.         The

23   problem I have with -- in a way with your response to

24   Justice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the

25   instruction that your side requested on contributory


                                     23

 1   negligence is this:     It seems to me that the in whole or

 2   in part language would be wrong on contributory

 3   negligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for

 4   the simple reason that you never get to contributory

 5   negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent

 6   in the first place.

 7         MR. PHILLIPS:       Right.

 8         JUSTICE SOUTER:        And therefore, if the plaintiff

 9   is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part.               It

10   couldn't be wholly or in part.            If it were wholly

11   negligent, you would never have found the defendant was

12   negligent in the first place.

13         MR. PHILLIPS:       I --

14         JUSTICE SOUTER:        So that to the extent the

15   instruction addresses multiple causation, it would be

16   misleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility

17   that couldn't happen.      Therefore, if you are not going to

18   mislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct

19   on contributory negligence, you've got to have some other

20   way of addressing the proximate cause language.               Is that

21   analysis right or wrong?

22         MR. PHILLIPS:       Well, I think it is wrong on two

23   levels.   One is, I don't know why you would need to have

24   proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you

25   just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight


                                      24

 1   cause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in

 2   part means, then you can just say slight cause when

 3   you're describing the contributory negligence.

 4         JUSTICE SOUTER:       Okay.        But the instruction that your

 5   side asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight

 6   cause instruction, it was an in whole or in part

 7   instruction.

 8         MR. PHILLIPS:      What we asked for was an

 9   equivalence.

10         JUSTICE SOUTER:       Okay, and that -- all right.       But

11   if you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction

12   on contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has

13   got to have been correct in saying no to that, because to

14   the extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would

15   be addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in

16   contributory negligence which will always be in part.

17         MR. PHILLIPS:      That was not the basis on which the

18   judge rejected it.    He didn't reject it on the basis --

19         JUSTICE SOUTER:       Well, maybe that was not the

20   basis on which he rejected it, but if -- we've got to

21   consider it in deciding whether to reverse it.

22         MR. PHILLIPS:      Well, the point here that remains

23   is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction.

24   Now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly

25   argue about that.

 1            JUSTICE SOUTER:     But that's not what he said.        He

 2   said equivalence instruction was not on multiple

 3   causation.    It was the equivalence instruction on either

 4   proximate cause or not proximate cause.             It was the

 5   causation issue, it was the proximate causation issue,

 6   not the multiple causation issue that concerned you,

 7   right?

 8            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, that is the specific issue in

 9   this case.

10            JUSTICE SOUTER:     They don't have to have

11   proximate, we don't have to have proximate.

12            MR. PHILLIPS:     Right.        That's our argument.

13            JUSTICE SOUTER:     Okay.        But because the

14   instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause

15   and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far

16   as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request

17   for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory

18   negligence really should have been denied.             Is that

19   correct?

20            MR. PHILLIPS:     Well -- I think -- I think the

21   argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly.

22   I think you can make an argument that what, you know,

23   what we were entitled to was some variant.             And that --

24   our objection here is not --

25            JUSTICE SOUTER:     You were entitled -- your

 1   argument is you were entitled to an equivalent

 2   instruction on the issue of the need to prove --

 3         MR. PHILLIPS:      The slightest cause.

 4         JUSTICE SOUTER:      -- proximate cause or no need to

 5   prove proximate cause.

 6         MR. PHILLIPS:      Right.

 7         JUSTICE SOUTER:      That's your basic argument.

 8         MR. PHILLIPS:      That's our basic argument.

 9         JUSTICE SOUTER:      Okay.

10         MR. PHILLIPS:     And we didn't get that.

11         JUSTICE SOUTER:      And I don't think you could have

12   gotten where you want to go with the instruction that

13   your side requested, which was an in whole or in part

14   instruction.   That's my only point.

15         MR. PHILLIPS:     Well, it may be that the in whole

16   part of this may have been slightly misleading, although

17   I think you can make an argument that you can end up with

18   in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter.     But

19   that's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial.       It

20   wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't

21   the basis for the court of appeals decision.

22         If the Court wants to send it back and say, is

23   there another objection to this instruction, that's fine.

24   But it seems to me, this Court ought to address this

25   issue in the way it has been presented.

 1         JUSTICE GINSBURG:        What was wrong with the

 2   instruction, in your view of the case, that was given,

 3   instruction number 13, negligence of plaintiff directly

 4   contributed to cause his injuries?

 5         MR. PHILLIPS:     Because that's proximate causation.

 6   And that's higher than we were required to prove under a

 7   doctrine of equivalence, Your Honor.

16                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. PERRY

17                 ON BEHALF OF THE Respondent

18         MS. PERRY:   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

19   the Court:

20         The controlling question raised here is whether

21   instruction 13 accurately states Federal law.          That's

22   exactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the

23   Missouri Court of Appeals.      They could not have been any

24   clearer that their challenge was to instruction 13.             In

25   John versus Poulin, this Court said that State courts


                                    28

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in

 2   their courts even when Federal issues are at stake.

 3         The requirements in the Missouri courts were not

 4   complied with here.     No abstract question was presented.

 5   The sole question presented and preserved was with

 6   respect to instruction 13.         And that can again be seen in

 7   their opening brief in the Missouri Court of Appeals,

 8   which specifically says the trial court erred in giving

 9   instruction 13 based on MAI 32.07(b).

10         JUSTICE ALITO:       Is the question whether

11   instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether

12   it is flawed when it's viewed together with the

13   instruction on employer negligence?

14         MS. PERRY:     It is viewed in conjunction with the

15   instruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept

16   of what it was, they did not challenge the language of

17   instruction 12.    They accepted that.             Holding that

18   language constant, what should we do to instruction 13?

19         They could have objected to instruction 12 and 13,

20   and they could have said, here are a pair of instructions

21   both in proximate cause, and here are a pair of

22   instructions both in -- resulting in whole or in part,

23   and then they could have preserved this issue.               But they

24   did not do that.    They accepted instruction 12 as a

25   correct statement of the law, and said, now let's look at


                                      29

 1   instruction 13.

 2            JUSTICE ALITO:     But do you agree that they set out

 3   different causation standards, 12 and 13?

 4            MS. PERRY:   Yes, they do.           Rogers concluded that

 5   50 years ago and the courts in the Federal and State

 6   system have nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers as

 7   reaching that decision.

 8            JUSTICE ALITO:     So if the causation standards are

 9   in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't

10   that right?

11            MS. PERRY:   Yes, if you can reach that decision

12   without interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of

13   instruction 12, particularly since instruction 12

14   contained the exact language of the statute.              Whatever

15   judicial gloss has been put on that language was not told

16   to the jury.

17            Justice Stevens, the question you asked, whether

18   there was any argument about the different standards, the

19   answer is no.    There was no argument.            The only way in

20   which the jury learned of this difference was in the

21   language of the instruction.              And instruction 12 --

22            JUSTICE STEVENS:      Let me ask you this question, if

23   I may.    Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips.               Is

24   there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence?                   I

25   understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's


                                      30

 1   burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same

 2   rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence.

 3         But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding

 4   doctrine of equivalence.     It just says when they wrote

 5   the restatement, the rules were the same.              Is there such

 6   a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?

 7         MS. PERRY:   There wasn't in the early 1900s for

 8   certain, Your Honor, because at that time, even

 9   petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging.              And if

10   we look at the language of 53, it talks about the type of

11   contributory negligence that used to be a bar.              And that

12   certainly was a type of contributory negligence that only

13   arose with the traditional proximate cause.              It certainly

14   wasn't on the slightest cause standard.

15         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Well, doesn't there have

16   to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a

17   comparative negligence regime?         Because, you know, you

18   talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to

19   a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing

20   it to a certain degree.     And if you're not dealing with

21   apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the

22   comparison.

23         MS. PERRY:   No, Your Honor.              You can conduct the

24   comparison, and it happens all the time in cases where

25   one party has committed intentional misconduct and


                                   31

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   another party has had negligent misconduct.               The

 2   causation standards are different in that instance.

 3   There's a --

 4         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Right.   But we're talking

 5   about comparative negligence here, where there's

 6   negligence on both sides.        And I just don't know how you

 7   say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to

 8   the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using

 9   different causation standards.

10         MS. PERRY:    Well, the causation standard is used

11   to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in

12   the comparison.    For example, if a party is negligent,

13   but the negligence had no causative effect, that

14   negligence falls out of the analysis.

15         JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yeah, but your example of other

16   instances including having to compare a defendant who did

17   the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory

18   negligence, that's not what we have here.             We have here a

19   difference in the causation.             Intentional or

20   non-intentional has nothing to do with causation.

21         But once you say that there's a difference in the

22   causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two.

23   You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using

24   the same kind of a standard.

25         I mean, let's assume that you find that the


                                     32

 1   railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the

 2   injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly

 3   contributory to it.       What do I do?              Do I add another 40

 4   percent to his culpability because it was -- his

 5   causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?

 6            MS. PERRY:    No.

 7            JUSTICE SCALIA:       Why not?

 8            MS. PERRY:    It just affects which negligence was

 9   in the balance.       And --

10            JUSTICE SCALIA:       No, it doesn't.           It certainly

11   bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it

12   seems to me.

13            MS. PERRY:    Well, in responding -- going back to

14   your question about intentional conduct, the petitioner's

15   reply brief, in fact, states that a broader range of

16   harms are considered proximately caused by intentional

17   torts.    So there is a different conception of proximate

18   cause in that context.

19            But in any event, their merits brief consistently

20   argues for a proximate cause standard.                  In fact, it

21   closes with that.      And its criticism of instruction 13 in

22   this case was precisely that it was a proximate cause

23   standard.    So if they are now before this Court asking

24   for a proximate cause standard, they conceded that

25   instruction 13 was a proximate cause standard, they in


                                        33

 1   fact complained about it precisely because it was a

 2   proximate cause standard, that issue really isn't before

 3   this Court anymore.

 4           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            You don't have any

 5   conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to

 6   instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction,

 7   because it's comparative negligence.                It seems to me that

 8   necessarily implies in whole or in part.                If you can

 9   reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what

10   would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in

11   instruction 13?

12           MS. PERRY:    Well, I think Justice Souter hit the

13   nail on the head on that one, in that it does create

14   confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad

15   worker is responsible for other parties' culpability as

16   well.   Moreover --

17           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            No, no.    I thought Justice

18   Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's

19   instruction might cause confusion because of it.               But I

20   don't see how adding it to both of them when you're

21   dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily

22   the case that partial negligence on either of their parts

23   can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be

24   confusing.

25           MS. PERRY:    Well, in --

 1         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You can answer it.

 2         MS. PERRY:         I don't want to interrupt anybody.

 3         JUSTICE SCALIA:           Answer the question, Justice

 4   Souter.     Yes or no.

 5         JUSTICE SOUTER:           The point that I was trying to

 6   make about it being misleading is that if you use the in

 7   whole or in part language for a contributory negligence

 8   instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking

 9   that at least there might be whole contributory

10   negligence.     There never will be.             You don't get the

11   contributory negligence unless you've already found the

12   defendant was negligent, at least to some degree.

13   Therefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be

14   in part.     That's all I was trying to say.

15         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under that scenario, then,

16   what objection could there be to a recognition that the

17   negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the

18   accident?

19         MS. PERRY:      If petitioner had asked for an

20   instruction that said directly contributed in part, the

21   inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any

22   impact.     It could still potentially mislead the jury, but

23   they were seeking not just to add the words "resulting in

24   whole or in part," but remove the word "directly" because

25   it connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate


                                         35

 1   cause was not the appropriate standard for contributory

 2   negligence, even though now that is the standard that

 3   they solely are seeking.

 4         JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, two things you might

 5   comment on.     First, the in whole or in part, you might

 6   take account of the fact that there are other negligent

 7   actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury

 8   to the employee.

 9         Secondly, Section 53 does not contain the language

10   in whole or in part.

11         MS. PERRY:     Absolutely, Your Honor.           It does not.

12   In section --

13         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But that's what Justice

14   Souter has identified, right?             That's not because they're

15   adopting different standards.

16         MS. PERRY:     I disagree, Your Honor.           I think it is

17   because they are adopting different standards.              The

18   contributory negligence --

19         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, you just told me, a

20   good reason for not putting in whole or in part in

21   instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the

22   whole part doesn't make sense with contributory

23   negligence.   That's a good reason not to put it in

24   Section 53 either.

25         MR. PERRY:     That's one reason.            But another reason


                                      36

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   is that it's a different standard.               In Section 53,

 2   they're talking about contributory negligence that was a

 3   bar to liability.   That type of contributory negligence

 4   was the kind that was more than -- it wasn't caused by

 5   slight causation.   It required proximate cause.              That was

 6   a pretty harsh result.

 7         And it certainly didn't arise in instances where

 8   the plaintiff had just had the slightest causal

 9   connection.   And that certainly was the conclusion in

10   Rogers.

11         JUSTICE SOUTER:      Well, no, no.           May I pick you up

12   on that?   Because there's a point at which you and I are

13   disagreeing about Rogers.       And in all candor, I think

14   it's because you are ignoring one part of Rogers, and if

15   I'm wrong, I want you to tell me.           You quote the

16   slightest bit language from Rogers on both page 26 and 33

17   of your brief.   And you take that as being language that

18   eliminates the proximate cause requirement.

19         What you don't include in your quotation is the

20   footnote in Justice Brennan's opinion following that

21   slightest cause language.       And the footnote was to a

22   citation, the citation was to the Coray case.              The

23   opinion in Coray was written by Justice Douglas and --

24   I'm sorry, Justice Black.       And in the very language that

25   Justice Black used, he said expressly that if proximate


                                    37

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   cause is shown, there can be recovery.

 2         Now, given the fact that in Rogers, the very

 3   citation to the language which you say eliminated the

 4   proximate cause requirement cited a case in which

 5   proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on,

 6   I don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases,

 7   but I don't see how you can read Rogers as eliminating

 8   the proximate cause requirement.

 9         And therefore, I think you have to read Rogers as

10   addressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate

11   causation.   Now, am I going wrong there somewhere?

12         MS. PERRY:    I have two responses, Your Honor.

13   First, Justice Brennan wrote Crane twelve years later.

14         JUSTICE SOUTER:      Absolutely right.

15         MS. PERRY:    And he, you know, definitely clearly

16   said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common

17   law proximate causation relying on Rogers.

18         JUSTICE SOUTER:      He did, but he was also pointing

19   out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in

20   Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I

21   forget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act.        And the

22   Appliance Act had its own set of standards.       And

23   therefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you

24   cannot infer anything one way or the other about the

25   general standard in FELA.       And to make it even more

 1   complicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case,

 2   too, but he didn't get into that there.

 3            But my only point is, you are right about the

 4   two Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane.        But given

 5   the fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you

 6   can infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA

 7   standard in the absence of an Appliance action.

 8            What remains is that the citation in Rogers was to

 9   Coray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate

10   cause.

11            MS. PERRY:   Yes.     But if we look at those earlier

12   cases, particularly Coray, we can see that Rogers

13   articulated what was meant by that proximate cause

14   language.    Proximate cause is, in a sense, a label for

15   scope of liability or legal cause, as the restatement

16   says.    It doesn't have any singular conception.        And in

17   Coray, the Court found --

18            JUSTICE SOUTER:     Well, it is understood by

19   everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception

20   which is captured by using the word "direct" as in

21   instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning

22   whenever it is used, doesn't it?

23            In other words, it may not have a lot of bells and

24   whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at

25   least it requires some direct causation as opposed to

 1   indirect, right?

 2           MS. PERRY:    Yes, Your Honor.

 3           JUSTICE SOUTER:      Okay.        And that's -- I don't know

 4   that Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use

 5   of the language carries you any further than that.                But

 6   that's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.

 7           MS. PERRY:    We don't accept that, but even if

 8   that's the case, the Rogers -- the parties to Rogers

 9   immediately interpreted that decision as affecting

10   proximate cause.     Twelve years later, this Court did say

11   that in Crane.     The lower courts have uniformly, nearly

12   uniformly interpreted Rogers in a certain way.               And at

13   this point, stare decisis suggests that this Court should

14   not overrule.

15           JUSTICE SOUTER:      That may be.          That may be.   But

16   it seems to me that that's a different argument from

17   saying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can

18   get that out of Rogers.

19           MS. PERRY:    Well, and I also think, though, that

20   by lightening -- by saying the slightest cause possible

21   or, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that

22   does affect proximate cause.

23           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            You don't have to say

24   that.   I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to

25   follow the words of the statute.             And so whole or in part

 1   makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't

 2   appear in Section 53.   Why don't we just -- why shouldn't

 3   the instruction just say, "such negligence of the

 4   plaintiff contributed to cause his injury."          It's not

 5   going to be a complete bar because we know the

 6   immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing

 7   the award by the amount of the negligence.          Why wouldn't

 8   that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?

 9         MS. PERRY:   Because Section 53 refers to

10   contributory negligence that created a bar.          And that was

11   the type of negligence that required proximate cause.

12   Moreover, the type of instruction you are positing is not

13   at all what petitioner requested in this case.

14         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Well, no, but he requested

15   that the instructions be the same, and the directly is

16   what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in

17   the statute.

18         MS. PERRY:   But under Missouri procedures, you

19   have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the

20   objection was that we want the same language, we want the

21   language resulting in whole or in part.

22         And out of respect for the State courts and their

23   right to create the rules that govern in those courts,

24   that was not satisfactory under Missouri rules.          Missouri

25   rules also have specific requirements for what you have


                                   41

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to do in the court of appeals.             There's a "Point Relied

 2   On" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's

 3   required by Rule 84.04.       And it sets forth a very

 4   specific format, and it's supposed to start with "The

 5   trial court erred in," and then you give your reasons.

 6         And it says that negligence -- it erred in

 7   instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if

 8   it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to

 9   cause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole

10   or in part.

11         You know, there is no issue that was preserved in

12   the Missouri courts other than that challenge.              Cook

13   versus Caldwell which we cite in our brief, in Missouri,

14   not only do you have to object, but you have to keep

15   consistent with the basis of the objection.             You can't

16   just object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the

17   court of appeals, and raise a completely different

18   challenge to instruction 13.             You have to stay

19   consistent.    And out of respect --

20         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do you think they raised

21   an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?

22         MS. PERRY:    That was a justification for rewriting

23   instruction 13 to include the words "resulting in whole

24   or in part."   I do not think they raised an abstract

25   argument about equivalency; that in order to do that,


                                     42

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   they would have had to object to instruction 12 and

 2   instruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would

 3   require modification of both instructions, and they

 4   clearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12

 5   and only object to instruction 13.

 6          So no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised.

 7   It was a justification for one particular result, and

 8   that was a result that would have modified instruction

 9   13.   And in a particular way, too, modified it in a way

10   of including the words "resulting in whole or in part."

11          JUSTICE BREYER:     I guess they want to make the

12   argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at

13   Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with

14   contributory negligence.      I don't see anything else.          It

15   doesn't speak of causation at all.

16          MS. PERRY:   Exactly, Your Honor.

17          JUSTICE BREYER:     It just says if there's some

18   contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished

19   according to the negligence attributable to the employee.

20          So I take it their argument was, maybe with

21   hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language,

22   because nothing requires it.            And since, other things

23   being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the

24   same language you gave for the other side.

25          And they said the judge rejected that argument, so


                                    43

 1   now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have

 2   accepted it.    And all the rest of what he's saying is

 3   just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something

 4   like that.     But what about that one?

 5         MS. PERRY:      I'm sorry, Your Honor.           Could you --

 6         JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, I mean, should we answer

 7   the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist

 8   position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that

 9   Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a

10   causation instruction.       The judge's causation instruction

11   in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's

12   causation instruction on contributory negligence, if

13   there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the

14   defendant's negligence.        And he says that isn't what

15   happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one

16   of them was this equivalence thing.

17         So he's saying to us:               Decide it, say that they

18   were wrong.    What's your view of that?

19         MS. PERRY:     We disagree with petitioner.

20         JUSTICE BREYER:        I'm not surprised.

21         (Laughter.)

22         MS. PERRY:     The abstract question of equivalency

23   --

24         JUSTICE BREYER:        No, no.         That's just an argument.

25         MS. PERRY:     Right.

 1            JUSTICE BREYER:       It was not, but they say,

 2   nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was

 3   wrong.    One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of

 4   causation differently than when they spoke of causation

 5   in respect to the railroad.             We thought that was a reason

 6   why it was wrong then.         We think that's a reason why it

 7   is wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but

 8   they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong

 9   for that reason.

10            MS. PERRY:    Well, I think we're in a difficult

11   position right now, because they're asking for proximate

12   cause in their blue brief --

13            JUSTICE BREYER:       Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon

14   all that, that's just a series of different arguments

15   that we'd like the Court to say.

16            MS. PERRY:    Okay.     If we're putting aside the blue

17   brief then --

18            JUSTICE BREYER:       If you read it carefully, you'll

19   see it, basically.

20            (Laughter.)

21            MS. PERRY:    But if the question goes to the fact

22   that Section 53 doesn't have an express causation

23   standard in it, what you fall back on is traditional

24   proximate cause, that Congress departed from the

25   traditional proximate cause standard by using the words

                            Alderson Reporting Company

 1   "resulting in whole or in part" in Section 51.                 It didn't

 2   create the same departure in Section 53.

 3         In fact, by referring to the kind of contributory

 4   negligence that creates a bar, it was pretty much

 5   pointing right back to proximate cause.

 6         JUSTICE SCALIA:        Can you have more than one

 7   proximate cause?

 8         MS. PERRY:      I believe the treatises that say yes.

 9         JUSTICE SCALIA:        Of course.            So then how can "in

10   whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause

11   requirement, because it could be in part and still be a

12   proximate cause.   How can that language possibly be

13   interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?

14         MS. PERRY:      Because when a cause that -- when a

15   slightest cause can give rise to liability, that has

16   effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard.

17   There is still a legal cause requirement, yes.

18         JUSTICE SOUTER:        But it could be the slightest

19   direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.

20         MS. PERRY:      Well, but if we look at like the first

21   --

22         JUSTICE SOUTER:        Now, it may mislead the jury if

23   that's all you say.     But as a matter of analyzing the

24   statute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in

25   Rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that


                                      46

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis;

 2   isn't that so?

 3            MS. PERRY:   Well, no.           The Restatement, for

 4   example, at the time of Rogers talked about substantial

 5   factors, and talked, in other words --

 6            JUSTICE SCALIA:     How can you say no when you

 7   acknowledge that the prior law when there was

 8   contributory negligence used to require proximate cause

 9   for both the negligence of the defendant and for the

10   contributory negligence of the defendant?             Such a

11   situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't

12   have to be the sole cause.         It can be just the cause in

13   part, right?

14            MS. PERRY:   Right.

15            JUSTICE SCALIA:     So the mere fact that we had

16   contributory negligence statutes that were applying

17   proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a

18   proximate cause can be a cause in part.

19            MS. PERRY:   Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and

20   the statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight

21   cause.    And what it was understood, for example, in the

22   --

23            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           That's what Rogers might

24   have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about

25   slight cause.    It only says in whole or in part.


                                      47

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1         MS. PERRY:      And neither did the instruction.            It

 2   just used the words "resulting in whole or in part" also.

 3   But Rogers did interpret the language "resulting in whole

 4   or in part" as meaning playing any part, even the

 5   slightest.   And that has been the law for 50 years.              And

 6   it would be a massive change in the law, as Justice

 7   Scalia said earlier, for this Court to depart from that

 8   at this point in time.

 9         JUSTICE SCALIA:        It doesn't seem to me that slight

10   is the opposite of proximate.              It could be a slight

11   proximate cause.

12         MS. PERRY:      The Restatement at the time of Rogers

13   talked about substantial factors, and in the comment to

14   that, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be

15   so predominant that one causation is just not

16   sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to

17   constitute a legal cause.

18         So there is a component of quantity within the

19   concepts of proximate cause.              I believe their reply brief

20   talks about substantial factor, and to talk about

21   something as being a substantial factor does have a

22   quantum component to it, just as slight has a quantum

23   component to it.   A slight cause could not be a

24   substantial factor, or oftentimes would not be a

25   substantial factor.     So the two really do go hand in


                                      48

 1   glove.

 2            JUSTICE SOUTER:     But under the old rule that

 3   plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute

 4   bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that

 5   plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar

 6   to recovery?

 7            MS. PERRY:   I'm not aware of that, Your Honor.            It

 8   may be.

 9            JUSTICE SOUTER:     I thought it was.        I may be wrong

10   about that.

11            MS. PERRY:   I am not aware of that.          So that would

12   be a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case.

13            JUSTICE SOUTER:     That's what I thought.        Yes, I

14   thought it was a pretty harsh rule.

15            MS. PERRY:   And clearly, Congress in this statute

16   was trying to move away from the common law in many

17   respects to protect the railroad worker.             And the

18   interpretation of Section 51 as lightening the causation

19   standard for the defendant's negligence, but leaving

20   intact the traditional proximate cause standard for

21   plaintiff's contributory negligence completely comports

22   with the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.

23            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Why isn't "in whole or in

24   part" simply the logical corollary of introducing

25   comparative negligence?        Why do you have to read that as


                                      49

 1   departing from proximate cause, instead of simply

 2   recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the

 3   employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?

 4         MS. PERRY:    I reach that conclusion on the basis

 5   of Rogers.    And in the petitioner's brief --

 6         JUSTICE STEVENS:        Beyond that, if the plaintiff's

 7   negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the

 8   -- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence

 9   or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there

10   would have been no negligence by the defendant.

11         MS. PERRY:    Yes, Your Honor.

12         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             That's why you don't have

13   "in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to

14   depart from proximate cause there, but because, as

15   Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in

16   whole or in part.

17         MS. PERRY:    Even the petitioner's brief describes

18   the language "resulting in whole or in part" as an

19   elaboration of proximate cause.           They recognize that it

20   has bearing on proximate cause.           And so if it has bearing

21   on proximate cause in Section 51, it certainly would have

22   bearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into

23   the language of the instruction on contributory

24   negligence.

25         So that may be one reason for not including the


                                     50

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   language, but another reason is that it does affect the

 2   causation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in

 3   Section 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51.             And

 4   when it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of

 5   the risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not

 6   equate proximate cause and "resulting in whole or in

 7   part" necessarily as the same thing because one version

 8   had proximate cause and it was not adopted.             The phrase

 9   "resulting in whole or in part" was used in its place.

10         So suggesting that Congress may, in fact, have

11   seen a difference, just as Rogers concluded, and I think

12   rightly so.

13         Moreover, as I said, that has been the law for 50

14   years, and it's pretty settled in this country and it

15   would create a massive change if this Court were to

16   depart from that.   Moreover, this is not the right case

17   to decide that because the language in instruction 12

18   said, "resulting in whole or in part."            And petitioner

19   has never --

20         JUSTICE SCALIA:      It is not the kind of change

21   anybody would have relied on, is it?             I mean, I find it

22   hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.

23         MS. PERRY:    Excuse me, Your Honor?

24         JUSTICE SCALIA:      I find it hard to see any

25   reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation.

 1   Is there anybody doing something differently because they

 2   believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of

 3   proximate causality?      Does anybody act differently

 4   because of that rule?        I don't think so.

 5            MS. PERRY:   Well, for Mr. Sorrell in particular, I

 6   mean, he acted, that he allowed that instruction to be

 7   used, and now they're attempting to disrupt this

 8   judgment.

 9            JUSTICE STEVENS:      I suppose employees have been

10   under the rule for a long time.

11            MS. PERRY:   Yes.

12            JUSTICE KENNEDY:      I suppose employee associations,

13   workman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied

14   on it.

15            MS. PERRY:   Yes, you're absolutely right, Your

16   Honor.    And there is employees' compensation for railroad

17   workers, and that may be very well be because of this

18   interpretation of Rogers that was adopted 50 years ago.

23             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 1   like to address just sort of two issues.               One is the

 2   minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about.               It

 3   seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case

 4   is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri

 5   standard which says that you cannot deviate from our

 6   designated instructions creates a disparity in the way

 7   you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that

 8   disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines,

 9   and nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong.               And

10   that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a

11   new jury being -- and a new trial.               That's the simplest

12   way to resolve the issue.

13         If the Court wishes to go forward and deal with

14   the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the

15   question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do

16   with this "in whole or in part" language.               And if you go

17   back -- you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know,

18   what does the common law say.           We cite this on page 38.

19   If its negligence contributes proximately to the injury,

20   no matter how slightly -- there must be a dozen cases

21   that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter

22   how slightly.   And they refer to "in whole or in part" as

23   language that still recognizes that you still require

24   proximate causation.

25         The reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts


                                    53

 1   doubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is

 2   not enough, you have to have proximate causation, or

 3   Earnest, where this Court said that proximate causation

 4   is the correct jury instruction that has to be given.

 5   This Court said nothing about that in Rogers.

 6         JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Would you have in your ideal

 7   instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury,

 8   that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause

 9   of plaintiff's injury?

10         MR. PHILLIPS:       No, Justice Ginsburg.          We didn't

11   ask for that.   All I'm saying to you --

12         JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Would you?

13         MR. PHILLIPS:       -- is that the guidance of the

14   Court on remand, you could, and we would ask you to

15   address that issue and to resolve it.              It is fairly in

16   front of you.

17         JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But in your model instruction,

18   in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in

19   order to hold the defendant liable, you must find the

20   defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of

21   plaintiff's injury?

22         MR. PHILLIPS:       Yes.     That would be my preferred

23   instruction on remand, yes.

24         JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Even though almost universally,

25   the term proximate cause has been criticized as totally


                                      54

 1   incomprehensible to juries?

 2         JUSTICE STEVENS:       Let me ask this one very brief

 3   question, Mr. Chief Justice.

 4         In your view, would the doctrine of equivalence be

 5   satisfied if we simply directed that the word directly be

 6   omitted from the instruction 13?

 7         MR. PHILLIPS:      I think that would certainly go a

 8   long way.   I don't know exactly how strictly you want to

 9   do it, but sure.   I mean, that's the pivotal problem with

10   the way that instruction reads today, Justice Stevens.

11         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

12   The case is submitted.

13               (Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the
