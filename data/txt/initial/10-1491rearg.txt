 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                 MR. HOFFMAN:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 The plaintiffs in this case received asylum

12   in the United States because of the human rights

13   violations alleged in the complaint.                 They sued the

14   defendants for their role in these human rights

15   violations in U.S. courts because the defendants are

16   here and subject to the general personal jurisdiction of

17   our courts.

18                 There's nothing unusual about suing a

19   tortfeasor in our --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           May -- may I ask you

21   about the statement you just made?                 Personal

22   jurisdiction was raised as a defense, right?

23                 MR. HOFFMAN:      Personal jurisdiction was

24   raised as an affirmative defense, but not raised in a

25   motion to dismiss.

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And so your position is

 2   it was waived?

 3                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Yes.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it was not

 5   adjudicated.    Is there --

 6                  MR. HOFFMAN:     It was not adjudicated in this

 7   case.   Our position, it was waived when it was not

 8   raised in a Rule 12 motion.

 9                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What effects that

10   commenced in the United States or that are closely

11   related to the United States exist between what happened

12   here and what happened in Nigeria?

13                  MR. HOFFMAN:     The -- the only connection

14   between the events in Nigeria and the United States is

15   that the plaintiffs are now living in the United States

16   and have asylum because of those events, and the

17   defendants are here.      There's no other connection

18   between the events that took place in the -- in Nigeria

19   and the forum.    The -- the basis for suing the

20   defendants here was because they are here and because it

21   was possible to get jurisdiction.

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And just to make it

23   clear --

24                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Yes.

25                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- it's your

 1   position -- and I believe it's the position of the

 2   United States; I'm not sure -- that if a U.S.

 3   corporation commits an international law violation in

 4   the United States, that U.S. corporation can be sued in

 5   any court in the world?

 6               MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, it is -- it is possible

 7   that other countries would assert jurisdiction.              I think

 8   that, generally speaking -- and it might well have been

 9   the case in this case had the issues been raised -- most

10   of the time, alternative doctrines like the requirement

11   of personal jurisdiction, or the requirement -- or forum

12   non conveniens or other doctrines would -- would have

13   those cases litigated in other places.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But then -- but the way I

15   stated the hypothetical, or the proposition, that is

16   your beginning proposition -- although there might be

17   some defenses.   But as a beginning matter, that they can

18   be sued in any country in any court in the world.

19               MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, I think it would depend

20   on what the events were and what the claims were and --

21   and what the law in that jurisdiction was.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, we assume --

23               MR. HOFFMAN:      I think that this -- sorry.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- we assume a violation

25   of international law --

 1               MR. HOFFMAN:      Okay.


 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- as part of the


 3   hypothetical.


 4               MR. HOFFMAN:      Yeah.        Well, I think that


 5   if -- if, in fact, the U.S. corporation committed a

 6   violation of a universal jurisdiction norm, for example,

 7   as we believe these norms are in this case, there are

 8   many jurisdictions in which U.S. corporations could be

 9   -- could be sued.

10               In fact, in the United Kingdom and -- and

11   the Netherlands, I believe their juris -- their

12   provisions enforcing the international criminal court

13   might --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I suppose, if you

15   have -- I suppose, if you have, as I think there

16   probably is in this case, a number of plaintiffs, they

17   can sue in a number of different countries, right?               Some

18   will sue in the United States, others in the United

19   Kingdom, others in the Netherlands?

20               MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, it -- it is possible

21   that the plaintiffs could have sued in other places.

22   They sued here because this is where they live.              This is

23   their adopted homeland because of that.

24               The United States, under international law,

25   clearly has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims between

 1   parties properly before them.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is there some -- is there

 3   some super body that decides what constitutes a

 4   violation of the particular norms of international law?

 5   That is to say, these other countries that have


 6   jurisdiction, they decide for themselves, don't they,


 7   what -- whether there's been a violation of the


 8   international norm or not?


 9               MR. HOFFMAN:       Well, if -- if there are


10   proceedings with respect to those norms or violations,

11   yes, they do.

12               I mean in domestic courts, there are

13   international tribunals that have a limited

14   jurisdiction, and they decide.           There are some ad hoc

15   tribunals that decide other cases.                And the national --

16   national courts have always been engines of decision

17   making on -- on international law.

18               In fact, that's the foundation of this -- of

19   this statute comes from the founders' desire to have

20   Federal courts decide what law of nations claims --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Sure, national courts have

22   been the deciders when -- when the violation occurs

23   within the nation.    But to give national courts

24   elsewhere the power to determine whether a United States

25   corporation in the United States has violated a norm of


                                      7

 1   international law is something else, it seems to me.

 2               MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, it's -- it's unlikely

 3   that -- that that would come up, because the suit could

 4   be brought in the United States.          It's also unlikely,

 5   because, based on most forum non conveniens doctrines,

 6   the suit would be heard here, because --

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You didn't mention

 8   exhaustion of administrative remedies.

 9               MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, there is the possibility

10   of exhaustion of local remedies.          I know the European

11   Union brief suggests that that's part of the

12   international law package that one has to accept.           And

13   this Court in Sosa did say that it would consider an

14   exhaustion of local remedies doctrine if that was the

15   case.

16               And, of course, exhaustion of local remedies

17   would be an additional safeguard against the issue that

18   Justice Kennedy and Justice --

19               JUSTICE ALITO:       Suppose a case like this is

20   brought in the United States and the State Department

21   tells the district court that allowing this case to go

22   forward will have a very deleterious effect on U.S.

23   foreign policy and on the welfare of U.S. -- U.S.

24   citizens abroad.

25               MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, I think there --

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:       The district court says:

 2   "Well, there's nothing I can do about it.           This case is

 3   just going to forward."      That's your position?

 4                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, no, not at all.        I mean,

 5   I think --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, what would happen in

 7   that situation?

 8                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, I think the political

 9   question doctrine would clearly apply, and -- and -- and

10   a court would decide whether to go forward.           If the

11   United States believed that -- that the case should be

12   dismissed, as I understand the U.S. position in past

13   cases like Doe v. Exxon, is that -- that there should be

14   interlocutory appeal from -- from a denial of a

15   political question doctrine decision to go forward in

16   light of that.

17                JUSTICE ALITO:       What if a district court

18   won't certify a question for interlocutory appeal?

19                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, but I think what the

20   U.S. position is, and I think -- I think it would -- I

21   assume it would be accepted -- is that if the United

22   States says going forward at all raises those questions,

23   that it would be able to go up on a Cohen v. --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you know, Justice

25   Alito can protect his own hypothetical, but it seems to

 1   me you're walking away from it.             The question as I


 2   understood it assumed that there is a violation of


 3   international law.


 4                MR. HOFFMAN:       Right.


 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But that proceeding with

 6   this particular case will, because of some other

 7   reasons --

 8                MR. HOFFMAN:       Right --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- involve the United

10   States or its citizens living abroad in serious

11   complications with a foreign Government.             That's not a

12   political question.

13                MR. HOFFMAN:       Well, it could be.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             There's political

15   consequences, but that's the whole point.

16                MR. HOFFMAN:       Well --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             There's -- there's -- you

18   can't cite a case -- but maybe you can, please do if you

19   can -- that this is part of the political question

20   doctrine.

21                MR. HOFFMAN:       Well, I think that in

22   Corrie v. Caterpillar, for example, there were alleged

23   human rights violations, and the United States said that

24   because U.S. aid was involved in providing the

25   bulldozers that were involved in that alleged human

 1   rights violation, that the court should dismiss on

 2   political question grounds, and the courts did dismiss

 3   on political question grounds.

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Couldn't you just say if --

 5   would we have the power to say, looking at Sosa and the

 6   principles that narrow considerably the subject matter

 7   of this statute, to add a requirement that if the State

 8   Department says that it interferes with foreign

 9   relations it doesn't fall within the statute, can't

10   bring it?

11                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Well --

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:         That would get rid of this

13   problem, wouldn't it?

14                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, that would get rid of

15   the problem.    I think that in truth, the -- the way the

16   political question doctrine would work would probably

17   end up being the same when it's that kind of rule.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:         It would be the same thing.

19   By the way, did we sign the torture treaty?

20                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Yes.      We've ratified --

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:         We've signed the torture

22   treaty.

23                  MR. HOFFMAN:     We've ratified --

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:         The torture treaty does

 1   jurisdiction?

 2               MR. HOFFMAN:     Yes.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.   So, if in fact

 4   a corporation in the United States, in cahoots with the

 5   Government or something, should do the unusual thing of

 6   violating the torture treaty, Tasmania or any country in

 7   the world that signed the torture treaty would have

 8   jurisdiction under that treaty to proceed, is that

 9   right?

10               MR. HOFFMAN:     Right.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:         So the situation that we're

12   talking about already is in existence.

13               MR. HOFFMAN:     That's right.       I mean, there's

14   nothing that the Court would do in this case that would

15   change --

16               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, if it was the

17   corporation, it wouldn't fall under the torture --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, that's -- no, the

19   torture treaty says nothing about corporations.

20               MR. HOFFMAN:     Right.       I mean, that's

21   different from the ICC.

22               But the -- the -- yes, Justice.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And it provides for a

 2   very simple rule.    Please explain to me what's wrong

 3   with it.   It basically says you have to borrow both the

 4   substantive and procedural international law norms; that

 5   those norms do permit these foreign-cubed cases only so

 6   long as either, it appears to me, the defendant is a

 7   citizen of the country, the acts occurred within that

 8   country, or the alien has exhausted both domestic and

 9   international avenues for relief, a sort of forum by

10   necessity, which apparently most countries have,

11   including the ones who have submitted amici arguing --

12                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Right.

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- different points,

14   like England and The Netherlands.

15                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Right.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         It seems to me like a

17   fairly simple set of rules clearly defined and limiting

18   the application of this statute in a way that sort of

19   makes sense.

20                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, I think --

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What's wrong with the

22   rule?

23                  MR. HOFFMAN:     I don't think there is a lot

24   wrong with the rule, actually.            In a foreign-cubed kind

25   of case, it seems to me the EU position is, number one,

 1   that there is universal jurisdiction, no matter whether

 2   you consider the Federal Commonwealth cause of action

 3   prescriptive or not.      And so, the countries of the world

 4   have agreed that all states have an interest in

 5   enforcing these fundamental norms and that's part of

 6   international law.     And that -- that what goes with that

 7   are limits of exhaustion of remedies under international

 8   law, which guard -- safeguards the interests of third

 9   states before the United States can --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So answer me why is this

11   not the case where on the facts there has been a failure

12   to exhaust.

13                 MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, I think that we would --

14   we would -- there's no record, obviously, about that.

15   And one of the arguments we would make about exhaustion,

16   I believe, is that it would have been futile to exhaust

17   under international law -- under international law

18   standards.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Might be -- Nigeria is

20   one question, but other potential forums are the U.K.

21   and the Netherlands.

22                 MR. HOFFMAN:      Right.       And I think that we --

23   you know, we have -- if there was an exhaustion of local

24   remedies requirement, then we would have to see if we

25   could satisfy that.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I think -- haven't both

 2   of those nations said they would not entertain this

 3   case?

 4               MR. HOFFMAN:        It's not clear.       I mean, in

 5   fact, the -- you know, there is a recent Dutch decision

 6   that goes perhaps farther than the Alien Tort Statute,

 7   the Al Brujaj case.

 8               JUSTICE KAGAN:          But you would agree, Mr.

 9   Hoffman, that if there were an exhaustion requirement,

10   it would not apply only to Nigeria, but also to the

11   Netherlands and to the U.K.?

12               MR. HOFFMAN:        Well, I mean, it depends on

13   how the Court frames it.        I mean, there's the exhaustion

14   requirement under the Torture Victim Protection Act,

15   there are other arguments about what that looks like

16   under international law.        I mean, I think that -- to

17   follow up on Justice Sotomayor's point, I think that if

18   that's deemed by the Court to be a requirement of

19   international law, then international law rules on

20   exhaustion should apply, and we would either be able to

21   satisfy them or not or take whatever position we would

22   take with respect to that.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, the U.K. -- the U.K.

 2                MR. HOFFMAN:       Yeah.       No, I don't think that

 3   anybody disputes that -- that the legal systems in the

 4   Netherlands or the United Kingdom are fair.             I mean,

 5   they obviously are.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, if that's so, then

 7   what does this case -- why does this case belong in the

 8   courts of the United States --

 9                MR. HOFFMAN:       Well --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:         -- when it has nothing to do

11   with the United States other than the fact that a

12   subsidiary of the defendant has a big operation here?

13                MR. HOFFMAN:       Well, it -- it -- from our

14   standpoint it's here, the way I started the argument,

15   really, which is that our clients are here, they're

16   here.   Their -- personal jurisdiction has not been

17   contested and no one made a forum non conveniens motion

18   in this particular case.        Now, there was a forum non

19   conveniens motion in a companion case.             So -- but I

20   think that that's a problem that goes more toward --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And what happened to

22   that?

23                MR. HOFFMAN:       It -- the Second Circuit

24   overturned the district court on forum non conveniens.

 1                MR. HOFFMAN:     It said that the case -- that

 2   the Wiwa case could proceed and --

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So it rejected the forum

 4   non conveniens.

 5                MR. HOFFMAN:     Rejected forum non conveniens

 6   in that case.   And I know that the United States brief

 7   believes that that was wrongly decided.          But from our

 8   standpoint, the -- if we're talking about the way that

 9   the ATS should be structured, our belief is that forum

10   non conveniens, generally speaking, is going to deal

11   with the problem -- the problems that the Court has

12   raised.   If -- if the Court believes that the Wiwa

13   decision was wrong or that that doctrine's wrong, that

14   doctrine should be changed.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          May I ask you a question

16   about your reliance on the Alien Tort Statute, but if

17   your theory is that this is a violation of a universal

18   norm, and that Federal common law makes it a claim

19   available in the United States, now there is 1331

20   general Federal question jurisdiction.

21                Couldn't you have said, never mind the Alien

22   Tort Statute, I'm suing under 1331 Federal question

23   jurisdiction, and I have got the -- the claim for relief

24   is the U.S. common law implementing the international

25   law?

 1               MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, I think this Court in

 2   Sosa said that its analysis did not necessarily apply to

 3   1331, and I think that's because of the history of 1350.

 4               The history of 1350, as the historians'

 5   brief lays out, is that the Founders believed that

 6   certain law of nations norms could be implemented by

 7   common law tort actions.     And this Court in Sosa found

 8   that without further congressional action, the courts of

 9   the United States would be available to enforce norms

10   that were similar to those norms.

11               And in fact, the norms that the Founders

12   were familiar with were very similar in kind to the

13   universal jurisdiction norms that Justice Sotomayor --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes, but -- but general --

15   general common law was not considered to be Federal law,

16   neither Federal law nor state law.              If that were so,

17   every tort action, which in those days were decided

18   under -- under a general law that was up there in the

19   sky, would have been a Federal -- a Federal claim.

20               MR. HOFFMAN:     But there were -- there was

21   certain -- there were certain norms that were believed

22   to be part of the law of nations, including piracy and

23   attacks on ambassadors, and they were governed by

24   universal standards.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Common law.       It's general

 1   common law.

 2                 MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, but I think this Court

 3   found in Sosa that that -- that that part of common law

 4   at the time has become customary international law, and

 5   that -- that the courts of this country have not lost

 6   their ability to enforce the same kinds of law of

 7   nations norms as the Founders wanted to be -- to enforce

 8   in the Alien Tort Statute in the context of universal

 9   human rights norms.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, that isn't the issue.

11   The issue is whether when they do so they are enforcing

12   Federal law or not.

13                 MR. HOFFMAN:      I think this Court said that

14   it's the Federal common law within one of the exceptions

15   to Erie and -- and I think this Court, right after Erie,

16   found that there were enclaves of Federal law, one of

17   them being the area of foreign relations, where Federal

18   common law should be viewed as Federal --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, that answer would

20   apply if you were answering Justice Ginsburg's question

21   in the affirmative by saying that there is 1331

22   jurisdiction, but you need not go so far, given Sosa.

23                 MR. HOFFMAN:      We don't.          We don't, and I

24   think the distinction is that in Sosa and in the Alien

25   Tort Statute the statute itself speaks about torts.

 1                This Court found, based on the history and

 2   intent of the Congress, that there was no reason to wait

 3   for any congressional authorization to go forward on

 4   those claims, and -- and therefore it was available to

 5   bring claims.   So --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, maybe they had --

 7                MR. HOFFMAN:     -- we're not taking the

 8   position that 1331 --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- maybe they had to

10   provide that in 1789 because there was no -- there was

11   no general Federal question jurisdiction existing at the

12   time.

13                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, it could be, but what

14   seems more obvious about the reason for the Alien Tort

15   Statute was to make sure that there -- there was a

16   Federal court available to litigate law of nations

17   claims that could have been litigated in state court,

18   just as these claims could be litigated in State court.

19                And -- and in fact, one of the -- and, also,

20   in answer to the Respondents' claims about

21   extraterritoriality, if one imagines -- under the

22   Respondents' theory, you could -- a French ambassador

23   could be attacked by a Frenchman in Pennsylvania and

24   have Alien Tort Statute jurisdiction and a claim for

25   relief.   If a U.S. citizen attacked the French

 1   ambassador on foreign soil, he wouldn't have an Alien

 2   Tort Statute claim; he would be sent to the state courts

 3   if he could -- the state courts were open, which is

 4   exactly the opposite of the purpose of the Alien Tort

 5   Statute, the fundamental known purpose of the Alien Tort

 6   Statute.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You point out, I think,

 8   an anomaly.   If the victim is a United States citizen --

 9   you say the only ties here are that the victims got

10   asylum in the United States, so they are here.           But

11   someone who is here all the time, someone who is a

12   citizen of the United States, but is abroad and is a

13   victim of one of these atrocities, there would be no

14   suit for such a person.

15                 MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, the -- the Congress

16   provided for some jurisdiction in the Torture Victim

17   Protection Act.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but under the Alien

19   Tort Statute.

20                 MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, the Alien Tort Statute

21   is limited to alien plaintiffs.           I mean, and that was

22   the congressional design, and it was -- that arises out

23   of the history, to make sure that aliens with law of

24   nations claims had access to Federal courts and Federal

25   remedies to -- to vindicate those positions.           The -- the

 9   please the Court:

10                  This case has nothing to do with the United

11   States.   It's Nigerian plaintiffs suing an English and

12   Dutch company for activity alleged to have aided and

13   abetted the Nigerian Government for conduct taking place

14   entirely within Nigeria.

15                  And, Justice Ginsburg, to the personal

16   jurisdiction question, Shell did not waive personal

17   jurisdiction objections to the suit.                The court in the

18   companion Wiwa case determined -- rejected the personal

19   jurisdiction affirmative defense, and the Second Circuit

20   affirmed.

21                  So if you look at Joint Appendix pages 111

 1   dangers of applying the ATS in foreign countries is any

 2   mention of Congress.    And I'd like to return us to the

 3   question presented on this round of the argument, which

 4   is:   Should the ATS and, Justice Ginsburg, Federal

 5   common law be applied to conduct taking place entirely

 6   within the borders of a foreign country?          And our answer

 7   is it should not, under the --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Does that mean,

 9   Ms. Sullivan, that you -- and do I understand your

10   argument on brief correctly, that you would say from --

11   the revival of 1350 from Filartiga was wrong because

12   nothing happened -- nothing happened in the United

13   States there?   Marcos was wrong because nothing -- the

14   wrong occurred abroad?

15                Does your -- the argument you're making now

16   that this is not applicable to things that happened

17   offshore exclude Filartiga and Marcos?

18                MS. SULLIVAN:      We do not believe that you

19   need to address Filartiga because Filartiga is taken

20   care of entirely by the proper body, which is Congress.

21   Congress, in enacting the TVPA, the Torture Victim

22   Protection Act, covered a situation like Filartiga,

23   where a Paraguayan plaintiff sues a Paraguayan

24   individual defendant for conduct in Paraguay.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But then you're at least

 3   history and background, but I would really like you to

 4   answer Justice Ginsburg's question.              Suppose we had

 5   granted cert in Filartiga before Congress acted?

 6   What -- under your position, what should have been the

 7   result?   I think that was the purport of her question,

 8   and I would appreciate an answer to it.

 9                MS. SULLIVAN:      Yes, Justice Kennedy.         We

10   think the current correct result is that the ATS and

11   Federal common law, which is substantive and remedial

12   law of the United States -- and here, we agree with the

13   United States on page 2 of its brief -- ATS plus Federal

14   common law is the substantive and remedial law of the

15   United States.   And we think, under the well-established

16   canon against extraterritorial application of U.S. law,

17   absent congressional clear indication, there should not

18   be such an extension.     So, therefore --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Ms. Sullivan, can I ask you

20   about your position on extraterritorial application.               I

21   believe strongly in the presumption against

22   extraterritorial application, but do you know of any

24   application on the territory of a foreign country and

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Oh, you don't?      Okay.   I

 9   thought that was common ground.          I'm glad to know it

10   isn't.

11               MS. SULLIVAN:       Sosa said, looking to the

12   three Blackstone paradigms, assaults on ambassadors,

13   interference with safe conducts, and piracy, that

14   certainly the antecedents to the ATS, the Marbois

15   incident of an attack in Philadelphia, and the New York

16   constable entering the home in New York City of the

17   Dutch ambassador, those were incidents on U.S. soil.

18   And Sosa says perhaps also the third paradigm, piracy,

19   might also be covered.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, I thought that

21   was the most clear violation of an international norm.

22   The one thing that the civilized countries would agree

23   on is that you --

24               MS. SULLIVAN:       At the time.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               -- capture pirates.

 1                MS. SULLIVAN:       Our clear -- our position on

 2   piracy is this.    Even if you think the ATS and Federal

 3   common law can extend to conduct on the high seas, which

 4   are stateless, a place where no foreign sovereign rules,

 5   that does not mean that the ATS and Federal common law

 6   can apply to conduct within a foreign sovereign's

 7   borders --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, it doesn't mean that.

 9   It doesn't mean that, but if the -- what is the question

10   we're asking.   If, when the statute was passed, it

11   applied to pirates, the question to me is who are

12   today's pirates.    And if Hitler isn't a pirate, who is?

13   And if, in fact, an equivalent torturer or dictator who

14   wants to destroy an entire race in his own country is

15   not the equivalent of today's pirate, who is?

16                And we have treaties that say there is

17   universal jurisdiction.       Other countries take it.

18                MS. SULLIVAN:       Justice Breyer --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          We took it in Filartiga.

20   We took it in the cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned.

21   So I absolutely grant you could make the distinction,

22   but, given the purpose and an objective of the statute,

23   why should we make it?

24                MS. SULLIVAN:       Justice Breyer, with respect,

25   the United States has not acceded to the principle of


                                     26

 1   universal civil jurisdiction.             And with respect --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, we did explicitly in

 3   the torture treaty in respect to that particular

 4   incident.

 5                 MS. SULLIVAN:       Justice Breyer, in our brief

 6   at 48, note 11, you'll see that that's not quite the

 7   case.   I'm sorry -- I'm sorry.

 8                 We object -- the United States objected to

 9   the universal civil jurisdiction aspect of the

10   convention against torture.            We have never acceded to

11   that.   And the reason is that we fear exactly the

12   consequences Justice Kennedy began the argument with.

13   We fear that if we say that a United States court can be

14   open to try any accused law of nations violator for

15   anywhere in the world regardless of the place of the

16   conduct, the other nations of the world might seek to do

17   the same to us.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:          They do that, don't they,

19   with torture?   I mean, isn't that -- it's criminal, not

20   civil, quite right.      Does that make it better?

21                 MS. SULLIVAN:       Criminal is very different

22   from civil.   And what we -- the precise argument we are

23   making here is that the presumption against application

24   of U.S. law to conduct within foreign sovereigns -- and

25   remember, the purpose of the presumption,

 1   Justice Scalia, is to avoid conflict with foreign

 2   sovereigns.   There is no foreign sovereign over the high

 3   seas.

 4                 The conflict arises, and the presumption

 5   protects against this conflict, when we go into a

 6   foreign nation, we project our law.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          I understand that.   That's

 8   the worst.    But I really don't -- you appeal to the

 9   general principle of territoriality of our laws.            And,

10   as I say, I don't know any other case where -- where

11   that principle allows our securities laws to be applied

12   on the high seas, for example --

13                 MS. SULLIVAN:       Well --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- even though they can

15   apply in Australia.

16                 MS. SULLIVAN:       -- Your Honor, if you wish to

17   say no extraterritorial application, we think Sosa does

18   not foreclose that, because Sosa simply said piracy

19   might be one of the -- the actions covered.

20                 But I want to get back to the key point,

21   which is --

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:        Can I ask this about piracy?

23   In 1789, do you think that Congress was contemplating

24   tort actions against pirates in courts of the United

25   States?


                                      28

                                   Official


 1                 MS. SULLIVAN:      No, we do not, Your Honor,

 2   because we think that in rem actions were the typical

 3   things contemplated.     And as soon as

 4   United States v. Palmer comes along, this Court applied

 5   the presumption against extraterritorial application of

 6   U.S. law to -- the application of the then-extant piracy

 7   statute to a foreign-flagged vessel on the high seas.

 8                 The thought was, don't apply it to the

 9   foreign-flagged vessel because that's like a mini-

10   foreign country on the high seas.            So we would argue

11   that the presumption against extraterritoriality

12   actually applied in the founding era even to piracy.

13                 But even if you were to say, well, piracy is

14   covered now, it doesn't follow that the norms that are

15   invoked here under the law of nations can be subject to

16   a U.S. civil cause of action.

17                 And I want to stress that our point is that

18   the U.S. is projecting here -- and I don't believe

19   through the statute, the ATS, but through the causes of

20   action under Federal common law -- our law onto foreign

21   countries.

22                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Ms. Sullivan, your

23   argument is very broad, and I want to ask you a

24   question.    Your case might properly be dismissed.          But

25   take a different case, and it's a -- just a variation on

 1   the Marbois incident, where instead of being attacked in

 2   Philadelphia, the French ambassador to Britain is

 3   attacked in London, but is attacked by a United States

 4   citizen, who then comes home to the United States, seeks

 5   refuge in the United States.              And the French

 6   ambassador -- the French ambassador wants to bring an

 7   action.

 8                  Wouldn't the ATS have contemplated exactly

 9   that sort of action?      I mean, why would it make any

10   difference whether the attack on the French ambassador

11   by a United States citizen occurred in Philadelphia or

12   occurred in London?

13                  MS. SULLIVAN:      The difference it makes is

14   that in your hypothetical, the reverse Marbois case, the

15   proper remedy would have been to seek -- for France to

16   seek extradition of the U.S. assailant and --

17                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, I think I'm advised by

18   the Solicitor General's office that there were very few

19   extradition treaties at that time.                 And even if

20   extradition was a possible remedy, I mean why shouldn't

21   we understand the ATS to provide supplemental remedies

22   as well, civil as well as criminal, civil as well as

23   extradition?

24                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Because Congress hasn't

25   clearly said so.    And the point of the presumption is to

 1   avoid all of the judge-made possible qualifications that

 2   were discussed earlier: exhaustion, political question,

 3   the possible limitations suggested by the European

 4   Union.

 5                 Congress doesn't get to say anything if it's

 6   the courts deciding, through their own prudence,

 7   together with the advice from the Department of State.

 8                 And, Justice Alito, in answer to your

 9   question whether --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Excuse me.   Excuse me.   Do

11   you mean that the courts -- in those areas where you

12   acknowledge the statute applies, that the courts will

13   not apply doctrines of exhaustion, of, you know, comity,

14   of -- the appropriateness of bringing the action here?

15   Of course they will, won't they?

16                 MS. SULLIVAN:       They're not always applied,

17   Justice Scalia.    And if so, it sometimes takes many

18   years before they happen.         And the State Department is

19   not always listened to.

20                 In the South African apartheid case, not

21   only did the State Department seek to protest the

22   action, but the Government of South Africa filed a

23   letter, and the district court ignored both.

24                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, we should fix that

25   then.    But that's not the question here, right?          The

 1   question here is -- is the different one of whether you

 2   ever get to the exhaustion question.

 3               MS. SULLIVAN:      Correct.

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:       And if you go back to the

 5   reverse Marbois, you said Congress didn't speak, but I

 6   think what we said in Sosa is that Congress did speak,

 7   that Congress was referring to exactly that kind of tort

 8   when it passed the Alien Tort Statute.

 9               And you are saying it would have made a

10   difference to Congress that the incident occurred in a

11   different place even though the attacker was a United

12   States citizen seeking refuge in the United States and

13   leaving the French with no remedy.

14               MS. SULLIVAN:      With respect, Your Honor, the

15   French had several remedies.           The French victim could

16   have sued in tort in the United States.           And under the

17   transitory tort doctrine that was adopted at the time,

18   which is not a precedent for the ATS, would have allowed

19   a suit under French law.     French law would have been

20   imported to try that claim.         So it could have been tried

21   in State court as an assault.

22               Second, there could have been extradition.

23               Third, the point of the Marbois in

24   stimulating the ATS was that if -- if a U.S. citizen

25   attacks the French ambassador on U.S. soil, and we then


                                   32

 1   harbored him, that could have led to an incident of war.

 2   But there is no incident of war or conflict posed in

 3   your hypothetical because extradition was possible, and

 4   State court tort violations -- State law tort -- State

 5   court jurisdiction over a transitory tort should

 6   have obtained.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Do you think it matters

 8   that the harboring is after the fact or not?        Meaning if

 9   the -- if the mercenary fled France and was hiding from

10   the French here, why is there any less chance of a war?

11               MS. SULLIVAN:      Well --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I don't understand.   The

13   apples and apples don't -- seem to not match in my mind.

14               MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Sotomayor, I -- there

15   is theoretically the possibility that if State law

16   transitory tort didn't work, and if extradition didn't

17   work, and if the French didn't just seek to punish the

18   assailant in their own country, maybe there would have

19   been international conflict, but there is no evidence

20   Congress was thinking about that at the time.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Pirates could have been

22   sued in State court, too, and yet the ATS -- I know that

23   you quarrel about whether an act of piracy qualifies as

24   an international norm, but assuming that I accept it is,

25   pirates could have been -- under your theory, pirates

 1   could have been sued in State court, too, yet Congress

 2   found it important to pass the ATS.

 3                MS. SULLIVAN:      It did.          But, Your Honor,

 4   there is not a single founding era precedent, not a

 5   single one, that involves the reverse hypothetical.

 6   Every single founding era precedent that stimulated the

 7   ATS or came soon in its aftermath involved international

 8   law violations alleged to have occurred on U.S. soil or

 9   in U.S. waters.

10                The two cases most soon after the ATS were

11   Moxon v. The Fanny and Bolchos v. Darrell, which

12   involved supposed law of nations violations on U.S.

13   waters and on U.S. soil.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:       What should happen when the

15   injury occurs within the territory of a foreign country,

16   but it is alleged that the injury was directed by

17   someone in the United States?

18                MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Alito, we would

19   respectfully urge that direction is -- is not enough.

20   If the place of the injury and the place of the last

21   conduct was on foreign soil.            We think ordinary

22   restatement of conflict principles would suggest that

23   you look to the law of the place of injury, not to the

24   forum law.

25                And the most important point about the ATS


                                    34

 1   and Federal common law, even if it were under section

 2   1331, Justice Ginsburg, is that it's an application of

 3   U.S. substantive and remedial law to another country.

 4   And the offense is we're telling the other country that

 5   they have to entertain private civil litigation.                And

 6   there is a difference, Justice Breyer, between criminal

 7   and civil --

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Okay.       You're right about

 9   that.   What about the Bradford?           Isn't there -- all this

10   stuff about -- you know what I'm talking about.

11                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Bradford is the best thing

12   the Petitioners have in the founding era, and it's not

13   enough to overcome the presumption --

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Because?

15                  MS. SULLIVAN:      -- because he could have been

16   speaking about the high seas.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:         He could have, but if you

18   read it, it looks as if there was -- what he's upset

19   about -- or what Britain was upset about was an

20   American.

21                  MS. SULLIVAN:      And he --

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.    Go ahead.

23                  MS. SULLIVAN:      It was Americans, but

24   we -- we think, if properly read, the hostilities of

25   which he spoke was the high seas part of the conduct.

 1   It was an American who piloted the French fleet 60 miles

 2   from the Iles de Los to the Sierra Leone River.             And

 3   that was -- if you read grammatically, we think that is

 4   what Attorney General Bradford was referring to.

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        But --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Ms. Sullivan, before your

 7   time runs out, I mean, you have said, candidly, that if

 8   Filartiga were to come up today, if Marcos were to come

 9   up to this forum, there would be no basis under the

10   Alien Tort Statute.

11                 But assume for the moment that those two

12   cases -- that we accept them -- Sosa seemed to accept

13   them.   Is there anything different about your case?

14                 MS. SULLIVAN:       Yes, Your Honor.      There are

15   many -- many differences between us and Filartiga.             For

16   one, this is a case in which there is a -- a class

17   action against a corporation.             And if you don't agree

18   with us on the lack of extraterritorial application, we

19   still maintain that the ATS does not apply to

20   corporations.

21                 Second, there is -- there was a -- there's

22   an allegation here of aiding and abetting a foreign

23   Government.   It was unclear in Filartiga whether the

24   Paraguayan was acting within or without the state's

25   authority, but -- and he was later deported, so we don't


                                      36

 1   know the answer.


 2               But here the offense is magnified because


 3   the allegation is that an English and a Dutch company


 4   aided and abetted the Nigerian Government.               That is


 5   where the offense to the principle against international

 6   friction is at its highest.            And so if you weren't to

 7   adopt our position in full, at a minimum we think you

 8   should hold that the presumption applies to

 9   foreign-cubed cases involving aiding and abetting a

10   foreign government, where everything is foreign.

11               But we don't think you should do that in the

12   first instance.     We respectfully submit the better

13   approach is to apply the presumption as a categorical

14   matter.

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But in Filartiga, why

16   wasn't there an aiding and abetting?               I think it was

17   pretty clear.   He probably was working for the

18   government, which is even worse.

19               MS. SULLIVAN:         Well --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But -- and I am interested

21   in Justice Ginsburg's question.

22               MS. SULLIVAN:         Yes.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Just assume we think the

24   Second Circuit was right, pre-congressional action under

25   the Alien Tort Statute.        Is -- is there any way in which

 1   we can use the principle of extraterritoriality to rule

 2   in your favor?

 3                MS. SULLIVAN:      We think there is,

 4   Justice Kennedy.    And we think the principle of

 5   extraterritoriality is -- is essentially a

 6   democracy-forcing device to send these questions back to

 7   Congress.    And if we send it back to Congress --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, have we

 9   crossed that -- we've crossed that bridge already,

10   didn't we, in Sosa?

11                 MS. SULLIVAN:       You have --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The presumption

13   applies to interpreting acts of Congress.                We are over

14   that.    We're -- we're making this law up ourselves,

15   right?

16                 MS. SULLIVAN:       Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice,

17   you are making it up themselves, and that's why there's

18   all the more reason to apply the presumption against

19   application to foreign countries.

20                 It's far worse to have judges --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But you're asking us to

22   overturn our precedents.

23                 MS. SULLIVAN:       We --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You're -- you're

25   basically saying Filartiga and Marcos, Sosa, they were

 1   all wrong.

 2                 MS. SULLIVAN:      We are not, Your Honor.          Sosa

 3   did not address the question we have before the Court

 4   today.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, how can you say

 6   that?    Maybe the facts didn't, but certainly the

 7   reasoning of the case addressed that issue very directly

 8   and -- and basically said it does.                And then it talked

 9   about how you limit it.       That's what Sosa did.

10                 MS. SULLIVAN:      To answer the Chief Justice's

11   question, you don't need to overrule, so to speak,

12   Filartiga on Justice Kennedy's question.                You can simply

13   say that in the intervening period, Congress did, as is

14   appropriate in the area of applying law to foreign

15   conduct, pass a specific statute, the TVPA, that applies

16   exactly to the conduct in Filartiga.                That should inform

17   your decision today, that you don't need judge-made law

18   to address the situation in Filartiga.

19                 And you don't need to overrule Sosa, with

20   respect, Justice Sotomayor, because Sosa did not

21   address, for better or for worse, the

22   extraterritoriality argument we make today.                It went off

23   at the first step.    No international norms, specifically

24   universal and specific -- sufficiently specific and

25   universal.   So it didn't get to the concerns about


                                     39

 1   friction with foreign countries.

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But, Ms. Sullivan, I'm going

 3   to read you something from Sosa, which -- it talks all

 4   about the rule that it adopts and then it says:                 "This

 5   is generally consistent with the reasoning of many of

 6   the courts and judges who faced the issue before it

 7   reached this Court.      See Filartiga."            And then it quotes

 8   Filartiga:   "For purposes of civil liability, the

 9   torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader

10   before him, an enemy of all mankind."

11                So we gave a stamp of approval to Filartiga

12   and Filartiga's understanding that there were certain

13   categories of offenders who were today's pirates.

14                MS. SULLIVAN:        If -- the fact that the

15   nations of the world agree on norms does not mean the

16   nations of the world agree on remedies.                And what the

17   ATS and Federal common law, as interpreted in Sosa, do

18   is project a U.S. civil cause of action with U.S. rules,

19   punitive damages, no attorney fee shifting, contingent

20   fee and punitive damages.         That should not be done

21   except by Congress.      They did it in the TVPA, but you

22   should not permit it to be done here.

23                Thank you.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

25   Ms. Sullivan.

 2             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 3              FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 4                     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 5                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Mr. Chief Justice, and

 6   may it please the Court:

 7                  The Alien Tort Statute should not afford a

 8   cause of action to address the extraterritorial conduct

 9   of a foreign corporation when the allegation is that the

10   defendant aided and abetted a foreign sovereign.            In

11   this category of cases, there just isn't any meaningful

12   connection to the United States.

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Is that the same -- is

14   that your simple rule?       Is that how you want us to

15   rule --

16                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- that there could

18   never be aiding and abetting on behalf of a corporation?

19   Is that your simple answer to this case, or what's the

20   general --

21                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          It's -- it's a narrower

22   statement than that, Justice Sotomayor.            It's that there

23   shouldn't be a cause of action to address the

24   extraterritorial conduct of a foreign corporation that

25   is alleged to have aided and abetted the acts of a

 1   foreign sovereign.

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What about in your -- you

 3   do say in your brief that you think that Filartiga is

 4   within the Alien Tort Statute.

 5                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes, we do,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You don't -- don't adopt

 8   a theory that many of the -- briefs do, that there has

 9   to be some connection, some nexus to the United States.

10   You just tell us that Filartiga is okay.               And how about

11   Marcos, is that okay?

12                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, we think in

13   Filartiga, Justice Ginsburg, that the -- the -- that

14   there is a nexus to the United States.               The actual

15   perpetrator was -- A, it was a case against the actual

16   perpetrator.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but you -- you don't

18   --

19                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          And B --

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- you don't offer us a

21   nexus.   You don't offer us that reason why Filartiga was

22   okay.

23                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes, I think our reasons

24   for why Filartiga was okay is that -- that it was the

25   actual perpetrator, not an aider and abettor, and the


                                      42

 1   actual perpetrator was resident in the United States.

 2               And I do think when Congress enacted the

 3   TVPA, that is what Congress looked to as the salient

 4   features of the Filartiga situation that justified --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What else?   What else?

 6   You -- you say Filartiga.      You don't mention Marcos.         Is

 7   Marcos in your view a proper exercise?

 8               GENERAL VERRILLI:          I -- I think Filartiga is

 9   the paradigm, and cases like Filartiga are the paradigm

10   that -- where we think ATS -- ATS causes of action

11   should be recognized.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:         General Verrilli, the --

13   that's -- that is a new position for the -- for the

14   State Department, isn't it?

15               GENERAL VERRILLI:          It's a new --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:         And for -- and for the

17   United States Government?      Why should -- why should we

18   listen to you rather than the solicitors general who

19   took the opposite position and the position taken by

20   Respondents here in other cases, not only in several

21   courts of appeals, but even up here?

22               GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, Justice Scalia, in

23   a case like this one, in cases under the Alien Tort

24   Statute, the United States has multiple interests.           We

25   certainly have foreign relations interests in avoiding


                                   43

 1   friction with foreign governments; we have interests in

 2   avoiding subjecting United States companies to liability

 3   abroad.   We also have interests in ensuring that our

 4   Nation's foreign relations commitments to the rule of

 5   law and human rights are not eroded.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I understand that, but --

 7                GENERAL VERRILLI:          It's my responsibility to

 8   balance those sometimes competing interests and make a

 9   judgment about what the position of the United States

10   should be, consistent with existing law.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:         It -- it was --

12                GENERAL VERRILLI:          And we have done so.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- it was the

14   responsibility of your predecessors as well, and they

15   took a different position.        So, you know, why -- why

16   should we defer to the views of -- of the current

17   administration?

18                GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, because we think

19   they are persuasive, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Oh, okay.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Your successors may

22   adopt a different view.      And I think -- I don't want to

23   put words in his mouth, but Justice Scalia's point means

24   whatever deference you are entitled to is compromised by

25   the fact that your predecessors took a different


                                    44

 1   position.

 2               GENERAL VERRILLI:            So, Mr. Chief Justice,

 3   let me be clear:    In this case our position is that the

 4   Court ought not recognize a cause of action.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:         Suppose that the defendant

 6   in this case were a U.S. corporation, but the case were

 7   otherwise identical.     What result then?

 8               GENERAL VERRILLI:            In that case the possible

 9   risk of foreign relations friction would be comparable.

10   The risk of reciprocal exposure to American companies

11   would also exist.    The difference between that case and

12   this case, Your Honor, is that there'd be a much more

13   substantial connection to the United States because it's

14   an American company.     The question in the case would be

15   whether the -- that substantial connection provided a

16   sufficient justification for subjecting the United

17   States company to these international law norms to avoid

18   undermining the credibility of our Nation's commitment

19   to those norms.    We haven't taken a position on that

20   question in this case because we think that the Court

21   ought to proceed incrementally here.              The case before

22   the Court involves a foreign corporation in which there

23   just isn't any connection to the United States at all,

24   and it's our judgment that the Court should decide that

25   case --

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You are disavowing --

 2   you are disavowing any forum of necessity view of the

 3   ATS?   You are disavowing what other countries do or say

 4   with respect to citizens -- to aliens who are attacked?

 5                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          Our view about that,

 6   Justice Sotomayor, is that the key determinant here, and

 7   the reason why there ought not be a cause of action

 8   here, is the absence of any meaningful connection to the

 9   United States.    And the question is --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I asked you a question

11   directly.    Are you foregoing -- are you foregoing any

12   forum necessity exception to the rule you've just

13   announced?

14                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          We don't think that the

15   question of the availability of a forum or

16   nonavailability of a forum is sufficient to override the

17   absence of any connection to the United States.

18                 Now, I will say --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:       If I could follow up on the

20   question I asked before.       I'm not asking you to say

21   definitively which way you would come out in this

22   hypothetical case, but from your brief I really don't

23   understand how you would decide.            Would it depend --

24   what would it depend on?

25                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, I think it would

 1   depend on a weighing of the strength of the interests of

 2   the United States, the foreign relations interests of

 3   the United States, in applying this narrow category of

 4   Sosa norms in order to avoid undermining the

 5   credibility --

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Suppose everything is the

 7   same except for --

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         But we don't -- we are not

 9   very good at figuring out the foreign policy interests

10   of the United States.       And, you know, in the past we

11   have tried to get out from under our prior case law in

12   the sovereign immunity area of asking the State

13   Department.    And the State Department would come in

14   here:   This is good; this is bad.            We abandoned all that

15   in the sovereign immunity field.             Why should we walk

16   back into it here?     Or do you intend to have us make

17   these foreign policy decisions?

18                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Congress can always act

19   in this area, Justice Scalia.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         No, but assuming Congress

21   doesn't act.    Why should -- you know, you want us to

22   listen to the State Department case by case.             Is that --

23                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, actually what we

24   are advocating here, Your Honor, is that the Court can

25   make categorical judgments, not pure case by case


                                      47

 1   factual judgments.     We just think there is more than one

 2   category.   There are salient differences between a

 3   situation like this one, in which there is no connection

 4   to the United States at all, or a situation like the one

 5   Justice Alito raised about an American corporation. And

 6   there are also cases in which the suit is against a

 7   direct perpetrator.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          But we listen to the State

 9   Department as to what those categories ought to be.

10                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, I think the

11   categories are evident from the kinds of cases that have

12   been brought.   But -- but certainly, the views of the

13   State Department do deserve deference.

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Are you talking about a

15   nexus test?   That's what it sounds like to me.             Has to

16   have either an actor nexus or a act nexus, effect nexus?

17   What are you talking?

18                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           I think what we're --

19   we're not -- we're talking about something different,

20   Justice Sotomayor.     The question is whether to recognize

21   a Federal common law cause of action.              I think that

22   depends on --

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Either it exists or it

24   doesn't.

 1   of interests, I believe, Your Honor, and that there are

 2   interests that cut against recognizing causes of acts in

 3   this area, and that's what Sosa said.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Is -- that -- I'm having

 5   trouble with this.    We -- without question, piracy,

 6   attacks on ambassadors, we know that those were

 7   international norms in 1789.             If one of those acts

 8   happened, you seem to be suggesting that, answering

 9   Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that if a Frenchman

10   attacks an English ambassador in Switzerland, that case

11   would never be heard in the United States because there

12   is no nexus to the United States; is that correct?

13                GENERAL VERRILLI:            Well, if no one ever came

14   to the United States.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, assuming someone

16   came.   So how is that different from here?

17                GENERAL VERRILLI:            No.     It's just -- it's

18   not -- the connection is not an on/off switch.               But our

19   position is you need a connection in order to assess

20   whether there is even an interest in having cause of

21   action --

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So why isn't presence

23   alone in the United States a connection?

24                GENERAL VERRILLI:            Well, if it's an

25   individual perpetrator like Filartiga we think that it

 1   is because it's the direct perpetrator.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:          If in the -- in fact in

 3   Filartiga it was done through a corporation -- the

 4   torture -- now?

 5               GENERAL VERRILLI:           If the -- if the -- it

 6   was -- I think torture has to be --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:          Torture is done by hiring

 8   Torture, Inc.   Okay?   Is there or isn't there?

 9               GENERAL VERRILLI:           If it's a norm that has

10   to be violated by --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:          You heard the question.       I

12   need an answer to that specific -- that specific

13   hypothetical.   Everything is the same except the torture

14   is carried out by Torture, Inc.          Because my actual

15   question is about aiding and abetting.               I mean, the

16   first part is they do it directly.               Can they bring

17   Filartiga or not -- in your view?

18               GENERAL VERRILLI:           If they do it directly.

19   If they are the direct violator of a norm that they can

20   violate directly, then yes they can.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.       But if it's aiding

22   and abetting?

23               GENERAL VERRILLI:           Then if it's a foreign

24   corporation and it occurred entirely in a foreign

25   country.

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.   So it turns on that.

 2   And what I really want to know is what is the difference

 3   between that?    Is it like the criminal law difference of

 4   accessory versus principle or what?

 5                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          May I answer,


 6   Mr. Chief Justice?


 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Briefly, yes.


 8                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          The difference is that


 9   while you would have a comparable -- you would have a


10   risk of friction in subjecting a foreign sovereign's

11   acts to scrutiny in the United States, you have the

12   reciprocity risk I mentioned.             You would have to make a

13   judgment about whether those concerns are overcome by

14   the countervailing concern of applying the -- finding an

15   ATS cause of action to apply U.S. norms.                 If it's an

16   entirely foreign corporation with no connection to the

17   United States, our position is the answer to that is no.

21                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN

23                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

24   I would like to make three points.

25                  First, on the Bradford opinion.              I think if


                                      51

 1   you read the diplomatic materials that we placed before

 2   the Court, it's absolutely clear that what the British

 3   were concerned about was pillaging and plundering on

 4   land in the Sierra Leone colony.             They were seeking

 5   redress for those things, for destroying libraries, for

 6   destroying Freetown, not just about things that happened

 7   on the high seas and not just about things that happened

 8   in territorial waters.       It's absolutely clear that

 9   that's true, but obviously you have those materials and

10   you can read it.    And Attorney General Bradford said

11   there was no doubt that there was an ATS action.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          There was also a U.S.

13   perpetrator.

14                  MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, that's true, but with

15   respect to the presumption against extraterritoriality,

16   it wouldn't matter if it is a U.S. perpetrator or not.

17   And it shows exactly why the presumption can't apply

18   because it would undermine the very purposes of the

19   statute in the best available evidence that we have

20   about what it meant in the era.

21                  I would like to give a hypothetical that I

22   think reveals why the U.S. Government position should

23   not be accepted.

24                  Suppose there is -- there is an Iranian

25   corporation that secretly supplies poison gas to the


                                      52

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   current Syrian regime in order to kill tens of thousands

 2   of Kurdish citizens.    And suppose after the Assad regime

 3   is overthrown, those -- the documents revealing that

 4   poison gas transfer to the Syrian regime was made public

 5   and that Iranian corporation does business in the United

 6   States, asylum seekers who were driven out by the poison

 7   gas attacks are in the United States, maybe living in

 8   the same communities as the plaintiffs in our case,

 9   having gotten asylum in this case.               Would it be the case

10   that the Alien Tort Statute should not apply to a claim

11   of aiding and abetting the Assad regime and murdering

12   tens of thousands of its people?           It is the modern day

13   example of I.G. Farben.      Is it the case that a modern

14   day I.G. Farben would be exempt from the Alien Tort

15   Statute?   There is a clear, well-established doctrine of

16   aiding and abetting in international law.              It has been

17   accepted by the lower courts.           The lower courts have

18   uniformly rejected the arguments that have been made by

19   Respondents in this case.       And I would say that the Sosa

20   framework is -- should be given a chance to work.              This

21   Court dealt with these issues eight years ago.              It set

22   up a historical paradigm test based on many of the

23   concerns that have been expressed here, and there are

24   alternative doctrines that can be applied to deal with

25   these concerns.   Political question, active state,


                                    53

 1   international comity, forum non conveniens, personal

 2   jurisdiction, those have not really been litigated.

 3   Whether they have been waived or not is something that

 4   the lower courts can deal with.          Whether they apply the

 5   lower court --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Given the court's recent

 7   decisions on personal jurisdiction, and I have in mind

 8   particularly the Goodyear Tire case, is there personal

 9   jurisdiction in this case or in the case of your

10   hypothetical?

11                MR. HOFFMAN:     One of the problems that --

12   that we would have, Justice Ginsburg, in answering that

13   question is that there is no record about the contacts

14   between these defendants and -- and the jurisdiction in

15   2002.   The Wiwa case, for example, where it was

16   litigated was dealt on a factual record that went back

17   to 1996 and 1997.   So there is no record here about

18   personal jurisdiction because it hasn't been asserted.

19                Now if the defendants have not in fact

20   waived personal jurisdiction, then presumably the lower

21   courts would apply the tests that this Court has -- has

22   established or in the 2011 decisions.            And the same

23   would be true of forum non conveniens or any of the

24   other defenses.   They have raised other defenses in this

25   case that have not been fully litigated.            So -- so my


                                    54

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   basic position is that the Sosa framework actually is --

 2   works.   It has actually weeded out cases.               These

 3   alternative doctrines have weeded out cases, but the

 4   Court should not accept the categorical positions

 5   asserted by either of the Respondents, which are the


 6   broadest categorical positions even rejected by the


 7   Government, or the Government's modified categorical


 8   position.    Those kinds of issues can be dealt with


 9   within well-established doctrines where lower courts


10   have a body of jurisprudence that they can use to do

11   this.

12                 The Alien Tort Statute as was applied to

13   human rights cases from Filartiga on is part of a trend

14   in the world today.      The trend in the world today is

15   towards universal justice for people that -- and

16   corporations that violate these kinds of norms.                  That's

17   the trend.    In fact, the United States has been the

18   leader in that.    Our Government has proclaimed our

19   leadership position to U.N. bodies and around the world.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, the United

21   Kingdom and Netherlands don't think so.

22                 MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, the United Kingdom and

23   Netherlands have obviously asserted this position.                 But

24   the Netherlands have asserted that position while at the

25   same time 21 days after the -- the argument in

 1   February a Dutch court gave damages to a Palestinian


 2   doctor for wrongful imprisonment and torture that


 3   occurred in Libya against two Libyan defendants that


 4   were not even present in the courtroom.


 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:          It may have been wrong.

 6               MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, it may have been but

 7   actually it seems perfectly consistent with Dutch law,

 8   it is consistent with the exercise of universal

 9   jurisdiction in many pieces of legislation --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I would rather listen to

11   the Dutch Government than one, one Dutch judge, frankly.

12               MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, the Dutch Government,

13   though, and one of the significant pieces in this case

14   is that the Nigerian Government doesn't have a position

15   on this case any longer.      The United States Government

16   has never asked for this case to be dismissed on foreign

17   policy grounds.   The United Kingdom and the Dutch

18   Government have never asked for this case to be -- to be

19   invalidated on foreign policy grounds.           They have stated

20   their position about what they think the Alien Tort

21   Statute should mean.    And if you look at the European

22   Union brief, of which the United Kingdom and Dutch are

23   members, the European Union says there is no issue about

24   universal jurisdiction, there is no issue about civil

25   jurisdiction that falls within universal jurisdiction.

 1   Their only argument is that if you accept that, you

 2   should accept international opposition and exhaustion of

 3   local remedies.

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:       And isn't that really the

 5   way to reconcile the Dutch positions?             The Dutch are

 6   objecting because they think they have a fair forum, but

 7   when the judges were faced with a case arising from

 8   Libya, they thought that there was no fair forum there.

 9   And that's the difference, that in one case there was

10   exhaustion and in the other there wasn't.

11               MR. HOFFMAN:     I think that that's probably

12   what the basis of the Dutch position.             Our position,

13   though, is that this -- the framework that this Court

14   established in Sosa to -- to take the pirates of the

15   18th century and deal with the Alien Tort Statute with

16   the torturers and those who commit genocide in the 21st

17   century was correct, and that doesn't need a radical

18   re-evaluation as suggested by the Respondents and the

19   United States.

20               If there are no further questions, I'd --
