 6           ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

 7              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. COLLINS:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              This case comes before the Court under the

11   deferential standard of review of the Antiterrorism and

12   Effective Death Penalty Act.             The Ninth Circuit decision

13   should be reversed because the Washington court's

14   adjudication of this matter was not objectively

15   unreasonable.   The Washington court concluded that the

16   instruction at issue properly informed the jury of the

17   elements of accomplice liability, and the prosecutor's

18   argument informed the jury that it could only convict

19   Sarausad if he acted with knowledge he was facilitating

20   the commission of a homicide.

21              The court also concluded that the trial

22   judge did not abuse his discretion in directing the jury

23   to reread the relevant instructions instead of giving

24   the supplemental instruction proposed by Sarausad.                 The

25   decision below was not an unreasonable application of


                                         3

 1   clearly established Federal law.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But you think it was

 3   right?

 4              MR. COLLINS:         I do think it was right, Your

 5   Honor, but I also believe that it was not objectively

 6   unreasonable, which is the standard before this Court.

 7   Turning to the PRP court's adjudication, the --

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            First, is there some

 9   constitutional minimum?       Let's assume direct review.           Is

10   there some constitutional minimum requirement for

11   scienter with reference to an accomplice?

12              MR. COLLINS:         I believe there is, Your

13   Honor.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What is it?

15              MR. COLLINS:         You have to have knowledge

16   that you're facilitating -- you have to act and you have

17   to have knowledge, both those two points.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is that the same -- is

19   that the same as purpose?

20              MR. COLLINS:         I think it is, Your Honor.         I

21   think the model -- I think the Model Penal Code refers

22   -- uses the term "purpose" as opposed to "knowledge,"

23   but I don't think --

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but you don't take

25   the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law


                                       4

 1   conforms to the Model Penal Code?                  I thought the Model

 2   Penal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're

 3   stating.

 4                 MR. COLLINS:         I believe that's correct, Your

 5   Honor.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you're -- would --

 7   would you say that the trial court in Washington states

 8   law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have

 9   to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the

10   crime?

11                 MR. COLLINS:         I believe that you would have

12   to have -- you have to knowingly facilitate the crime,

13   Your Honor.    That's the --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you agree there is a

15   difference in "knowing" and "purpose"?

16                 MR. COLLINS:         I'm not sure there is much of

17   a difference, Your Honor.            Frankly, I haven't thought

18   about that question, but I think you have to have that

19   mental component.     You have to either have purpose or

20   you have to do it with knowledge.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the question is

22   knowledge of what.      And I thought it is now recognized

23   that in this State you have to know not just that a

24   crime -- you have to know in this case of the potential

25   for a homicide.

 1               MR. COLLINS:         That's right, Justice

 2   Ginsburg.   You have to know -- you have to act with

 3   knowledge that you are facilitating a homicide.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why just a homicide?         What

 5   was -- what was the indictment here?                    What was he tried

 6   for?

 7               MR. COLLINS:         First degree -- a number of

 8   counts, Your Honor.     First degree murder, second degree

 9   murder, attempted first degree murder, first degree

10   assault with a deadly weapon, because there was one

11   death and two people were shot -- wounded and then there

12   was --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why wouldn't assault with a

14   deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you

15   have to know that it was first degree murder or second

16   degree murder?   I don't know how you get from the text

17   of the Washington statute that all you have to know is

18   that it was a homicide?

19               MR. COLLINS:         Because the statute refers to

20   "the crime," so you have to have knowledge that you're

21   facilitating a homicide, but you don't have to have

22   shared --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But -- but he wasn't

24   prosecuted for homicide.         I mean, the crimes are much

25   more specific --

 1               MR. COLLINS:         Well --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- first degree murder,

 3   second degree murder.

 4               MR. COLLINS:         In Washington, you have to

 5   have knowledge of the general crime that is homicide,

 6   but you don't have to have the same knowledge as to

 7   principle; therefore, you don't have to have knowledge

 8   of premediation.   You just have to have knowledge that

 9   you're going to commit the general -- the general crime.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             How does that appear from

11   the statute?   If I read the statute, I would have

12   thought that you have to have knowledge that he was --

13   would negligent homicide suffice?

14               MR. COLLINS:         You could be convicted of

15   manslaughter as an accomplice if you had knowledge of a

16   homicide.   You have to have general knowledge of the

17   crime.

18               Let me give you another example.                 In the

19   Davis case, for example, this was a robbery case, and

20   the defendants agreed to do a robbery, but the person

21   who went into the store had a gun.                 The accomplice

22   didn't know that he had a gun, but still he was

23   convicted of armed robbery because he had a general

24   knowledge that robbery was going to be committed.                   On

25   the other hand, if the principal had shot the store


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   owner, the defendant would not be an accomplice to

 2   murder if his only knowledge was that he was

 3   facilitating the crime of robbery.

 4                So you have to have knowledge that you're

 5   facilitating the general crime charged.                 In this case

 6   crimes charged were various kinds of homicides, first

 7   degree murder, attempted murder.               And in this case, the

 8   record is very clear that the prosecutor argued that

 9   Mr. Sarausad acted with knowledge that he was

10   facilitating a homicide.         Therefore, the PRP court's

11   adjudication of that point is not objectively

12   unreasonable under the AEDPA standard.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This is -- the

14   prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just

15   filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a

16   crime, that was sufficient.             I don't find that what

17   you've said is an accurate description of the charge --

18                MR. COLLINS:        Your Honor --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- of the prosecutor's

20   summation.

21                MR. COLLINS:        Your Honor, the prosecutor

22   continually talked about the fact that they were going

23   there for the shooting.        For example, in the -- the

24   joint appendix, the brown brief on page 123, the

25   prosecutor tells the jury when they rode down to Ballard


                                        8

 1   High School the last time, "I say they knew what they

 2   were up to.    Fists didn't work.             Pushing didn't work.

 3   Shouting insults didn't work.              Shooting was going to

 4   work.    In for a dime, in for a dollar."

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but isn't the problem

 6   on your side of the case that there was another "in for

 7   a dime, in for a dollar" argument and that was the

 8   hypothetical holding the hands behind the back while

 9   some third party slugged the victim?                     And on that

10   hypothetical, there was no reference to a definite

11   crime.   In that hypothetical the victim was killed, and

12   under that hypothetical, there was no reference to the

13   crime, i.e., homicide, and so it seems to me that the

14   prosecutor's arguments, the dime-dollar arguments, went

15   both ways.

16                 MR. COLLINS:        I disagree, Your Honor.               When

17   the prosecutor used the hypothetical, and in fact on

18   page 123 that I just quoted you, the prosecutor talks

19   about, in fact uses that dime for a dollar hypothetical,

20   and then immediately tells the jury that Mr. Sarausad

21   acted with knowledge that there was going to be a

22   homicide.    They went --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Sure, in that case.           But

24   there was another one in which the prosecutor didn't do

25   that.

 1                 MR. COLLINS:         I'm sorry.             Are you talking

 2   about a different case, a case other than this, Justice

 3   Souter?

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I did -- maybe I dreamed

 5   this.     I thought the prosecutor also gave as a dime for

 6   a dollar example the example of the individual, the

 7   accomplice who holds a victim's hands while a third

 8   party slugs the victim and in fact kills the victim.

 9   And I thought in that hypothetical argument the

10   prosecutor was saying that the -- that the accomplice

11   was an accomplice to homicide, even though he didn't

12   know at the time the assault started that homicide was

13   intended or would result.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It's toward the bottom of

15   page 123.    And I have the same, I have the same, just

16   tieing onto Justice Souter's question, on the same

17   subject.    It seems to me that that hypothetical is not

18   necessarily correct.

19                 MR. COLLINS:         The court, the PRP Court of

20   Appeals said that that hypothetical is problematic.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the

22   instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the

23   statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed,

24   in for a dime, in for a dollar?                The law in the State of

25   Washington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a

 1   dollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and

 2   you're helping in some fashion to bring about this

 3   crime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion.                      And

 4   that was tied in to the person who thought he was

 5   assisting in assault and it turns out that the victim

 6   got killed.

 7                 MR. COLLINS:        Justice Ginsburg, the

 8   hypothetical may be problematic, but you have to

 9   consider --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But what about the

11   statement I just read, that the law of the State is you

12   don't even have to be there if you're helping in some

13   fashion.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where is that?           Is that in

15   the charge to the jury?

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.          It's in the same

17   paragraph, the paragraph with the example of the

18   accomplice who is --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's not in the court's

20   charges.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            No.      This is in the

22   summation.

23                 MR. COLLINS:        Justice Ginsburg, the

24   prosecutor's argument responds to the argument made by

25   Sarausad's counsel that you had to have shared intent,


                                        11

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that Mr. Sarausad had to have the same intent as the

 2   principal.     They do use the hypothetical about holding

 3   the arms, but as soon as they finish the hypothetical

 4   the court -- the prosecutor identifies what happened

 5   here, which is that the intention was to facilitate a

 6   homicide, and you have to take the argument as a whole

 7   just looking at the hypothetical.

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, if you take the

 9   argument as a whole you've got at best an ambiguous

10   argument.    You've got an argument that points to a "the

11   crime" interpretation and you've got an argument part of

12   which points to an "any crime" interpretation, and to

13   the extent that your case may ultimately turn on the

14   significance of the prosecutor's argument, it seems to

15   me that the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.

16                MR. COLLINS:          Well, of course, Your Honor,

17   in this case my argument doesn't have to turn on that.

18   The question is whether this is an unreasonable

19   application and looking at the whole argument that the

20   prosecutor made, whenever the prosecutor used "dime for

21   a dollar" or that hypothetical, the prosecutor tied that

22   to shooting.    Mr. Sarausad was going to --

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Maybe I'm beating a dead

24   horse, but it seems to me that what we've brought in our

25   questions from the bench is that that is not correct.

 1   In one instance the prosecutor clearly tied it to

 2   shooting.    If that's all we had before us we wouldn't

 3   have an argument.     But in the other iteration of the

 4   dime-dollar argument, the prosecutor didn't tie it to

 5   shooting.

 6                MR. COLLINS:          Your Honor, I believe the

 7   prosecutor always tied it to shooting, and moreover

 8   that's the way the defense counsel argued the case.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:             Can you help me with this?

10   Suppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a

11   technical matter, an important but technical matter, and

12   when they have questions about it I say read the

13   instruction.    Suppose I'm right as far as the

14   instruction goes.     But say the prosecutor gets everybody

15   mixed up.    Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people

16   mixed up enough, that could becomes a due process

17   violation.     But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot

18   of mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect.              Are

19   there any cases I should look at, one that would tell me

20   how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before

21   it's a due process violation?

22                MR. COLLINS:          Well, Your Honor, Brown v.

23   Payton, which involved the Factor K in how you consider

24   mitigating evidence in the --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:             In Brown, in that case did


                                         13

 1   they find that he did get them too mixed up or he

 2   didn't?

 3                 MR. COLLINS:        He didn't get them too mixed

 4   up so.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           He did not.       So unless in

 6   this case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up

 7   than in the Brown case, we should just reverse.

 8                 MR. COLLINS:        Exactly.          Particularly --

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the appellate

10   court?    I mean, the first time around the appellate

11   court was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the

12   prosecutor.

13                 MR. COLLINS:        Well, Your Honor --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Because the appellate

15   court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was

16   enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely

17   to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the

18   indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et

19   cetera, just a crime.       And the second time around that

20   appellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know

21   we got it wrong because there has been an intervening

22   decision of the State's supreme court clarifying it.

23                 But what the prosecutor said, at least as I

24   read it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate

25   appellate court said the first time around:                 Said he


                                        14

 1   didn't have to know that there was going to be a

 2   shooting.

 3                MR. COLLINS:         Your Honor, the intermediate

 4   appellate court did get it wrong the first time around.

 5   But I think you have to consider the context, Your

 6   Honor.   The legal issue before the appellate court the

 7   first time on accomplice liability was Mr. Sarausad's

 8   claim that there had to be a shared intent, that is to

 9   say you didn't have to know the crime.                     You had to have

10   --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They say, the court

12   itself said:    We got it wrong.             We said go away

13   appellant because you knew that a crime was likely to be

14   committed.

15                MR. COLLINS:         Your Honor, I think you have

16   to consider the context of the case.                     The argument that

17   the court of appeals was considering on direct review

18   was not the argument here.           The question, the point that

19   you're looking at where the court said that it was not

20   necessary to prove shooting, the issue before the court

21   was Mr. Sarausad's claim that he was merely present,

22   that he didn't do anything.             And the court of appeals

23   responded by saying no, there is evidence that you may

24   have known of the fight, you may have known of the

25   shooting.    And then in what I would characterize as an


                                        15

 1   aside, the court said the State doesn't have to prove

 2   shooting, but there is evidence of shooting.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did -- hadn't other

 4   Washington State courts made a similar error in their

 5   interpretation of the Washington statutes?

 6              MR. COLLINS:         A few, a few court of appeals

 7   decisions did misstate the standard, Justice Scalia,

 8   that's correct.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And the same -- and hadn't

10   the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard

11   the same way and using "In for a dime, in for a dollar"

12   to mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if

13   you were in for beating him up that's enough for holding

14   you liable for homicide?

15              MR. COLLINS:         Some prosecutors made that

16   argument, Justice Scalia.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Including this one in an

18   earlier case.

19              MR. COLLINS:         That's right.          But in Boyde

20   this Court pointed out that the fact that prosecutors in

21   other cases made improper arguments -- in Boyde

22   prosecutors were arguing about Factor K didn't allow

23   consideration of mitigation evidence.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:            The only reason I raise it

25   is, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on


                                      16

 1   the point.     It asked for further instructions three

 2   times on this precise point, what did -- did he have to

 3   know.   And all the trial judge did was say read, you

 4   know, read my instructions, which essentially recited

 5   the statute.     And what all of what you've just

 6   acknowledged shows is that reading the statute doesn't

 7   help a whole lot.     It doesn't clarify.                   It doesn't, it

 8   doesn't correct any misimpression that the prosecutor

 9   could have created.

10                MR. COLLINS:          Justice Scalia, with respect,

11   I disagree that the same question was asked three times.

12   In fact, if you look at the progression of the

13   questions, you can see the progress of the

14   deliberations.    The first question asks about intent

15   with regard to the two convict instructions 11 and 12.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Let's look at -- where is

17   that?

18                MR. COLLINS:          That would be at JA 131 and

19   132.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             In the white?

21                MR. COLLINS:          I'm sorry.             The brown joint

22   appendix 131, 132.      And see "Request Clarification on

23   Instruction Nos. 11 and 12, Intent."                      Now, 11 and 12 are

24   the two "convict" instructions for first degree murder

25   for Mr. Recuenco and Mr. Sarausad.                   The next questions

 1   that were asked -- this is on page 135 of the same

 2   document -- they ask about Instruction No. 17.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Excuse me.       Let's go back

 4   to 131 for a minute.      I thought that applied to the

 5   "accomplice" instruction.

 6               MR. COLLINS:         The trial court directed the

 7   --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's a question

 9   specifically applied to the defendant only for the

10   defendant or his accomplice.

11               MR. COLLINS:         They asked about "accomplice,"

12   but the -- this was not a question about the meaning of

13   "accomplice liability."        This question is different than

14   the third question.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It doesn't -- your

16   point is that it doesn't go to the "aiding" issue.

17               MR. COLLINS:         Exactly, Your Honor.

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, excuse me.       "Intent"

19   is broad enough to go to the DA issue, isn't it?

20               MR. COLLINS:         This question really goes to

21   if you look --

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            What's the answer to my

23   question?   I mean "the" and "a" are references to what

24   the accomplice had in mind at the time of acting.

25   That's an intent issue.

 1                 MR. COLLINS:         Your Honor -- it is an intent

 2   question, Your Honor.        But the question, if you look at

 3   Instruction No. 12, which is on page -- page -- on page

 4   9 of the brown book, this talks about the fact that in

 5   paragraph 2, that the defendant or his accomplice acted

 6   with intent to cause the death of another person.                   So

 7   the question was:     Did both -- do you have to have the

 8   same intent as -- does the accomplice have to have the

 9   same intent as the principal?

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Maybe so.     Let's go to

11   the third question, when the jury asks:                   "When a person

12   willingly participates in a group activity, is that

13   person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in

14   the group?"

15                 MR. COLLINS:         Yes, Your Honor.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How could the jury better

17   express its puzzlement?          It wanted to know, if someone

18   participates in a group, but did not -- that that person

19   is -- is an accomplice to any crime by anyone?

20                 MR. COLLINS:         And that, Justice Ginsburg --

21   and that's the first time that the jury asked that

22   question.     The trial court referred them to the

23   accomplice liability instruction and the knowledge --

24   and the knowledge instruction and --

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And the -- the counsel


                                         19
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   for the defense says, tell them no.

 2                 MR. COLLINS:         And that would have been

 3   wrong, Your Honor.      If -- if the trial judge -- there

 4   are two things wrong with that -- wrong, Your Honor.

 5      First of all, it would not have been accurate because

 6   you don't know what the group activity is, and you don't

 7   know what the knowledge is.              If the knowledge of the

 8   group activity was going back to the school to

 9   facilitate a crime --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It says "a group

11   activity."    When a person willingly participates in "a

12   group activity," is that person an accomplice to any

13   crime committed by anyone in the group?                   I don't think

14   there is any ambiguity in that question.

15                 MR. COLLINS:         With respect, Your Honor, I

16   think you have to know what the group activity is.                   More

17   -- but the important point is:                The jury got the answer

18   to the question and --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They didn't get an

20   answer.   They were told to read an instruction that they

21   had been told three times to read and obviously didn't

22   understand.

23                 MR. COLLINS:         Your Honor, I think in the

24   Weeks case this Court has held that it's proper to tell

25   a jury to reread instructions.                They are not required to


                                         20
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   give a supplemental instruction.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But we already know that

 3   many people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this

 4   "a crime."     Was it "a crime," or "any crime."               Or "the

 5   crime"?

 6                 So I think you can't avoid the confusing

 7   nature of the statute and the charge, which repeated the

 8   statute.     It doesn't get clarified until the Washington

 9   Supreme Court says it means "the crime," not "a crime,"

10   and not "any crime."

11                 MR. COLLINS:         Your Honor, we are not arguing

12   that there couldn't be some ambiguity, but what we are

13   saying is that the adjudication by the PRP court was not

14   objectively unreasonable.            Because when you look at the

15   instructions as a whole and the argument as a whole and

16   the evidence as a whole, the PRP court's decision is not

17   objectively unreasonable.

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, isn't -- isn't the

19   argument for objective unreasonableness, number one, to

20   begin with, what you just stated.                  Of course, there is

21   some ambiguity there.        I'll be candid to say that if I

22   were stating it myself, I would say there is more than

23   some ambiguity here.        It seems to be, if not misleading,

24   at least incapable of informing a jury of exactly what

25   the law is.

 1                Number two, the -- the second point in the

 2   argument is, the jury comes back repeatedly, and

 3   although, as you point out, it is -- it may well be a

 4   proper answer to a jury request for clarification to

 5   say, go back and read the instruction; the answer is

 6   there.   When it has been demonstrated by repeated jury

 7   questions that they are just not getting it, that they

 8   still have perplexity, the court has got to do something

 9   more than just say, oh, go back and do it again.

10                And number three, in this situation in which

11   there is ambiguity, there is a demonstration of jury

12   confusion.   There is an argument by the prosecutor

13   which, in fact, is a two-part argument or a two-example

14   argument and it cuts both ways, isn't it objectively

15   reasonable to say under those circumstances that there

16   was an inadequate instruction to the jury in -- in the

17   correct Washington law?

18                MR. COLLINS:        I would say no, Your Honor.

19                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Then -- then what would it

20   take?

21                JUDGE SCALIA:         You -- you know, you are

22   taking on more of a burden than you have to.            And you

23   could say, yes, it would be reasonable to say that, but

24   it would also be reasonable to say -- to say otherwise,

25   right?

 1               MR. COLLINS:           It's not objectively

 2   unreasonable.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's not objectively

 4   unreasonable to say the opposite.

 5               MR. COLLINS:           Exactly, Your Honor.

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:              The -- the "opposite" in

 7   this case would mean that the jury was properly

 8   instructed and was in a position adequately to

 9   understand Washington law correctly?                      That's the --

10   that's the opposite position.

11               MR. COLLINS:           There is no question that in a

12   number of --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:              I want to know what you

14   mean.   That's what you mean by the "opposite position"?

15               MR. COLLINS:           I mean the "opposite position"

16   is it's possible that if you are --

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Would you -- you are saying

18   you want -- why don't you answer my question?                     My

19   question is:     I think you're telling me that it would be

20   objectively reasonable to say that on the scenario I

21   just laid out the jury probably understood Washington

22   law correctly.

23               MR. COLLINS:           And I would say I think that's

24   correct, Your Honor.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But even, again, I

 1   think you are taking on too high a burden.                 You don't

 2   have to show that the jury properly understood it.                 You

 3   don't even have to show that it's reasonable.

 4   You have to show the opposite -- or your friend has to

 5   show the opposite, that there is no way that the jury

 6   could have understood this correctly or applied the

 7   correct constitutional law.            That is, if there is a way,

 8   then it's -- it's not objectively unreasonable.

 9              MR. COLLINS:          That's exactly right, Chief

10   Justice Roberts.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And that way would be the

12   way we just set out, wasn't it:              That the jury, if -- if

13   -- if, in fact, it's objectively reasonable to conclude

14   that the jury did understand Washington law correctly on

15   those circumstances, then -- then the -- the Respondent

16   here cannot win in -- in his collateral attack?

17              MR. COLLINS:          We would say he cannot win

18   because the decision of the Washington court was not

19   objectively unreasonable.

20              I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

23              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

 1   please the Court:

 2              The State is here today making what we think

 3   is a rather extraordinary argument.                      It's arguing that

 4   there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury in this

 5   case interpreted the accomplice liability charge in the

 6   same manner that the State itself urged the jury to

 7   interpret it; that the State urged the Washington Court

 8   of Appeals to interpret it on direct review in this case

 9   and in many other cases, and how the Washington Court of

10   Appeals in fact interpreted it.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well -- but is that

12   the standard?   You said there is -- they are saying that

13   it's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard.

14   They have -- you have to show that it's objectively

15   unreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the

16   State got it correct.

17              MR. FISHER:          That's right, Your Honor.              So

18   there is a constitutional violation, and then our

19   burden, which we believe we can carry on the

20   extraordinary record in this case, is to show that a

21   court, the Washington Court of Appeals, could not have

22   reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable

23   likelihood the jury understood the charge in this case.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:            When I read the opinion of

25   the Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me


                                        25

 1   that what they are doing is providing a literal

 2   interpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we

 3   have to presume the jury did when they got that

 4   instruction.

 5              Washington Court of Appeals is interpreting

 6   Washington law.     And they may be influenced by

 7   Washington case law, which is what they cite.              They

 8   don't -- they quote the instruction but they don't say

 9   "the crime" means "a crime".              That's how we interpret

10   the language of the instruction.

11              So there is an overlay of Washington case

12   law, principles of accomplice liability that inform this

13   instruction.   So I don't know that you can -- it's

14   reasonable to argue that because they misinterpreted

15   Washington law, they were misinterpreting the literal

16   language of the jury instruction.

17              MR. FISHER:           Well, Justice Alito, we think

18   it is fair to say that, because in the Washington Court

19   of Appeals decision, they start by laying out the

20   statutory language of Washington accomplice liability.

21   And remember, the jury instruction in this case simply

22   tracks that language.        That's, in fact, one of the

23   State's argument.

24              Now, our response to that argument is, just

25   as you said, Justice Alito, when a State supreme court,


                                         26

 1   as the Washington court later did in this case, steps in

 2   and applies a gloss to that language and interprets it,

 3   as this Court has said many times, it's as though that

 4   language is written into the statute.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              The gloss that the

 6   Washington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the

 7   same as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in

 8   this case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the

 9   state of the law was, got it right.

10              MR. FISHER:          Got it right insofar as

11   regurgitated the language of the statute.                But the

12   Washington law that would apply to this case -- and I

13   think there is an agreement on this, Justice Kennedy, is

14   that Mr. Sarausad has to know that he was promoting or

15   facilitating a homicide.          That's what he has to know.

16   That's theory one of the State's --

17              JUSTICE BREYER:              That's exactly what the

18   instruction said.    My problem is, I guess different

19   people, I understand, can read the same words and come

20   to different conclusions.           But I have read the

21   instruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times

22   by now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity.

23              It seems to be absolutely clear.                 What it

24   says is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I

25   would say what crime is the jury considering -- of a

 1   crime.     Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is

 2   committed by another person for which he is legally

 3   accountable.

 4                 Then it says you're an accomplice -- an

 5   accomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with

 6   certain knowledge when he aids another person in

 7   planning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree

 8   murder.

 9                 What is the problem?

10                 MR. FISHER:        The problem, Your Honor, is it

11   starts with this Court recognized him void.                      Juries are

12   lay people, and they understand things in terms of

13   common sense.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's a different

15   argument.    I want to know first -- in my mind in two

16   different categories.        Category one:                Is there an

17   ambiguity in this instruction?                And my answer so far,

18   which is what I was asking you, is zero.                      Why not?

19                 And then the second question is, could the

20   prosecution get people so mixed up about something, a

21   typical thing like this, that it would violate due

22   process?    That's why I asked the question before.                      And I

23   said, obviously the answer is sometimes they could.

24                 And then the question is, did they here?

25   And what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked


                                         28

 1   at, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in

 2   that case did not rise to a federal due process

 3   question.     So, I guess -- though it's only one person --

 4   you would have to convince me that this is somehow worse

 5   prosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.

 6

 7                 MR. FISHER:        Let me take your question in

 8   two steps, Justice Breyer.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All my questions from the

10   whole case.

11                 MR. FISHER:        Thank you.               First I want to

12   emphasize we are not alleging prosecutorial misconduct

13   in this case in any way.           The problem is --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No.     But what I mean by

15   that is that the prosecution would have had to have

16   gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using

17   shorthand for that --

18                 MR. FISHER:        Right.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            -- more mixed up than they

20   did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.

21                 MR. FISHER:        That's right.               Let me -- all I

22   meant to say was the prevailing view in the State at the

23   time of this trial was that any crime was sufficient,

24   and so that's why the prosecutor was entitled to make

25   that argument.

 1               Let me take your question in two steps,

 2   first the ambiguity in the language.                    As the Washington

 3   courts themselves and as the States themselves argue at

 4   page 38 and 39 of the appendix of our red brief, you can

 5   interpret the language in the statute, when you get to

 6   words "the crime", to mean one of two things:

 7               One, it could mean as you said, Justice

 8   Breyer, that the particular crime the principal

 9   committed; or it could mean one could understand it to

10   mean simply the principal's criminal conduct.                   And in

11   Washington --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            In my -- it it doesn't mean

13   either.   It means jury you are instructed that the

14   person is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury

15   is sitting there and they are asked the question:                   Is

16   the person guilty of second-degree murder?

17               Now they are to apply the instruction.                   A

18   person is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da,

19   da.   And when it gets to "the crime", it is referring to

20   second-degree murder.      I don't know how -- anything else

21   it could be referring to.

22               MR. FISHER:        Well, maybe the best that I can

23   do, Justice Breyer, is refer you to empirical evidence

24   from the State itself, from the State of Washington, and

25   if you need one further thing to look at, I commend to

 1   you the Supreme Court decision of the Supreme Court of

 2   Colorado that cited in the actual brief -- there was

 3   language exactly like this that comes to a textual

 4   analysis and comes to the conclusion.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:             You're convincing me that

 6   different people can reach different conclusions.                     What

 7   I'd like you to say is something that would change my

 8   mind on my initial conclusion that there is no

 9   ambiguity.   I think you could say something like that,

10   because as you quite rightly point out, other people

11   have reached other conclusions.

12                MR. FISHER:         Because the articles "a" and

13   "the" are simply not definite enough.                     And you can read

14   the words "the crime" to simply mean criminal conduct.

15                Now, let me talk about the prosecutor's

16   argument.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You might be able to

18   and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you

19   could read it one way or you could say it another way.

20   And if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it

21   one way is objectively unreasonable when the State court

22   reads it that way.

23                MR. FISHER:         I think if that's all we had,

24   Mr. Chief Justice, you would be exactly right.                     So let

25   me turn now --


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it is not

 2   objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct

 3   jurors as they did?      If that's all you had, then that

 4   would be the point.

 5                 MR. FISHER:       Right.        Right.     Because the

 6   test that this Court has repeated many times is whether

 7   there is a reasonable likelihood that this jury

 8   misapplied the instruction.

 9                 Now, let me turn to the prosecutor's

10   argument, because there was a lot of discussion about

11   that in the first half an hour.

12                 There is two places in the joint appendix

13   that you might want to pay attention to, and I think we

14   might have been referring to two different places

15   earlier.   In joint appendix page 38, the prosecutor

16   makes her opening argument and says -- and uses the

17   assault analogy of holding somebody's arms behind their

18   back.   And she tells the jury this is -- as Justice

19   Ginsburg was reading -- this is the law of the State of

20   Washington.

21                 And again, in direct rebuttal at page 123 of

22   the joint appendix, the prosecutor again says very

23   specifically -- specifically to the jury, let me talk to

24   you about the accomplice liability instruction.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Was there an objection?


                                        32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. FISHER:        There were objections both

 2   before and after.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The objection was based on

 4   the defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely,

 5   close to the model penal code that says you have to have

 6   the same -- is anterior principle, and that's not

 7   necessarily the law in every state.

 8                So the defense bears some responsibility for

 9   not -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent

10   theory either.

11                MR. FISHER:        There were times where

12   Mr. Sarausad's counsel, you're right, did ask for a

13   little more than he was entitled to.                     But Mr. Reyes'

14   counsel made objections directly on point, which

15   Mr. Sarausad joined, and as Justice Ginsburg noted

16   earlier, when the jury comes back with the third

17   question that is precisely on point, it's precisely the

18   question on which that whole entire case turns -- and I

19   might add there would be no reason for the jury to ask

20   that third question, what kind of knowledge is required

21   in this case, if they had decided, as the State argues,

22   that Mr. Sarausad knew a homicide was going to be

23   committed.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't think that

25   your reading of question three is definitive.                     I think


                                        33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of

 2   two ways.    If you look at question three, the issue

 3   could be whether others could have had an intent, in

 4   other words, others in the group, not simply -- it

 5   doesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have

 6   the requisite intent.

 7                MR. FISHER:        Well, we think it's pretty

 8   clear, Mr. Chief Justice.           I think the more important

 9   sentence may be the one that precedes that question,

10   which is the jury tells the court, after seven days of

11   deliberations:    We are having difficulty agreeing on the

12   legal definition and concept of accomplice.

13                Now, that is the question -- and let me

14   return to the prosecutor's argument --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's not the

16   question.    There are a number of areas, and I think the

17   first two questions point in the opposite direction.

18   They do not say we don't know whether it's "the crime"

19   or "a crime".    Their questions, neither one, two or

20   three focus on that.

21                It's a more general question that we could

22   read the opposite way.        Perhaps you can read it the way

23   you are, even though it doesn't say is it "the crime" or

24   "a crime".

25                But there again, I think it's incorrect to


                                        34
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   say it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly

 2   not questions one and two, I mean question three is your

 3   strongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are

 4   focusing on the "the/a" issue.

 5                 MR. FISHER:        Well, I think the best we can

 6   do, because we have to make reasonable inferences from

 7   the record and he we can't go back and ask the jurors

 8   what we thought, is we have to make, as the court has

 9   done many times, reasonable inferences as to what they

10   are doing.     And I think the fairest reading of this

11   record, even if it's not absolutely clear, is that the

12   jury was honing in progressively on the central issue in

13   this case, and that was Mr. Sarausad's mens rea.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So, then, what I take is

15   authoritative on that are two sentences from the

16   Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other

17   judges have been all over the lot.                   The first sentence

18   it says:     The trial court correctly instructed the jury

19   that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they

20   mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it

21   found he knowingly aided in commission of "the crime"

22   charged, which was second-degree murder.                   That's their

23   interpretation, which I could understand.

24                 Then the second thing is, it does not offend

25   the principles of accomplice liability to hold


                                         35

 1   responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely,

 2   conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when

 3   the substantial risk of death results in actual death.

 4                 So that would seem to be hornbook law.              If

 5   you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial

 6   or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you

 7   know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's

 8   the Washington view, that's it.                You've had it.

 9                 And here they go on to say that he knew

10   there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was

11   engaged in a drive-by shooting.                And then to put every

12   dot on every "I", they say a drive-by shooting does run

13   a substantial risk of death.              Okay.

14                 Now that's what I read and at that point, I

15   said I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best

16   answer.

17                 MR. FISHER:        Your Honor, we are not

18   challenging -- or this Court does not have authorities

19   the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, so there

20   might be enough evidence in the record for the jury to

21   have found that.     But the question is, did the jury find

22   that?     And we can't know from the instructions given in

23   light of the arguments made to the jury by the

24   prosecutor and the jury's own questions trying to sort

25   through them, this case -- whether the jury actually


                                         36
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   found that.     And so if the State wanted -- this goes

 2   again to the prosecutor's argument.

 3                 There is two things that I think we might be

 4   conflating improperly here.              There is the first question

 5   of what the prosecutor argued to the jury Washington law

 6   meant.     And I suggest to you if you look at JA 38 and JA

 7   123, there is no doubt what the prosecutor was arguing

 8   to the jury Washington law meant.                  It meant as she said,

 9   "in or a dime, in for a dollar."                 If you hold somebody's

10   arms behind their back thinking that an assault is going

11   to occur and the person dies, you can be found guilty of

12   murder.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No objection from defense

14   counsel.

15                 MR. FISHER:        Both before and after, Justice

16   Kennedy.

17                 But I would add that another reason the

18   defense counsel may not have interposed yet another

19   objection at that instance was because that was the

20   prevailing view of Washington law at the time.

21                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Could I ask you this

22   question about the jury's question where they say we are

23   having difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and

24   concept of accomplice; when a person willingly

25   participates in a group activity, is that person an


                                         37

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the

 2   group?

 3               Suppose that the judge had answered that

 4   question by saying a person who participates in group

 5   activity is guilty of the crime of second degree murder

 6   if the person acts with knowledge that his or her

 7   conduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the

 8   crime of second degree murder.              Would you have a case if

 9   that answer was given?

10               MR. FISHER:        I don't think so, Justice

11   Alito.   That would have cleared up the ambiguity in the

12   case.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          That's almost a direct quote

14   from the instruction that was given.

15               MR. FISHER:        No, it's not because what you

16   did is you inserted the name of the crime in there.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:          I put in crime of second

18   degree murder rather than the crime.

19               MR. FISHER:        That's exactly what defendants

20   even still in the State of Washington are asking courts

21   to do in the --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          That poses a difference

23   enough to make A, a constitutional violation and B, make

24   it unreasonable for the Washington Court of Appeals to

25   say that there was no constitutional violation?

 1                 MR. FISHER:       Yes, under the particular

 2   circumstances in this case, because the jury expressed

 3   confusion.    So we know the jury was confused.                 We know

 4   the only reason they would have asked that is if they

 5   had not found the facts the State alleges, at least at

 6   that point, that Mr. Sarausad knew a murder was going to

 7   occur, and also because we know the prosecutor argued

 8   the exact opposite to them.             They were actually asking

 9   the question -- another way to put it, I think which is

10   a fair characterization is, is what the prosecutor told

11   us correct?    That --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           The prosecutor, I mean I

13   thought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I

14   think, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his

15   back and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps --

16   at least might run -- I can see a person saying that

17   that runs a substantial risk of death.                   I mean Houdini

18   died that way, apparently.           So maybe hitting somebody in

19   the stomach does create a substantial risk of death.                      Do

20   you know anything about -- one way or the other on that?

21                 MR. FISHER:       I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.            You

22   need more than that in this case.                 Second degree murder

23   is intentional.    So --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           They intentionally hit

25   somebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about --


                                        39

 1               MR. FISHER:         Intentionally killing is what

 2   the State says.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:             I realize that but what the

 4   State supreme court holds.           I think correctly, that if

 5   the person conscious of the risk knows that a particular

 6   individual is engaging in certain conduct for whom he is

 7   responsible, he is -- he is guilty of the -- if the

 8   event that you know there is a substantial risk of comes

 9   about.   I would be amazed that a State would say the

10   contrary.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And your answer to Justice

12   Breyer incorporated the -- the principle that the

13   defense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of

14   this case, that you must have the same scienter as the

15   principal, and that's not necessarily the law.

16               MR. FISHER:         I think that --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It can go on in some

18   States but not -- it doesn't have to be the law as I

19   understand it.

20               MR. FISHER:         The defendant didn't have to

21   have premedication, Justice Kennedy.                     I think the best

22   answer I can give and I -- is that we agree with the

23   State on this.    We agree with what the State said at

24   page 31 of its brief, that it had to prove that

25   Mr. Sarausad knew he was aiding or facilitating a


                                        40
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   homicide.   That he knew, and it was argued to this case,

 2   Justice -- as it was argued to the jury, Justice Breyer,

 3   the defense agreed that if Mr. Sarausad knew there was a

 4   gun in his car, or if he knew that the fellows were

 5   planning on killing somebody, that he could have been

 6   found guilty.

 7               That was the very -- that was the central

 8   issue in this case; and when the State stands up and

 9   says the prosecutor argued -- didn't make -- didn't make

10   a misleading argument, what they are talking about are

11   the prosecutor's arguments on the facts.                  After telling

12   the jury had is what Washington law is, the prosecutor

13   argued in various ways that Mr. Sarausad knew that a

14   fight was going to happen, or -- or that a gun was --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            Washington -- in the State

16   of Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones

17   helps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's

18   leg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't

19   aim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense

20   to say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick.                  I thought

21   he'd just hit him in the leg.             I mean, that -- we know

22   that isn't a good defense in Washington because the

23   Supreme Court of Washington tells us that.

24               MR. FISHER:        That's right.            But I think you

25   don't --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            What's the difference

 2   between that and punching him in the stomach?

 3               MR. FISHER:        Because when somebody is

 4   punched in the stomach there is no reasonable belief

 5   that the person is going to be put in grave risk of

 6   death.   And so as I said, the issue of this case, that

 7   the whole entire case was about, and that the jury was

 8   demonstrably perplexed about, was what did Mr. Sarausad

 9   know.

10               And when the State says, well -- the

11   prosecutor argued to the jury that he knew their

12   shooting was going to happen or that he knew a gun was

13   in the car, if the jury had believed that they could

14   have come back with a guilty verdict in 30 minutes; but

15   instead they asked a series of questions culminating in

16   the one after seven days of deliberation which can only

17   be interpreted as suggesting that we don't believe that

18   Mr. Sarausad knew that the worst was going to happen

19   here, and we are struggling to figure out what kind of

20   verdict we have to render in light of that.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          With the jury -- was the

22   jury told that the arguments of counsel are not the law,

23   that I, the judge, will tell you what the law is?

24               MR. FISHER:        I think a standard statement to

25   that effect was made.      But remember two things, Justice


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Alito.   First, the prosecutor herself kept telling the

 2   jury this is what the State of Washington law requires.

 3   And as this Court has recognized in other cases, the

 4   prosecutor isn't just any old lawyer standing in front

 5   of a jury.   The prosecutor carries with her the

 6   imprimatur of the government; and so we think it's

 7   perfectly reasonable for the jury to have understood the

 8   prosecutor to be arguing this is what the law is, and at

 9   the very least to have created a question in their

10   minds.

11                And if I contrast this case with Brown

12   against Payton, because Justice Breyer has asked about

13   that case and it is another case where the prosecutor

14   made what this Court found was a misleading argument to

15   the jury, there you have a very different situation.

16   Not only do you have no jury questions at all coming in

17   that case to demonstrate to the Court that the jury was

18   in fact confused and likely to follow the prosecutor's

19   advice, but you have a very different scenario in Brown,

20   where this Court said that in light of the way that case

21   was actually argued, the prosecutor was really making

22   more of an argument on the facts, that these arguments

23   the defendant has made shouldn't really be considered

24   mitigating evidence in your deliberations; and as this

25   Court said the jury must have taken it as a factual


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   argument because otherwise the whole mitigation hearing

 2   would have been totally unnecessary.

 3              Now, under the -- under the facts of this

 4   case, the way this case was tried -- and again I want to

 5   emphasize that at the time this case was tried, the

 6   prosecutor had the better of the argument as to what

 7   Washington law is.

 8              This case is only before you because it's

 9   the oddball case, and the only one I can think of that's

10   like it is when this Court had in about 2000, or decided

11   in 2001, called Fiore v White, when in Pennsylvania the

12   State brought a prosecution and obtained a conviction

13   for discharging hazardous waste without a permit, and

14   then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later said that not

15   having a permit is required under the statute.                    It's not

16   enough to prove to the jury that he so deviated from the

17   permit that -- that no permit existed.                    And then this

18   Court said once we know that clarification under State

19   law, we look back and it's clear as day that the jury

20   didn't find that element.

21              Now the only difference between that case

22   and this case is that in Fiore it was absolutely certain

23   the jury didn't find the element and the prosecution

24   didn't argue otherwise.          Here you have enough ambiguous

25   evidence and ambiguity in the jury instructions that the


                                         44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   State was trying to backfill after it has lost the case

 2   in the Washington Supreme Court and say no, the jury in

 3   this case even though we told them they didn't have to

 4   find it, did go ahead and find it.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:            But the only difference

 6   between that case, which I know very well, and this case

 7   is that in that case there was no issue about jury

 8   instructions.

 9              MR. FISHER:          Well, not directly.

10              JUSTICE ALITO:            So what's the relevance of

11   it?

12              MR. FISHER:          Right.        So, the relevance --

13              JUSTICE ALITO:            Has to do with the

14   retroactivity whether a State can -- whether

15   Pennsylvania had changed the interpretation of its

16   statute, or whether what they said it meant was what it

17   always had meant.

18              MR. FISHER:          That's right, Justice Alito and

19   I know that you know that case.               The -- you're right.

20   So we are on all fours with Fiore in the sense that the

21   later decision from the State Supreme Court applies

22   retroactively, and in Fiore what you would have had, the

23   court didn't need to talk about jury instructions,

24   because I take it that the jury was instructed in Fiore

25   that deviating substantially from a permit satisfies the


                                        45
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   no-permit element of that defense, and so the jury was

 2   given there, simply an instruction that was simply

 3   wrong.

 4                And here our contention is that the -- that

 5   the jury charge taken in light of the case was

 6   ambiguous, but that distinction doesn't matter because

 7   as this Court has said in Boyde and Estelle and many

 8   other cases, all you have to show is a reasonable

 9   likelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge.

10                Now we have to show an additional layer of

11   unreasonableness because we are on habeas now and no

12   longer on direct review, but for all the reasons that

13   are apparent on the face of this record this is the

14   extraordinary case.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Fisher, can I just ask

16   you a question?    Is it your view that the question that

17   is troubling the jury was whether they had to find that

18   the driver of the car knew that there was a gun in the

19   car.

20                MR. FISHER:        There's two ways to think about

21   it.    Yes, that could be one way to think about it.           The

22   other way that they might have been thinking about it

23   was whether he knew that a murder was going to happen

24   and that a killing was going to happen.

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Assume proof of the gun in


                                        46
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the car was enough to prove --

 2               MR. FISHER:        That's the way the case was

 3   presented to the jury.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It wouldn't -- and that's

 5   what presumably may have taken a lot of time

 6   deliberating whether or not he knew there was a gun.

 7               MR. FISHER:        That's right, Justice Stevens.

 8   The defendant --

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:            And in one theory it makes

10   a difference; in another theory it doesn't.

11               MR. FISHER:        Precisely.               And the defense

12   counsel -- the defense counsel admitted in argument that

13   if you find he knew there was a gun in the car, then we

14   lose.   And, remember, the jury earlier -- we've talk

15   about the three jury questions about what the law meant.

16   Remember the jury earlier asked to have Mr. Sarausad's

17   testimony reread back to them.              So, again, every

18   indication is you have a jury really trying very, very

19   hard to do their job.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, AEDPA of

21   course requires that this be an unreasonable application

22   of clearly established Federal law.                     What is the clearly

23   established Federal law that was unreasonably applied?

24               MR. FISHER:        It's the rule that is stated --

25   again, at page 32 of the State's brief with which we


                                       47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                             Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   agree -- that if there is a reasonable likelihood that

 2   the jury applied instructions so as to violate the

 3   Constitution, then that violates due process.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So that's

 5   articulated at a fairly general level.

 6                MR. FISHER:            That's right.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     In Yarborough, we've

 8   said that the more general the rule, the more leeway

 9   courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case

10   determination.        So you have a very general rule, and to

11   find an unreasonable application, the court has broad

12   leeway because it is a general rule.                         And you've already

13   said that the instruction does not establish

14   unreasonable application.

15                Given that, isn't it pertinent, although

16   people have objected -- you've objected to the idea

17   that, well, all they did was send them back with the

18   instruction.     So they sent them back with something that

19   you said could be reasonably interpreted correctly.                         So

20   why isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway

21   the State court has because this is a general rule, why

22   isn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable

23   objective?     Yes.

24                MR. FISHER:            The State would have a better

25   argument if nothing else had happened in this trial

 1   other than simply the jury had been given that

 2   instruction, but our point is, and then this Court

 3   recognizes as much, I think, in Brown against Payton,

 4   that the prosecutor's arguments do matter.              They are to

 5   be considered in the calculus.              And this Court said in

 6   Estelle that instructions cannot be considered in

 7   isolation.   They have to be considered in the totality

 8   of the way the case was tried.

 9                And so my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is the

10   reason why the State cannot show that the State court of

11   appeals decision was reasonable is because it's not just

12   the instruction that had perplexed the State and

13   Washington courts over the years; it's the fact that the

14   prosecutor asked the jury to adopt the wrong

15   interpretation of the instruction and that the jury came

16   back and told the court -- I think -- maybe it helps to

17   think about the case this way:              After seven days of

18   deliberation -- now I understand that we can dispute a

19   little bit what the jury was asking, but I think a fair

20   statement is that after seven days of deliberation, the

21   jury was telling the court at a minimum there's a

22   reasonable likelihood we don't understand accomplice

23   liability in this case and that we are going to find

24   that as long as Sarausad was a member of this gang and

25   willingly participated in gang activity, that that's


                                       49
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   enough to hold him liable for accomplice murder.                   And

 2   that's what the State had argued alternatively, Your

 3   Honor.

 4              So after seven days, there's no guesswork

 5   that's even required.      We know the jury was confused and

 6   going down the wrong path.          And so the only way the

 7   State can rescue that is to say that, upon being told to

 8   read the same charge that it been told to read three

 9   previous times, that suddenly the light bulb went off so

10   dramatically that it reduced its confusion below the

11   50/50 level.   Now that's what this Court said in Brown

12   against Payton.   The reasonable likelihood test is below

13   50/50.

14              So we think if you were the Washington Court

15   of Appeals -- and I think this is another way to ask

16   yourselves the question you have to decide in this case.

17   If you were the Washington Court of Appeals on this

18   record, would it be reasonable for you to say that this

19   jury was not even reasonably likely to misunderstand the

20   accomplice liability instruction in this case?

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You've already said

22   that the instruction doesn't get you there.                   And I just

23   heard you say that, with respect to the questions, we

24   can dispute what the jury was asking.                   So it's hard for

25   me to see where you get the objectively unreasonableness

 1   if you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if

 2   you can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know

 3   that they were reflecting the confusion you have here.

 4   So is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?

 5               MR. FISHER:         Well, we have all three, but I

 6   don't want to give away too much.                 I think it is fair to

 7   say that the jury's third question is perfectly clear.

 8   I hedged a minute to be frank so that I could

 9   acknowledge the Court's earlier questions and get -- and

10   get my statement out, but in all honesty, I think that

11   the third jury question makes it clear that the jury is

12   confused.   But we have -- again, unlike Brown against

13   Payton, unlike Weeks against Angelone, we have this

14   amazing constellation of all these mutually --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             This argument -- I'm

16   beginning to get your argument.               The statement is -- the

17   prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found

18   guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to

19   occur.   You're saying that's absolutely wrong.                 There's

20   no support for that in the record.                  In fact what the

21   prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting

22   didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang

23   activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so

24   wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that

25   habeas was right.    Is that the argument?

 1                 MR. FISHER:        That's a fair characterization,

 2   Justice Breyer.    If you look at the hypothetical that

 3   the State gives the jury as to what Washington law

 4   means, it is clear that's the argument they're making.

 5   On the facts they made alternative arguments.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 7                 MR. FISHER:        Thank you very much.

10                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

11                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                 MR. COLLINS:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13                 I want to just focus for a moment on the

14   third question because Respondent focuses on that.                  To

15   begin with, you have to understand what was going on in

16   this trial.    There was deliberation for seven-plus days

17   but it was a 10-day trial, I mean the jury heard

18   testimony for 10 days.         There were three defendants

19   being tried together.        Each defendant was being tried on

20   five counts.    It was a complicated trial.                The fact that

21   the deliberations took seven days is not extraordinary

22   at all.

23                 Mr. Sarausad assumes that the third question

24   is directed at him.       I suggest -- of course we don't

25   know what was going on in the jury room, but I suggest


                                         52

 1   as likely an explanation is that question went to

 2   Mr. Reyes because Mr. Reyes was not driving, was sitting

 3   in the back seat.     The question is, if you're just

 4   sitting in the back seat when your gang is going to do

 5   an activity, are you guilty?             And they were told to

 6   reread the instruction.         They did reread the

 7   instruction, and they deliberated.                  So the third

 8   question came on the seventh day of deliberation.                       After

 9   they got the answer to reread the instruction, they

10   deliberated about 45 minutes.              They took a break for the

11   night.   They came back, deliberated about another hour

12   and a half, and then they pronounced their verdict,

13   convicted Mr. Ronquillo of first degree murder,

14   Mr. Sarausad of second degree murder.                    They hung on

15   Mr. Reyes.

16                It seems to me that the third question does

17   not -- is not some kind of a smoking gun.                    When you look

18   at the trial --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They didn't say anything

20   at all about Mr. Reyes.         They asked the question about

21   an accomplice, a crime.

22                MR. COLLINS:         Exactly right, Justice

23   Ginsburg, but Mr. Sarausad assumes that that's a

24   question about him.      We suggest it's just as likely that

25   it's a question about Mr. Reyes.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:              But what he's saying, I

 2   think now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose

 3   the jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he

 4   didn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but

 5   that the prosecutor in the context of the trial had

 6   given the jury the impression that they could convict

 7   this person even if the person did not know there was

 8   going to be a drive-by shooting.

 9               And he's saying that the finding to the

10   contrary, the statement to the contrary in the Supreme

11   Court of Washington is wrong.               When I look at that, I

12   will find, he says, that the prosecutor gave the

13   impression, as I just said, that even without a gun your

14   involvement with this gang is enough to convict him of

15   murder.   What is your response to that?                  You know the

16   record.   I don't.

17               MR. COLLINS:           My response, Your Honor, is

18   you will not find that when you look through the record.

19   The prosecutor -- and the PRP court stated the

20   prosecutor never argued that if the only knowledge was

21   some kind of a fight, that you could convict him,

22   because the defendants in this case testified that they

23   were going to go fight.          And you never had the

24   prosecutor saying:      This is an easy case; I win.               The

25   defendants have all testified that they were going to go


                                         54

 1   fight.   In for a dime, in for a dollar.                  If they were

 2   going to go fight, they're guilty.                   Never argued that.

 3               You will not find that in the transcript or

 4   in the materials, Justice Breyer.                  What you will find is

 5   the prosecutor consistently arguing they knew they were

 6   going to facilitate a homicide, a shooting, a murder.

 7   And given that this is a case brought under AEDPA and

 8   the question is whether the PRP court's decision is an

 9   unreasonable application of Federal law, I don't think

10   there's any doubt that it's not an unreasonable

11   application, and, therefore, this Court should reverse

12   the Ninth Circuit.

13               If there are no more questions.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

15               The case is submitted.

16               (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the
