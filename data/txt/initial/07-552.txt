 5   Company v. APCC Services, Inc.

 6   Mr. Phillips.

 7                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 8                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. PHILLIPS:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               Chief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent

12   below that there are assignments and there are

13   assignments, and that's essentially going to be the

14   theme of my presentation this morning.                   It is I think

15   common ground between the parties in this litigation

16   that if you have an assignment which represents the

17   grant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy,

18   that is the complete assignment of the chosen action,

19   then under those circumstances there's no question that

20   the assignee has standing under Article III.

21               By parity of receiving, if all that the

22   assignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere

23   collection agency role, under those circumstances I

24   think it's common ground between the parties that

25   Article III is not satisfied.              Two of the data points


                                         3
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   come from --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Say it again?        What is the

 3   common ground?

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:         I think the second part of

 5   the common ground is that if all that the assignee

 6   receives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as

 7   the lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances

 8   the assignee doesn't -- cannot -- has no common stake

 9   than I or my clients do in these particular cases, any

10   more than I do in my client's interest in these

11   particular cases, and there I don't think anybody

12   disputes that Article III is not satisfied.

13                Now, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of

14   identified two additional data points.                  First of all, it

15   made clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached

16   to anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for

17   the same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient,

18   because that's not tied to the particular right at stake

19   and therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the

20   satisfied.

21                The second half of it is, though, that if

22   that bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights

23   and even if that's a partial assignment of the rights,

24   then there is Article III jurisdiction under those

25   circumstances.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that if these

 2   contracts provided that the aggregators will turn over

 3   all of the proceeds of the litigation except for one

 4   penny, then you'd be satisfied?

 5                  MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I'm not sure I'd be

 6   satisfied.     I think there's a different -- I think the

 7   answer is that might satisfy Article III.                    The only

 8   reason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that

 9   ought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer

10   standing cases seems to recognize that there are

11   situations where there is a sufficiently de minimis

12   amount of at stake that under those circumstances

13   Article III won't be satisfied.                But clearly the

14   cleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you

15   no stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what

16   Article III would ultimately do.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well then, this is not

18   really a very significant case, is it?                    Because I

19   presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims

20   and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply

21   get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat

22   fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of

23   the rewards.    So it's no big deal, I mean, really.

24                MR. PHILLIPS:           But it is a big deal, not

25   necessarily because of the importance of the article.                   I


                                          5
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   think the Article III part of it is still a big deal.                   I

 2   think requiring as a separation of powers matter that

 3   there has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing

 4   the litigation, that's an important principle and the

 5   Court shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in

 6   this case.

 7                But more fundamentally in terms of the

 8   importance of the underlying process, remember here

 9   we're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400

10   different assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones.

11   And that's the problem, is that when you break this down

12   and you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article

13   III in its prudential standing concerns, then what you

14   end up with is this mass tort litigation.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it would be just the

16   same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was

17   that the aggregator gets a piece of the action?               Let's

18   take out the de minimis one cent.                A significant stake,

19   like the qui tam plaintiff has.              So you would have the

20   same problems that you're complaining about with regard

21   to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem

22   with respect to counterclaim.

23                That's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice

24   Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just

25   by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a


                                        6

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the

 2   prudential objections that you are making here would

 3   apply just as well.

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, and I would -- I would

 5   still assert those same prudential objections in the

 6   hypothetical you pose.       What I'm saying is when you --

 7   when you have an assignment and there is a bounty built

 8   into it, however you want to define the bounty, whether

 9   it's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever,

10   that may satisfy Article III.             I understand that.         That

11   does not answer the question of whether there's

12   prudential standing under those circumstances.                    In that

13   --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Go ahead, I'm sorry.

15                MR. PHILLIPS:         In that context, Justice

16   Ginsburg, you do have the problems.                     You don't get the

17   discovery.   You don't get to use the efficiency of the

18   counterclaim process, and there are serious questions

19   about whether or not there are res judicata and

20   collateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that

21   context that there's a very significant claim that those

22   proceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal

23   court as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article

24   III.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           What if all of the

 1   claimants assign their claims to something called an

 2   agglomeration trust and the -- the person who's bringing

 3   suit here brings it as a trustee?                  He has no interest in

 4   it personally and he is compensated the same way, the

 5   same way this agglomerator is compensated.                 He has no

 6   personal interest.      He could sue, couldn't he?

 7                MR. PHILLIPS:           I mean, there is a long

 8   tradition of allowing trustees to bring litigation on

 9   behalf of the trust because that's the only way that a

10   trust can in fact enforce its rights.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So once again, it's no big

12   deal.   I mean --

13                MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, it is a big deal,

14   because trust relationships carry all kinds of

15   additional legal consequences.                What is particularly

16   offensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that

17   the assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to

18   bring mass tort litigation with none of the

19   responsibilities.

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:             He would do the same thing

21   in Justice Scalia's if it were an irrevocable trust.

22   The trust could do exactly what the aggregator is doing

23   here.

24                MR. PHILLIPS:           That's true, but there are

25   additional trust responsibilities that would attach to


                                          8

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that process.   There's an entire legal regime to deal

 2   with that.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:             -- that might protect those

 4   who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't

 5   offhand see what difference it would make, what

 6   difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis

 7   you and your client.

 8                MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, again, Justice Souter,

 9   I think the answer probably is going to depend on how

10   the Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine.

11   Again, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III

12   matter, because I think it's one of those long-held

13   traditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation

14   on behalf of the trust and that's understood.

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But the real issue is not

16   whether the trustee can sue.              The real issue is whether

17   the trust can sue.

18                MR. PHILLIPS:           Right.        I mean, that's where

19   the claims are, sure.

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:             It seems to me in his

21   example if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator

22   sue?   And your answer was, well, trustees have certain

23   responsibilities.     But I don't see that those

24   responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or

25   to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings.

1    So I don't see how it would differentiate it.

2                   MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, there are two

3    differentiations.     One is that there is this entire

4    legal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed

5    the courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to

6    be comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a

7    particular way.

8                   But second of all and the second answer to

9    your first question is the prudential concerns remain

10   just, potentially just as serious.                   I think the question

11   is do you want to create litigation devices that allow

12   the courts to avoid -- to allow lower courts or, more to

13   the point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements

14   either of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the

15   associational standing doctrine.                 Those are doctrines

16   that are designed to limit mass tort litigation in

17   particularized circumstances --

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:              You mentioned discovery.

19   I don't see why you can't get discovery against this

20   whole bunch of people.

21               MR. PHILLIPS:            Because they're not a party

22   to the litigation.      I mean, you can get discovery --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Subpoenas out there and

24   depositions.

25               MR. PHILLIPS:            But, Justice Stevens, if you

1    sue me, you hail me into court, you put me to the

2    burdens of being a defendant in litigation, the least I

3    ought to get out of that is that I can turn to you and

4    ask you to admit certain facts, I can turn to you and

5    ask you to answer certain interrogatories, and I don't

6    have to go chasing you down, because you've already

7    submitted yourself to the personal jurisdiction of that

8    court.

9                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Of course, in this

10   particular situation you can do the same thing.              You can

11   file requests for admissions or serve interrogatories.

12   I don't understand why you can't do that.

13               MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I can serve them on the

14   aggregator, but I cannot serve them on the party who in

15   fact has the relevant information that I need.            I have

16   to use third party subpoena power.

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I would assume the

18   aggregators have the relevant information.

19               MR. PHILLIPS:          I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I would assume the

21   aggregator would have the relevant information.

22               MR. PHILLIPS:          In some instances it might or

23   it might not.   The problem is the aggregator has got to

24   get the information.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But they have to -- they


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    have the burden of proof in the case and I assume they

2    have to investigate the facts and be prepared for

3    trial.

4                MR. PHILLIPS:           And that would help on the

5    affirmative case that they have to put together, but it

6    doesn't help with respect to the counterclaims.             The

7    Qwest amicus brief does a very nice job of explaining

8    that there are a lot of situations where the -- where

9    the payphone operators are overpaid and it's very

10   difficult -- first of all, and the aggregator has no

11   idea or any incentive to find out any of that, any of

12   that information.    And when Qwest made the requests of

13   the aggregator saying, provide me with the information,

14   the brief quotes in a variety of places comments such

15   as, you know, "whatever the -- our aggregator says is

16   fine with us," or "I don't care about those claims," or

17   answers like that, which, if I sue you -- I mean, if you

18   sue me and I ask for those, you cannot give me back

19   those answers.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you can make that same

21   answer if it's just a standard assignee for collection

22   of -- of a debt for single person.

23               MR. PHILLIPS:           Right, but if it's a simple

24   assignee for a debt and nothing more than that, just a

25   power of attorney -- or are you talking about a full

1    assignment?

2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, no.         It's a full

3    assignment, where everybody agrees that there's

4    standing.

5                  MR. PHILLIPS:         But in no circumstance --

6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You can make the same

7    argument:    Oh, he might not have all the information.

8                  MR. PHILLIPS:         Right, but at least there he

9    is also responsible for both -- he has the entirety of

10   the right.    He has the right and the remedy.                 So that

11   whatever counterclaims you have operate directly against

12   that particular individual.

13                 But even in that context, Justice Kennedy,

14   it seems to me there's a fundamental difference, as a

15   matter of prudence, between dealing with a single

16   assignee back and forth and the disputes that arise

17   there and the difficulty of discovery that would exist

18   there, and the situation we have here where you have

19   1400 payphone operators --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You have a discovery be

21   problem.    I don't see that it's a standing problem.                  And

22   two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a

23   financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going

24   to have to collect them as receivables and there may be

25   50,000.    That could have the same kind of practical


                                        13

1    problems.    Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may

2    or may not be aware of where somebody went around and

3    had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered

4    a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth

5    about $10.   Nobody figured a way out of that.              They had

6    to pass a special statute.

7                 There was -- and so it seems to me you're

8    better off than the cabbage people because have you two

9    possible remedies:      One on discovery; you could ask the

10   judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission

11   thinks.   It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.

12                MR. PHILLIPS:           But, Justice --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:             Or you could go to the FCC

14   and you say, FCC, you got us into this.

15                Now, you have some rules here that make some

16   sense in terms of collection.               You have both those

17   agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage

18   people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem.                 Now,

19   what's your response to that?

20                MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, there are two elements

21   of the standing problem:           The first one is we're all --

22   let's be clear -- we're talking about a hypothetical

23   that's different from this case because we're talking

24   about a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a

25   concrete interest in the outcome of this dispute.                 Here


                                         14
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    the assignee has no interest in the outcome of this

2    dispute.   So the Article III problem arises there.

3                 The question is if you have a minor amount

4    at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but

5    nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you

6    nevertheless entertain that case.                And I think the

7    answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead

8    of making this into a Federal court case, where you have

9    1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that

10   the better course to follow is in fact for the

11   plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an

12   aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right

13   institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the

14   limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the

15   limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its

16   ability to provide complete relief.

17               And, indeed, if you read the Respondents'

18   brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in

19   which this entire system worked effectively, a claim

20   that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal

21   Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated

22   in front of the Federal court.              So, to my mind, the

23   right answer to this case is to take these cases all to

24   the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary

25   jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do


                                       15

1    because they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the

2    Federal courts.

3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But --

4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           What do you do about --

5    about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of

6    Federal regulation?      They're just sort of out of luck?

7    Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they

8    can take their claims to?           I mean, this is a fluke that

9    there happens to be this Federal agency they could have

10   gone to.    Certainly our principles of standing should

11   not depend upon that fluke, should it?

12                MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I think when the Court

13   is considering the questions of prudence, you know, it

14   can certainly take it into account, and maybe that would

15   argue in the alternative in another case if there

16   weren't such an available vehicle that the Court might

17   be more inclined to entertain it under those

18   circumstances.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Would there be review?

20   The FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III

21   barriers.   So the FCC decides one way or another.             One

22   party ends up losing.       Is there review in Federal court?

23                MR. PHILLIPS:          I mean, Justice Ginsburg,

24   that is Spiller.   That's what the Court said in Spiller,

25   and I think it's a logical outgrowth of what the Court


                                        16
                           Alderson Reporting Company

1    held in ASARCO, which is that, even though a claim

2    doesn't start with Article III jurisdiction because it's

3    not an Article III entity, that when a final

4    determination comes out of that entity that is in fact

5    enforceable as a right that that right is enforceable

6    consistent with Article III notions.                     And that's true.

7    That is what the Court essentially, without dealing with

8    Article III at all, said in Spiller, and that's clearly

9    what the Court held in ASARCO.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What is the advantage?

11   You have proposed the FCC route.                That obviously wasn't

12   taken here.   What is the advantage of going to Federal

13   court on claims like this?

14                 MR. PHILLIPS:         From my perspective or from

15   the plaintiffs' perspective.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why would the plaintiff

17   make such a choice if the agency --

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Because the -- the plaintiffs

19   here, the payphone operators, get a free pass in this

20   proceeding.   They get all of the benefits of being able

21   to go to Federal court and bring litigation with none of

22   the burdens of having to deal with discovery or

23   cross-claims or counterclaims or even necessarily being

24   bound by doctrines of res judicata and collateral

25   estoppel.   So you get all the benefits and none of the

1    disadvantages.    That's why it's an advantage for them to

2    go to Federal court.

3                  JUSTICE BREYER:            How is that different?

4                  MR. PHILLIPS:          When --

5                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Just on that very point --

6    I need clarification on this.               How is that different

7    than the case of the financer who takes accounts

8    receivable, which is very common?                  You finance the

9    accounts.     You take a secured interest in accounts

10   receivable.

11                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And there you might

13   foreclose on the secured interests.                       Then you as the

14   financer have to collect from everybody.                       How is your

15   case different from that?

16                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I don't know --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            In the respect you were

18   just talking about.

19                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.        Well, I mean, the

20   real question is I don't know why that case is

21   necessarily in Federal court either.                       I mean, a lot of

22   that --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I know, but I mean, there

24   may be many reasons for that.               I'm just saying it's a

25   normal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking

1    community.   I don't know.

2                 MR. PHILLIPS:           Right, but most of that's

3    litigated in State courts, in which case there's no

4    serious problem --

5                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Go back to my question, I'd

6    like to get an answer to it.

7                 MR. PHILLIPS:           Certainly.

8                 JUSTICE BREYER:             In respect to the problem

9    you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of

10   counterclaims or those problems, is this case any

11   different than the financing case I just mentioned?

12                MR. PHILLIPS:           No, I don't think so.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:             No.

14                MR. PHILLIPS:           I think those exact problems

15   would arise in that context as well.                      On the other hand,

16   that's a situation that seems to me is largely driven by

17   the exigencies and by accident in Federal court.                     This

18   is situation that is driven into Federal court by the

19   plaintiffs' choice and by the ability and the preference

20   to be in a position to get the benefits of litigation in

21   Federal court without any of the detriments that might

22   otherwise arise in that context.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Could you explain that?

24   That really goes back to your answer in Justice

25   Ginsburg's question and I'm not getting it.                     She said


                                         19

1    why would you go to the Federal court if you can you go

2    to the FCC, and you said, well, you get the benefits of

3    being in Federal court.        What -- I should be asking

4    other counsel this question, but as you understand it

5    what is the benefit of being in the Federal court rather

6    than the FCC that makes this so attractive?

7                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I guess I would encourage you

8    to ask counsel on the other side, because personally I

9    would think that they would have a full and fair remedy

10   --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So you don't know of any

12   benefits?

13                MR. PHILLIPS:         I'm sorry?

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:           You don't know of any

15   benefits?

16                MR. PHILLIPS:         I don't know -- well, other

17   than the ones I've already articulated, where I think

18   they get some advantages of being in a Federal court and

19   have --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, you eliminate step

21   one.   I mean, you go to the FCC, you win there, then

22   you've got to face an appeal before the Federal courts.

23   Why not go right to the Federal courts immediately?            You

24   eliminate one level of litigation.

25                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, and that may well be

1    his answer.

2                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, I'd like you to go

3    back to the question that Justice Stevens, Justice

4    Breyer, and I asked you.          You said, oh, there's a

5    problem, there's no counterclaim, we can't get the

6    information.    And we say, well, that happens in every

7    accounts receivable assignment; there's no problem

8    there.   And then you say, well, that should be in State

9    court.   That's not right.

10                 I thought it was agreed, stipulated by you

11   at the outset, that if there's a standard assignment for

12   collection you can be in the Federal court; there is

13   standing.

14                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right, there is Article III.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And Article III.

16                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.        And let's not lose

17   sight of that core question --

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           If you're saying, if you're

19   saying that it's the aggregation that makes it difficult

20   to reach everybody, well, that's a question of

21   discovery, and it's still the aggregator's

22   responsibility.    If the aggregator can't answer

23   necessary questions for discovery of the suit, the

24   suit's dismissed.

25                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, that may or may not


                                        21
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    have happen.   But let's be clear, okay.                The core

2    question here is whether or not an aggregator who has no

3    claim, who has no stake at all, not a penny's worth, can

4    pursue this litigation.        On that it seems to me the

5    answer got -- should be no.            There's no benefit to it.

6    The concrete stake is a core requirement of Article III

7    and the Court ought to enforce it as a separation of

8    powers question.

9                The issue that we've been discussing here is

10   what do you do when you get past that, and when you have

11   a kind of a bounty that's been attached to it, and how

12   do you resolve that?      In that situation, which is not

13   this case, I still think that there would be grounds for

14   prudential standing to serve as a basis to eliminate

15   this kind of litigation.         On the other hand, it may well

16   --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you said --

18               MR. PHILLIPS:          I am sorry, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You said the aggregator

20   had -- that the aggregator could sue on behalf of these

21   1400 plaintiffs naming every one of them as a named

22   plaintiff in this complaint and still the aggregator

23   would run the show because they each authorized the

24   aggregator to conduct the litigation.

25               MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.

1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Now, it seems to me that

2    it's not very prudential to require that there be 1400

3    named plaintiffs instead of one.

4                  MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I mean, the price you

5    pay -- bless you -- is that when you bring Federal court

6    litigation -- is that you have to have -- you have to

7    expose yourself to exactly the burdens that come with

8    it.

9                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           You also pay a price.      I

10   thought that's what you were going to get at.                 Talking

11   about prudential standing, 1400 filing fees is pretty

12   prudential.

13                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.        Federal courts

14   clearly have an interest in that.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought your

16   position was they could all join in one complaint just

17   as long as they're all named separately.

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:         They can join in a single

19   complaint.    You know, the court can consider whether or

20   not it thinks joinder is appropriate under those

21   circumstances, but they could unquestionably do that.

22   But then, again, they are then at that point a plaintiff

23   in the litigation having brought this action and,

24   therefore, subject to all of the burdens of being a

25   plaintiff in the litigation, including submitting


                                        23

1    themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the court.

2                I mean, let's be clear about this.                     There

3    are 1400 names out of people all over the country that

4    under the -- under the plaintiffs aggregators' theory we

5    have to go chase down in order to obtain discovery, to

6    obtain any of our counterclaims or anything like that.

7    Whereas if they come into this Court and they submit

8    themselves to the jurisdiction, at least the process

9    works as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I don't like to be

11   the broken record.      I'm just not getting -- I don't see

12   why that isn't the responsibility of the plaintiff.                    The

13   district court said, now, you've brought these claims.

14   The defendants need this information.                     You go get that.

15   That's your responsibility.

16               MR. PHILLIPS:            Well, I don't doubt that the

17   trial court can do that, but the question is:                    Why do we

18   have to go to the burden of having to chase all of that

19   in the first instance?

20               I mean, the Respondent's brief at page 10

21   criticizes us for not having brought 1400 third-party

22   complaints, not having sought additional discovery.                    All

23   of those are burdens that simply arise in this context

24   that otherwise do not exist in an ordinary case where

25   you simply ask the party who has the actual claim to be

1    the plaintiff in front of the court.

2                And that's -- and, again, just to be clear,

3    we are still here dealing with the hypothetical.                  We're

4    not dealing with the core question of what do you do

5    with a plaintiff who has not one penny at stake in

6    litigation that, as the lawyers describe, is all hard

7    cash.

8                JUSTICE SOUTER:              I'm sorry.       The only way,

9    it seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard

10   as a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that

11   in any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff,

12   the person who has got to provide that discovery, is

13   standing right there.

14               And I don't see how you can get the benefits

15   that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400

16   separate actions.     If you don't have 1400 separate

17   actions, whether you have an aggregation like this,

18   whether you have a joint action, whether you have a

19   class action, this problem of chasing down, as you

20   describe it, is going to be there.

21               So it seems to me the prudential question

22   for this Court is:      Do we really want to require 1400

23   separate actions so that you can have your perfect

24   paradigm of private litigation?                And to say, yes, we

25   want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch.                  What do

1    you say?

2                MR. PHILLIPS:           I think the answer to that is

3    that when you -- when you deal with mass tort

4    litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply

5    in that context as it applies in every other place.                     And

6    when the courts deviate from the standard paradigm for

7    litigation, they do it expressly, either through the

8    rules or through doctrines that already exist.

9                And so we have Rule 23, which sets out very

10   clear protections for both the courts -- or not only for

11   the courts, but for the plaintiffs and for the absent

12   defendants -- absent, absent plaintiffs and for the

13   defendants, and is a clear mechanism for conducting 1400

14   claims all once in a particular situation.

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:             What does that have to do

16   with -- I guess that goes to prudential standing.

17               MR. PHILLIPS:           It goes directly --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:             It has nothing to do with

19   Article III standing.

20               MR. PHILLIPS:           No, to be sure.          Again, I

21   don't think that -- I mean, the Article III debate here

22   seems to me to turn solely on the question of there is

23   no stake in the outcome of this case.                    That's a bedrock

24   requirement of Article III and ought to be a basis for

25   simply reversing.    But, you know, to the extent that the

1    Court then goes beyond that and worries about what's the

2    next case going to look like and what are the prudential

3    limitations, which I don't think the Court has to

4    resolve any of this, what I would suggest is the Court

5    should be informed by Rule 23 and associational standing

6    and those doctrines --

7                   JUSTICE SOUTER:           Are you saying, in effect,

8    that if we get to the prudential-standing point, the

9    answer is that in the absence of a rule comparable to

10   Rule 23 we should not recognize prudential standing, but

11   that if we adopted a rule that sort of regulated how

12   this would work, prudential standing would be

13   appropriate?    Is that basically it?

14                MR. PHILLIPS:           I think that's the right

15   answer, is that the Court shouldn't just make it up as

16   it goes along.    And if there is a need for this -- look,

17   and the truth is we've been here 200 years.               We haven't

18   had to have aggregator standing all of this time.              It

19   strikes me that there's no compelling need for a change

20   and that for that reason the Court ought to go back to

21   the paradigm example, plaintiffs sue defendants and you

22   have normal discovery and counterclaims.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is there any significance

24   to this being the -- this assignment transfers legal

25   title.   True, there's an obligation to pay, to pay the

1    separate PSPs.    But does anything turn on legal title?

2    For example, suppose the -- I gather the check would be

3    payable to the aggregator if the aggregator prevails.

4    Could a creditor of the aggregator come in and say,

5    stop, you owe me lots of money and I want to reach those

6    proceeds?

7                  MR. PHILLIPS:         That -- I mean the proceeds

8    -- I assume -- do those claims arise out of the

9    relationship between the payphone operators and the

10   aggregator?

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            No.

12                 MR. PHILLIPS:         It's completely unrelated to

13   that?   It's just a garnishment on it?

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            These are just the

15   creditors.    Or the aggregator goes bankrupt.

16                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I assume those moneys could

17   be taken out of the aggregator and then the PSP would

18   have a claim over against the aggregator for breach of

19   contract.

20                 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

1                   MR. ENGLERT:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

2    and may it please the Court:

3                   One of the last things Mr. Phillips said was

4    there's no need to change the law in this case and I

5    strongly agree with that.            Assignees for collection have

6    been litigating in Federal courts since at least the

7    19th century and there is not one decision cited in any

8    of the briefs in this case in which an assignee's

9    lawsuit was dismissed solely because of what the

10   assignee intended to do with the proceeds.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:             But also not one in which

12   the issue of standing was raised and decided.                 And our

13   jurisprudence says that where we do not address the

14   issue of standing the case has no precedential value on

15   the subject.

16                MR. ENGLERT:          Justice Scalia, a single

17   decision, a small body of decisions that don't address

18   the issue of standing, can be looked at in that way.

19   But a unanimous body of case law, two decisions from

20   this Court, arguably a third decision from this Court,

21   many decisions from lower courts --                       JUSTICE

22   SCALIA:   I don't consider two decisions an enormous

23   body.

24                MR. ENGLERT:          But there is an enormous body

25   in the lower courts under Rule 17.

1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, we don't count the

2    lower courts.

3                (Laughter.)

4                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Mr. Englert, with respect

5    to what weight we should give to those decisions, I just

6    want to put a simple hypo and I'll ask a question on it.

7    Assume that in this case the assignment -- well, assume

8    another case, rather, in which the assignment is

9    identical is identical to this one, except that the

10   terms of the second agreement, i.e., if I the aggregator

11   collect anything I give it to you.                Assume that is part

12   of the first agreement, so that there is an assignment

13   and as part of the assigning document there is a stated

14   obligation on the part of the assignee to pay all

15   proceeds to the assignor.

16               I am assuming that your position would be

17   the same; is that correct?

18               MR. ENGLERT:        Absolutely.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:           Now, my question is, you're

20   taking that position, I think, just as you did in

21   response to Justice Scalia, on the grounds that there is

22   a huge body of law that assignment for collection

23   conveys adequate standing.         But are any of the

24   assignment for collection cases in that body of law

25   clearly cases like the one in my hypothetical in which


                                      30

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    the assignment itself by its terms requires the total

2    payment of any benefit back to the assignor?

3                MR. ENGLERT:         Justice Souter, the cases

4    don't always discuss the way in which the assignment

5    arose.   But typically, in those cases they simply say,

6    there are these two promises, and they say the fact that

7    there is a second promise makes no difference.            That's

8    my position.   The fact that there's a second promise,

9    whether in the same document or in a different document,

10   makes no difference.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What's the earliest of

12   those cases in our Court?

13               MR. ENGLERT:         The earliest case --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            The earliest case in our

15   Court that upholds this that, without specifically

16   addressing the standing issue, gives judgment?

17               MR. ENGLERT:         The earliest case that gives

18   judgment is Spiller in 1920.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            1920?

20               MR. ENGLERT:         Yes.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            In Vermont Agency, in the

22   Vermont Agency case, which dealt with qui tam, that many

23   people, including the Justice Department, thought did

24   not confer Article III standing, we held to the contrary

25   that it did confer Article III standing, mainly because


                                       31

1    it had been around forever.           It was -- it was the

2    understood part of the judicial power when the

3    Constitution was adopted.

4                Do you have any case prior to 1920 in which

5    English courts or even early American courts thought

6    that this, that this would be sufficient to bring a

7    lawsuit?

8                MR. ENGLERT:        Well, assignee standing, not

9    assignee for collection standing but assignee standing,

10   is referred to in Blackstone's Commentaries

11   contemporaneously with the Constitution.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Sure, but --

13               MR. ENGLERT:        This wrinkle of arguing --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's more than a wrinkle.

15   The assignee keeps the money.

16               MR. ENGLERT:        But the wrinkle of arguing

17   that that makes a difference as far as I know first

18   arose in the 19th century.         And every single case and

19   every single Federal court that has considered the

20   question under any body of law has rejected the

21   argument.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:           What's the earliest Federal

23   court case you have?

24               MR. ENGLERT:        Late 18th -- late 19th

25   century.

2                  MR. ENGLERT:         Yes.

3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We're not under any

4    body of law.    I didn't see any cases cited after we had

5    more carefully explicated our understanding of Article

6    III.     What's the latest case from this Court that you've

7    got?

8                  MR. ENGLERT:         Well, as you know, I argue

9    that the Vermont Agency case strongly supports us.                  But

10   if you want a case specifically about assigning

11   collection, then the latest case I have is Titus in

12   1939.

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, aren't Titus and

14   Spiller different in that there the assignee is suing on

15   a judgment that was obtained in a forum where Article

16   III didn't apply?

17                 MR. ENGLERT:         No, absolutely not, Justice

18   Alito.

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Why isn't that irrelevant?

20                 MR. ENGLERT:         Because for the exact reason

21   Mr. Phillips gave you.         The ASARCO case and Coleman v.

22   Miller, Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion, and a

23   number of other cases stand for the proposition that a

24   party who invokes the jurisdiction of this Court or of

25   any other Federal court must satisfy Article III.                  So

1    when Spiller, the secretary of the Cattleman's

2    Association, went to the Federal district court seeking

3    enforcement of the reparations award he had gotten

4    before the ICC, he had to satisfy Article III.

5                 When Titus came to this Court arguing that

6    the lower courts had not properly given full faith and

7    credit, he had to satisfy Article III.                  Each of those

8    parties invoking the jurisdiction of the Federal court

9    was someone who had to turn over 100 percent of the

10   proceeds to the assignors.          And in each case this Court

11   rejected the argument that he was not a proper

12   plaintiff.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, you say in

14   your brief that there is no reason for concern about the

15   absence of concrete adverseness.               But I would have

16   thought there was a great deal of reason for concern and

17   that your client doesn't care if he wins or loses.

18                MR. ENGLERT:        My client --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's all the same to

20   him.   If he wins, he doesn't get to keep the money; if

21   he loses, he loses.

22                MR. ENGLERT:        Well, that's -- that's false

23   in every possible respect, Your Honor.                  He does keep --

24   get to keep some of the money.              Now, we haven't proved

25   that in the lower court.         It's an allegation at this

1    point, but it happens to be true.               But aside from

2    that --

3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought the

4    question came to us on the assumption that he doesn't

5    retain any of the money.

6                MR. ENGLERT:        On the assumption, but not the

7    fact.

8                Second, my client's whole reason for

9    existence is to collect payphone compensation.                   This is

10   what my client does day in and day out.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But I thought our

12   cases made clear that that kind of -- -- I forget what

13   we call it -- it's a separate interest from the injury

14   that you're alleging in the lawsuit.                   You don't allege

15   in the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is

16   that you're in this line of work and if the work dries

17   up you're in big trouble.         That wouldn't be enough to

18   support Article III standing.

19               MR. ENGLERT:        No.      What's enough to support

20   Article III standing is the interest of the assignors,

21   as the Court held in Vermont Agency.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but then why

23   is the assignee bringing the lawsuit?

24               MR. ENGLERT:        The assignee --

1    independent injury.

2                 MR. ENGLERT:        The assignee is bringing the

3    lawsuit for the most pragmatic of all possible reasons.

4    Mr. Phillips wanted to talk a lot about discovery, and

5    Justice Kennedy and I believe Justice Souter asked why

6    is this lawsuit in Federal court instead of before the

7    FCC.   There are good answers to those questions.

8                 The discovery in Federal court, the

9    discovery available in Federal court, is more

10   appropriate to -- is more necessary in a large case, a

11   $200 million case like this one, than in a relatively

12   small case --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry, we got

14   off the track here.

15               MR. ENGLERT:         We did.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm trying to find

17   out what the assignee's injury is.

18               MR. ENGLERT:         The -- the assignee's

19   injury --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And how it's

21   redressed by the receipt of the money.

22               MR. ENGLERT:         It is, as this Court said in

23   Vermont Agency, the assignor's injury and it is

24   redressed by --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.   But you know,

1    Vermont Agency, obviously, the assignee recovers

2    something himself, that he gets to keep the bounty.

3    Here that's not the case.

4                MR. ENGLERT:          Here that's not the case, but

5    the reasoning of Vermont Agency specifically rejected

6    the proposition that the bounty was helpful to the

7    assignee's standing.       And there is not a word in Vermont

8    Agency that says when you combine the bounty with the

9    assignor's interest that's enough.                  It just says the

10   assignor's interest is enough, full stop, because of the

11   ancient doctrine.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought it said -- I

13   thought it said, Mr. Englert, that, that the United

14   States has -- is treated as having assigned part of its

15   claim for damages to the qui tam relator, and that gave

16   the qui tam plaintiff a stake in the action, a stake in

17   the proceeds.   I thought that Vermont Agency -- and

18   Justice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong -- was

19   envisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle

20   was talking about when he said there are assignments and

21   then there are assignments.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I was under the same

23   misimpression, I have to say, and I wrote it.

24               (Laughter.)

25               MR. ENGLERT:          The -- the assignment in this

1    case conveys all right, title and interest.               It conveys

2    it for purposes of collection to be sure, but it conveys

3    all right, title and interest.

4                   Now, the proposition that the "for purposes

5    of collection" purpose of an assignment negates the

6    ability of the plaintiffs to sue is one that has been

7    litigated many times in Federal courts, and that

8    argument has been rejected in every case in which it's

9    come up until now, including two from this Court.              So

10   between the fact that the reasoning of Vermont Agency,

11   whatever the facts were, relied on the interest of the

12   assignor, relied on the ancient doctrine that the

13   assignee for Article III purposes stands in the

14   assignor's shoes, and the fact that this argument has

15   been rejected in every case in which it's come up, I

16   think the case for Article III standing is quite strong

17   here.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I must say we seem to have

19   come full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that

20   the doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with

21   Article III.    That it all -- the only thing it's there

22   for is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our

23   adversary system depends.            You've come full circle from

24   that to now your argument that concrete adverseness

25   doesn't matter at all.

1                MR. ENGLERT:        Oh, Justice Scalia --

2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is there a combination of

3    the two that's possible, that maybe one of the elements

4    of Article III standing is that both parties have a

5    stake in winning and losing?

6                MR. ENGLERT:        There is tremendous concrete

7    adverseness in this case.         And both parties have a great

8    stake in winning and losing.           The -- the aggregator

9    doesn't get to keep the money, although actually it

10   does, but this case can be decided on the assumption,

11   subject to remand that it doesn't get to keep the money.

12   But it exists for the purpose of bringing -- of

13   obtaining redress from carriers obtaining payphone

14   compensation from carriers, usually outside the

15   litigation process.     But this is -- but this is what my

16   client does -- what my clients do.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The Sierra Club

18   protect -- undertakes activities to protect the

19   environment, but that doesn't give it standing in every

20   environmental case to sue.         It needs to show members

21   what the concrete interest and so on.                  The fact that

22   your client is in the business of suing on behalf of

23   payphone operators --

24               MR. ENGLERT:        My client is not in the

25   business of suing on the business of payphone operators.

2    outside the litigation process.              This is merely an

3    extension of the day-to-day operation.

4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you tell me is this

5    1,400 causes of action or is it one?

6                MR. ENGLERT:         One.

7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            How does that come about?

8    Suppose a lot of people owe the bank -- a lot of farmers

9    owe the bank money, can there be assignment in this one

10   cause of action?

11               MR. ENGLERT:         Sure.       And let me give you

12   one --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And how does the law

14   express the metaphysical process in which 1,400 causes

15   of action become one cause of action?

16               MR. ENGLERT:         Well, they are all assigned to

17   one entity that brings the cause of action just as a

18   trustee brings causes of action --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, there is not a

20   representative cause of action.              What is the magic point

21   at which it becomes one cause of action?

22               MR. ENGLERT:         The point at which they are

23   all assigned to one entity that then brings the cause of

24   action, and importantly, has authority to settle the

25   cause of action without any further permission from the

1    clients.   The -- a very, very important protection here

2    for Mr. Phillips --

3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm still missing

4    something here.    Can you give me an example of where

5    this has happened in other cases that this Court has

6    heard that are commonly heard?

7                 MR. ENGLERT:         Every Rule 23 class action,

8    every associational standing case, every trustee action.

9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I interrupted you and I

10   talked over you.   Every Rule 23 cause of action and what

11   else?

12               MR. ENGLERT:          Every associational standing

13   case, every action brought by a trustee.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, associational

15   standing, Sierra Club v. Morton, they are interested in

16   an ongoing injury in which there is a common -- in which

17   there is a common injury.           These are liquidated amounts.

18               MR. ENGLERT:          But that's not uncommon, Your

19   Honor.   Justice Souter's opinion for the Court in United

20   Food and Commercial Workers v. Brown reported a Seventh

21   Circuit case that said representative damages litigation

22   is common from class actions under Rule 23 to suits by

23   trustees representing hundreds of creditors in

24   bankruptcy, to parent patriot actions by State

25   governments to litigation by and against executors at

1    decedent's estates.       This is something that happens

2    every day in Federal court.

3                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Those are usually ongoing

4    injuries as to which there's a common interest in

5    stopping the injury.        Here you're aggregating liquidated

6    amounts.

7                   MR. ENGLERT:        It's actually not entirely

8    liquidated amounts.       There are ongoing disputes about

9    ongoing payphone compensation.                But I don't think it

10   would make any difference even if that weren't true.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I might understand it if

12   was some sort of injunction actions -- in the future

13   please pay what you're supposed to pay.

14               MR. ENGLERT:           No.      But, Justice Kennedy,

15   consider the typical Rule 23 damages action, which is

16   about amounts due in the ordinary case.                   You have one

17   cause of action on behalf of the class instead of many

18   causes of action on behalf of many people.                   It happens

19   all the time.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But that's allowed because

21   the requisites for class actions have been met and

22   that's authorized by the rule.                That's not true here.

23               MR. ENGLERT:           Because we have something much

24   better here.    What we have here, Justice Kennedy, is

25   assignments of the cause of actions by every plaintiff

1    to my clients completely --

2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           There are a lot of better

3    procedures that are in the rules but it is not in the

4    rule.

5                  MR. ENGLERT:        Actually there is.       Rule 17

6    was put in the rules.       And if you read the works of

7    Judge Charles Park, you will see that Rule 17 was put in

8    the rules to authorize justice kind of action to be

9    brought in the name of assignees, including asignees for

10   collection.   And one year after he joined the Federal --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask a fact question?

12   I'm just a little puzzled here.               I probably should have

13   asked Mr. Phillips.      But what issues in fact are there

14   going to be in this case?           It seems to me everything

15   ought to be on computer somewhere, and it's just a

16   matter of pushing the right button and you know how much

17   money you owe.   Am I missing something?

18                 MR. ENGLERT:        You're not missing something,

19   Justice Stevens.   That's what this case is about, is

20   computer records, massive computer records in possession

21   of the carriers and some tools the aggregators have to

22   analyze computer records.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Except for counterclaims.

24   He says I have some counterclaims.

25                 MR. ENGLERT:        He says he has some

1    counterclaims, but in nine years of litigation his

2    clients have never used Rule 19; they have never used

3    Rule 22; they have never made any effort -- he says we

4    have asserted they have to go out and bring 1,400

5    separate lawsuits.      What we said on page 10 of our brief

6    was they have never tried in nine years of of litigation

7    to use --

8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, what did they do?

9    I mean, you mention necessary parties but these other --

10   on your own theory the PSPs are not necessary parties,

11   and this -- this is a defendant seeking to join

12   additional plaintiffs, and that's rather odd.               And you

13   also talk about interpleader.               I don't know who is the

14   stakeholder in this picture.

15                 MR. ENGLERT:         Well, Your Honor, my point is

16   that there are many procedural devices available to deal

17   with many situations like this, Rule 19 and Rule 22 and

18   separate lawsuits.      If there were serious counterclaims

19   in this case, first of all as a factual matter, AT&T and

20   Sprint would know it from their own records and second,

21   they would have done something in nine years to try to

22   bring a claim against PSP, and they have done nothing in

23   nine years.   So this is a very, very odd case in which

24   to be worrying about whether they have lost some

25   counterclaim rights because the PSPs -- lost some


                                         44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    counterclaim rights because the PSPs aren't individual

2    parties.

3                It's also a very odd case in which to be

4    worrying about discovery rights because the PSPs aren't

5    individual parties because that issue was resolved in

6    their favor in 2000 by the special master's discovery

7    order saying, just as Justice Stevens postulated, the

8    aggregator to go out and get the information from the

9    PSPs.

10               Now they complained that some of the PSPs,

11   some of these mom and pop operations, said we don't have

12   any information.   That's because for the most part the

13   PSP don't have any information.              The information resides

14   with the carriers and with the aggregators.             So as a

15   purely practical, pragmatic matter this is not the case

16   in which to be worrying that some discovery rights have

17   been lost; this is not the case in which to be worrying

18   in which some counterclaim rights have been lost; this

19   is not the case in which to be worrying that my clients

20   aren't' bound.   Every single -- I'm sorry, that the PSPs

21   aren't bound, the assignors aren't bound, because every

22   single one of them has signed an agreement, or two

23   agreements, really, saying they will be bound.             What

24   this comes down to is a series of abstractions put up

25   against the tradition of allowing lawsuits by assignee

1    for collection.

2                   JUSTICE BREYER:           Well I guess it could be

3    that you're asking them to go back into records that are

4    somewhat old.    What you're asking to find out is -- is

5    every call made out of a payphone that was long distance

6    call, and we don't even know who actually turned out to

7    be the carrier.    It's like asking them, tell us exactly

8    on the payphone at that corner over there who was called

9    at 9:15 a.m. to some number in 1987, and maybe they

10   should have records of that but they don't.                     They have

11   estimates --

12               MR. ENGLERT:           No, they do.            There is no --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              They say maybe the time

14   necessary to go through those records, to figure out

15   whether you should give 12 cents to the person who ran

16   that payphone, is really not worth it.

17               MR. ENGLERT:           Well --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              And therefore, if they are

19   right in some claim like that, is there a way to get

20   this worked out at the FCC?              I mean, it -- it -- I don't

21   think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent

22   claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under

23   some set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to

24   get the discovery that this just won't be worth it.

25               Now that might be right.                      And if it is right

1    or whether it's right, can the FCC work this out?

2                MR. ENGLERT:           Your Honor, several points if

3    I may.   47 U.S.C. in section 276 says that payphone

4    service providers are to be compensated for each and

5    every payphone call.        So it was Congress's purpose to

6    make any 24 cent call compensable, and the FCC set up a

7    very elaborate system to make them keep records.

8                JUSTICE BREYER:              I'm aware of that system.

9    I'm aware of that.

10               MR. ENGLERT:           Well, as -- and there is about

11   $200 million at stake in this case so this is not about

12   each 24-cent payphone call individually.                      This is a

13   properly advocated case.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:              Right.           But my question is

15   to get to that figure there may be billions of calls,

16   for all I know.

17               MR. ENGLERT:           There are.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              And it could be quite

19   expensive to track down each of those calls

20   individually.   I don't know if it is or not; but if it

21   is, is there a way to get this problem worked out at the

22   FCC or do we have the cabbage case grown large?

23               MR. ENGLERT:           Your Honor, my client has

24   brought scores of these actions -- my clients have

25   brought scores of these actions, some before the FCC,

1    the largest ones -- and this is the largest one of

2    all -- in Federal court to get the advantage of the

3    discovery processes in Federal court.                     Most of these

4    cases settle.     These cases as Justice Stevens pointed

5    out are about analyzing computer records, and you can

6    fight to the death or you can say let's figure out who

7    owes whom what and let's settle; and most of the cases

8    settle.    There is no reason why there should be any more

9    or less incentive to settle when the case is before the

10   FCC than when it's before a Federal court.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:             In settlement they may work

12   out.   But if it is -- for example costs a dollar to

13   fight a claim that's worth 12 cents, individually,

14   before you get to billions, they don't want to be in

15   that situation where they are really paying money for

16   nothing; because in their opinion they already paid.

17                I mean we understand this kind of problem.

18   So I go back to my question.              They have one view of it;

19   you have another of what's going on here.                    And their

20   view is very unfavorable to your clients and your

21   clients' view is very unfavorable to their clients.                       So

22   I would like to know is there a way to get this worked

23   out at the FCC?    Maybe that will turn out not to be

24   relevant in this case but I'd still like to know your

25   opinion.

1                MR. ENGLERT:          Well, this case was brought in

2    Federal court under a statute that permits the

3    plaintiffs to choose whether to go to Federal Supreme

4    Court or the FCC.    The reason it's nine years old is not

5    because we didn't sue immediately; it's because we've

6    been litigating for nine years about our right to

7    litigate.

8                Does the FCC have a useful role to play in

9    this process at this point?             Never say never, but I

10   don't see one.   The case was brought in Federal court

11   under a doctrine that has always allowed assignees for

12   collection to sue in Federal court, and there is no

13   reason I can think of why it shouldn't proceed in

14   Federal court.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Englert, is this one

16   lawsuit or 1,400 lawsuits, or however many clients you

17   have?

18               MR. ENGLERT:          It's one lawsuit.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             How can it be -- how is it

20   one lawsuit when there are, I mean, just a lot of

21   different individual claims?             You think you could have

22   brought this as a class action?

23               MR. ENGLERT:          We, after Judge Sentelle

24   dismissed this case, we moved to the alternative to

25   amend our complaint to add either 1,400 individual

1    plaintiffs or a class action.             The plaintiffs opposed

2    that, and then she reversed herself on --

3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           They opposed it on what

4    seems to be a reasonable ground, that each of these

5    claims is quite different.          There are different calls,

6    different -- different amounts owing.                   Each case is not

7    going to be judged on the same -- on the same facts.

8                 MR. ENGLERT:        That's really not true,

9    Justice Scalia.   Just it's a pure practical matter,

10   leaving aside theory, this is about analyzing computer

11   databases.   This is about analyzing call records.

12   Because of the system the FCC set up, none of the

13   information resides with the PSPs; it resides with the

14   aggregators and with the carriers.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you agree that this

16   could not have been brought as a class action?

17                MR. ENGLERT:        No, I disagree, Justice

18   Kennedy.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why didn't you bring it as

20   a class action?

21                MR. ENGLERT:        I'm sorry?

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then why didn't you bring

23   it as a class action?      We can all go home.

24                MR. ENGLERT:        Because it's so much better to

25   bring it on behalf of individuals who have expressly

1    consented to be bound, than on behalf of people who may

2    not even know about it and who may not have consented to

3    be bound and may not want to be bound as in the typical

4    class action.

5                  There are all sorts of problems with class

6    actions.    Class actions are typically brought by

7    enterprising law firms who may not ever have met their

8    clients.    This is a different litigation altogether.

9    This is litigation by a trade association that exists to

10   collect payphone compensation, doing the same thing it

11   always does, only doing it in court on behalf of 1,400

12   companies that each signed an agreement saying I want

13   you to go do this for me and I agree to be bound by the

14   result.    So I can get entitlement interest.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            Do you -- this is giving me

16   a thought here.   Just a total imaginary case, nothing to

17   do with your clients.       Put yourself in the opposite

18   position.   Suppose you were representing a defendant and

19   that defendant were asked by this imaginary plaintiff to

20   dig up records on the computer.               To dig up each

21   individual record costs $1, there were billions of such

22   records, and the value to you, to the other side, the

23   plaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call.

24   Okay?   So you say look, those people are asking us to

25   dig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a

1    dollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out

2    of it is 12 cents a call.            But of course we are the ones

3    who have to pay the dollar, and they get the 12 cents.

4    Now, is there a way for the legal system to solve that

5    problem?

6                   MR. ENGLERT:        Yes.

7                   JUSTICE BREYER:           Other than standing.

8                   MR. ENGLERT:        Push the parties to settle.

9    That's what rational economics --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, the defendant says --

11   now your client, I am not going to settle; there are no

12   such claims.    This is ridiculous but it's going to cost

13   me a dollar to prove it.

14               MR. ENGLERT:           Yeah, the client says millions

15   for defense, but not one cent -- one cent for tribute

16   and every lawyer gets happy, because the client wants to

17   litigate to the death instead of just surrendering to

18   extortion, in that kind of case they have to decide

19   whether the economically rational thing is to set a bad

20   precedent or is to settle.

21               That happens all the day for defense counsel

22   and I'm quite often defense counsel --

2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Speaking of one cent

3    for tribute, it's easy to get rid of this problem, isn't

4    it?

5                  MR. ENGLERT:         Prospectively.

6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why don't your

7    agreements just say you get to keep $10 out of every sum

8    that your recover?      Then we wouldn't have this problem.

9                  MR. ENGLERT:         I agree, and we made that

10   point in our brief in opposition to cert.                   This case is

11   of no practical significance going forward for the body

12   of the law.   There's nothing this Court is going to

13   decide in this case that's going to make a difference.

14   People will just draft their assignment and --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So why --

16                 MR. ENGLERT:         So my clients --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why doesn't the tie

18   go to Article III?      I mean if it makes no difference

19   either way I'd like to preserve significance of Article

20   III as a limit on court jurisdiction.

21                 MR. ENGLERT:         Article III is a proper and

22   important limit on court jurisdiction when it restricts

23   court jurisdiction.       When we have a traditional cause of

24   action, the abstractions that have come to be thought of

25   as Article III jurisprudence don't trump tradition.

1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but --

2                MR. ENGLERT:        What Article III --

3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, Article III

4    does trump tradition.     I mean, if it doesn't meet

5    Article III, no amount of tradition can save it.                    And

6    you several times refer, when asked one of these

7    questions, to the tradition and the old cases, but I

8    haven't heard an answer yet to the concrete injury that

9    is suffered by the aggregators.

10               MR. ENGLERT:        The -- on the assumption on

11   which this case comes to the Court, the aggregators'

12   injury is the assigned injury of the assignors.                    We are

13   taking the principle of Vermont Agency and saying that

14   applies just as much to assignees for collection as it

15   does to any other assignees.           Contrary to Mr. Phillips'

16   position and Judge Sentelle's position, that there are

17   assignments and then there are assignments, the law has

18   looked many times at the question whether there are

19   assignments and then there are assignments.                  The

20   argument that assignees for collection should be treated

21   differently has been made many times.                  It has never

22   prevailed in Federal court, unless and until it prevails

23   in this case.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The significance --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Englert, could you --

1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- to the legal title,

2    would it make a difference if the assignee did not have

3    legal title, was just --

4                  MR. ENGLERT:         Oh, it would make a huge

5    difference, Justice Ginsburg.

6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So -- but is that just a

7    formality?    For example, the question I asked

8    Mr. Phillips.    Could a creditor of the aggregator get at

9    this money when the check is paid by AT&T and Sprint and

10   therefore reduce the amount available to distribute to

11   the PSPCs?

12                 MR. ENGLERT:         Well, if we assume insolvency

13   and we assume a secured creditor, then, yes, I think the

14   PSPs are general unsecured creditors, and the secured

15   creditor is in line ahead of them.                   Different facts,

16   different results.      But, yes, it does make a difference

17   if the assignee enters insolvency, which is not going to

18   happen in this case, but if the assignee enters

19   insolvency and if there is a creditor that arguably

20   under insolvency principles has a higher claim than the

21   PSPs, yes, it does make a difference to the assignee.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about for tax

23   purposes?    Must the aggregator report the proceeds as

24   income?

25                 MR. ENGLERT:         Your Honor, I'm sorry.          I just


                                         55

1    don't know the answer to that question.                   I'm guessing

2    they either don't report them as income or they report

3    them as income, but then have a deduction in the exact

4    same amount.    But I really don't know the exact answer

5    to that.

6                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Englert, can you

7    explain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14

8    separate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against

9    the same defendant, just by your acquiring them they

10   sort of melt into one cause of action.                   How does that --

11   how does that happen?

12               MR. ENGLERT:          That happens the same way it

13   happens under Rule 23.        It happens the same way it

14   happens with the trustee who is representing people who

15   would otherwise have many different causes of action.

16   It's a very common thing in Federal court.                  If the -- if

17   a bankruptcy trustee or if a class representative brings

18   a lawsuit on behalf of many people, then there is one

19   cause of action instead of the many causes of action

20   there would be if those many people sued directly.                    It's

21   not an issue.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  In all of those

23   cases, the class action, the trustee, you know, the

24   named plaintiff, the named trustee has concrete injury

25   and redressability to themselves?

1                 MR. ENGLERT:         No more than my clients.

2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Very much more than

3    your clients.   The trustee has legal obligations that he

4    has to discharge.    If it's a suit that he has to bring

5    on behalf of the beneficiaries and doesn't do it, he is

6    sued for breach of trust.           In a class action case, the

7    representative has to have standing, has to show

8    concrete injury and redressability.                      Here we don't have

9    any of that.

10               MR. ENGLERT:          I respectfully disagree, Your

11   Honor.   My clients have legal obligations that they have

12   to discharge.   They are embodied in the very agreements

13   reproduced in the back of the red brief, that require us

14   to pursue this action and require us to turn over --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But why do we have Rule 23

16   that requires certification of a class action?                     If you

17   can say, well, I don't need Rule 23, I'm going to take

18   1400 claims and make them one any way.

19               MR. ENGLERT:          For very good reasons.             Rule

20   23 exists to protect absent plaintiffs, something we

21   don't have here, and to protect defendants so that they

22   will know there will be a res judicata effect of the

23   judgment, whether for them or against them, so that they

24   can't be sued by other class members.

25               They have those protections.                     In fact, if

1    you read the blue and yellow briefs in this case, they

2    keep referring in the abstract to the protections of

3    Rule 23, but they don't identify a single concrete

4    protection that they do not have under this system.

5    Rule 23 is inferior to an action by assignees for

6    collection in every imaginable way.                     It's not a superior

7    alternative.   And to say that the existence of Rule 23

8    means we should throw out a traditional form of action

9    that's been recognized for well over a century would be

10   a very surprising result.

20               The specific protection is that the courts

21   determine how the settlements will play out.                    They make

22   sure that all of the requirements of Rule 23 are

23   satisfied before the litigation goes forward.                    That

24   means that there is a demonstration of commonality, that

25   there -- the predominance issue is resolved, that this

1    is a matter that should be litigated in this forum

2    because it is a more efficient mechanism for litigating

3    it, not because the assignor -- assignee decided that

4    this is more efficient way from the assignee's

5    perspective --

6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And are problems --

7                  MR. PHILLIPS:         -- to litigate the issue.

8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are the requirements of

9    typicality and -- the same type of injury designed in

10   part to preserve the rights of the defendant?

11                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Yes, of course, because you

12   don't want to have all this litigation being heaped on a

13   particular defendant under these circumstances.              There

14   is an efficiency to this process that the rules

15   anticipate.   And I think you're absolutely right,

16   Justice Kennedy.   There is simply no reason in the world

17   to say we're going to allow this to be as a substitute

18   for existing doctrines under either Rule 23 --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But wouldn't you --

20                 MR. PHILLIPS:         -- or associational standing.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Suppose this had been

22   mounted as a class action.           I take it you would oppose

23   certification.

24                 MR. PHILLIPS:         To be sure, and my answer is

25   --

1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And one of the reasons

2    would be that these are all different situations,

3    different amounts involved in each case?                  Some -- you

4    would have a counterclaim, not others.                  I assume you

5    would say they're not a lot alike.                 Not at all alike.

6                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

7    We would oppose it.     I don't think that this is a proper

8    case for class certification.             But it seems to me that

9    that doesn't mean okay, and, therefore, the answer to

10   this is:   Come up with some other contrivance in order

11   to litigate this in a way that obviously maximizes the

12   convenience to one side without regard to the

13   protections that are designed both for the defendant and

14   for the court that's embodied in Rule 23.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Phillips, do you

16   attach any significance to the fact that every member of

17   the so-called class here has individually agreed to be

18   bound by the judgment?

19                MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, it's interesting

20   because they -- in one -- in the assignment part of it

21   they say they are bound, but on the -- on the separate

22   set of the agreement it talks about the reasonable

23   discretion of the assignor -- assignee.                 So the

24   agreement is, to my mind, inherently contradictory as to

25   what are the obligations.

1                  JUSTICE STEVENS:            Which -- the assignees,

2    but the assignors have agreed to be bound --

3                  MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, if it's reasonable --

4    it says reasonable discretion.                And so the question is,

5    you know, is this -- was that an exercise of reasonable

6    discretion?     And I don't know the answer to that in any

7    given case.

8                  And I think part of the -- Justice Kennedy

9    and Justice Breyer, you asked the question about above

10   and beyond discovery, what are the other problems that

11   arise when you go down this -- and the more -- the other

12   one is that being bound by the judgment.

13                 If you have a complete assignment of the

14   chosen action, the assignee, then, is completely bound.

15   There is nothing left.         The assignor has no rights left.

16   There is nothing left for the assignor to do in that

17   situation; whereas, in these kinds of situations where

18   the assignee receives the right to go forward but the

19   remedy is in another party's hands, the potential for

20   being bound is completely lost.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

22   Mr. Phillips.    The case is submitted.

23                 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the hearing in

24   the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
