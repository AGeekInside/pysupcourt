 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. KLAUSNER

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. KLAUSNER:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Retirement eligibility in Kentucky is based

12   on 20 years of service or age 55.                 Age is not the only

13   determinant.   And "age" is not a bad word.                  As Justice

14   White said in McMann v. United Airlines, all retirement

15   plans necessarily make distinctions based on age.

16               Here it is age or service.                   And the EEOC's

17   focus on age alone fails to appreciate that Kentucky is

18   an integrated, consolidated retirement plan with the

19   goal of providing benefits to all qualified workers.                      To

20   say, as the EEOC does, that all younger workers will

21   always fare better than all older workers is factually

22   wrong, and it fails to appreciate the myriad factors

23   that go into determining pension amounts.

24               It's not age alone that determines the

25   result.   Age is a factor.          It's not the factor.          The

 1   plan is not facially discriminatory, it's not arbitrary,

 2   and it doesn't violate --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             I guess the part that they

 4   are saying is arbitrary as I understand it, and I

 5   appreciate your correcting me if I don't understand it

 6   correctly, is that you get double your pension at 55 if

 7   you've worked 20 years as opposed to 10.               Is that right?

 8              MR. KLAUSNER:          No, Mr. Chief Justice --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:             A worker who has been

10   there, he's qualified, he has only worked for 10 years

11   and now he's 55 years old.         There is a chart in the SG's

12   brief, and as I read that chart, he got amount "X".                  He

13   started at 45, he ended up at 55, he gets "X".               If he

14   started at 35 and worked for 20 years, he would get much

15   more than "X".

16              MR. KLAUSNER:          If the EEOC's chart were --

17   correct, that would be true, Your Honor, limited only to

18   the amount of imputed service.             The person who began

19   younger in the example which Your Honor used would get

20   more imputed service.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:             You would get "Y", because

22   he worked for 20 years rather than 10; is that right?

23   I'm not talking about a disabled person.               I'm talking

24   about anybody.

25              MR. KLAUSNER:          No, Your Honor.        That's only


                                       4

 1   in the case of disability.           In a normal requirement

 2   setting, one works a number of years and you get two

 3   and-a-half percent of your salary for each year that you

 4   worked.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So if a person works for 20

 6   years, he gets more than if he worked for 10 years; is

 7   that right?

 8                 MR. KLAUSNER:         That's right.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Now he is disabled.    And

10   when he's disabled, if he's disabled after working only

11   10 and he is 45 years old, they pretend he had worked

12   the full 20?

13                 MR. KLAUSNER:         They impute -- yes, Your

14   Honor.    They impute the additional service to you.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Now I understand it.

16                 Now, this individual says, I was working

17   there after the age of 55, I only worked for 14 years,

18   now I become disabled.        If I become disabled before I

19   was 55, let's say I had six years to go, they would give

20   me six years extra.      But because I was disabled after

21   I'm 55, I get nothing extra.              Nothing is imputed.   Is

22   that right?

23                 MR. KLAUSNER:         It's only partially right,

24   Mr. Justice.    Justice Breyer, the reason that you get

25   additional before age 55 is the same as the reason why


                                         5

 1   you get extra before you reach 20 years.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             I didn't ask you for the

 3   reasons.   I want to know if I'm factually right.

 4               MR. KLAUSNER:          Your only partially --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             Where am I factually wrong?

 6               MR. KLAUSNER:          The difference is that the

 7   imputed service comes before 55, because you're not

 8   eligible for after 55 or after 20 years you are eligible

 9   for benefits --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             You're giving me reasons.

11   I'll ask you in a second for the reasons.                    I want to

12   know if what I said is factually true?

13               MR. KLAUSNER:          If you were disabled before

14   normal retirement, you receive imputed service.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             And not after?

16               MR. KLAUSNER:          Correct.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.      Now I'll say that I

18   think is the discrimination of which he is complaining.

19   And now what he would like to know is what possible

20   reason is there for that difference?                    Now I'd like to

21   hear what the reason is that justifies that difference.

22               You give him six extra years when he retired

23   after 14 years and though he was only 49 years old, and

24   you don't give him even one extra year when everything

25   else was the same but he retired after he was 55.

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 Now, explain to me what the reason is for

 2   that.

 3                 MR. KLAUSNER:         The reason for that, Justice

 4   Breyer, is as follows:        The person who's 49 and gets

 5   disabled, assuming he does not have -- he or she doesn't

 6   have 20 years of service, can't retire.                   The person who

 7   is 55 in your example can leave tomorrow.

 8                 Additionally, the person who begins work

 9   older starts out closer to retirement.                   We are not

10   talking about two different groups of people.                  The plan

11   favors the older worker by saying on the day you begin

12   work, you're always closer to retiring than a younger

13   person.

14                 The purpose of the imputed service is to try

15   to replicate as closely as possible within some

16   financial limits set by the -- by the General Assembly

17   of Kentucky what you would have received had you made --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No.    He says now, what he

19   says to that, I take it, is fine.                 He is 49 years old.

20   He has six years to go to qualify for retirement, so let

21   him retire.    If you let him retire, and you gave him 14

22   years of credit, you would be treating him just like

23   you're treating me.

24                 But in addition to letting him retire, you

25   give him six extra years of credit, which at two


                                         7

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and-a-half percent per year.            Good, I'm glad you do

 2   that.   Give me the six extra years at two and-a-half

 3   percent as well.   Treat us alike.

 4               What's your response?

 5               MR. KLAUSNER:          My response, Justice, is

 6   this.   They start out un-alike.             As I mentioned before,

 7   the person who was in 55 in your example, A, is already

 8   eligible for benefit.      He doesn't have to wait to be

 9   disabled.   He may leave tomorrow.

10               The person who starts younger, particularly

11   in a public safety retirement plan, spends more time in

12   the line of fire than the person who starts older.                 The

13   person who starts older takes advantage of the fact that

14   in this retirement plan you can retire with as little as

15   five years of service.       Actually a person who is 55 is

16   eligible for a benefit after only a month.              In fact,

17   Kentucky may be the only plan in the country that does

18   that.

19               But where they don't start out alike and

20   where the EEOC's chart is based on fallacy is that the

21   person who began older in work in your example was

22   always closer to retirement, they needed less years.

23               The purpose of the plan for disability

24   purposes, which is not a separate plan, it's simply a

25   means of getting one to normal retirement who is not


                                        8

 1   otherwise eligible.

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            This has been very

 3   helpful, but it does seem to me to raise a question

 4   about the fairness of your opening statement.                 You began

 5   by saying something to the effect that this does not

 6   discriminate on the basis of age.                It does.   Age is the

 7   explicit factor that the statute uses in order to answer

 8   Justice Breyer's question.          And the Act does not

 9   prohibit the use of age in all circumstances to which it

10   applies, but it does -- the Act goes on to prohibit the

11   use of age in some of the circumstances.                And one of

12   those circumstances is the hypothetical of the

13   55-plus-year-old person used in Justice Breyer's

14   statement and example.

15               So, it is not correct, it seems to me, for

16   you to say that this does not discriminate on the basis

17   of age.   Now, maybe there is some good reasons for doing

18   that, you can get into that, but it seems to me it does

19   make an explicit determination based on age as to some

20   people.

21               MR. KLAUSNER:          Respectfully, Justice

22   Kennedy, I think that's not entirely correct, for this

23   reason.   The plan makes the determination of eligible to

24   retire on 20 years or age 55 with five years.                In other

25   words, it makes the determination not based on age but

 1   on pension status, that is, eligibility to receive an

 2   unreduced normal retirement.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              You're saying you're one

 4   step removed.   You're making your determination on the

 5   basis of eligibility for retirement, which in turn is

 6   based on age.   And you're saying that that --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:              It's sometimes based on

 8   age.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Huh?

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:              It's sometimes based on

11   age, sometimes years of service.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Right.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And always based on

14   age plus service.

15              MR. KLAUSNER:            Right.        Yes, Mr. Chief

16   Justice.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But your answer, as I

18   understand it, to Justice Breyer's question was, could

19   be boiled down to this:         The person whose disability

20   benefit or total benefit following disability is

21   calculated on the basis of age 55, is less likely to

22   have worked or is likely to have worked less long than

23   the person whose benefit is imputed and calculated on

24   the basis of 20 years.        And because the odds are that

25   we'll say the person in the 55-year-old category has


                                        10

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   worked less and endured less risk, it is, therefore,

 2   fair to impute less time on average to such a person,

 3   and therefore, give a lower benefit.

 4              You're saying there is a tradeoff.                     And the

 5   tradeoff is because the 55-year-old retiree may get a

 6   benefit after very little work and very little risk, it

 7   is therefore fair and not a discrimination that on the

 8   average the windfall is less for that person by the

 9   imputation than the windfall to the person who retires

10   on the basis of age 20.

11              Is that a fair statement of your argument?

12              MR. KLAUSNER:            Yes.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Okay.

14              MR. KLAUSNER:            As I noted before, it's

15   about retirement eligibility, not about age.

16              In Hazen Paper you dealt with the question

17   of an individual who was fired because they were about

18   to meet the 10-year vesting requirement in a private

19   sector plan.   The person was also over the age of 40.

20   The Court found that it wasn't an age discrimination

21   case because it said that age was merely correlated with

22   what the Court called pension status.                    I think pension

23   status and retirement eligibility, which can occur at 20

24   years or it can occur at age 55 with some service, is

25   exactly the same.    In --

 1              JUSTICE ALITO:           That would be a good

 2   argument if the sole basis for retirement under your

 3   system was years of service, but it's not just years of

 4   service, isn't that right?

 5              MR. KLAUSNER:           That's correct, Justice.         One

 6   needs some service, but one may retire at 55 or one may

 7   retire at 20 years.

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:           You can't take your -- you

 9   couldn't take your statute and erase all the references

10   to age and have the statute work, could you?

11              MR. KLAUSNER:           No.      And I don't -- I don't

12   think that pension statutes are required to eliminate

13   any use of age at all.

14              JUSTICE ALITO:           Because the ADA expressly

15   allows them to do that; isn't that right?

16              MR. KLAUSNER:           The ADA is designed to

17   eliminate arbitrary age discrimination.                 That is where

18   the design of the plan is motivated by a policy of the

19   employer to discriminate, to provide less solely because

20   of the individual's age.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:             That's -- you're sticking

22   in a word, "arbitrary," that appears nowhere in the body

23   of the statute.   You picked it up from the preamble, and

24   that's -- and you're interpreting the statute with that.

25   And it isn't customary for this Court to take words that

 1   don't appear in the text of the statute and read them

 2   in, based on some statement of purpose or preamble.

 3                 MR. KLAUSNER:         Justice Ginsburg, I'm aware

 4   that the preamble alone doesn't direct, and I understand

 5   that the operative language is in 623(a).                But I think

 6   that the --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You'd be in better shape if

 8   it was in legislative history and not in the preamble.

 9   We probably would take it into account.

10                 MR. KLAUSNER:         I think, Justice, the

11   legislative history is important for this reason.                 When

12   Title VII was first written age was included and then it

13   was taken out, and there was a reason why it was taken

14   out:   Because there is never a reason to discriminate on

15   the basis of race, there is never a reason to

16   discriminate on the basis of national origin or

17   religion; but in government retirement plans, which are

18   paid for life and in which the calculation is determined

19   in part on age, on how long someone will live and how

20   long they've worked and that interrelationship, I think

21   Congress recognized age is qualitatively different.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I think the Congress

23   recognized that what they were protecting was not age as

24   such, but old age, where in the other case they say it's

25   the racial criterion and whether it's -- or the sex


                                        13

 1   criterion, whether it's a man that's adversely affected

 2   or a woman it doesn't make any difference; Title VII

 3   applies to them both.      But the Age Discrimination Act

 4   doesn't apply to younger workers.                It doesn't say that

 5   you can't discriminate on the basis of age, so you can't

 6   prefer the older person over the younger person.

 7               MR. KLAUSNER:          Justice Ginsburg, I

 8   understand this Court's holding in Cline was that the

 9   statute is intended to protect the relatively older as

10   it relates to the relatively younger.                   But you also said

11   in Cline that age is qualitatively different, because

12   what gives age reason in terms of discrimination is when

13   it's arbitrary.   That is, when it is invidious, and

14   that's the distinction between the Title VII cases that

15   the Government relies on, and why I think Hazen Paper is

16   important, because, as the Court said, unless you can

17   show in a disparate treatment case that the policy is

18   motivated by age, then I think that the -- the intent

19   goes.   And the -- one cannot draw from the face of the

20   Kentucky statute -- and that's what this is; this was a

21   challenge that said the statute discriminates on its

22   face -- that the only inference that one can have is

23   that the design of the plan is motivated to pay older

24   people less.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There is one little piece

 1   of it that seems, that clearly does favor the younger

 2   retiree.   And that's the -- what is it -- you're

 3   guaranteed, what was it, at least 25 percent of your

 4   final monthly salary.       That's not under -- for a regular

 5   retiree; and also this 10 percent that you get added on

 6   for each child -- that's not part -- that's somebody who

 7   is disabled gets that, but not somebody who is already a

 8   retiree.   Isn't that so?

 9                 MR. KLAUSNER:         That is correct, but Justice

10   Ginsburg, that type of disability is not the disability

11   which was at issue in this particular case.                That is for

12   a person who is disabled from any ability to work,

13   period, in other words, the Social Security standard of

14   disability.    The disability at issue in this case was

15   the inability to work as a public safety officer, in

16   this case a police officer.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I'm not sure that I

18   follow that answer.

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Am I correct in

20   understanding that your plan does not provide a

21   disability benefit just as a disability benefit?                 The

22   only time disability is relevant is when it determines

23   whether or not a person will become eligible for the

24   regular retirement benefit?

25                 MR. KLAUSNER:         That's correct.      This isn't,

 1   for example, a stand-alone disability insurance policy.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So that for the old person

 3   who has already reached retirement age the fact that he

 4   doesn't get a disability benefit is common to everybody

 5   subject to the plan.

 6                 MR. KLAUSNER:         It is common subject to

 7   everyone in the plan without --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Isn't that the answer to

 9   Justice Breyer's question?

10                 MR. KLAUSNER:         And I -- you certainly said

11   it better than I did, Justice Stevens.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But is there any

13   reason -- I think what you're saying is we should view

14   this as a retirement plan and there are a number of ways

15   you can be eligible for retirement:                      Age plus years of

16   service, but another way you can be eligible is

17   disability.

18                 MR. KLAUSNER:         Disability fills in -- it

19   covers a gap.    Disability is designed to cover you in

20   most instances from the time you get five years of

21   service -- and by the way, you're uncovered in this plan

22   for disability for the first five years of employment

23   except for a very limited, specific number of instances

24   in which only total disability from all work applies.

25                 So in the case of the individual who the

 1   EEOC talks about as having been discriminated against,

 2   if you were a younger worker for the first five years of

 3   employment you would have been not covered.                  A 55 -- for

 4   any benefit at all.     A person who starts at 21 and gets

 5   disabled from work as a police officer or firefighter

 6   for the first five years of employment has no protection

 7   at all.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But let's take the one

 9   who gets over the five-year initial period.                  The

10   disability pay when you no longer can be in the

11   hazardous occupation, it will begin immediately, right?

12   You don't wait until you get -- you're 55 to get it.

13              MR. KLAUSNER:          No, ma'am.           That's the

14   purpose of the imputed services.              And it's

15   essentially -- we say if during this gap of time before

16   normal retirement, this risk that's covered, that if

17   this disabling event occurs, we advance you to normal

18   retirement immediately and try to replicate as closely

19   as possible the benefit that one would have achieved had

20   you worked to the closest --

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's the point,

22   right?

23              MR. KLAUSNER:          -- point of eligibility.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:            There -- that's what the

25   complaint is, I think, that you say it's the second part

 1   that you just said.      What you do when the person is

 2   disabled and he is not yet 55 -- he hasn't qualified

 3   yet -- is you both qualify him, and when you qualify him

 4   you give him credit for years he hasn't worked.               Now,

 5   the older person who is still working and is also

 6   disabled says:    Fine, you let me retire, but you don't

 7   give me any extra years.

 8              Now that's the complaint, I think.                So that

 9   if you had a person who had started at 45, eligible to

10   retire at 55, works for 4 years and becomes disabled, he

11   is credited with 14 years; while the person who started

12   at 35 and at 45 becomes disabled, he is given 20 years.

13   He is given the 10 extra years.               So the first person,

14   older person, says:      You gave him some extra years; you

15   didn't have to give him those extra years in order to

16   qualify him to retire.        You could have just said you can

17   retire, but you gave him 10 extra years and you give me

18   no extra years.   Why not?

19              MR. KLAUSNER:            The answer to your question,

20   Justice Breyer, is the person who has either 20 years or

21   is 55 on the day they become disabled is already

22   eligible to retire.      The plan is a single plan that

23   provides a benefit.      If you start older, you have to

24   work less to get there.         By the same token, by starting

25   closer to retirement you need less added to your balance

 1   to bring you to normal retirement.                   In the example --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You don't need anything to

 3   bring you to normal retirement.                You could rewrite the

 4   plan and say when a person becomes disabled you get

 5   retirement, right at that moment.                  You could say that.

 6   And what the plaintiff is saying is, why don't you say

 7   that?     Though it's a bit mean.             But I think what he

 8   would probably like is you would extend the extra years

 9   to him.

10                 MR. KLAUSNER:          There's reasons why that

11   isn't done.    Number one, to follow your example, Justice

12   Breyer, for current employees, people hired before 2004,

13   of which there were several hundred thousand, you'd have

14   to lower the benefit to follow your example.                   The

15   Kentucky Constitution forbids lowering the benefits.

16   Actually, the Commonwealth, in response to the liability

17   in this case, did change the disability benefit.                     For

18   people hired after 2004, they slashed its economic value

19   substantially, and now everybody just gets a certain

20   amount of disability.        It doesn't, however, accomplish

21   the Commonwealth's goal of attracting and retaining

22   employees to do hazardous duty jobs.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the effect of

24   this litigation is that policemen or firefighters who

25   are injured and become disabled now get lower benefits

 1   for disability?

 2                 MR. KLAUSNER:          Much lower.           It's a

 3   substantial reduction.         They just get a small piece of

 4   change.

 5                 It's interesting, you know, in the Federal

 6   Civil Service Retirement System, the police officers,

 7   for example, who work in this Court, if they become

 8   disabled, they have imputed service to an age.                      It's a

 9   very similar system.        In fact, all employees in both

10   FERS, the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and the

11   Civil Service Employees' Retirement System, both

12   participate in a program where age is imputed to normal

13   retirement.     It's a common practice, as the Court can

14   see from the amicus briefs.              It's a common practice

15   throughout the United States.               I think --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            See, that's why I think the

17   result in this case is just terrible.                     I think it takes

18   disabled people and cuts their benefits with no benefit.

19   I cannot believe for two minutes that Congress would

20   have intended that result.            But the reason I asked you

21   the question was I want you to tell me how to get to

22   that result under this statute.

23                 MR. KLAUSNER:          You may get to this result in

24   this way:     If you determine that age is not the driver,

25   that is, that because you have a plan that has normal

 1   retirement based on service alone, a 38-year-old

 2   employee who gets disabled with 18 years of service gets

 3   two years of imputed service.             The 45-year-old, in your

 4   example, who started at 35 would get 10 years.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Suppose I can't make that

 6   assumption or adopt that premise.                Is there another

 7   basis on which to reach the result?                     I think this does

 8   explicitly discriminate based on age as to some people,

 9   and you're telling me you don't want me to do that.                     But

10   Suppose I don't agree with you.              Is there some other way

11   to reach the result?

12              MR. KLAUSNER:           I think Your Honor you can

13   reach the result in this way.             The statute was

14   challenged as being facially discriminatory, and I think

15   under this Court's precedents for facial discrimination,

16   one would have to say that the only reasonable inference

17   in the statute, by its mere use of age, is that you say

18   that it starts out presumptively discriminatory.                    What

19   the Government has really argued here is an as-applied

20   circumstance.   They said the effect of the statute in

21   certain cases, and in those circumstances the statute

22   would stand on its face and if there is a circumstance

23   in which someone effectively is discriminated, then you

24   look to see are there reasonable factors other than age

25   that effect -- that take effect in this instance?

 1                 Secondly, I think the Court can determine --

 2   and I think this is the question that is the next step

 3   after Hazen, where you said that age correlated with

 4   pension status, in that case being vested for 10 years.

 5   The question is, if a plan has eligibility to retire as

 6   its motivation, that is, it is service regardless of age

 7   or age plus service, is it really motivated by age?                 And

 8   I think the answer to that question, Justice Kennedy,

 9   clearly is no.

10                 The one thing I would add is if you look at

11   the statute in Betts, the Ohio case, which is the last

12   time an age case on a public plan got to this Court, in

13   the Ohio plan you couldn't get a disability because you

14   were 60, but you could also retire in that plan just

15   like Kentucky on years of service alone, but a

16   years-of-service retiree in Ohio could get a disability.

17                 That's not true in Kentucky.               Somebody who

18   starts as a firefighter at 18 no longer has disability

19   protection at 38 years old.             A person who starts as a

20   police officer at 45 retains disability coverage until

21   they're 55.    I think -- I think the language of the

22   statute alone enables you to get there.

23                 And I think to get back to Justice

24   Ginsburg's question -- and I don't believe I fully

25   answered on this issue of the role of the word

 1   "arbitrary" in the statute -- I think that that gives

 2   that word meaning, not just because it's in the

 3   preamble, but because it's in the legislative history,

 4   and the evil that Congress was trying to get to is what

 5   is it that we're trying to prevent?                       We're trying to

 6   create job opportunities for older workers, and what

 7   Congress said after Betts is you want to make sure

 8   benefit plans are covered.            And I think Kentucky has

 9   accomplished both.      It doesn't use a retirement age, as

10   many employers do.      Again, the Federal Government forces

11   police officers and firefighters out of their jobs.

12   Firefighters at 55, police officers at 57.                      Kentucky

13   doesn't.   The program doesn't discriminate on the basis

14   of age.

15               If there's no question, I'd like to reserve

16   the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 1   employees.    Although Kentucky may be able to establish

 2   on --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            Let me ask you this sort of

 4   basic question:    Does it use age any differently than it

 5   uses years of service?

 6                MR. STEWART:         It does in the sense that,

 7   with respect to disabled employees, two employees who

 8   have the same total years of actual service but who are

 9   of different ages may receive dramatically different

10   benefits.

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's because of the

12   period necessary to qualify for retirement?

13                MR. STEWART:         It's -- let me direct your

14   attention to the relevant provision of the Kentucky

15   statute, and it's at page 7a and 8a of the blue brief.

16   This is with respect to -- it's true that, for a normal

17   retirement, an individual either has to be age 55 with 5

18   years of service or have 20 years of service at whatever

19   age.    But if you look at the requirements for disability

20   retirement in particular, the very bottom of the page,

21   it says:    "Any person may qualify to retire on

22   disability subject to the following.                     The person shall

23   have 60 months of service, 12 of which shall be current

24   service credited under provisions of Kentucky law."

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me just interrupt you.

 1   Is there -- is it your position there is a disability

 2   benefit that is different from the retirement benefit?

 3              MR. STEWART:            They -- they are different in

 4   the sense that they are calculated differently.              That

 5   is, if all Kentucky had done was say --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:               I thought that all that

 7   disability did was determine -- help get a man who is

 8   disabled eligible for the retirement benefit.

 9              MR. STEWART:            The program --

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:               That's the only function

11   it provides.

12              MR. STEWART:            I think that's incorrect.

13   There are two distinct functions of -- there are two

14   distinct differences between disability retirement and

15   normal retirement:      The first is that the eligibility

16   criteria are different.          In order to qualify for normal

17   retirement, you have to be either 55 years old with 5

18   years of service or have 20 years of service.              For

19   disability retirement, you become eligible if you are of

20   any age and are forced to retire due to disability and

21   have at least five years of service.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, why does that matter?

23   I mean, the exception in the statute is for -- for

24   retirement, taking age into account for retirement, is

25   narrowly crafted.     It says that they can make any


                                         25

 1   decision about -- they can require the attainment of a

 2   minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or

 3   early retirement.

 4                Now, we have not read that to exclude adding

 5   an additional element to age, namely age plus years of

 6   service.    We don't say that that disables you from the

 7   -- from that exemption.         Why can't you add a third

 8   factor?    Age, years of service, and disability.

 9                MR. STEWART:         You can't.              The first thing I

10   would say about that exception is it refers specifically

11   to a minimum age, and what that was intended to make

12   clear was that to the extent that Kentucky allows

13   55-year-olds to retire with only 5 years of service, but

14   requires a 45-year-old to have 20 years of service, that

15   minimum age would not violate the statute.                      Now, as a

16   result of this Court's decision in Cline, that provision

17   in a sense is superfluous because the younger worker

18   wouldn't have an ADEA claim anyway.                      But the reference

19   to a minimum age is intended to address that situation.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:          It seems to me that what

22   Kentucky is trying to do is to, at least in part,

23   provide make-whole benefits for a police officer who

24   becomes disabled below the age of 55.                     So what they want

25   to do is to say we want to give you the benefit that you


                                        26
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would have received if you had not been hurt on the job

 2   and therefore unable to work and had been able to work

 3   to the normal retirement age.

 4              Now, if that's correct, is that an

 5   illegitimate objective?        And if it's not an illegitimate

 6   objective, is there any way that they can do that

 7   consistent with your understanding of the ADEA?               Because

 8   when someone is over the retirement age, it's rather

 9   hard to see how many years you would add on projecting

10   how long that person would continue to work beyond the

11   age of retirement eligibility.

12              MR. STEWART:         It is certainly not

13   illegitimate for Kentucky to say:               We want to be more

14   generous to people who are forced to retire due to

15   disability than to people who choose to retire

16   voluntarily when they are physically capable of

17   continuing to work.

18              And so if Kentucky wants to say, in the case

19   of an individual who is forced to retire due to

20   disability, we will add additional years in computing

21   benefits to estimate the number of years this person

22   would have worked had he or she not become disabled,

23   that's fine as well.

24              What they can't do, at least what they can't

25   do without establishing one of the affirmative defenses,


                                      27

 1   is use age as a proxy, as the basis for deciding how

 2   many years would this person have worked if he or she

 3   had not become disabled because --

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:          So if they want to do that

 5   and they have a case of a police officer who works

 6   beyond 55 -- the officer is 55-plus with 10 years of

 7   service and then becomes disabled -- you say they have

 8   to give that person 10 years of credit.

 9               MR. STEWART:         If they are going to give the

10   45-year-old with 10 years of service 10 years of credit,

11   they have to give the 55-year-old 10 years of service --

12   with 10 years of service 10 years of credit, again,

13   unless they can establish the cost-justification

14   defense.

15               And part of the argument they are making is

16   it would be unduly expensive to guarantee the

17   55-year-old an additional 10 years of service, because

18   it's much more likely that the 55-year-old will become

19   disabled than it is with the 45-year-old.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But he is saying one thing

21   more.   He is saying it's also highly unlikely that the

22   55-year-old has worked as long subject to risk at the

23   point at which the calculation is made than is the case

24   with the person who retires on the basis of 20 years.

25   And so that there is a tradeoff.               And, therefore, you


                                       28

 1   constantly analyze this as the kind of garden variety of

 2   discrimination based on age which Congress was aiming

 3   for.

 4              MR. STEWART:         Well, to go back to the

 5   question you were asking Mr. Klausner, I think if we

 6   were looking at the class of voluntary retirees, it

 7   would be an accurate generalization to say that those

 8   above 55 were likely to have fewer years of service than

 9   the younger people.     Because the only way that a younger

10   person could qualify for normal retirement would be to

11   amass 20 years of service; whereas, the older person

12   could do it with fewer years.

13              But if you are looking at people who want to

14   continue working but who are prevented from doing so by

15   reason of disability, there is no reason to assume that

16   the older people are going to have spent less time in

17   the line of fire than the younger people.               And, in any

18   event, the comparison that we are making --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just say that again.        Just

20   say the last thing again.         I didn't follow you.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.      I didn't get it

22   either.

23              MR. STEWART:         If we're looking at the class

24   of people who -- including over 55-year-old and under

25   55-year-old -- who want to continue working but who have

 1   been prevented from doing so by reason of disability,

 2   there is no reason to think that the older people within

 3   that class, as a group, will have fewer years in the

 4   line of fire than the younger people.                    And, in any event

 5   --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why?      I -- I think -- you

 7   mean in the future?

 8               MR. STEWART:          No.      No.      Under their belt.

 9   Under their belt.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Under their belt.        I see.

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:             They are exactly the same

12   people.   The only thing that distinguishes the one

13   class, those who voluntarily do and those who are

14   disabled, is happenstance; and the happenstance is

15   disability in the line of service.

16               MR. STEWART:          It's not just happenstance,

17   because if you're guessing the likely tenure of service

18   of people who take voluntary normal retirement before

19   age 55, in a sense you are skewing the class, because

20   the only people who can do that under Kentucky law are

21   people with at least 20 years of service.

22               So the voluntary retirees, the younger

23   people, as a group, are likely to be -- have longer

24   tenure.   But that generalization doesn't hold true with

25   respect to people who are forced to retire due to

 1   disability.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It seems to me your

 3   argument boils down to the claim that people who have

 4   already reached -- become eligible for retirement by

 5   either age or period of service, the State has a duty to

 6   give them a chance to recover a disability benefit if

 7   they give a disability benefit to younger workers.

 8                 MR. STEWART:         No.      Our point is that they

 9   should use the same computation methodology for both

10   categories of employees.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            The computation is for a

12   different purpose in that -- in -- for the younger

13   workers the purpose is to make them eligible for

14   retirement.    For the older workers, they are already

15   eligible for retirement.

16                 MR. STEWART:         I think that's incorrect, and

17   that was really the point I was making by quoting from

18   the Kentucky law on page 7a and 8a.                       The Kentucky

19   provision that I quoted was the provision that

20   establishes eligibility for disability retirement.                       And

21   it says, as the criterion for eligibility, beyond, of

22   course, the fact of disability, the person shall have 60

23   months of service.

24                 So an individual under Kentucky law who is

25   forced to retire due to disability and has at least five


                                         31

 1   years of service is eligible for disability retirement.

 2   The imputation of additional years of service is not

 3   necessary --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:               The term "eligibility for

 5   retirement," as used in that part of the statute, is

 6   referring to actually the same thing as retirement

 7   achieved by getting their -- getting credit for

 8   post-disability years.

 9              MR. STEWART:            Exactly.          Well, the purpose of

10   defining the category of eligible persons is to make

11   sure that they do get a retirement benefit even though

12   they wouldn't satisfy the normal age and service

13   requirements for ordinary retirement.                     And we have no

14   problem with that.

15              Kentucky can say we want to define a

16   separate category of individuals who don't satisfy

17   normal age and service rules but who should,

18   nevertheless, be given a retirement benefit because they

19   have been forced to retire due to disability.                     That's

20   fine.

21              And if they use the same computation

22   methodology, namely, some factor of actual years of

23   service times final compensation times a multiplier, as

24   they do for normal retirement, that would be fine.                     Our

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it's fine for

 2   them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for

 3   them to use any element of age in making that

 4   computation?

 5                MR. STEWART:        That's correct.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even though, under

 7   the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive

 8   requirement in determining retirement?

 9                MR. STEWART:        Well, again, there is a an

10   explicit exemption in the ADEA for a minimum retirement

11   age.   And so it wouldn't have violated -- even apart

12   from this Court's decision in Cline, it wouldn't have

13   violated the ADEA to say an individual who is 55 with

14   five years of service can get retirement, even though a

15   younger --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           What is wrong with using

17   that as a benchmark?      If you can fire a person when he

18   is 55, why can't you use it as a benchmark as to how

19   much you're going to give a disability person on

20   pension?

21                MR. STEWART:        Well, again, I think the --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           The lesser or greater --

23   this would be an instance where greater includes lesser

24   for the reason that this lesser business has no

25   stereotypes.   All they're trying to do is to help people


                                       33

 1   who are disabled at a time when they are younger and

 2   probably have fairly good expenses, and everybody gets

 3   this kind of insurance.

 4               And this man who is the Plaintiff here had

 5   it, too, while he was there.            So it's true you are

 6   really using in a minimal sense age, but you are doing

 7   it in a statute that permits you to do it because it's a

 8   lesser version of that.

 9               MR. STEWART:         There are a couple of things

10   I'd say.   The first is that the Act is quite specific in

11   saying that a State may establish a minimum -- may

12   establish a retirement age with respect to its State

13   police and firefighters, but it doesn't say the ADEA is

14   inapplicable to police and firefighters who are over age

15   55.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            It doesn't say it's

17   inapplicable.   I wasn't saying it's inapplicable.             What

18   I am worried about -- and this is a perfect example of

19   people using absolutely mechanical rules, and

20   particularly when you talk about pension systems, which,

21   of course, age is relevant to a pension system, and what

22   they do is find comparisons; and, before you know it,

23   you are in the kind of a -- of a hamburger situation

24   where it's so chopped up that perfectly worthwhile

25   things are forbidden.      And this would seem to be a

 1   number 1 exhibit.

 2                MR. STEWART:         There are several different

 3   answers I would give.       The first is if the greater

 4   included the lesser, it would be permissible for

 5   Kentucky to say:    We will keep the over 55-year-old

 6   people on the work force, but we'll pay them less

 7   because of their age.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, because what you are

 9   looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is

10   somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent

11   stereotypical thinking from being used to put older

12   people at a disadvantage.           And there is no indication

13   that this is so in this case.

14                MR. STEWART:         I think --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, what's the response?

16                MR. STEWART:         I think that's incorrect, that

17   is, the two justifications that have been given for the

18   disparate treatment of older workers are, first, younger

19   workers as a group are likely to need more of a boost;

20   and, second, the younger disabled person probably would

21   have worked longer if he had not become disabled.             And

22   so this replicates the situation that would have

23   prevailed.

24                I think, whether or not you want to think of

25   those as stigmatizing stereotypes, it's quite clear that


                                        35

 1   neither of those generalizations could typically be used

 2   as a basis for age-based disparities.

 3               For instance, nobody would claim that an

 4   employer could pay the older workers less because they

 5   are likely to be less in need of financial assistance.

 6   And with respect to the initial --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            The reason for that is that

 8   we accept the criterion at the outset that your pay

 9   bears some relationship to what you do.

10               We are now in a situation in which the

11   benefit does not bear a relationship to what you are

12   doing or going to do.

13               MR. STEWART:         Well, on the whole, the

14   benefit bears a close -- the retirement benefit bears a

15   close relationship to what you have done.               That is, the

16   benefit is calculated on the basis of actual years of

17   service, and the purpose clearly is, in part, to reward

18   the employee for service to the employer.

19               But with respect to -- and that's the way

20   it's done with respect to the older disabled worker.

21   His benefits are computed based on what years of service

22   he has actually contributed to the employer.               With

23   respect to the younger people, it's not based on that

24   alone.   Rather, the State imputes additional years --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And with respect to that,

 1   Mr. Stewart, the problem that Justice Breyer brought up,

 2   you -- if you would look to your brief, page 30,

 3   footnote 13, the question is, so we have this -- if we

 4   take your interpretation of the statute, how can we deal

 5   with a person in her 30s who becomes disabled when she

 6   is making a low salary and has only, say, 10 years of

 7   service?   She is going to get a very low disability.

 8   And you say that's one thing that's all right.

 9               On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky

10   do?   One is give the younger workers only their actual

11   years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is

12   happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot

13   less than they used to get.            And then you say, oh, but

14   there's another way, and that is to impute additional

15   years of service on an age-neutral basis.               And you're

16   not specific about what would the age-neutral basis be.

17               MR. STEWART:         I guess there could be a range

18   of alternatives.   One alternative, for instance, would

19   be for every disabled worker of whatever age impute an

20   additional five years of service as something of a rough

21   estimate of the number that person might have worked if

22   he or she had not become disabled.

23               Another possibility would be to impute years

24   of service up to 10 or 20.          Again, there would be

25   probably an infinite number of ways it could be done as


                                       37

 1   long as age were not used as, as the basis.

 2               The other thing I wanted to say about --

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:            But if do you that, aren't

 4   you going to be -- you're going to be undercompensating

 5   the younger person who gets disabled and

 6   overcompensating the people over 55 who gets disabled

 7   who may not -- it may not be realistic to think that

 8   someone's going to continue to work as a police officer

 9   until 65.   I don't know.

10               MR. STEWART:           Well, the other thing I would

11   say about that justification, which rests on I think the

12   valid statistical correlation between how old you are at

13   the time that you're disabled and how much longer you

14   would have worked.      Again, whether or not -- I think you

15   wouldn't think of that as an invidious stereotype.           But

16   again, it's not a generalization that could typically be

17   used as a basis for age-specific decisions.

18               For example, the Wirtz report makes clear

19   that the paradigmatic pre-ADA practice that Congress

20   wanted to get rid of was a limit of age 50 or age 45 and

21   an employer saying:       We're not going to hire anybody who

22   is over that age.     And certainly the employer could say

23   justifiably as a group people above that age are likely

24   to have fewer work years ahead of them than people below

25   that age.   And if that generalization could provide a


                                         38

 1   basis for an explicit age-based distinction, the Act

 2   would really be eviscerated.

 3              The other thing I wanted to respond to is

 4   the suggestion that, while we might be able to tease

 5   this out of the literal language of the statute, this is

 6   certainly an unintended consequence.                     It is not

 7   something that Congress would have wanted.                     I think, to

 8   the contrary, this is not identical but very similar to

 9   the type of disparity that was present in Betts.                        That

10   is, in Betts the individual was over the age of normal

11   retirement but had elected to keep working.                     She became

12   disabled and was prevented from continuing to work.                       She

13   was eligible for normal retirement benefits.                     She wanted

14   to collect disability retirement benefits, because

15   again, the reason for her retirement was disability.

16   She was told that she couldn't do it.                     And the State's

17   computation methodology for calculating disability

18   retirement benefits was significantly more generous than

19   the one that it offered for --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:             What about this idea, which

21   is -- would this wreck the statute?                     You say we're

22   talking about age, which is not an immutable

23   characteristic.   Everybody goes through it.                    Everybody

24   is younger, everybody is older.              And therefore we take

25   the word "discriminate" and the word "discriminate" in


                                       39

 1   this context, when considered in terms of pension

 2   requirements, which inevitably are age mixed to a

 3   considerable degree, means that if there are plausible

 4   justifications and no significant reason for thinking

 5   that it reflects stereotypical thinking, that it does

 6   not fall within the scope of the word "discriminate."

 7              MR. STEWART:          I think, first, that would be

 8   contrary to the way that the word "discriminate" has

 9   been construed in Title VII.

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             I started out by saying,

11   that's why I said that this is not an immutable

12   characteristic, and it is -- that's why I put all the

13   qualifications in there.

14              MR. STEWART:          Well, the court in Thurston

15   has said the language of the ADEA should be construed

16   similarly to that of Title VII because the basic

17   anti-discrimination prohibition was drawn in haec verba

18   from Title VII in the legislative history to the older

19   workers's Benefit Protection Act when Congress amended

20   the statute to cover fringe benefits, which the Court in

21   Betts had held were not covered.               Congress did that by

22   enacting a new 29 U.S.C. 630(l) to say the term -- that

23   the phrase "terms and conditions of employment" includes

24   fringe benefits.

25              And the legislative history explains that


                                       40
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Congress could have achieved the same result by adding a

 2   reference to fringe benefits in the basic

 3   anti-discrimination provision contained in 29 U.S.C.

 4   623(a), but the Congress chose not to do that because it

 5   wanted to maintain the similarity in wording between the

 6   ADEA's anti-discrimination provision and that of Title

 7   VII in order to reinforce the inference that the two

 8   were to be construed in pari materia.

 9               The other thing I would say with respect to

10   your reference to age distinctions that are not based on

11   stereotypes is again to return to what I was discussing

12   earlier.   The two justifications that have been offered

13   are first, younger people are likely to have fewer

14   financial resources, so they need more of a boost; the

15   second is the younger worker probably would have worked

16   longer if he hadn't become disabled and therefore this

17   is replicating the situation that would have prevailed

18   absent the disability.

19               And again, my point is, whether or not you

20   think of those as invidious stereotypes, they are

21   plainly not generalizations that could typically be used

22   to justify --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question

24   right on that point.      Supposing you have two different

25   people retire, one -- that become disabled, rather --


                                       41

 1   one because he's five years short of the age eligibility

 2   and the other because he's five years short of years of

 3   service, so it would be a younger person, and both would

 4   have become eligible for retirement in five years after

 5   their disability.     Are they treated the same way under

 6   the plan?    And if they are, where is the discrimination?

 7                MR. STEWART:          Well, the discrimination is if

 8   you imagine --

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, first of all, tell

10   me whether they're treated the same way under the plan.

11                MR. STEWART:          Well, it depends on other

12   variables.     For instance, if you have a --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:             What other variables?

14                MR. STEWART:          As to the person who is five

15   years away from qualifying by reason of --

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Years of service.

17                MR. STEWART:          -- years of service, if that

18   person is younger than 50, then they'll be treated the

19   same, because each of them will have --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:             That's a hypothesis.

21                MR. STEWART:          But --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:             So then how is that

23   discrimination on the basis of age?

24                MR. STEWART:          But it is a discrimination on

25   the basis --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's not even

 2   discrimination as far as I see it.

 3                 MR. STEWART:         Well, it wouldn't -- there

 4   wouldn't be any claim of disparate treatment with

 5   respect to those two individuals.                  But if you have an

 6   individual who is 55 years old with 15 years of service

 7   and 50 years old with 15 years of service, they are both

 8   equally close to the 20-year threshold for qualifying

 9   for normal retirement on the basis of years of service.

10   Yet the 50-year-old gets 5 imputed years added and gets

11   a significantly larger benefit than the 55-year-old.

12                 Their justification is, well, the

13   55-year-old is already eligible for normal retirement

14   and therefore, it's fair to treat him differently.                 And

15   the point I was making with reference to the Kentucky

16   code is the 50-year-old who is forced to retire due to

17   disability is also eligible for retirement.                 It's called

18   disability retirement.

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It seems to me that your

20   claim boils down to an argument that the statute

21   requires someone who is already qualified for retirement

22   to get a disability benefit that the younger person

23   would.     It seems to me that's the basic difference.

24                 MR. STEWART:         No, I don't think that's

25   correct.     If all the State did was to say disability

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   retirement benefits will be available to people who have

 2   at least five years of service and are forced to retire

 3   due to disability and we are excluding people who are

 4   above 55, in and of itself that's fine.                If the only

 5   purpose of excluding the older workers is to make clear

 6   that they can't get both benefits simultaneously, there

 7   is no problem with that.

 8              Our problem is that, having defined the

 9   class of persons eligible for disability benefits to

10   include only those who are under 55 --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I see you talking about

12   two benefits.

13              MR. STEWART:         -- they did use a more

14   generous computation methodology.

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            There not two benefits.

16   It's only one.

17              MR. STEWART:         It's only one benefit.          And

18   really, that's part of our point.               It's only one

19   benefit, so why would they say that people who are older

20   will have their benefits computed using a different

21   formula than people who are younger?

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You prevent the

23   State from taking into account the fact that younger

24   disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that

25   older disabled workers have.           And it results -- if we


                                      44

 1   adopt your system where you can look only at years of

 2   service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to

 3   prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to

 4   older workers who become disabled.

 5               For example, if you have two workers, one

 6   who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service,

 7   say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would

 8   say, well, you can take those years of service into

 9   account.   The older worker who begins at age 30 and is

10   disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well,

11   you can only look at years of service.                    You can't impute

12   to both of them retirement age.              So the 30-year-old who

13   becomes disabled has to get less, fewer benefits than

14   the 18-year-old who becomes disabled.

15               MR. STEWART:         Well, first, we are not

16   preventing Kentucky from imputing additional years.                     We

17   are simply saying the method of determining how many

18   years will be imputed, absent an affirmative defense,

19   can't be dependent on the employee's age.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            Would it be the same as --

21   I mean it seems to me now -- I'm thinking the problem is

22   we are going into the package; we are starting opening

23   up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally

24   gets.

25               Suppose they said this:                     here's what we'll


                                       45

 1   do to the disabled person.           We'll treat him just as if

 2   he retired at 55.    He is only 35; and, moreover, at 55

 3   when you retire in our police force, we give you a big

 4   party and a gold watch.         Well, we don't do that if you

 5   retire later on.    Same kind of claim.

 6                 Why not?     Over 65 years old, he retired.

 7   Hey, you didn't give him the gold watch.                    Why did you

 8   give the other person the gold watch?                    You said the

 9   reason is we treat them all like we treat them when you

10   retire at 55.

11                 MR. STEWART:        I'm not quite sure if I

12   understand the question, but I don't think that there is

13   any --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's fair, that you don't

15   understand.

16                 (Laughter.)

17                 MR. STEWART:        I don't think there would be

18   anything wrong with Kentucky saying we are going -- in

19   fact, this is what we are asking for.                    If Kentucky wants

20   to say a younger person who is forced to retire due to

21   disability will be treated as though he were 55 years

22   old, that's fine.    If they give him disability benefits

23   and they calculate the benefits using actual years of

24   service as they do for the other -- for the older

25   employees, that there is no ADEA problem with that.

 1               Our problem is that they say we are treating

 2   him as though he had worked additional years until he

 3   was 55 when he hasn't, and when the older employee isn't

 4   given that same opportunity.

 5               And, again, it is true that Kentucky's

 6   system is particularly generous to older employees who

 7   want to retire voluntarily.             They can retire with as

 8   little as five years of service, even though the younger

 9   worker would have to have more.                 But the people on

10   whose behalf the EEOC is suing have not derived any of

11   that benefit.    These were people who did not retire

12   voluntarily.    They were people who were eligible for

13   retirement benefits, but chose to remain in the work

14   force.   And, essentially, they are being told, in

15   estimating how many more years you would have worked, we

16   are going to have an irrebuttable presumption that the

17   answer is zero, even though their very circumstances,

18   the fact that they continued to work after they could

19   have retired, belie that assumption.

20               And just a final point I wanted to make

21   about Betts, is that the system here is not identical,

22   but very similar to the system that was at issue there,

23   in the sense that an older worker who was forced to

24   retire due to disability got a lower benefit than she

25   would have received if she had been younger with the

 1   same years of service and the same disability.

 2                 It couldn't be clearer that Congress wanted

 3   to overturn that decision.           That was the impetus for the

 4   enactment of the OWBPA.

 5                 So I think there is really -- it's not

 6   correct to suggest that, even if we win, this is somehow

 7   an unintended consequence of what Congress did.              This is

 8   the very situation that Congress wanted to cover while

 9   providing an affirmative defense to employers who can

10   satisfy it.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Stewart, before you

12   finish, that little piece that seems to be favoring the

13   younger worker that you guaranteed at least -- what was

14   it, 25 percent of your final monthly salary, and you get

15   10 percent for each child -- now that does seem to be

16   something that's -- that's not available for a regular

17   retiree.

18                 MR. STEWART:        It's not available for a

19   regular retiree, and it's not available for a person who

20   is eligible for normal retirement but becomes disabled

21   and is forced to retire for that reason.

22                 If the only problem were that Kentucky made

23   those benefits available to people who were forced to

24   retire due to disability, that wouldn't be an ADEA

25   violation, so long as they made those benefits available

 1   to the older worker who was also forced to retire.

 2                But I take your point that those aspects of

 3   the statute introduce a further element of age

 4   discrimination without even the justification that

 5   Kentucky has proffered for the imputed years.

 6                With respect to the children, in particular,

 7   that seems to be the only other area in the plan in

 8   which Kentucky is directly targeting the people who are

 9   in greatest financial need, at least by one measure

10   having dependent children, and yet the older workers are

11   left out of that entirely.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

13   Mr. Stewart.

14                Now, Mr. Klausner, you have four minutes

15   remaining.

16          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. KLAUSNER,

17                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18                MR. KLAUSNER:         I'd like to start back where

19   we just left off with Justice Ginsburg's question about

20   the guaranteed benefit.        If a person is 38 years old and

21   has 20 years of service, that benefit is not available.

22   If you're 50 years old with 5 years of service, the

23   benefit is available.

24                The benefit is not available to the

25   38-year-old because that person is eligible to retire on


                                       49

 1   a normal retirement benefit.             Age isn't the driver.

 2   Eligibility for retirement is the motivation.

 3              And while my brother says that Congress

 4   wanted to overturn Betts, what they wanted to overturn

 5   in Betts was the language in this Court's decision that

 6   cast doubt on whether pension plans were generally

 7   covered by the language of the Age Discrimination in

 8   Employment Act.    And the Older Workers Benefits

 9   Protection Act, if one looks at the legislative history,

10   was focused far less on what happened in a public

11   employee retirement system.              The real issue that

12   Congress focused on, if one looks at the House and

13   Senate reports, is they said there is a problem in

14   private industry in the Rust Belt that normal retirement

15   eligibility is being used to force people not to get

16   some other benefit in some other stand-alone plan.

17   That's not the issue here.

18              And the plan in Betts is no more like

19   Kentucky's plan than the Thurston plan.                  In Thurston,

20   the pilot case, no pilot over 60, no matter how

21   skillful, had bumping rights to be a flight engineer.

22   In Kentucky, one with 20 years of service, regardless of

23   age, is in the same posture as someone who is 55 with a

24   minimum service.

25              My brother also pointed you to a provision


                                        50
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   in the Kentucky statute on pages 7a and -- page 7a in

 2   the appendix.   Look also at 2a, which defines normal

 3   retirement to be 55 with 5 years of service, or 20 years

 4   of service regardless of age.               The methodology for

 5   determining disability in this case is exactly the same.

 6   It's based on your proximity to normal retirement, not

 7   based on your age.

 8                One example was given.                  If a person is 45

 9   years old with 4 years of service and became disabled,

10   that person would get nothing because they haven't met

11   the five-year service requirement.                   But a 55-year-old

12   with 4 years of service has a normal retirement benefit.

13                It's about limited Government resources not

14   being duplicated, and perhaps that's the reason why the

15   EEOC adopted its regulation on December 26th

16   coordinating retiree health care.                  The rationale they

17   gave was we looked at all the -- all the ways to do

18   this, and we couldn't come up with a reason to do it any

19   other way.

20                In the Sixth Circuit Federal argument, Judge

21   Boggs noted in his dissent -- Chief Judge Boggs noted he

22   asked the EEOC for a reason on how to fix this, and they

23   couldn't give him one.

24                What this case is about is about being fair

25   to workers without regard to age.                  All the people who


                                         51

 1   run these plans, who fund these plans, who are in these

 2   plans, are all lined up on Kentucky's side of the table.

 3              That should tell you that it's neither

 4   arbitrary nor discriminatory.             The plan is fair, and the

 5   plan does not violate the law.              We ask you to reverse

 6   the decision below and reinstate the district court's

 7   original final summary judgment.

 8              Thank you.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you

10   Mr. Klausner.   The case is submitted.

11              (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the

12   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
