 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT E. CATTANI

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. CATTANI:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The Ninth Circuit's rejection of a reasoned

11   State court factual determination and decision is

12   improper under any deferential standard of review, and

13   it is particularly improper under the highly deferential

14   standard of review required under the AEDPA.                 This

15   morning I'd like to try to develop three -- three

16   points.

17               First, the State court's factual finding

18   that Landrigan instructed his attorney not to present

19   any mitigating evidence was not an unreasonable finding

20   and, in fact, is the most logical interpretation of the

21   record.   Although Landrigan now argues that the record

22   does not show whether his decision not to present

23   mitigation evidence was knowing or voluntary, that is

24   not a claim that was ever developed in State court.                 He

25   never alleged in his State post-conviction proceedings


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that that, his decision to do that was not knowing or

 2   voluntary.

 3                 Secondly, an evidentiary hearing is

 4   unwarranted in this case --

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask about the first

 6   one?   Does the Constitution require there be no

 7   involuntary?

 8                 MR. CATTANI:         It would require that it would

 9   be knowing and voluntary, yes.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:             So if the record showed

11   that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to

12   voluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't

13   the district court be able to reexamine that?

14                 MR. CATTANI:         Well, there's no colloquy

15   requirement for a defendant to waive presentation of

16   mitigation.     And I think it would have been enough if

17   the defendant or defense counsel had simply said my --

18   if the attorney had said my client has instructed me not

19   to present any mitigating evidence, and that would be

20   adequate.     If a defendant chooses to make a claim that

21   his waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden

22   would shift to him to do that in a post-conviction

23   proceeding, and he did not do that in this case.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             How would he make such a

25   claim in this case where in open court he was asked by


                                          4

 1   the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether

 2   it was the case that he did not want any mitigating

 3   evidence introduced?      And he said, right, yes, that's

 4   correct?

 5               MR. CATTANI:         I agree, Your Honor.         It would

 6   be very difficult for him to make that argument and I

 7   suspect that's why the argument was not raised in the

 8   State post-conviction proceeding.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I don't know if you

10   got to the third point you were going to make.                You were

11   outlining three different points.                But it seems to me

12   that from the very start, what happens is that you and

13   your brother for the respondent are talking past each

14   other.   You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the

15   State court's finding.       The respondent says what we --

16   all we want is a hearing in the district court, and

17   those are two different issues.

18               We want a hearing in the district court,

19   i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial

20   or incorrect.   Those, it seems to me, are two different

21   issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each

22   other on this point.

23               Did you see the same thing?

24               MR. CATTANI:         Yes, I did, Your Honor, and I

25   think the reason for that is, in our view an evidentiary


                                        5

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   hearing is not necessary because the factual finding by

 2   the State court obviates the need for one.                An

 3   evidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that

 4   would never have been presented.                Given this factual

 5   finding, the State court is in effect saying no matter

 6   what counsel might or might not have developed, it would

 7   not have been presented at sentencing because this

 8   defendant specifically instructed his attorney not to

 9   present any mitigating evidence.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              In your view, what is the

11   standard for when the district court may hold an

12   evidentiary hearing?       I know there's an element of

13   discretion in it.

14              MR. CATTANI:           A district -- the district

15   court can order an evidentiary hearing if the defendant

16   has been denied an opportunity to develop relevant facts

17   necessary to resolve a colorable claim in State court.

18   And I think here the defendant fails on two different

19   points.

20              First --

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              That's the only time the

22   district court can hold a hearing?

23              MR. CATTANI:           Well, it has to be through no

24   fault of his own and if the facts were not developed in

25   State court.   Certainly it's the petitioner's


                                         6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   obligation, a defendant's obligation to present these

 2   claims in State court and the only -- the reason --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Yes, but it seems that if

 4   he doesn't do that, then that's a bar.                  But if he has

 5   done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?

 6               MR. CATTANI:         Well, but that's the point

 7   here.   He has not done that.            He did not attempt to

 8   develop facts or he was not precluded from developing

 9   facts that would be relevant to a resolution of his

10   ineffective assistance claim.

11               If I could, Your Honor, there are two

12   different parts of that question.                First, the facts are

13   not relevant.   The facts that he's seeking to develop in

14   an evidentiary hearing is this additional, this

15   mitigation that should have been developed.                 If, in

16   fact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to

17   be presented is accurate, then these other facts are not

18   relevant.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but isn't that the

20   problem in your argument?          Because your argument

21   assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a

22   moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he

23   informed the court that he did not want mitigation

24   evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of --

25   binds him as a matter of law for all time.


                                        7

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               And what he is saying here is look, if I had

 2   known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence,

 3   as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end

 4   of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver,

 5   if you want to call it that.             I would not have made that

 6   representation to the court.             And what I want is an

 7   evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact,

 8   when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I

 9   didn't mean this.

10               And he wants a hearing for that.                  The only

11   way it seems to me that you can properly win on the

12   issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I

13   think you said a moment ago.             That once there is a

14   finding that he made a statement, whatever its

15   predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating

16   evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a

17   matter of law.

18               My question is, do you have any authority

19   for that?

20               MR. CATTANI:          Simply the AEDPA 2254(e).            I

21   don't have a specific case that also would go directly

22   to that point.

23               Your Honor, I would also --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Justice Souter's

25   question highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit

 1   opinion, for me anyway.        Do you understand the hearing

 2   that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is

 3   the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation

 4   evidence that he now wants to present?

 5               MR. CATTANI:         It seems to me the hearing is

 6   directed at presenting all of the mitigation evidence

 7   that he now wants to present.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Doesn't it have to go to

 9   both?   Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to

10   show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence

11   that was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that

12   I wouldn't have objected to.

13               And he then wants to proceed with respect to

14   his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the

15   existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't

16   look to.

17               There's a dual purpose, I thought.

18               MR. CATTANI:         I would agree with that, but

19   Your Honor --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I wouldn't agree with it.

21   I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear

22   that it did not agree with the district court's

23   determination that he had waived mitigating evidence.               I

24   thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that

25   finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   evidence.

 2                MR. CATTANI:        Yes.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Isn't that so?    I mean,

 4   that's what that -- one of the reasons the case was

 5   here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a

 6   district court factual finding that he had waived any

 7   mitigating evidence.      Isn't that what happened?

 8                MR. CATTANI:        That's correct, Your Honor.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So it wasn't remanding for

10   a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence.

11   It made the determination that he had not waived it, and

12   then remanded for investigation into what that

13   mitigating evidence would be.

14                MR. CATTANI:        I don't know that it's

15   completely clear as to what the Ninth Circuit is saying

16   can be developed and how that evidence can be used.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, it's clear at least

18   that they disagreed with the finding of the district

19   court that there had been a waiver, no?

20                MR. CATTANI:        That's right, Your Honor, and

21   I think --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So it's clear that they

23   disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive.

24   Is anything clear beyond that?              I mean, I guess I'm

25   hesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Chief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court

 2   did.

 3               I mean, there's no question that they found

 4   that the -- the State trial court's finding with respect

 5   to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not

 6   necessarily dispositive.         I don't think it's clear that

 7   they found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm

 8   wrong.

 9               MR. CATTANI:         The Ninth Circuit ordered an

10   evidentiary hearing to allow him to develop whatever

11   mitigation he's proffered in Federal court.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Right.           But that could

13   have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual

14   purpose.   One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or

15   the nondispositive character of the State court's

16   finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate

17   assistance of counsel.

18               And the question here is that, the immediate

19   question is what exactly did the State court find with

20   respect to -- oh, sorry -- what exactly did the Ninth

21   Circuit find with respect to the State court finding?

22               And there's no question that the Ninth

23   Circuit assumed that the State court finding was not

24   necessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's

25   clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   could help me if I'm wrong.

 2              MR. CATTANI:         Well, the Ninth Circuit

 3   clearly held that the State court's determination of the

 4   facts was unreasonable.        And that's the problem with its

 5   decision because if the determination of facts was

 6   reasonable, it obviates the need for any further

 7   evidentiary hearing.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, on the waiver point,

 9   let's assume that this case had not come in -- come

10   here, and you had gone back to the district court

11   pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit.

12              Surely you would have taken the position, or

13   you could have taken the position if the evidence

14   developed that way, that he really knew or should have

15   known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived.

16   You certainly could continue to take that position in

17   the district court.

18              MR. CATTANI:         Yes.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And the district court

20   would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I

21   make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there

22   wasn't.

23              MR. CATTANI:         Yes, but the point we've tried

24   to make is that he was allowed an opportunity to develop

25   his claim about whether his -- whether he made that


                                      12

 1   statement and whether he intended to instruct his

 2   attorney not to present any mitigating evidence.            He

 3   submitted an affidavit where he said, if my counsel had

 4   told me there was this evidence of a genetic

 5   predisposition to violence, I would have allowed that to

 6   be presented.

 7                The court -- there was no need for an

 8   evidentiary hearing because the court simply accepted --

 9   accepted as true that Landrigan would have provided that

10   testimony.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, how could the district

12   court on remand find that there was a valid waiver when

13   the Ninth Circuit says on A-17, the appendix to the

14   petition, for all the foregoing reasons, Landrigan has

15   not waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective

16   assistance of counsel?

17                MR. CATTANI:        I think you're correct.        The

18   Ninth Circuit has specifically found that the

19   determination of facts was unreasonable and found that

20   Landrigan has established a colorable claim of

21   ineffective assistance.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And it has not waived.     Not

23   that the district court was -- didn't have enough

24   evidence before it.     It says the foregoing, Landrigan

25   has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective

 1   assistance.

 2                 So how can you possibly say that that

 3   question is still open?

 4                 MR. CATTANI:        Well, I --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The district court has to

 6   accept that he hasn't waived.              And what it's sent back

 7   for is for all of the facts that show -- that show he

 8   had ineffective assistance of counsel.

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me ask this question.

10   It seems to me that there are two separate parts to the

11   waiver issue.    One, did he intend to say I don't want to

12   put on any mitigating evidence?

13                 But then the second part of the question is,

14   was that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just

15   as a guilty plea or something like that has to be.

16                 So is it enough for you to say it's clear

17   what he intended, or is it also part of your burden to

18   say that that intent was expressed in a way that was

19   knowing and voluntary, compliant with the rule that

20   applies to waivers of constitutional rights?

21                 MR. CATTANI:        I think it's clearly enough

22   simply to say that, as I indicated, even if it had just

23   been an avowal by the attorney that this defendant has

24   instructed me not to present mitigating evidence, that

25   that would be enough.


                                        14

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is that a sufficient

 2   waiver without inquiring as to whether it was a knowing

 3   and intelligent waiver, that he knew what he could put

 4   in, and so forth and so on?

 5                 MR. CATTANI:        Yes, it is, Your Honor.       I

 6   think to the extent that the defendant wants to raise

 7   that, he can raise that in a State post-conviction

 8   proceeding.    He should make that type of argument in the

 9   post-conviction proceeding.

10                 And that's not what he did here.           An

11   analogous situation is that -- came up in a case that

12   the defense, that Landrigan has cited, Iowa versus

13   Tovar.   And this Court expressly noted that the time to

14   raise a claim -- that case involved whether it was a

15   counsel -- it was a decision to waive counsel at a plea

16   proceeding.    And this Court noted that the time to raise

17   that is in a post-conviction proceeding, and that the

18   burden shifts to the defendant to raise that issue.

19                 And here if you look at the, the petition

20   for post-conviction relief, if you look at the affidavit

21   that Mr. Landrigan submitted, there, there is nothing in

22   there that suggests that "I did not understand what I

23   was doing when I instructed my counsel not to present

24   mitigation.    I, I did not understand the concept of

25   mitigation."    There's nothing in there to suggest that.

 1   So I would --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Isn't there something that,

 3   isn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly "I

 4   didn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been

 5   aware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given

 6   that instruction?"

 7                 So he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying

 8   well, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I

 9   understood there was this kind of evidence and intended

10   to preclude its introduction?               Isn't that clear?

11                 MR. CATTANI:         It's clear he is saying that I

12   would have permitted one type of mitigating evidence.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that's the same thing,

14   isn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent

15   my waiver was not knowing?

16                 MR. CATTANI:         He, he's raised to it that

17   extent as to that particular piece of mitigation.               And

18   the trial court is expressly saying I disbelieve you

19   when you say you would have allowed presentation of that

20   mitigation.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And he's saying if you will

22   give me a hearing, district court, I will try to

23   demonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on

24   that point was unreasonable.              The State court made that

25   finding based on its observation of me at trial and, and


                                         16

 1   at the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a

 2   further chance to develop my evidence on, on

 3   post-conviction.

 4                And I want a hearing to develop that

 5   evidence in front of you, Federal district court, in

 6   order to prove that the State court's finding in light

 7   of that evidence was unreasonable.

 8                Isn't, isn't it correct that that's what

 9   he's asking for now?

10                MR. CATTANI:        He is, Your Honor, but I would

11   suggest that there is no further evidence that was

12   presented that he was attempting to present in State

13   court regarding whether his waiver was knowing or

14   voluntary.

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:           How would -- how do we know

16   that?

17                MR. CATTANI:        How do we know we know that?

18   Because of the, the affidavit he submitted.             And he,

19   he's required to submit an affidavit to establish a

20   colorable claim.   And, and he's required to allege in

21   his post-conviction petition that his waiver is not

22   knowing or voluntary.      But the burden is on the

23   defendant --

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But you, I don't think you

25   mean this, but you're not arguing that he just omitted

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the magic words not knowing and voluntary?

 2              MR. CATTANI:         I don't think, I don't think

 3   he just omitted them.     I think he was not raising that

 4   claim.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but, I thought a second

 6   ago you -- you admitted that to a degree he was, because

 7   he is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind

 8   of mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived.

 9   Therefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing

10   waiver.

11              MR. CATTANI:         He raised that as to that one

12   aspect of mitigation.     But it would have been very

13   simple for him, a simple matter for him to argue I

14   didn't understand the whole concept of mitigation.            I

15   didn't understand what I was doing.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Look, it would have been a

17   better affidavit, it would have been better pleading.

18   We can stipulate to that.         But is there, I don't see

19   there is any serious question that he is arguing right

20   now that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about

21   it I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be

22   precluded from, from getting it in now.

23              And, and if there's no question about that,

24   then -- then I think we're just fighting about words.

25              MR. CATTANI:         Well, I think the issue was

 1   resolved by the State court's factual determination that

 2   Landrigan was not credible even in making that assertion

 3   that I would have allowed presentation of genetic

 4   predisposition of violence.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And he says in the

 6   district, he says in the district court:                    I want a

 7   hearing to show that I was credible.                    So credible that

 8   the State court finding should be seen as an

 9   unreasonable resolution of a factual issue.                    I want a

10   hearing.

11              That's all he's asking for, isn't it?

12              MR. CATTANI:          I would just suggest that

13   there is no further evidence other than putting

14   Landrigan on the stand to say --

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, that's pretty good

16   evidence, isn't it?     I mean, he may be a believable

17   witness on this point.       I don't know.

18              MR. CATTANI:          Well, I don't think there was

19   any need for an, for the trial court to put Landrigan on

20   the stand having already presided over Landrigan's trial

21   and sentencing.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  If he wants, if he

23   wants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the Ninth

24   Circuit, right?   Because the Ninth Circuit held that he

25   didn't waive --

 1                 MR. CATTANI:         That's right.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- this claim?

 3                 MR. CATTANI:         That's right.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The part of the

 5   opinion that Justice Alito quoted on page A-17.

 6                 MR. CATTANI:         That, that's right, Your

 7   Honor.     And I think that's why this case should be

 8   relatively straightforward.

 9                 Because the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth

10   Circuit's finding, that the State court unreasonably

11   found that, that Landrigan expressly instructed that his

12   attorney not present any mitigation, given that --

13   that's the problem with the Ninth Circuit's opinion.

14   Everything else builds on top of that.

15                 If that's an incorrect holding, then the

16   rest of the ruling is, is incorrect.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Even if it is incorrect, if

18   we -- we don't know precisely what he meant by the words

19   he said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a

20   hearing?    At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't

21   he, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school

22   teacher, the various others?              And he'll say anyone who

23   listens to those people will see that I have the most

24   horrendous upbringing anyone could have.                  The worst

25   you've ever heard.

 1                And my argument is that if only my lawyer

 2   had looked into this at that moment in the trial, he

 3   would have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what

 4   I can present for you.        And if he had done it and told

 5   me that, anyone would have said, "of course, present

 6   it."    And I want a chance to show that that's true of my

 7   case.

 8                Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on

 9   that?    No hearing was given him in the State court.

10                MR. CATTANI:         Well, the problem with, that

11   Your Honor, is that he didn't ask for, for a hearing to

12   present testimony from, for example, his biological

13   mother and his ex-wife, who would have presented the

14   very evidence --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            In State court he didn't.

16                MR. CATTANI:         In State court in the --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I mean, is the

18   requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a

19   State court on a general matter, "I would like to show

20   through a hearing," then he gives a whole lot of

21   affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce,

22   that then the State says "no," you go into Federal court

23   and say "I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have

24   a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra

25   things," no, you can't do that?

 1              MR. CATTANI:            Well, there is a requirement

 2   in State court that you plead with specificity what type

 3   of claims you're raising in a post-conviction --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:               Didn't he say my claim is

 5   ineffective assistance?

 6              MR. CATTANI:            Ineffective assistance --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:               Yeah.       Because he didn't

 8   investigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in

 9   which I was raised, and had he done it, he would have

10   found roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to

11   show that he should have done that because it would have

12   changed the result?

13              MR. CATTANI:            Well, his argument at

14   State court was not that he didn't investigate that; his

15   argument in the post-conviction proceeding was he could

16   have presented that through some other witnesses.

17   The -- his argument at the trial -- at the

18   post-conviction --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    That's not what I

20   understood his argument that he wants to raise to be.

21   In his affidavit, it is a different argument.                   It is the

22   biological component of violence.                  "Look, my grandfather

23   was convicted, my father was convicted," and so the

24   mitigating evidence he wants to present at sentencing

25   that is I'm biologically predetermined to commit crimes.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The criminal gene argument.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That -- which is

 3   certainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation

 4   at a sentencing hearing.

 5                 MR. CATTANI:        Certainly.             And that is, that

 6   is the main point I'm trying to make is that that was

 7   the only thing he was asserting in his post-conviction

 8   proceeding, was that "I would have liked have raised

 9   this argument that I'm generically predisposed to

10   violence."    The rest of the argument I think would have

11   been frivolous because it was so obvious that he had

12   restricted, he had limited his counsel's, restricted his

13   counsel from presenting the very type of evidence that

14   we're talking about now, this other type of evidence.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I thought all that evidence

16   was basically before the district court anyway.                    Didn't

17   the district court know about all of that when it made

18   its ruling?

19                 MR. CATTANI:        Yes, Your Honor and the trial

20   court knew about it when it made its ruling.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, the district court

22   had a proffer, but the district court but had not heard

23   witnesses, it had not heard evidence.

24                 MR. CATTANI:        But, but the focus here is on

25   the reasonableness of the State court's factual finding.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Sure, but the

 2   reasonableness of factual findings depends on what the

 3   evidence is that can go in on the issue of

 4   reasonableness.   And there's a universe of difference

 5   between a proffer of evidence which the district court

 6   says "well, I'll assume that," on the one hand, and on

 7   the other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses

 8   perhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court

 9   actually hears.

10               You know, you, sometimes you get a lot more

11   impressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make

12   for the sake of argument.            And that seems to me a world

13   of difference.

14               MR. CATTANI:           I don't necessarily disagree

15   except that we're -- the focus has to be on what the

16   claim was that was raised in the State post-conviction

17   proceeding; and --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:              The only thing, but the --

19   the -- I guess on that point, my only, my only reason

20   for raising this with you is on that point, it's not

21   enough to say well, the district court assumed this.              Or

22   for that matter, the State trial court assumed this.

23               That is not the same thing as putting in the

24   evidence.

25               MR. CATTANI:           Except in this case we

 1   certainly had the trial court that presided over the

 2   sentencing and had seen Landrigan in person and was

 3   uniquely qualified to make a credibility assessment

 4   regarding the points that Landrigan made in his

 5   affidavit, that "I would have allowed presentation of

 6   genetic predisposition."

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask what might be an

 8   awfully elementary and stupid question?                 But -- it seems

 9   to me that there's no question about the facts of what

10   he said.   And you can interpret him saying I don't want

11   any mitigating evidence put it.              But isn't it clear that

12   the waiver of the right to put in any mitigating

13   evidence at a capital sentencing hearing is a

14   constitutional right of very important dimensions?

15               And can that right be waived if the record

16   does not show whether or not he knew the full right

17   of -- that is available to every defendant in a capital

18   case?   Namely, he had been advised by his counsel he

19   could put in all sorts of stuff.               Is there anything to

20   show that there was that kind of waiver here, on the

21   face of the record?

22               MR. CATTANI:         There, there's not a specific

23   colloquy that goes through --

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Then it is, as a matter of

25   law, an ineffective waiver.            Isn't the Ninth Circuit

 1   dead right, not factually, but just as a matter of law,

 2   that you cannot waive this right unless the record shows

 3   that he's fully advised of the scope of the right that

 4   he's waiving.

 5              MR. CATTANI:            Well, first, there's no

 6   authority that I'm aware of that would require any type

 7   of a specific colloquy.          I think this record --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It's new to me also.           I

 9   never heard of it.

10              MR. CATTANI:            And I think that would be --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:               But why should it be, why

12   should there be a less complete colloquy for this kind

13   of waiver than a guilty plea itself?                      Now I admit

14   there's no authority on the point.                   But isn't it

15   absolutely obvious?

16              MR. CATTANI:            Well, I think the reason

17   there's no need for one is because a defendant can come

18   in and if he really believes that his waiver was not

19   knowing and voluntary, he has an opportunity to pursue

20   that type of claim in a post-conviction proceeding.                         And

21   he can come in and proffer whatever evidence he wants to

22   proffer if, in fact, that's his claim, that he didn't

23   understand --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Some kind of waivers, like

25   waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a

 1   colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what

 2   consequences of foregoing counsel are.                     So the judge

 3   discusses with him and, you know, points out what a --

 4   what a significant decision that is.                     But it doesn't

 5   take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the

 6   question, you know, "do you agree that your counsel

 7   should not introduce any mitigating evidence?"                     I mean,

 8   it's clear on, on its face.

 9                 MR. CATTANI:        I would agree, Your Honor.

10   And I think --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But doesn't that assume

12   that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is?                      I

13   mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, "I

14   thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what

15   the, these two relatives were going to testify to.

16   There was really much more, if my counsel had

17   investigated."    And that's not a knowing waiver.

18                 MR. CATTANI:        I think that type of argument

19   was belied by what, what happened at the time of

20   sentencing.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, unless the argument

22   is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to

23   argue, that -- that when you make waiver of all

24   mitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's

25   reached that far in the criminal process what mitigating

 1   evidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements

 2   of mitigation that could have been introduced.                 Which

 3   will almost never be the case.                So that it's always

 4   possible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating

 5   evidence to come into the court a year later and say,

 6   "Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence

 7   I didn't know about at the time.                 My grandfather was a

 8   criminal.     I didn't realize that at the time.              And now I

 9   want" -- you know -- "therefore my waiver was

10   uninformed" and, you know, we go back to square one and

11   try the case again.

12                 That would always be possible, wouldn't it?

13                 MR. CATTANI:         Well, I agree, Your Honor.

14   And it's because the nature of mitigation is so open

15   ended, it would be difficult to explain precisely and

16   have a waiver of every conceivable item of mitigation.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And so are you, are you in

18   effect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a

19   knowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based

20   upon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation

21   evidence that in this case might come in?                 Are you

22   saying it need not be knowing in that sense?

23                 MR. CATTANI:         I think a defendant needs to

24   understand the nature -- the basic nature and concept of

25   mitigation.    But this case provides a good example --

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, you're not answering

 2   my question.    I -- we all agree that he needs to

 3   understand the basic concept of mitigation.               Does his

 4   waiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that I just

 5   described?     Or doesn't it?         What's your position?

 6                 MR. CATTANI:         It does have to -- it does not

 7   have to be knowing as to every conceivable aspect of

 8   mitigation.

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And it will nonetheless

10   kind him if he comes in later and says look, I accept

11   the fact that it's my burden to show at this point that

12   my waiver was not a knowing one, and that there us

13   mitigating evidence that I would have let in?

14                 Are you saying that he simply as a matter of

15   law cannot say that?        Or cannot be heard to say that?

16                 MR. CATTANI:         He is bound by that, Your

17   Honor.   And if I could --

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            So -- so the answer to my

19   question is yes?

20                 MR. CATTANI:         Yes.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            As a matter of law, he

22   cannot do what he is trying to do here?

23                 MR. CATTANI:         Yes.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 1   we have a situation where the defendant is now trying to

 2   proffer evidence that is inconsistent with what counsel

 3   was trying to present at the time of sentencing.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you are -- what you

 5   are saying is that it was sufficient when he said, I

 6   don't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence,

 7   and the trial court said, do you know what that means,

 8   and he said yes?

 9                 MR. CATTANI:        Yes.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That doesn't have to be

11   fleshed out at all, unlike a Rule 11 colloquy.                  To see

12   if he really understands?           Do you know what that means,

13   and he yes and that's the end of it?

14                 MR. CATTANI:        I think that is sufficient,

15   Your Honor.    And again, here he's now raising this claim

16   of genetic predisposition.           The sentencing memorandum

17   that counsel submitted attempted to pore Landrigan as

18   someone who is basically a good person who committed

19   this crime because he was under the influence of alcohol

20   and drugs.    This new type of evidence -- and the

21   sentencing memorandum -- and you'll see that Landrigan

22   had been evaluated by an expert, who had said he didn't

23   have any mental deficiencies.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 1          ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

 2                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 3                 MR. VERRILLI:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 4   and may it please the Court:

 5                 I'd like to begin by clearing up what

 6   exactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver

 7   and what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that

 8   set of issues in our judgment.               I then would like to

 9   spend a couple of minutes on what I think the Ninth

10   Circuit did and what effect that would have on this

11   Court's disposition of the case.                And if there's any

12   time remaining.    I'd like to turn to the question of

13   whether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant

14   an evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're

15   asking for.

16                 Now, with respect to this question of

17   whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid

18   counsel for the State is just wrong about this.                 It's

19   important to understand how this comes up.                 We asserted

20   a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient

21   performance and prejudice.           The State asserted as a

22   defense to that claim:        No, no, he's waived.

23                 And the trial judge, the State habeas judge

24   in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that

25   and said, well, yes, he's waived.                 We then filed a


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't

 2   rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing

 3   and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst.

 4   That's at page 92 of the joint appendix.

 5               That motion for rehearing was denied without

 6   any further comment.      We then took a petition to review

 7   to the Arizona Supreme Court.             That's also in the joint

 8   appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in

 9   which we specifically argued that you can't look to this

10   so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of

11   ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and

12   intent.

13               Now, in the State's response to our

14   petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint

15   appendix but is in the record, the State says:                 No, this

16   waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally

17   defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct

18   review.   But the one thing the State does not say is

19   that you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too

20   late, it can't be considered.

21               We then went to --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.       I'm looking at

23   page 92 of the joint appendix.              I don't, I don't see

24   that.

25               MR. VERRILLI:          I may have the wrong page.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's rather

 2   important, don't you think?

 3                 MR. VERRILLI:          I'm sorry.           I will find it

 4   for Your Honor.

 5                 I'm sorry for the delay here.                   The motion

 6   for rehearing is, I'm sorry, 99, and on 102 is where we

 7   raise it, and then subsequently -- then subsequently we

 8   raise it --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that effective?         Does

10   the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?

11                 MR. VERRILLI:          Well, it doesn't have to,

12   but, Your Honor --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Isn't it your obligation to

14   raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion

15   for rehearing?

16                 MR. VERRILLI:          Well, there's no -- but the

17   point is that's not -- when we took this to the Arizona

18   Supreme Court that's not an argument that the State made

19   in opposition to our raising Johnson against Zerbst.

20   Then when we got to the Federal district court we raised

21   this again, this exact argument in Federal district

22   court, and the State in Federal district court didn't

23   object that we had failed to raise this appropriately in

24   the State proceedings.

25                 We took it to the Ninth Circuit.                  They


                                         33

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   didn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it

 2   appropriately in the State proceedings.                   The first time

 3   that question has even been raised here is in the reply

 4   brief on the merits in this Court.

 5              And I think that's tied to the next point I

 6   want to make, which is significant, which is as the case

 7   comes to this Court the Ninth Circuit has ruled that we

 8   have met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are

 9   therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

10              Now, what the State is essentially saying

11   is, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an

12   evidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you

13   didn't raise them adequately in the State court.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And is it just an

15   evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination

16   to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the

17   waiver question?

18              MR. VERRILLI:             On both, Your Honor.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, why did -- the

20   court on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver.                   So

21   why would they then send it back for an evidentiary

22   hearing on waiver?

23              MR. VERRILLI:             Let me move to that if I

24   could, because I do think that's significant.                   I think

25   the Court has elucidated the two potential readings of


                                         34

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Ninth Circuit's decision.             It seemed to us as we

 2   prepared this case on the merits that the reality is

 3   that the two, the issue of performance and the issue of

 4   waiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after

 5   a hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a

 6   diligent job of performing the investigation, and did

 7   instruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence

 8   was, then you view the waiver in a different light than

 9   of course you would if the counsel hadn't.              So we

10   acknowledge here that the proper disposition of this

11   case ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that wasn't your

13   assertion even in this motion for a hearing.              It wasn't

14   that he didn't know what he was giving up.              It was

15   rather the sentencing transcript, you say, "does not

16   establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and

17   intelligently waived his right to present mitigating

18   evidence.   Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that

19   right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in

20   frustration with his attorney during that particular

21   proceeding."

22               MR. VERRILLI:          We're trying to establish

23   there, Your Honor --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that was a factual

25   matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was


                                       35

 1   present at the time.      And he didn't think it was in the

 2   heat of anger.   He did think that it was a valid waiver.

 3   Now, you're raising a totally different issue.          You're

 4   saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all

 5   the elements of mitigation that the waiver might

 6   embrace.   That wasn't the argument you were making here.

 7               MR. VERRILLI:          Your Honor, I want to respond

 8   directly to Your Honor's question, if you'll just permit

 9   me one more thought about the Ninth Circuit and I'll

10   turn right back to that.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

12               MR. VERRILLI:          So in other words, we are

13   making a more modest request for relief here which, is

14   affirmance of the judgment sending back for an

15   evidentiary hearing, but with a recognition that the

16   evidentiary hearing ought to deal with the issue of

17   waiver, which should be understood to be left open.            I

18   think we're conceding something here, that waiver ought

19   to be left open and not definitively resolved.          It's

20   premature to definitively resolve that against the State

21   without an inquiry.

22               Now, turning to Your Honor's point, the --

23   with respect to whether there was a waiver here or not

24   and what the State judge did or didn't do, something

25   very significant here that I think the State's argument


                                       36

 1   just overlooks.    There's an assumption in the State's

 2   argument that Landrigan's conduct at the sentencing

 3   hearing itself was a waiver and considered to be a

 4   waiver.   But if one looks at the transcript of that

 5   hearing, and this is D to the appendix to the petition

 6   and beginning at page D-4 -- D-3 is where the colloquy

 7   occurs where this alleged waiver happened.                     The very

 8   next thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs,

 9   is the trial judge says:          Okay, I want to hear from the

10   mitigation witnesses.

11               Then the mitigation witnesses say:                     Well,

12   we're not going to testify.             Then the very next thing

13   that occurs is the trial judge says:                     Well, I want a

14   proffer of what they would have said.                     Then when -- then

15   when all that's said and done, the trial judge says to

16   the lawyer -- - and this is at D-15 -- you got anything

17   else, and the lawyer says, no, Your Honor, that's all

18   I've got, all I've got is what's in the sentencing memo

19   and these two witnesses.          Then the judge proceeds to

20   pass sentence.    That's the -- the particularly important

21   pages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see

22   that what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's

23   statements as a waiver, because if she had treated those

24   statements as a waiver what she would have said is,

25   well, here's the aggravation case, Mr. Landrigan has


                                        37

 1   waived mitigation, he has a right to do that.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           This is belt and

 3   suspenders, that's all.        The -- I don't think any judge

 4   likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver.

 5   This judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't

 6   waived it there's nothing there --

 7                MR. VERRILLI:         I respectfully --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- because he wasn't

 9   bringing in at this point the biological -- by the way,

10   biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor

11   rather than an aggravating factor?

12                MR. VERRILLI:         Let me address your second

13   question first and then your first question.

14                I think that that in two senses does not

15   accurately represent what this mitigation case presented

16   to the State court and presented to the Federal court is

17   all about.   With respect even to his affidavit, which I

18   don't think fairly under Arizona procedure can define

19   the full scope of his claim, but with respect to that

20   affidavit alone, what it says is not genetic

21   predisposition.   It says the "biological component of

22   violence."   That's the language that Mr. Landrigan's

23   affidavit uses.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but the prior

25   paragraph says it's because of the history of his


                                       38
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   biological grandfather, biological brother, and

 2   biological child.    That suggests to me it's a genetic

 3   claim and --

 4                 MR. VERRILLI:         But one other thing it does

 5   that's very significant, Mr. Chief Justice, is it also

 6   says that these witnesses can attest to the use of

 7   alcohol and drugs by the biological mother when

 8   Landrigan was in utero.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but he knew

10   about that.    He knew about that mitigating evidence at

11   the trial because his biological mother was there.

12                 MR. VERRILLI:         Yes, but what he's saying

13   that he would have agreed to, it seems to me the only

14   fair reading in this affidavit, which again I don't

15   think fairly defines the full scope of what he's allowed

16   to proceed with under Arizona procedure, but with

17   respect to this affidavit he's saying, well, if you had

18   had an expert who could have come in and given testimony

19   about fetal alcohol syndrome and the organic brain

20   damage and other impairments that it causes, I would

21   have cooperated with that.           And that's really

22   significant because if you look at page D-21 of the

23   appendix to the petition --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How could that be

25   helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother


                                        39
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to testify about drug and alcohol abuse?                  What use would

 2   the expert be if the potential predicate --

 3              MR. VERRILLI:            Because all the biological

 4   mother would have had to do was to give that information

 5   to the expert.    That's a routine matter, for experts to

 6   gather factual information and assimilate it into an

 7   expert opinion and then provide it to the court.                  That

 8   could have happened easily here.

 9              And I think it's very significant because on

10   page 21 you'll see that the trial judge makes a

11   fundamental error about this exact issue.                  She says:

12   Well, I'll grant this, I'll take the mother's testimony

13   as a proffer.    I'll consider the possibility of fetal

14   alcohol syndrome, but all fetal alcohol syndrome

15   establishes is that the kid will also have a

16   predisposition to addiction.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   The defendant would

18   have been happy to have his biological mother talk with

19   the expert, but was unwilling to have his biological

20   mother say the same thing in court?

21              MR. VERRILLI:            Sure, and I don't think

22   there's anything unreasonable about that.                  Those are

23   very different experiences, but --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't understand.       It

25   seems unreasonable to me.           He was trying to spare his


                                        40
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court?

 2   That's what he had in mind?

 3                MR. VERRILLI:         If I -- whatever else

 4   happened, the trial judge here considered this evidence

 5   of mitigation and did a weighing.                And the key point I

 6   want to make sure I make here is that therefore any

 7   evidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on

 8   fetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other

 9   evidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the

10   time and had considered at the time and had weighed at

11   the time by this trial judge.             And that's a claim of

12   prejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even

13   if one assumes -- and we dispute it and I'd like too

14   talk about that -- but even if one assumes that there is

15   a finding and we can't do anything about it that

16   Landrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation

17   of any --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, do you

19   think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the

20   presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always

21   possible that some additional evidence would come up and

22   you say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have

23   waived it?

24                MR. VERRILLI:         I don't think there's a yes

25   or no answer to that question.              It's something --


                                       41
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You can't give a yes

 2   answer to whether it's ever possible.

 3               MR. VERRILLI:          Yes.      Yes, it's possible.

 4   It's certainly possible.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay.

 6               MR. VERRILLI:          But I think I don't -- I want

 7   to make sure I don't leave any implication that the rule

 8   we're asking for here is going to open the door to lots

 9   of claims, because I don't think it does for two sets of

10   reasons.   One is a procedural set of reasons and that's

11   the -- that, we refer the Court to the Blackledge

12   against Allison decision -- that if -- that it's not

13   going to be enough in every case for you to plead an

14   adequate claim and then jump right to an evidentiary

15   hearing.   As the court said in Allison, the district

16   court has available to it a number of tools that it can

17   use to test the claim before granting an evidentiary

18   hearing.   So there's a limitation there.                    Now --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could you do it

20   concretely, Mr. Verrilli, for this case.                     The defendant

21   is being rather obstreperous and says:                    I don't want any

22   mitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy.                     And that's

23   how he's trying to portray himself.                     What -- you said,

24   and you allow for the possibility that there could be a

25   knowing waiver of mitigation.             What would have had to


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?

 2                MR. VERRILLI:         I think that's important, and

 3   hopefully it will help explain why we think that this is

 4   a narrow -- that the rule we're asking for here is a

 5   narrow one, and it's not going to open the door to lots

 6   of claims.   It's clear that just like the waiver of any

 7   other fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial,

 8   the defendant's got to understand what mitigation means.

 9   He's got to understand its significance in the

10   proceedings --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, he certainly

12   understood that.   He said if you want to give me the

13   death penalty, bring it on, I'm ready for it.                 The

14   purpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the

15   imposition of the death penalty.               He says bring it on.

16                MR. VERRILLI:         And he needs to be assisted

17   by competent counsel.      That's a consistent theme of this

18   Court's decisions on the Johnson inquiry.                 And so if you

19   have a situation in which you have documented that the

20   client understands what mitigation is -- and frankly I

21   don't think, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice,

22   this is the kind of documentation that ought to suffice.

23   But even if you had that, even if you documented that

24   the defendant understood it, even if you documented that

25   the defendant clearly waived it and documented that was


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   done with counsel's assistance, then it seems to me it

 2   is going to be very hard for a habeas petitioner to

 3   plead something that's going to get past --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why isn't the type

 5   of documentation that would be sufficient?                   He

 6   understands what the consequence of not putting

 7   mitigating evidence on is going to be.

 8                 MR. VERRILLI:          Well, because I think there

 9   isn't clarity at all that he understands what mitigating

10   evidence is, what the full scope of it is and how it

11   could --

12                 THE COURT:       He's present in the court while

13   they're making a proffer of this sort of mitigating

14   evidence.     The judge is quite careful, saying okay, if

15   he doesn't want the evidence, I want to know what it is.

16   And he called the two witnesses.                 And all that this

17   defendant does is undermine his lawyer's effort to

18   present the mitigation.

19                 MR. VERRILLI:          But again, Mr. Chief Justice,

20   at the time the trial judge didn't treat that as a

21   waiver.     And so I don't think you can cut off his

22   ability to litigate an ineffective assistance claim

23   years later on the ground that it was an ineffective

24   waiver.

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, are you claiming that


                                         44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately

 2   represent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to

 3   the question of waiver?       In other words, when -- that

 4   the attorney should have insisted that the judge go

 5   through some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with

 6   him about waiver and inform him of certain things about

 7   what he was giving up?      Are you making that claim?

 8              MR. VERRILLI:          I think, Justice Alito, we're

 9   making a couple of different claims, not that claim, but

10   a couple of different claims.            One is, and it pertains

11   particularly to a mental health expert, that even if

12   Landrigan behaved exactly the way -- at 13 -- he in fact

13   behaved in the counterfactual world in which he had

14   received adequate representation, that the mental health

15   expert testimony could have been proffered to the Court,

16   had it been prepared and developed, would have been

17   considered, and could have made a critically important

18   difference and for precisely the reason that

19   Justice Ginsburg's question suggested, which is that

20   he's obviously behaving badly in this situation.

21              What the trial court ruled out of that is,

22   well, he's an amoral person.           What the mental health

23   testimony would give you is an alternative frame of

24   reference for making a reasoned moral judgment about

25   this guy, and could be critically important in


                                      45
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   explaining that behavior.          So even within the confines

 2   of accepting that the world would have unfolded exactly

 3   the way it did, it was ineffective to have dropped the

 4   ball on preparing that kind of evidence.

 5              Then it's also ineffective in --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.       I'm not

 7   following you.   You mean the mental health expert's

 8   testimony could have gone to whether the judge should

 9   have accepted the waiver?

10              MR. VERRILLI:           No.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I thought that's what you

12   were saying, I'm sorry.

13              MR. VERRILLI:           No, to the basic weighing the

14   mitigation which the judge undertook based on all

15   proffered evidence.     Then beyond that, we're making an

16   argument that the waiver that, even if you are going to

17   consider that a waiver, you can't consider it a knowing

18   and voluntary waiver, knowing intelligent waiver

19   supported adequately by the efforts of counsel.

20              JUSTICE ALITO:           Isn't that a separate

21   question, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver?

22   Isn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which

23   is a question of fact, which is a question of whether

24   had he been informed of the possibility of mitigation

25   evidence relating to a history of family violence, he


                                       46

 1   would have persisted in blocking the admission of any

 2   mitigation evidence?      Isn't that the issue?              Not whether

 3   it was knowing and intelligent.              That would be a

 4   separate legal question.

 5               MR. VERRILLI:          No.      I don't think that's the

 6   issue.   With all due respect, Justice Alito, I think the

 7   test under Strickland is whether there was sufficient

 8   performance, which we think we have a very powerful

 9   record of here, and then a reasonable probability that

10   the outcome would have been different.                  And I think the

11   inquiry here that the State habeas judge is undertaking

12   is the reasonable probability inquiry.                  That seems to me

13   to be a mixed question that requires --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes, it's a mixed question.

15   But if the post-conviction relief court found as a

16   matter of fact that even had he known about the

17   possibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he

18   would have persisted in refusing to cooperate -- if

19   there was such a finding, and know you dispute it -- and

20   if you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would

21   have to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?

22               MR. VERRILLI:          Well, taking our first

23   argument to the side, our first argument which I've been

24   discussing about what happened at the hearing, I think

25   with respect to that argument the answer's no, that


                                       47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   argument stands without any need to disprove the factual

 2   finding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we

 3   don't concede that.

 4                But if it is a factual finding, then yes, we

 5   would have to disprove it by clear and convincing

 6   evidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're

 7   asking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           What is the standard?     I

 9   ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard

10   previously -- I think the State was saying that the only

11   issue that was raised before the State proceeding,

12   collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing

13   proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that

14   he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something

15   like that.

16                When I've looked at this, it's on page 88,

17   the motion filed says we have two claims.               One claim is

18   the claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about

19   it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and

20   alcohol.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where are you quoting from?

22   I'm sorry.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:           Joint appendix A.     And then

24   there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to

25   failing to investigate these alternative sources, we


                                       48

 1   also want to say that counsel failed to explore

 2   additional grounds, and that was the sister.                  And the

 3   sister was going to testify that the mother -- the

 4   foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she

 5   has a whole list of things in her affidavit.

 6                 So is that still before us?                I mean, isn't

 7   that something you want to argue?

 8                 MR. VERRILLI:         Absolutely.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.

10                 MR. VERRILLI:         Thank you, Your Honor, for

11   bringing us back to that question.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And then the claim would be

13   this:   You want a hearing in which you're going to

14   present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what

15   the school says, what happened to him at school, all

16   things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the

17   State court, and that the biological gene.                 And you want

18   to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your

19   mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this

20   been looked into and presented to the defendant, the

21   defendant would not have said don't present any of that,

22   it would have been presented, and it would have made a

23   difference.

24                 What -- is that what you want to do?

25                 MR. VERRILLI:         Yes.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.

 2               MR. VERRILLI:           With one addition, which is

 3   this one, fetal alcohol syndrome expert testimony is

 4   very important.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right, with that too.

 6               MR. VERRILLI:           Yes.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:             Now, what the Ninth Circuit

 8   said is, we'll give you a hearing.                  We don't know if

 9   you're right or wrong.        What's the standard for giving

10   you the hearing?   I -- a lot of things in the law aren't

11   always written down exactly, and I was under the

12   impression that trial judges often give hearings on what

13   you might call seat of the pants.                 I'd like to hear more

14   about it.   I've been on appellate courts where rightly

15   or wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know

16   more about this.   I can't quite understand it.                Let's

17   have a hearing.    And we're going to tell the trial judge

18   to do it.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Verrilli, I thought you

20   already conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for

21   a hearing on this question of whether he had waived,

22   effectively waived mitigating evidence.

23               MR. VERRILLI:           No.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             That isn't what the Ninth

25   Circuit said.

 1                 MR. VERRILLI:          Well, but --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It found that he had not

 3   waived mitigating evidence.              So what --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm not actually talking

 5   about waiver.     My question was just generally what I

 6   asked.     What is the standard there on whether you get a

 7   hearing?

 8                 MR. VERRILLI:          Justice Scalia, would you

 9   permit me to answer that question, and I'll come back to

10   Your Honor's?

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Whatever.

12                 MR. VERRILLI:          Thank you.           The -- with

13   respect to the standard, there are two things that we

14   have to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing.

15   One is that we're not disentitled under the analysis

16   under Section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the Court's

17   Michael Williams decision, to show that the court below

18   found it, it was not raised in the cert petition.                       We

19   pointed out in the brief in opposition that it wasn't

20   raised, it had nothing about it.                 That's established and

21   the case comes to the court.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What is established?

23   That you've satisfied (e)(2)?

24                 MR. VERRILLI:          That (e)(2) does not apply to

25   us proceeding to an evidentiary hearing.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why, because you

 2   satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?

 3                MR. VERRILLI:         Because the -- there is no

 4   lack of diligence here that would trigger us meeting the

 5   heightened requirements of (e)(2), and therefore it

 6   doesn't apply to bar us.         That's the theory.

 7                Now, with -- the other thing we have to

 8   show --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry, you'll

10   just have to bear with me.

11                MR. VERRILLI:         I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you're saying you

13   satisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of

14   diligence.   Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B),

15   which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would

16   have found him guilty, in other words words subject to

17   --

18                MR. VERRILLI:         No.      No, Your Honor.     That's

19   -- as we understand the Michael Williams decision

20   interpreting that provision, Your Honor, those

21   requirements only kick in in a situation where you

22   haven't shown diligence and therefore you're at fault,

23   and you can overcome your fault by meeting those

24   heightened standards.      They don't apply in a situation

25   where you have been diligent and therefore you're not --

 1   they don't apply to you at all.

 2               With respect to the -- what else -- with

 3   respect to what else we'd have to show, we'd have to

 4   show that -- and this is the Townsend standard, which

 5   nothing has changed -- that we've alleged facts which,

 6   if proven, entitle us to relief.                 Those are the two

 7   things we have to show and we've done both of those

 8   things.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And the district court has

10   substantial discretion in determining whether or not to

11   grant that hearing on that basis.

12               MR. VERRILLI:            And the Ninth Circuit -- and

13   it seems to us actually, Your Honor, under Townsend in

14   that situation the hearing's mandatory.                   The district

15   court would have discretion under habeas, under habeas

16   practice, to hold a hearing as a discretionary matter

17   even in a situation where we haven't shown a mandatory

18   entitlement to it.      So there is discretion there.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Part of that discretion

20   is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a

21   likelihood of a different result?

22               MR. VERRILLI:            Yes.      Yes.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So it seems to me that

24   that is the difficult part of your case based on this

25   evidence.

 1                MR. VERRILLI:          Well, but I think -- what I

 2   think is important there is that that issue ought to be

 3   decided after an evidentiary hearing when you know what

 4   it's going to be.    It's premature to decide that --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, we know what the

 6   fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.

 7                MR. VERRILLI:          Well, that's true.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And we could make a

 9   determination or the court of appeals could make a

10   determination or the district court could make a

11   determination how likely that would to be affect the

12   result.

13                MR. VERRILLI:          Well, they could, but it

14   seems to me not until you actually hear the expert

15   testimony, and then we have all of the other testimony

16   that Justice Breyer detailed that you'd want to

17   consider.

18                I do want to try to come back,

19   Justice Scalia, to your point.               Yes, we acknowledge that

20   the Ninth Circuit went too far in the way Your Honor

21   described.   But you don't get from that conclusion to

22   the conclusion that you ought to grant the relief that

23   the State is requesting here, which is a reversal and

24   directing dismissal of the petition, because to get to

25   that you have to show that there's no set of

 1   circumstances under which we could prevail.

 2              We're -- our position is an intermediate

 3   one, which is that the right answer here is that the

 4   judgment to send it back for an evidentiary hearing was

 5   correct and should be affirmed.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What do you do

 7   with -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the

 8   dissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the

 9   mitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, "genetic

10   predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its

11   aggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was

12   undeterable and even from prison would present a future

13   danger"?

14              MR. VERRILLI:          I think the answer is that

15   that is an inappropriately truncated assessment of the

16   mitigation case and a wrongly focused assessment of the

17   mitigation case, which ought to Focus on the troubled

18   history and the fetal alcohol syndrome, which provide a

19   medical mental health explanation for his conduct which

20   is quite different and that -- and so that's what ought

21   to be balanced.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That was presented

23   in the State court proceedings.

24              MR. VERRILLI:          That's not correct, Your

25   Honor.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The biological

 2   mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.

 3               MR. VERRILLI:          The fact that she used

 4   abusive -- that she abused alcohol, but not the medical

 5   expert testimony explaining what effects that would

 6   have.   That's precisely the thing that wasn't there and

 7   that was the big problem.

 8               So I do think that that -- that's why we

 9   need an evidentiary hearing, to develop that.                     This

10   weighing, by the way --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So you think the

12   State trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol

13   syndrome?

14               MR. VERRILLI:          Well, if you look at page

15   D-21, Mr. Chief Justice, what you'll see is actually

16   proof in the transcript that she had no familiarity,

17   because she said on page D-21 all it does is predispose

18   you to being an addict yourself.               But fetal alcohol

19   syndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that

20   can bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability.

21               If I could just say --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I have just one other

23   question on a different matter.              In Judge Bias's

24   dissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from

25   the Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed


                                       56

 1   with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled.                    Can

 2   you comment on that?

 3                MR. VERRILLI:          Sure.       What there was that

 4   the Ninth Circuit, upon receiving this letter, contacted

 5   counsel for Mr. Landrigan, asked him -- asked them to go

 6   visit him in prison and find out what's going on.                 They

 7   did so.    They reported back to the Ninth Circuit that

 8   Mr. Landrigan did in fact want to proceed with the

 9   appeals.    He has continued to want to proceed with the

10   appeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns

11   out there were neurological problems that were

12   afflicting him, very serious, at the time.                 So that's

13   what happened.

14                If I could say in conclusion, just remind

15   the Court what it said in the first Norrell decision,

16   that even in the world of habeas there's a difference

17   between deference and abdication.                 And in a situation

18   like this one, in which the State court has not afforded

19   an evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the

20   development of the evidence that bears directly on

21   Mr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication

22   to hold that he can be conclusively barred from

23   proceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on

24   the basis of the present record.

25                Thank you.
