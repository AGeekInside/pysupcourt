 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MS. MAHONEY:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 If this Court adheres to its State action

12   ruling, it should now hold that the TSSAA has broad

13   discretion to adopt and to enforcement contractual

14   restrictions on athletic recruiting as a condition of

15   membership.    Under this Court's cases, Brentwood cannot

16   escape the contractual bargain it's made under the First

17   Amendment, because the association offered it a

18   reasonable choice as measured by the three criteria that

19   this Court has used to identify unconstitutional

20   conditions.

21                 First, participation in the state

22   tournaments is entirely voluntary.                  Second, the

23   restrictions at issue here are germane to the legitimate

24   goals of the association.           And third, enforcement of the

25   rule here imposed only a minimal burden on speech of


                                         3

 1   private concerns.

 2              I would like to turn first to the issue of

 3   voluntariness, because that's a core issue in every case

 4   involving allegedly unconstitutional conditions.

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               May I ask you a

 6   preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney?

 7              And that is, we are told that at the time

 8   this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and

 9   it was all right for one school to invite students from

10   another school to join the invitee school's practice.

11   And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that

12   one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its

13   own students and not -- others are not invited.                But if

14   it was permissible under the association's rules to

15   invite students from other schools, then why is it

16   impermissible to talk it up?             I mean, you can do it, but

17   you can't talk about it?

18              MS. MAHONEY:           Your Honor, actually the

19   record indicates that it would be permissible to give

20   the information about the date for the spring practice

21   to the students who had signed an enrollment contract.

22   And that's at CAJA-705.         It could have been sent in an

23   enrollment packet, for instance.                It could have been

24   sent just as a schedule.

25              But instead the problem here was that it was


                                         4

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sent from the coach in a personal solicitation to the

 2   students that really subtly pressured them to come to

 3   practice.   This was a form of recruiting.                  Under

 4   question 3, which is the interpretive guidance for the

 5   recruiting rule, it very expressly says that

 6   coach-initiated contact with students who are enrolled

 7   at another school is not supposed to occur.                   And so this

 8   fell within the terms of the rule.                 As the Sixth Circuit

 9   said, it would strain credulity to say that Brentwood

10   didn't know that it shouldn't have sent this letter.

11   And their own headmaster acknowledged that it certainly

12   should have been t kind of thing that they would have

13   called about before doing it, and he was surprised that

14   Coach Flatt had not done so.

15               So I think, Your Honor, that the first point

16   is that, yes, this information could have been

17   communicated to the students, but not in this way.                   And

18   certainly the association could recognize that this was

19   still a form of recruiting.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So in speech terms, there

21   were alternative means to get the message out.

22               MS. MAHONEY:         Absolutely.            This was speech

23   of private concern.     It was about the time for football

24   practice.   And there were other ways that that

25   information could be communicated.                 But the association


                                        5

 1   has an interest in having prophylactic rules that

 2   prevent coaches from initiating communications with

 3   students before they started school, because even though

 4   they --

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I think the briefs are --

 6   I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief

 7   this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering.                It seems

 8   to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away

 9   that impression from your brief.

10              If we said that it's commercial speech, I

11   think that's a little far off the mark.                If we said it's

12   an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps

13   either side that much, either.

14              MS. MAHONEY:         Your Honor, I think Pickering

15   is really an example of an unconstitutional conditions

16   analysis just in the employment context.               What the Court

17   really says in a broad group of cases where the

18   government or the State actor is not exercising

19   sovereign power, if it's offering a benefit, if it's

20   using funding to encourage activity, if it is engaging

21   in a contractual relationship as it does in Umbehr, that

22   what this court has said in Umbehr very explicitly is

23   that when the government uses contractual power the

24   constitutional concerns are not as great.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In Umbehr we said, the


                                       6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the

 2   interests of either party, the government or the

 3   contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a

 4   public employee.   I thought that made sense when I read

 5   it.   I'm not so sure it does any more.

 6               MS. MAHONEY:         Well, and in fact this Court

 7   said in Umbehr that, even though the interests were what

 8   different, the standards that had been applied in

 9   Connick and Pickering could easily accommodate the

10   circumstances of dealing with --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I suppose we could

12   construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a

13   very strong interest in the contractor.                 So I'm not sure

14   that that works as a general theorem.

15               MS. MAHONEY:         But I think that the key from

16   all the cases, whether we look at Cornelius, which

17   involves your access to the charitable campaign, or if

18   we look at or if we look at Lusk and American Library,

19   which involved access to funding, or Grove, access to

20   funding, that the strain across these cases is that

21   you're really looking at is the restriction germane.

22   What kind of a burden --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about if, what

24   if the association had a rule that members, school

25   officials, shall not criticize the decisions of the


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   association?

 2               MS. MAHONEY:        I think then it would be --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's germane.     In

 4   other words, you can criticize other things, but if

 5   you're going to join this group we think it's important

 6   for their public stature not to be criticized by

 7   members.

 8               MS. MAHONEY:        I think that would probably be

 9   viewed as speech of public concern, and at that point

10   under Connick balancing you'd have --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                There's no more

12   public concern about when spring practice is.                If you

13   think there should be, you know, two playoff tiers

14   rather than three and you criticize the association for

15   that and they say well, you're suspended for a year and

16   all that.

17               MS. MAHONEY:        Your Honor, in Connick this

18   Court said that in assessing whether something is a

19   issue of public concern you look at not just the topic,

20   but also the way in which that topic is discussed.                  And

21   if what happened was the association decided that it was

22   going to penalize a member or have a broad rule that

23   says it would tolerate no criticism and even if

24   Brentwood had taken an ad out in the paper to talk about

25   how terrible the association's policies were, I think


                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this Court could readily find that that was not a

 2   reasonable choice because it would impact --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about

 4   criticizing officials?

 5                MS. MAHONEY:        On the field, Your Honor?            I

 6   think that the interests in essentially controlling that

 7   kind of speech would always outweigh the interests of an

 8   athlete or a coach in engaging in any kind of speech on

 9   the field.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I mean three

11   days later, you know, the school -- the coach writes an

12   editorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last

13   week.

14                MS. MAHONEY:        I think that would probably be

15   treated as speech of public concern, which would then

16   give rise to Connick balancing.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And how would you balance

18   it?

19                MS. MAHONEY:        What Connick says is you look

20   at how core is the speech, what's it about?

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And how would you

22   commence?

23                MS. MAHONEY:        Probably find that that not be

24   a reasonable restriction, that it's probably not germane

25   to the important educational goals of the association.

 1   But it could -- I mean, I think that what we have here

 2   is the recruiting rule has been applied to speech that's

 3   a private concern that can be delivered in another way;

 4   and the choice to join is entirely voluntary.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Ms. Mahoney, on that point,

 6   can I just take you back to square one for a second?

 7   I'm with you in your explanation that the speech at

 8   issue here probably was fairly understood as being for,

 9   you know, the communication here as being a violation of

10   the rule.   Could you, though, tell me, would it have

11   been -- I guess I have two questions.

12               Would it have been a violation of the rule

13   if the coach had sent the letter to eighth grade

14   students in the school itself, those who were already

15   formally enrolled and who might be going out for

16   football the next fall?        And number two, what is exactly

17   the interest in preventing recruiting, as you describe

18   it, when the letters are aimed at people who have

19   already signed, I think you referred to it as, an

20   enrollment contract?      So there's every reason to believe

21   they're going to be in that school next year.

22               What is the interest?                And would that

23   interest have supported a ban on letters to the already

24   enrolled eighth grade kids?

25               MS. MAHONEY:         First, I think that this


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   letter, which was not sent to Brentwood's own eighth

 2   grade middle school students, probably could have been,

 3   because under the rule those students were not enrolled

 4   at another school.      And what is really restricted is

 5   coach-initiated contact with students enrolled at

 6   another school.

 7                 This letter was instead sent to student

 8   whose were still enrolled at another school.              And the

 9   interest I would --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay, so they had signed

11   up to go to Brentwood.         So where does the recruiting

12   come in?

13                 MS. MAHONEY:         Your Honor, the contracts

14   weren't binding.    We have the contracts in the record at

15   CAJA-1889.    But more importantly, whether it was or not,

16   the record demonstrates that some student do sign

17   multiple contracts.       Some students do not come.         And so

18   efforts to get, of the coach, to get them to come to

19   practice, to be with him, to entice them, to give them

20   his personal home phone number, that's still a form of

21   recruiting.

22                 In fact, one of the top basketball athletes

23   in the eighth grade in the city of Nashville in the 1997

24   was named Jack West Curry.            He signed one of these

25   contracts.    He did not ultimately come to Brentwood.

 1   And yet he was exactly the kind of person that still

 2   could have been subject to recruiting if during that

 3   period --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:           So it boils down to saying

 5   that when they've signed the enrollment contract that's

 6   not the end of the, in effect, the issue.

 7               MS. MAHONEY:        No.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:           And there is a sensible

 9   practical way in which recruiting goes on even among

10   those who have signed up.         Okay.

11               MS. MAHONEY:        It certainly could, and so

12   there's an interest in stopping that.                  This Court

13   certainly has said that even in the commercial speech

14   area, in Ohralik instance, that it's fineto have

15   prophylactic rules as long as the rule continues to

16   advance the interest.     The fact that the interest may be

17   less strong at the point when they sign an enrollment

18   contract doesn't mean there is still no legitimate

19   interest.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And what is the

21   interest behind the anti-recruiting rule?

22               MS. MAHONEY:        Several, Your Honor.            This is

23   a group of individuals involved in an educational

24   activity in the State of Tennessee, and they have

25   determined that athletic recruiting is harmful to young


                                      12

 1   adults, that it puts too much emphasis on athletics,

 2   that it also --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                They could have

 4   determined that it's particularly harmful to the public

 5   schools who don't have the option of recruiting while

 6   the private schools do?

 7                 MS. MAHONEY:        Well, Your Honor, in 1997

 8   there were five violations, five penalties for

 9   violations of the recruiting rule, and four of them were

10   against public schools, one against a private school.

11   That's at the transcript at 2705.                 Public schools have

12   to bear the burden of these rules because they do try to

13   recruit.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could the association bar

15   Brentwood from contacting public school students

16   altogether?

17                 MS. MAHONEY:        About anything?         I think again

18   --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           About enrollment.      About

20   enrollment.

21                 MS. MAHONEY:        I think, Your Honor, that it

22   would be hard to say that that is germane, and it would

23   also put a very large burden on speech if they imposed a

24   flat contact.    They've done nothing of the kind.               There

25   have been --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, like if Brentwood,

 2   let's assume -- I think it's true -- is rather

 3   well-known in the State, and if they send you a

 4   solicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got

 5   a great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit

 6   any high school students.

 7               MS. MAHONEY:          I think that they haven't done

 8   it.   It would certainly be far less reasonable.              I

 9   don't -- I think that that would be much more of a

10   burden on speech.

11               Here it's undisputed -- I shouldn't say it's

12   undisputed, but the record certainly establishes, that

13   academic targeting is not prohibited -- that's in the

14   transcript at 2202 -- that if Brentwood Academy or any

15   other school wants to initiate contact for the purpose

16   of trying to persuade them to come for academics, it's

17   entirely free to do so.         This rule is not designed to in

18   any way stifle those kinds of communications.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I haven't kept track of

20   your time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to

21   reach the due process problem.               And at some point after

22   you finish discussing what you wish to on free speech, I

23   actually find that a somewhat more difficult issue.

24               MS. MAHONEY:          Your Honor, if I could just --

25   one thing I do want to make clear about the

 1   voluntariness of the choice and then I'll turn to due

 2   process, is that, as we set out in our brief, one of the

 3   things that Brentwood and some of its amici have tried

 4   to say is that there simply is no ability to play

 5   scholastic sports in Tennessee if you're not a member of

 6   this association.    And it's important to emphasize that

 7   for regular season play, for instance, members of TSSAA

 8   are free to play any non-member schools they want.

 9               It used to be that the association required

10   approval, which was routinely granted.                     But in 2005 they

11   actually changed the rule.           It's in the handbook at page

12   23 on their website.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But then that's part of

14   the trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of

15   the year.

16               MS. MAHONEY:          That's right, Your Honor.                You

17   could have -- all that TSSAA does is give the

18   opportunity to engage in its State tournaments,

19   post-season competition.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is there any other?

21               MS. MAHONEY:          Yes, Your Honor.             There is a

22   Christian Athletic League that has 26 private schools,

23   that also conducts State tournaments.                     There are also

24   State tournaments in other sports, including lacrosse,

25   swimming, that are not run by TSSAA.                     And there's

 1   nothing to stop Brentwood, for instance, from trying

 2   form its own league, which is what independent schools

 3   have done in many other States.               They also could have

 4   regular season play with TSSAA member schools and have

 5   invitationals.    There's no bar on schools attending

 6   those.

 7              If I could quickly turn to Justice Kennedy's

 8   question with respect to the issue of due process.                  I

 9   think that the analysis is really quite similar.                  What

10   occurred here is a contractual agreement to provide

11   certain kinds of process which actually satisfy the

12   standards in Laudermill, but in addition Brentwood would

13   have been able to bring a beach of contract action under

14   State law if it wanted to allege that it didn't get the

15   notice that the contract required.                  And this Court held

16   in Lujan that you have to take into account the

17   availability of a State breach of contract action before

18   jumping to the conclusion that due process rights have

19   been violated.    Yet the Sixth Circuit did not take that

20   into account.

21              If I could save the remainder of my time.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you,

23   Ms. Mahoney.

 1       ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

 2                  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 3              MR. HIMMELFARB:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 4   it please the Court:

 5              The position of the United States is that

 6   the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in

 7   deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim.             This

 8   Court's decisions establish that when the government

 9   offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it

10   has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when

11   it exercises its coercive sovereign power.             As in cases

12   where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor,

13   a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor,

14   the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic

15   competition, that a school may decline by choosing not

16   to become a member of the association.

17                Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to

18   the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to

19   deferential review.     Deferential First Amendment review

20   is appropriate in these contexts because the Government

21   occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its

22   sovereign authority.      On the one hand the Government

23   remains the Government no matter what authority it's

24   exercising -- so it is subject to the restrictions of

25   the First Amendment.


                                      17

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                On the other hand, when the Government acts

 2   in a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable

 3   to that of private sector entities and it has to be able

 4   to make the same sorts of decisions that they make.                   It

 5   has to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in

 6   its workplace, what activities may take place on its

 7   property, and the uses to which its grant money may be

 8   put.

 9                So the First Amendment can't apply with the

10   same force as when the Government acts in its sovereign

11   capacity.    For example, a government agency can tell its

12   employees not to use offensive language with co-workers

13   or customers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her

14   plurality opinion in Waters versus Churchill, and that

15   prohibition would not be subject to heightened First

16   Amendment scrutiny.      So, too, an athletic association

17   can tell the students at its member schools that they

18   can't use offensive language in dealing with opposing

19   players or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact

20   do.    This is at page 202 of the joint appendix.              And

21   that prohibition should not be subject to heightened

22   First Amendment scrutiny either.                The same is true of

23   other rules that govern membership in and define the

24   character of a voluntary athletic association.

25                As applied to TSSAA's recruiting rule, the


                                        18

 1   deferential standard of review is easily satisfied.

 2   Prohibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or

 3   attempting to secure or retain high school athletes we

 4   think is self-evidently reasonable in light of the

 5   purposes underlying the rule, which include preventing

 6   the exploitation of children and ensuring that sports

 7   remains subordinate to academics.

 8                 Prohibiting coaches from contacting students

 9   who have not enrolled at the coach's school is likewise

10   reasonable.    Either because that prohibition can

11   reasonably be reviewed as an instance of undue influence

12   itself, or because it is a reasonable prophylactic

13   measure to prevent the exertion of undue influence.

14                 And finally defining enrollment in the

15   context of the prohibition on coaches contacting

16   students to exclude the situation where a student has

17   somehow announced its intention -- announced his

18   intention to attend its school, for example, as in this

19   case by signing an enrollment contract, is reasonable as

20   well for the reasons Ms. Mahoney mentioned in responding

21   to Justice Souter's question.              Somebody who signs an

22   enrollment contract may not decide -- may ultimately

23   decide to attend a different school, and there is

24   evidence in the record that students sometimes sign

25   multiple enrollment contracts and sometimes decide to


                                        19

 1   attend a different school after signing one.                   This is at

 2   page 240 of the joint appendix and there are additional

 3   citations to the record on page 6 of the reply brief.

 4               In short, while the First Amendment has a

 5   role to play in this case and cases like it, it is a

 6   very limited role.      And the recruiting rule easily

 7   satisfies what we think is the appropriately deferential

 8   standard of review that applies in circumstances of this

 9   type.   The judgment of the court of appeals should be

10   reversed.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I ask this, what is

12   your response to the, one of your earlier questions.

13   Suppose they sent out a general brochure to all the

14   graduating grammar school students to -- advertising

15   that they come up to Brentwood and so forth and so on,

16   and the rule prohibited that?               Would that rule be valid?

17               MR. HIMMELFARB:              I think that would be close

18   to the line, Justice Stevens.               The -- the prohibition on

19   coach contact we think is an easy case.                   There are, in

20   fact, ways that schools can communicate --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But isn't the coach

22   recruiting just a subcategory of a broader --

23               MR. HIMMELFARB:              No.     If it is a brochure

24   sent out by the school generally and it doesn't target

25   specific students and it went out to schools generally,


                                         20

 1   and there was a prohibition on that type of thing, I

 2   think that might very well be a reasonable restriction

 3   on speech.    As I say, I think this that's close --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry; you think

 5   it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?

 6                 MR. HIMMELFARB:           It might be -- well, I

 7   think it's close enough to the line that it could go

 8   either way.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's a close call

10   whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that

11   is not limited to athletics telling them about their

12   school?

13                 MR. HIMMELFARB:           Well, the -- in that

14   situation, I think -- I think it probably would be

15   unreasonable, Mr. Chief Justice.

16                 The, the -- the methods of -- the

17   alternative methods of speech here are not all that

18   different -- that are allowed by the rule here -- are

19   not all that different from Justice Stevens'

20   hypothetical.    There are a number of ways in which

21   schools can communicate with prospective students and

22   their families about athletics at the school, but it's

23   usually done through intermediaries.                     And I think as I

24   say, Justice Stevens' hypothetical is not --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if the mailing

 1   was limited to people who had signed contracts with --

 2   students, not just football players but everyone who

 3   else had signed enrollment contracts with the school?

 4   General brochure listing all the things you can do at

 5   the school including athletics, including -- you know,

 6   other extracurricular activities?                 Is that all right?

 7              MR. HIMMELFARB:              I think --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Or would it be

 9   unreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?

10              MR. HIMMELFARB:              I think that would be much

11   more problematic.    And I don't -- I don't think that

12   this rule prohibits that.           And I don't think it

13   prohibits Justice Stevens' example.

14              What the rule allows is for schools to send

15   out information about their athletic programs to other

16   schools to distribute to their students, for example.

17   It also allows them to send it out to real estate

18   brokers, to athletic leagues that aren't associated with

19   the school, to advertise.           It allows it to respond to

20   direct inquiries from students.

21              But I think Justice Stevens' hypothetical

22   and your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, are pretty

23   close to the sorts of things that are allowed by this

24   recruiting rule.    And I do agree with you that --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:              I'm not asking you about

 1   the school for the rule.          I'm trying to figure out

 2   what's the scope of the First Amendment protection.

 3                 MR. HIMMELFARB:           Right.           I -- I -- I think

 4   that if the, if the -- if the recruiting rule -- if

 5   there were a recruiting rule that prohibited those types

 6   --

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You do agree at some point

 8   the First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule.

 9                 MR. HIMMELFARB:           Of course.           There is, we

10   think there is a reasonableness or germaneness

11   limitation.    The justifications for the rule are mainly

12   preventing the exploitation of students and ensuring

13   that academics -- that --

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is that permissible, in

15   weighing the -- both sides of the equation to consider

16   the advantages -- I mean the justifications for the

17   speech?

18                 MR. HIMMELFARB:           Sure.       Under -- under a

19   reasonableness standard, I think it is appropriate to

20   look at the justifications for the rule and ask whether

21   if the -- the rule reasonably furthers those interests.

22   And, and in making that determination --

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- justification for the

24   rule in this case and the justification for the rule

25   that would prohibit the general solicitation I

 1   described.

 2                MR. HIMMELFARB:           I'm sorry?

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is it the same

 4   justification, but the justification is a little

 5   stronger in one hypo than the other?

 6                MR. HIMMELFARB:           Right.           I think you, if you

 7   -- if you offered those justifications for banning the

 8   type of speech you suggested, it might very well be that

 9   it would be appropriate to conclude that the rule isn't

10   reasonably related to those justifications because it

11   burdens too much speech.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me that,

13   turning to the state action for a moment, one of the

14   justifications for finding state action that is there is

15   no other real choice, that they have, other than to --

16   if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than

17   to join this association.

18                And yet at the opening of your argument, you

19   said oh, well it's voluntary.             So It seems to me that

20   your speech argument is inconsistent with one of the

21   justifications for finding state action to begin with.

22                MR. HIMMELFARB:           Well, no, I don't think so,

23   Justice Kennedy.   In the types of cases that I mentioned

24   at the outset, employment cases, funding cases,

25   property, ownership cases, I mean there's no dispute


                                       24

 1   that in those cases the Government is a state actor.

 2   When the Government employs people it is a state actor

 3   subject to the First Amendment, but deferential review

 4   is applied to First Amendment challenges because there

 5   is a choice.

 6              And so too here there is a choice for the

 7   reasons mentioned by Ms. Mahoney.                There are other

 8   athletic associations that schools can join.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But that's somewhat

10   inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for

11   finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to

12   join the school if you really want to compete with most

13   of the schools.   You have to join the association.

14              MR. HIMMELFARB:             Well, I think -- I'm not

15   sure that's true, Justice Kennedy.                 But I think it's

16   clear that in this Court's decisions in various areas

17   applying deferential First Amendment review, when

18   there's a voluntary relationship between the Government

19   and the citizen, that is precisely the reason that the

20   Court applies deferential review.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

22   Mr. Himmelfarb.

 1               MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 2   it please the Court:

 3               I represent Brentwood Academy in this civil

 4   rights case.

 5               It's about the regulatory overreaching of

 6   the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association,

 7   what we call the TSSAA.       The case involves the First

 8   Amendment's interest of the school, its students, its

 9   parents, and the procedural due process interests.

10               Brentwood was severely punished, and the

11   punishment is listed in footnote 5 of our brief, for

12   communicating with its own incoming male students,

13   informing them of an opportunity, spring football

14   practice, that the students were authorized to attend

15   under the TSSAA rules.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Did it serve the

17   suspension or has that been stayed?                    Was it suspended

18   from competition for two years?             That was the penalty.

19               MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Yes.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Did it -- did that take

21   effect?

22               MR. BLUMSTEIN:         The first year it did take

23   effect --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           One year --

25               MR. BLUMSTEIN:         And the second year did not

 1   take effect, Justice Kennedy.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And the fine has not been

 3   paid.   The fine.

 4               MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Not yet.             But we've

 5   recognized that if this turns out to be -- if the TSSAA

 6   position turns out to be vindicated, the school will be

 7   obliged to pay the fine.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Blumstein, there's

 9   one feature of this that I find puzzling.                       You're making

10   this a First Amendment case.              But you joined an

11   association that has such, certain rules and when one

12   joins, one agrees to abide by the rules.

13               Nothing in the world stops Brentwood from

14   saying this anti-recruiting rule is a really bad rule,

15   it is unfair to us; you could have written op ed pieces

16   about it, the school could have talked about it, the

17   school could have urged the board of education to drop

18   it.   Nothing stopped you from attacking this rule that

19   you don't like.     But when you signed on, the First

20   Amendment doesn't give you license not to follow the

21   rules that you disagree with.

22               MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Justice Ginsburg, let me say

23   that there's a finding, a stipulation that the school

24   thought it was abiding by the rule.                       It has no intent to

25   violate the rule.     Intent is not a requirement.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But isn't part of what

 2   you agree to is a organization that has a certain

 3   governance structure, the people in the organization

 4   decide, and then make public to all the members of the

 5   association what the rules are and how they're going to

 6   be interpreted?

 7              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             Well, Your Honor, let me

 8   first address, in -- in the appendix to our brief is a

 9   two page -- a two-sentence letter from Joe Marley to

10   Brentwood Academy.      This was in the same year in which

11   this alleged violation occurred; and in the two-sentence

12   letter, Ray Marley, the student's father, said it is our

13   attention for Ray to attend Brentwood Academy in

14   1997-98, Ray has my consent to participate in the speed

15   and strength program at Brentwood Academy.

16              The Association then informed the school

17   that it was able to allow this young man to come and

18   lift weights at the school based upon that letter.              So

19   when the school wrote a letter and had contact with the

20   student, based upon an enrollment contract, they thought

21   it was an a fortiori circumstance that if they could

22   have Ray Marley lift weights and be there and contact

23   the coach, that a much more elaborate contractual

24   enrollment form with signing of a contract and paying a

25   $300 deposit would allow them to, in fact, have contact

 1   with the coach.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Blumstein, am I not

 3   correct for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming

 4   constitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be

 5   constitutionally protected even if you knew in advance

 6   that this particular communication would violate the

 7   rule and even if you did it deliberately?                That's what

 8   your constitutional position is, is it not?

 9              MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, our -- Your Honor, the

10   significance of the voluntariness --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is it or is it not?

12              MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Yes.

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:            It is.

14              MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Yes.       I'm sorry.    Yes.

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            So that what really,

16   you're -- it is sort of a side issue as to whether they

17   really had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as

18   we're talking about the First Amendment?

19              MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Yes, Your Honor.         The

20   relevance of the signing up and the voluntary

21   involvement is ultimately whether there's a waiver; and

22   we don't believe that the requirements of waiver have

23   either been pled, which is an obligation, it's an

24   affirmative defense, has not been pled.                This has never

25   been treated as a waiver case.             It was not in the very

 1   beginning.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:         What if the state set up two

 3   athletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and

 4   the other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you

 5   chose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting

 6   league.   Would it be a violation of the First Amendment

 7   in your opinion?

 8                MR. BLUMSTEIN:         And both are governmental?

 9   Both are governmental, Justice Alito?

10                JUSTICE ALITO:         Yes, both are governmental.

11                MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Well, I think if a private

12   party subjects itself voluntary, voluntarily to a

13   regulatory program run by the government or which is

14   attributable to the government, then under cases like

15   Ibanez, which we emphasize in our brief, that there is

16   an obligation on the part of the government to apply the

17   rules fairly, unless there is a waiver of some kind, the

18   waiver standard is the one that makes a difference.            But

19   I believe in terms of voluntariness, the only difference

20   is whether there is some kind of a waiver.

21                In Ibanez where the lawyer, who was also an

22   accountant, submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the

23   accounting board, there was nothing requiring her to

24   submit herself to that jurisdiction.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But your claim here is not

 1   that they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is

 2   that they applied the rules.

 3              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             Unconstitutionally.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:               That's right.       Fairly.

 5   Fairly as they were written.              But you say even if they

 6   did apply them fairly, that's no good.

 7              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             That's correct,

 8   Justice Scalia.     That's correct.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I just wanted to be clear

10   on that.

11              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             But I think perhaps --

12              JUSTICE ALITO:             And even if was purely

13   voluntary and even if you had two choices but you chose

14   the -- you chose to join the association with the

15   anti-recruiting rule, there would be a First Amendment

16   problem?

17              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             Yes, Your Honor.         If the

18   government has a regulatory program providing an

19   imprimatur, certification, accreditation, and you as an

20   individual or an entity, private entity, seek that

21   governmental imprimatur, it's available and you seek

22   that, then the government must respect your First

23   Amendment rights.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So what if you

25   decided to offer bonuses to 8th graders, a thousand

 1   dollars -- and of course that's, I assume that's against

 2   the rules in Tennessee -- would you have -- would that

 3   be covered by your First Amendment right?

 4               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           No, Your Honor.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why not?

 6               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           That would be conduct, Your

 7   Honor.   And I think that, again, the problem that we

 8   have here is that the TSSAA has not --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But that's not the

10   line that we draw elsewhere in the First Amendment.

11               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Between money as an

12   inducing, an inducement, we would view an inducement or

13   an incentive as conduct, as opposed to speech,

14   communication.   Here there was no evidence that any

15   inducement or emolument or promise of future activity

16   was elicited from the school.              The only thing that was

17   done was sending them a letter informing them about an

18   activity that was an approved activity.

19               And I think that for our purposes in

20   drafting and implementing the undue influence rule, the

21   association has never recognized the difference between

22   its authority to regulate speech and its authority to

23   regulate conduct.    And as a result, they've never gone

24   through a process of figuring out how can they

25   accommodate their legitimate interest.

 1              We -- our school strongly supports a

 2   recruiting rule that's aimed at barring these kinds of

 3   conducts, Chief Justice, as you've just described.                  The

 4   problem is that the association, by not recognizing that

 5   the First Amendment enters into the analysis, that they

 6   have not -- never gone through a process of calculating

 7   the cost on speech, as this Court's decisions in cases

 8   like the Lorillard case or the Fox case require that

 9   they do, that they consider the impact on speech.                 If

10   you don't agree that there's any difference between

11   speech and conduct, you don't have to engage in that

12   kind of a process.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. Blumstein, you're

14   making that distinction.           Is there -- if the association

15   says no school in this association can invite students

16   enrolled in other schools to its practice, that's okay?

17   Because that's conduct, right?                If this is your

18   statement, there's nothing to recruit for, because we

19   don't allow it period.

20              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                That would be okay.

22              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             That's correct.      We have no

23   problem with the revised rules that the association has

24   adopted that does not permit spring practice --

25   non-matriculated students to participate in spring


                                         33

 1   practice.    That's a regulation of conduct and it doesn't

 2   fall within speech.      We think that was the right

 3   solution, not punishing the school in what --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's a little odd, isn't

 5   it, that they could do -- they could take the stronger

 6   measure but not the lesser measure of saying it's

 7   available but we don't want you to broadcast it?

 8                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, under the First

 9   Amendment, it is a core principle that speech about

10   lawful or permitted conduct cannot be punished just

11   because of the speech.        We have a finding of the

12   district court that the speech was actually beneficial,

13   it was welcomed by the families and by the children who

14   received the information.           And in fact, it was

15   effective.   The very thing the TSSAA --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But not beneficial to the

17   system.   That's why the organization didn't like it.

18   And I wanted to come back to something you said just a

19   minute ago, that there's an obligation under the First

20   Amendment to weigh the effects of speech.                Is there?   I

21   mean, suppose a government organization simply comes out

22   with a rule that is perfectly fair, and that happens to

23   give due weight to the fact that it's restricting

24   speech, but the government organization has frankly

25   never considered it.       They didn't sit down around a

 1   table and say now, look, this is going affect speech,

 2   let's be careful here.       They didn't do that.              They just

 3   promulgated a perfectly reasonable rule.

 4               Wouldn't we uphold that?

 5               MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, Your Honor --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            They don't have to consider

 7   the matter, do they?      They just have to get it right,

 8   whether they considered it or not.

 9               MR. BLUMSTEIN:          I believe that under the

10   Lorillard case and under this Court's decision in the

11   Fox case, that there is an obligation to engage in what

12   is called the careful calculation of cause and benefits.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Certainly.         We have to do

14   that.   Certainly we have to do it in assessing whether,

15   what the government has done is okay.                   But you're saying

16   it's invalid unless the government gathers together a

17   group of people just to shoot the breeze about -- I

18   don't know of any of our cases that require that.

19               MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, Your Honor, there was

20   in the Lorillard case, the tobacco regulation case, the

21   Court was specifically critical that the attorney

22   general of Massachusetts did not consider the cost of

23   speech, particularly with respect to --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I mean, you may

25   criticize them when they get it -- when it comes out


                                       35
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   wrong.   Then you can say, when the result is wrong, they

 2   should have considered it.           But when it comes out right?

 3   Do you have any case where it comes out right and it's

 4   perfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even

 5   though it came out right, they didn't consider speech?

 6   We've never said anything like that.

 7                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         But Justice Scalia, in your

 8   opinion in the Fox case, one of the safeguards that was

 9   articulated for speech protection was the need to have a

10   procedural safeguard.       And one of those safeguards was

11   the development of a careful calculation of benefits and

12   costs with respect to freedom of speech.

13                 That was the -- that was the case involving

14   the Tupperware parties on the State University campus of

15   New York.   And one of the protections that was built

16   into the --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's where you had an

18   approval system where one party would be approved and

19   another one wouldn't.       Of course, in that situation, you

20   have to engage case by case in making the weighing.                  But

21   this is not an approval situation.                  It's the issuance of

22   a rule that applies to everybody.

23                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Well, in addition, there is

24   an obligation under this Court's decision in the

25   Thompson case for the government to consider non-speech

 1   alternatives, where to restrict -- and to achieve its

 2   objectives by not regulating speech at all.              In the

 3   Thompson case --

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Mr. Blumstein, it seems to

 5   me that Ms. Mahoney addressed that in response to a

 6   question from me.

 7              I said, in effect, that once a student has

 8   signed an enrollment contract, where is there any

 9   recruiting going on?       And she said there is recruiting,

10   and hence there is an interest in regulating recruiting,

11   because not everybody who signs these contracts, or on

12   behalf of whom those contracts are signed, end up going

13   to the school.   So that in fact, there is room for

14   recruiting right up to the moment that the kid arrives

15   in the fall and signs on the dotted line.

16              What is your response to her response?

17              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Well, the district court

18   found that the constitutional balance tipped at that

19   point because the evidence suggested that while that

20   does happen, it's not a normal occurrence, fewer than 5

21   percent of cases.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, how many cases have

23   there got to be before you would recognize the

24   sufficiency of the asserted state interest?

25              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Well, I think that once a


                                        37

 1   family has -- and the evidence in this case established

 2   that all these families had made their educational

 3   choice.

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, we know that.

 5   They've signed the contract.             So that's where we start.

 6               And you're saying, well, only about 5

 7   percent of them weasel out of it later on and go to some

 8   other school.    But why is 5 percent insufficient?

 9               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Well, in this case, the

10   association allows the underlying practice itself.               It

11   permits the underlying practice.

12               And so if there's a concern about

13   recruiting --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:             So that if the kid comes

15   and says, look, I'm going to Brentwood next fall and I'd

16   like to tag along to a spring practice, they say okay.

17   But that's not recruiting.           The school hasn't initiated

18   it.   In this case, the school has initiated it by the

19   letter.   And it does sound like recruiting if you accept

20   the proposition that the students aren't bound to go to

21   the school even though their parents signed up and some

22   of them don't.

23               So I come back to my question.               If taking

24   your figure -- let's assume that only 5 percent, in

25   fact, change their minds.           Why doesn't -- why isn't


                                        38

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there a legitimate interest in preventing recruiting

 2   within the 5 percent?

 3               MR. BLUMSTEIN:          But there's the whole cited

 4   Question 3, Justice Souter.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yeah, but would you answer

 6   my question?   Why isn't that enough?

 7               MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, I think, again, as

 8   long as the association permits this activity and says

 9   there is a risk of recruiting at that activity if the

10   students are not firmly committed, irrevocably committed

11   to a place, and that they allow that conduct, then to

12   allow the -- to bar the -- the school from talking about

13   or at least mentioning the -- the activity as an

14   opportunity, then at that point the association if it

15   wants to protect its interests must act to prohibit the

16   conduct, not the speech.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       It certainly can do

18   that.   There's no question about it.                   But it seems to me

19   that the line that is being drawn is a line between

20   contact which is initiated by the prospective student

21   and proselytizing which is initiated by the school.                    Why

22   isn't that a reasonable line?

23               MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, because -- Ms. Mahoney

24   cited an example that does not require initiated school

25   contact.   Question 3 prohibits all contact, whether it's


                                       39

 1   initiated by the school or initiated by the student.

 2                In joint appendix 181 --

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's not what we've got

 4   before us.

 5                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Yes, we do.         She cited

 6   Question 3, and what it says is, no coach -- no.                     "A

 7   coach may not contact a student or his or her parents

 8   prior to -- "

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       We're still talking

10   about athletic contact.

11                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Yes, but not necessarily

12   initiated by the coach.         It would be, in fact,

13   impermissible.    Under their interpretation of their own

14   rules, it would be impermissible for the coach to speak

15   to people at this practice.

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       Maybe that would

17   present a different kind of problem, but that's not what

18   we've got here.    What we've got here is contact through

19   speech that was initiated by the coach.

20                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Yes.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            And I am saying that if the

22   rule generally -- maybe quite imprecisely -- but if it

23   generally distinguishes between that kind of

24   proselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact

25   that a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that

 1   roughly a fair line?

 2               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Well, I don't think so,

 3   Justice Souter, because once the association determines

 4   that this activity is legitimate, and authorizes this

 5   with respect to the feeder pattern, so that all public

 6   schools can be --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:             The activity being tagging

 8   along to spring practice?

 9               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Participating in spring

10   practice.   And all the kind of activity that the

11   association objects to would be permitted if there were

12   a feeder pattern.    And in this case, the kind of

13   activity that they say they want to isolate the students

14   from, what you were describing as coach-initiated

15   contact, all of that is permitted in the feeder pattern.

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But the answer to that is,

17   they're not trying to prevent people, at least under

18   this rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids

19   from going to spring practice.               They're trying to

20   prevent coaches from proselytizing kids, and that's the

21   distinction.   Why isn't it a reasonable distinction?

22               MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Well, the proselytization

23   here was found to be a harmless letter sent just

24   informing the kids that they had an opportunity.                 So I

25   guess it depends on how one characterizes what the


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   communication is.

 2                 We would characterize --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It was a letter from coach.

 4   It was a letter from coach.              I mean, that to a young

 5   kid, that is recruiting.           That is showing an interest on

 6   the part of the person who's going to decide who plays,

 7   an interest in you.

 8                 I think it's entirely reasonable to consider

 9   that recruiting.

10                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:          But the letter,

11   Justice Scalia, went to all students, not just the

12   athletes.     It was not targeted to any particular person.

13   All 12 students who -- male students who were admitted,

14   were incoming students, all of those students got the

15   letter.     It wasn't targeted in any type of recruiting

16   mode.     Every student who was admitted and signed the

17   contract received the letter.

18                 And a 13th student who was admitted but who

19   did not sign the enrollment contract did not receive the

20   letter.     So that the school was very careful, so that

21   they --

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is it fair to say "your

23   coach"?     The letter was signed by your coach, not just

24   coach.

25                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, these were incoming

 1   students, Justice Ginsburg, and --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And did it say, by the way,

 3   everybody got this letter?           Did it say that at the

 4   bottom?

 5                   MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Again we think if the

 6   practice itself was problematic, was educationally

 7   unsound, if there was a risk of any of the interests

 8   that were involved, then the association could and did

 9   prohibit participation in that activity.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Weren't all these things

11   that are being discussed before the factfinder, or was

12   there some ex parte contact later which was the only

13   evidence for what we're talking about now?                I'm getting

14   into the due process point.

15                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         The information that was

16   before the factfinder had to do with, on the due process

17   point, had to do with a person who was not related to

18   the school but who had been, it turns out falsely,

19   accused of offering inducements to students to attend

20   the school.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I mean, all of these

22   matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to

23   reply to all of these matters that we've just been

24   talking about, correct?

25                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Yes.       There was a procedure


                                        43

 1   in which there was an exchange of letters between the

 2   association and the school, in which the association had

 3   some investigation and then the school had an

 4   opportunity to respond.          Yes, Judge Kennedy.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               It doesn't seem to me like

 6   there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due

 7   process violation.

 8              MR. BLUMSTEIN:             The problem was that the

 9   district court made two findings in this regard that

10   were very important:        That the association misled the

11   school as to what issues were still open and available;

12   and that ultimately a matter involving this Bart King

13   was discussed at the closed after-hearing session,

14   executive session, and the school had been told that the

15   Bart King allegations were no longer on the table.

16              Now, the school did put forward evidence

17   about one youngster named Jacques Curry who was alleged

18   to have been recruited by Bart King.                      Again, Bart King

19   had no status with the school at all.                     And they put

20   Jacques Curry before the hearing panel and the hearing

21   panel wound up restoring his eligibility.

22              But it turns out that they, at the trial,

23   that the association members, or the board of control,

24   admitted that they considered the Bart King allegations

25   to enhance the penalty.          So it must have been something


                                         44
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   beyond Jacques Curry and that the school was never

 2   informed that the Bart King's involvement beyond Jacques

 3   Curry had anything to did with the proceedings.

 4                 So the district court found there was

 5   misleading of the school and that they -- the school

 6   never had a chance to respond to the evidence that was

 7   presented by these investigators for the association.

 8   And so therefore they did not have evidence, they were

 9   not aware of evidence, and they didn't have a chance to

10   respond or to reply to that evidence.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What was the evidence?

12                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:          I'm sorry?

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What was the evidence?

14                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:          We don't know what the

15   evidence was.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean, at this late date,

17   you've had trials.      You're saying -- did you ask?             With

18   all these people under oath, haven't you had trials and

19   everything?

20                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, the evidence suggested

21   that --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Did you ever ask the people

23   who were at the meeting, what was the evidence you

24   considered that we haven't had a chance to see?

25                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:          And --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:              Did you or not?

 2              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Yes.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:              And then, and what did they

 4   say?

 5              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            The evidence was the notes

 6   that was presented were the notes taken by the

 7   investigators.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.       So there were

 9   some notes taken by investigators, which did they have

10   anything new in them you hadn't seen before?

11              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            We hadn't seen, we hadn't

12   seen them before the hearing.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:              What was in there that you

14   had not seen before in the notes?

15              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Well, again I think that

16   what was -- what was available to the association was --

17   excuse me --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:              I'm asking you:      What was

19   in the notes that were presented to the decisionmaker

20   that you had not previously seen and therefore had no

21   opportunity to rebut?       What particularly and

22   specifically?    And it's surprising to me that you

23   hesitate at this very late date if this is a serious

24   issue.

25              MR. BLUMSTEIN:            Well, we did not know that


                                        46

 1   those issues were even on the table.                   The executive

 2   director testified at trial that the issue of Bart King

 3   was no longer on the table, and the notes were not

 4   presented to the --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            What did it say in the

 6   notes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you

 7   did not have a chance to reply to specifically?

 8              MR. BLUMSTEIN:          Well, we learned that the

 9   investigators had not spoken to Mr. King.

10              JUSTICE BREYER:            What you learned was the

11   investigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you

12   previously did not know that, and if you had known that

13   you would have said to the decisionmaker:                  The

14   investigators did not speak to Mr. King.                  And if you had

15   said that, how would this case be different?

16              MR. BLUMSTEIN:          What we would have been in a

17   position to say, Your Honor, was that we want to

18   understand what your perception, your, the

19   investigators' perception, is of what Bart King's

20   relationship to Brentwood Academy is and how -- and what

21   he is alleged to have done.

22              We have no control, we had no knowledge, of

23   anything that Mr. King did, and if any of those

24   allegations were true the school wanted an opportunity

25   to disassociate itself.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            And the other side says,

 2   Mr. Bart King was part of the school and had something

 3   to do with this?

 4                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          No --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            Is that right.

 6                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          I don't believe that they've

 7   taken that --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well then, I don't

 9   understand what the relevance of this is.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I thought your claim was

11   that you had a witness available to testify, but you

12   didn't put him on because you didn't think they were

13   going into this issue.        That's all.

14                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          This was Mr. King himself

15   was availability.    And he -- and we put him up, offered

16   him for --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            But I don't understand what

18   Mr. King has to do with this if the other side is not

19   claiming that Mr. King is part of your operation.

20                MR. BLUMSTEIN:          But the association, the

21   association association witnesses testified at trial,

22   Justice Breyer, that in fact they -- that they

23   considered the King allegations.                We don't know exactly

24   what that meant at the trial.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:            Who considered it?

 1                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         That the board of control,

 2   the TSSAA board.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Did you ask the people on

 4   the board of control, what role did Mr. King play in

 5   your decision?

 6                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         And the answer that was

 7   given at trial, and the trial judge found this, was that

 8   he played a role, not in the liable but in the penalty.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So that they might have

10   reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been

11   under the mistaken impression that Mr. King had

12   something to do with you when he did it.

13                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         And specifically to mention

14   the terms, the length of the probation, is what they

15   said, the probation.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And the probation was --

17   and the probation, which was for four years?

18                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Yes, Your Honor.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And have you served the

20   four years.

21                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Well, I believe one year has

22   been served at this point.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So there is three more

24   years?   So if in fact you are correct that they were

25   under a misapprehension on this matter, then the thing


                                        49

 1   to do would to be find out if that extra three years had

 2   something to do with this erroneous thing of Mr. King?

 3   It's surprising to me all of this is coming up now, but

 4   there we are.   So but that's your specific claim.

 5              MR. BLUMSTEIN:           The concern was that the

 6   association had told us, and the district court found

 7   this, that the King allegations were not on the table.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:             I thought it was a

 9   different claim.   I thought you were claiming there was

10   a violation of due process because an investigator spoke

11   without you present to the board.

12              MR. BLUMSTEIN:           Yes.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:             And that I would think was

14   not a violation of the Constitution since it happens

15   every day of the week in administrative agencies.            But

16   if you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen.

17              And I think in that you're saying the

18   Administrative Procedures Act is unconstitutional, which

19   would be a surprising claim to me.

20              MR. BLUMSTEIN:           No, but that we -- that the

21   disclosure of evidence as a basis of decision and an

22   opportunity to respond to that evidence in a

23   disciplinary hearing this Court has held as recently as

24   the Hamdi case and certainly in Laudermill that that is

25   an important procedural protection of due process, and

 1   that's what we're seeking in this case as well, Your

 2   Honor.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Thank you.

 4                 MR. BLUMSTEIN:         Again, we think that the

 5   First Amendment framework that exists for regulatory

 6   cases fits this case well.           The only difference is

 7   whether or not there's a waiver.                We think there's not a

 8   waiver.   The Government has claimed that they can define

 9   away First Amendment rights.             In our brief we address

10   that claim.    We don't believe that the Government can

11   define away First Amendment rights, and there is not a

12   case that they have cited really that supports the

13   position that the First Amendment should apply

14   differently in this context, where the Government is

15   regulating just because it is, the source of authority

16   is a different source of authority, a non-sovereign

17   source of authority.

18                 The Southeastern Promotions case, the Ibanez

19   case, those cases, the Barnett case, and the Fox case,

20   Justice Scalia's opinion in the Fox case, make it clear

21   that the source of authority, in that case universities,

22   is not determinative.       The Fox case discussed the

23   elements of commercial speech and that arose in a

24   university context, but it's been applied across the

25   board in all commercial speech cases, regulatory cases,


                                        51

 1   whether there was sovereign power or, as in the case of

 2   Fox, it was not sovereign power at all.

 3                So we think that the First Amendment

 4   doctrine, the rubric that we've described in our brief,

 5   is the proper one that should be applied in this

 6   circumstance and that there's not a need to carve out a

 7   special exception, which is what the Government is

 8   asking for and what the TSSAA is asking for, to

 9   generally applicable First Amendment doctrine.

10                This is a case of content-based regulation.

11   The time, place, and manner defense therefore cannot

12   work as a defense, and we think therefore, the TSSAA

13   case collapses under First Amendment.

14                Thank you very much.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

16                Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes

17   remaining.

18            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY

19                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20                MS. MAHONEY:        Thank you.

21                If I could respond to the due process

22   issues, this is still a very important claim because if

23   in fact the association has violated civil rights by

24   failing to give due process Brentwood would still be

25   entitled to an award of attorney's fees.                 And I think


                                       52
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it's critical that when an association enters into a

 2   contract and agrees upon procedures, that if those

 3   procedures can -- are not followed, a member of the

 4   association can bring a breach of contract action in

 5   State court.

 6               But Brentwood did not do that.              Instead it

 7   tried to constitutionalize this contract dispute and

 8   assert rights under Section 1983.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I thought it had some

10   State claims as pendant claims.

11               MS. MAHONEY:         The only State claim they had

12   as a pendant claim was arbitrary action under State law,

13   and the district court dismissed that because it found

14   that the questions were sufficiently novel that he

15   didn't feel that he should entertain jurisdiction over

16   it.   But they did not assert a breach of contract claim.

17               And it's important to note that the bylaws

18   actually provide that a member must be given, quote,

19   "notice of the charges and an opportunity to present its

20   case at a hearing."     So if they actually did not get

21   notice of the charges involving Bart King, it would have

22   been a breach of contract.          So that's the first problem,

23   is that the court of appeals didn't even look at the

24   fact that they had a contract remedy, just like the

25   contractor had in Lujan, and they simply weren't taking


                                       53
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   advantage of it.

 2                 Second, the suggestion that they were not

 3   actually given notice is contradicted by the record.

 4   And it's not issues of credibility.                       This is just an

 5   ultimate conclusion about whether they had sufficient

 6   notice.    And if you look at the record, the exchange of

 7   letters, at JA-205 is the letter that starts by

 8   disclosing the charges, and it specifically discloses

 9   that the association investigators have talked to a

10   number of middle school students, have talked to a

11   number of middle school coaches, and details precisely

12   what those witnesses have said about Bart King.

13                 Now they say, well, we didn't know that Bart

14   King was still involved by the time we got to the last

15   hearing.     But look in fact what they did.                    They came to

16   the hearing.     They submitted the affidavit of Bart King.

17   One of their live witnesses was Jacques Curry and the

18   only thing he testified about was his relationship with

19   Bart King.

20                 And then they ran out of time.                     They ran out

21   of time.     They had Bart King there.                    They were thinking

22   about putting him on live.            They had had an allotted

23   period of time.     They used it all up without putting --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Was there anything at the

25   trial that came out that the investigator when they were

 1   in the private session said a fact about Bart King of

 2   supreme importance that they didn't know about?

 3               MS. MAHONEY:           Absolutely not, Your Honor.

 4   There was absolutely nothing they've said that they

 5   didn't know about.

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, didn't one of the

 7   decisionmakers testify that they relied on this --

 8               MS. MAHONEY:           Your Honor, most of them

 9   actually testified that they did not.

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:              No, but one did.

11               MS. MAHONEY:           There was one who had

12   testified --

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:              And did not the district

14   court find that his testimony was credible?

15               MS. MAHONEY:           He did, Your Honor, and -- but

16   even if that's true, even if the board did rely on

17   evidence about Bart King in deciding what penalty ought

18   to be, how much probation, whatever, that still does not

19   establish that there was a due process violation because

20   they had notice that the Bart King issues could be

21   considered at this trial.            They actually submitted

22   evidence.   They submitted Bart King's affidavit and the

23   record shows that the board said they considered all the

24   evidence that had been submitted.

25               And when they -- and the reason they didn't

 1   put him on, they say:      "It was our intention to put him

 2   on, but I don't know if you are all interested in

 3   extending for five minutes to hear from Bart King or

 4   not.   He's here if you want him."               Carter responds "No."

 5   He doesn't say:   The King issues aren't on the table.
