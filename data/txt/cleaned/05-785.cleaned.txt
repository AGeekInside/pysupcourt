CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next
in Carey versus Musladin. Mr. Ott.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. OTT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OTT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
This Court has never addressed the
constitutionality of photo buttons worn by spectators
during a criminal trial. The two closest decisions of
this Court, Estelle v. Williams and Holbrook v. Flynn
established only a general rule that some courtroom
practices may be so inherently prejudicial that they
violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Neither
Flynn nor Williams --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it went a little bit beyond
that. I mean, the -- Justice Marshall announced not
merely the possibility of inherent prejudice, but he
spoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that
improper factors would come into play in the jury
decision. Isn't that the criterion?
MR. OTT: An unacceptable risk, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the criterion.
MR. OTT: Well, the test has been formulated
different ways --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the way he formulated it.
That's the way the Court in Flynn formulated it.
MR. OTT: In Flynn, it did, but it also, just a
paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we
need to answer is whether this practice, and there the
courtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial
that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial.
We don't believe that those are material --
JUSTICE SOUTER: That was the end point that they
were reaching, and then he elaborated on that by
referring to the unacceptable risk that improper
considerations would come into play. And it seems to me
that if you're going to talk about the criterion of the
test or the standard, however you want to describe it in
Flynn, you've got to get that latter point about
unacceptable risk of improper factors.
MR. OTT: That certainly was a formulation of the
test. It's been -- we can accept it as the formulation
of the test. And it was accepted by the California
courts below. They attempted to apply that test. They
announced the proper -- the correct clearly established
law of this Court, and then proceeded to analyze the
issue.
Below, however, on Federal habeas review, the
circuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to
define clearly established law under AEDPA. Instead of
assessing the state court's application of the general
rule, the circuit court narrowed this Court's general
rule into one that specifically condemned buttons.
Instead of granting the state court wide leeway to
apply this Court's general rule, it -- the circuit court
created a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit
buttons in any case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if the court of
appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme
Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in
case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court
rule, and we're bound by case A. This is the elaboration
we've given to it. And we have to find that the state
court, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're
bound by what we do when we review what the state court
has decided.
MR. OTT: Well, Your Honor makes a distinction
between a post-AEDPA case and pre-AEDPA cases. In a
post-AEDPA setting, it is -- the circuit court of appeals
is looking at its own post-AEDPA case -- post A-E-D-P-A,
AEDPA case which has said that this set of facts
constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly
established law.
We don't disagree that stare decisis might come
into play there. It doesn't mean that that first
decision was correct, but we don't -- what happened here
in contrast was a pre-AEDPA decision that was used to
define the clearly established law of this Court, give it
more detail such that the circumstances here fell outside
of it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: To apply an opinion of this Court
to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of
the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not
necessarily to say that that is clearly established
Supreme Court law. It just means that it is their best
guess as to how it comes out, right?
MR. OTT: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they're forced to decide
it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either
means this or that. They're not applying a clearly
established test to the Supreme Court, are they?
MR. OTT: Not by doing that. However, the circuit
court of appeals here expressly stated it was looking to
its own circuit authority to define the law that is
clearly established. It specifically stated that this
case, that the state's decision was unreasonable in light
of Norris. It specifically stated that the state court's
decision could not reasonably be distinguished from
Norris.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're looking under AEDPA
at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.
What do you do in a situation where you think the state
court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but
nonetheless reached the correct result? In other words,
correct understanding of the established Supreme Court
law would have led to the same result as their incorrect
articulation of it.
MR. OTT: Mr. Chief Justice, at first, the -- the
first thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as
this Court stated in Wilford v. Biscotti. Look at the
fair import of the decision.
Now, I don't know if you are referring to the
issue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at
the end of the state court's decision here, but the first
question is to look at the fair import. And if the fair
import is that the correct test was applied, then habeas
relief does not lie.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. My hypothetical,
and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is
let's say that the state court wrongly articulates
Supreme Court law. But under the correct articulation,
it leads to the same result. What happens in that case
under AEDPA?
MR. OTT: I believe that the habeas relief should
not lie. Now, I have seen circuit courts treat it
different ways. Some courts will decline to give
deference and review it de novo, but I don't think
Congress intended, in enacting AEDPA, the A-E-D-P-A, that
a state habeas -- a state conviction should be overturned
simply because of an accident in a statement or
formulation of the test, but the conviction is otherwise
constitutionally balanced --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You are actually saying the
answer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would
then review it de novo. But on de novo review, you would
sustain the conviction if it came to the right result.
MR. OTT: Yes. I believe so. If I understood you
correctly -- the question correctly, yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You would not affirm -- you
would not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA. You
would say AEDPA authorizes review, but on review, we
conclude the conviction was correct. That's what I
understand the AEDPA to be.
MR. OTT: Yes, with the caveat that we're assuming
that the hypothetical is that the state court has
misapplied, that the fair import has -- they have
misapplied the holdings of this Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It misarticulated them. I
guess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed
they reached what we would regard as the correct result
under the correct standard, they just articulated the
wrong standard.
Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be
reviewed without AEDPA deference?
MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. Then I misunderstood
the question. The deference would still apply if you
could look at the decision as a whole and see that the
correct standard was applied. If they have erroneously
stated the standard -- if the state court erroneously
stated the standard, but you can look to the decision as
a whole, and see that the correct standard was
nevertheless applied, deference is still due.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're concerned here with the
court of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that
opinions of courts other than this Court have in
determining whether law is clearly established.
Do you exclude entirely from the province of what
is proper for the Federal court to consider any court of
appeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?
MR. OTT: Yes, we do, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that the only thing -- your
argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are
decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a
case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then
that's the end of it?
MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. We -- our position is
that a Federal habeas court may not look at all to state
or circuit authority on the question of what is clearly
established, only the holdings of this Court, and what
appears on their face.
If there's a general rule, such as here, the
question moves to the reasonable application prong.
And under that prong, because the rule is general, as
this Court stated in Yarborough versus Alvarado, the more
general the rule, the more leeway there is. Relief can
still lie under certain circumstances, but it's -- it
moves into a question of objective reasonableness of the
state court's decision.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose all of the -- suppose
there are five circuits. They're the only ones that
looked at the issue. And they all say, we think the
general rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't
that entitled to some weight? You're not supposed to
cite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you
go to the state court?
MR. OTT: If Your Honor is speaking only to the
clearly established prong, my answer would be no. If a
circuit court says Jackson v. Virginia is clearly
established law on the sufficiency of the evidence, we
have no dispute with that. But to redefine or shape this
Court's holdings beyond the face of those holdings, our
position is that cannot be done with state or circuit
law.
Circuit law and state law may be relevant to the
question of reasonable application, but not on the first
prong. If a Federal habeas court looks to circuit or
state authority on the first prong of 2254(d)(1), the
reasonableness becomes a foregone conclusion. The
two -- the two sections of the statute collapse into what
is essentially de novo review, as what happened here.
Once, for instance, the habeas court here decided that
its own circuit authority required -- or prohibited
buttons, reasonableness was a foregone conclusion, even
though it was addressed by the circuit.
But in further response to your question, Your
Honor, our position is that on the reasonable application
prong, a Federal habeas court may look to state and
circuit cases. They are of varying relevance, but they
should look to state and Federal circuit cases equally,
but not all those cases have the same relevance. We have
-- there is a distinction between pre-AEDPA and
post-AEDPA cases, and the distinction between whether
those cases support or contradict the state court's
opinion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So would there be any
difference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the
circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.
MR. OTT: There would be a difference, Your Honor.
The -- depending on the prong we're looking at, under --
our argument would still be the same under -- on the
clearly established prong of 2254(d)(1), that even if
Norris was a post-AEDPA case, that the circuit court
could not look to Norris to define this Court's holdings.
But Norris, if it were a post-AEDPA case would
have more relevance on the reasonable application prong.
There, stare decisis might come into play. It doesn't
mean Norris is correct. It doesn't mean that the result
reached by the circuit court of appeals in this case
would be correct, but it would certainly be more
relevant.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us -- let's assume
for a minute that this case were on direct review, that
we don't have AEDPA. What is the standard that should
control? Whether there is an impermissible -- an
unacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be
taken into account by the jury? Is that the test?
MR. OTT: That is a test, the test, one of the
formulations of it. I don't believe it materially
differs from -- our position is it doesn't materially
differ from the general due process, fair trial standard
that applies in all cases.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you should make it
more specific for us. You say general due process. How
does that work in this case? I want to know whether or
not I can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a
button, a piece of clothing. What's the test that I use?
MR. OTT: Your Honor, it is an assessment of all
the circumstances, that if you're a trial judge --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- unless you want to go
on, that doesn't help me. We just tell all the judges in
the country to assess all the circumstances, we say no
more?
MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. Let's take the
impermissible factor test. The state court judge should
look at the circumstances before him and determine
whether he believes that there is an unacceptable risk of
impermissible factors coming into play.
Whether the practice at issue, whether it be
buttons or ribbons or what have you, is so likely to
prejudice this defendant or violate or infringe on his
fundamental rights that we need to order them removed.
Not just as a matter of supervisory power, but as a
constitutional requirement.
So it is a spectrum test, Your Honor. And it's
essentially a totality test of the circumstances of the
buttons, let's say, and there can't be a bright line
rule. The circumstances --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't there be here? I
mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in
this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not
exaggerate. But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea.
For obvious reasons.
Now, at some point, if enough judges say that,
each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't
say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that
inherent risk that it's unconstitutional. But if some
point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is
quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a
courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does
it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what
opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and
unconstitutional?
MR. OTT: Your Honor, my answer is no. As a
supervisory matter, a state court can do whatever it
wishes. Under the state constitution, state statutes,
state rules of court, can do many things under its
supervisory power or even state constitutional power.
That is different altogether, however, from saying
that all buttons violate the Constitution, which is
different in turn from saying all buttons require habeas
relief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about banners? What would
you do with banners?
MR. OTT: I beg your pardon?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do with banners?
Would it make sense to say all banners are banned from
the courtroom? I thought you would think that would make
a lot of sense.
MR. OTT: Banners?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Signs, placards.
MR. OTT: Your Honor, I haven't seen a case
involving banners. I imagine that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I know why. Because it
affects the atmospherics of the trial.
MR. OTT: And likewise, we don't see all the
button cases where the buttons have been precluded.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you also don't allow people
to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't
allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats.
Everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not
necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the
trial; isn't that right?
MR. OTT: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's why we don't allow
banners, because a courtroom is not the place for
banners.
MR. OTT: That's correct, Your Honor. Decorum
should not be confused with --
JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right. Suppose you
think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners,
posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea.
Now, why? Not just because of decorum. But
because they introduce an extraneous factor into the
judgment of the jury.
And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do,
I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw
lines among buttons. It is pretty hard to draw lines
among banners. And the only way to guarantee fair trials
in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this. No
buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters.
How would you explain -- you just say the law
just doesn't permit that.
MR. OTT: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to say about
that? Because that is a concern I have.
MR. OTT: I understand, Your Honor. And this
Court obviously has the power to enact a prophylactic
rule that -- but a prophylactic rule covers many
unconstitutional as well as constitutional practices.
And that a prophylactic rule requires -- the prophylactic
rule that might be enacted would require preclusion of
buttons does not mean that all the buttons that might
come up are necessarily prejudicial.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not so sure. You think that
we could just say we're going to exercise our best
judgment, not necessarily amend the Constitution, just
because it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby
banned forever? Do we have the authority to just say
that?
MR. OTT: Well, Your Honor, in this case, this
case has -- this Court granted certiorari on the question
of application of the AEDPA. So we are not asking --
certainly not asking for that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're exploring initially what
the rule ought to be.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?
Supposing we all thought that this practice in this
particular case deprived the defendant of a fair trial,
but we also agreed with you that AEDPA prevents us from
announcing such a judgment. What if we wrote an opinion
saying it is perfectly clear there was a constitutional
violation here, but Congress has taken away our power to
reverse it.
Then a year from now, the same case arises. Could
we follow -- could the district court follow our dicta or
could it -- would it be constrained to say we don't know
what the Supreme Court might do?
MR. OTT: It could not follow this Court's dicta
under this Court's statement in Williams v. Taylor that
only the holdings, not the dicta, of this Court establish
clearly -- clearly establish Supreme Court authority.
I believe that the rule, if there's going to be
one, should be the rule that was applied here. A general
rule of fundamental fairness considering the totality of
the circumstances before the trial court. I think the
rule works. And it worked in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need to
establish that rule, do you? You just need to establish
that what the Supreme Court determined was not an
unreasonable application of this Court's law?
MR. OTT: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
We're not asking for a new rule applicable to buttons.
The reason we're here is because of the circuit court's
method in addressing this case and granting habeas
relief.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the button had said --
the three buttons had said "Hang Musladin," would you say
that there was not -- there was not sufficiently clear
law from this Court to find that practice
unconstitutional under Justice Marshall's formulation.
MR. OTT: Your Honor, it wouldn't change the
clearly established prong. We still have the general
rule, but I think that your instance is one that all
judges would agree is so egregious that it falls within
the ambit of that, and would require habeas relief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Falls within the ambit of what?
Of a mob-dominated atmosphere or -- your answer to
Justice Souter was AEDPA would -- was that this would
require reversal even under AEDPA; is that your answer?
MR. OTT: I can concede that, yes, Your Honor,
that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: We both want to know why you say
that.
MR. OTT: Well, the question is objective
reasonableness. And we don't dispute that some
circumstances may present such a situation that no one,
no judge is going to disagree that the situation, at the
state court, if it denied the relief on the three buttons
you posed was unreasonable.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but what are the --
getting into the formulation, what are the impermissible
factors as to which a risk is raised by wearing the "Hang
Musladin" button? What are those factors?
MR. OTT: The "Hang Musladin" button, the
impermissible factor first is the explicit message.
"Hang Musladin." "Convict him." It's urging the jury to
convict him and that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what's wrong with that?
The prosecutor is going to get up and urge the jury to
convict him. What is wrong with it on the button? What
risk does the button raise that the prosecutor's argument
does not? That's what we're getting at.
MR. OTT: It is an outside influence, Your Honor.
It is an influence coming from --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How different is it from
the victim's family sitting in the second row behind the
prosecution every day of the trial? And I mean, I'm --
the hypothetical correctly focuses on the question, at
least for me, of whether or not you can have specific
applications of general rules that are clearly
established. I'm just not sure your agreement with it is
advisable because it seems to me that simply having --
how many people have to wear these buttons? One person
shows up with a "Hang Musladin" button, does that mean it
is a mob-dominated trial?
MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. My -- what I -- the
point I meant to make was that we're not urging that
relief can never lie because there's a general rule of
application.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.
MR. OTT: It's a spectrum. And I would -- I'm not
conceding that the example necessarily requires habeas
relief, because there are a whole host of circumstances
that we wouldn't know about it, for instance, whether it
was ever seen, in cases that people don't see the button,
or what have you.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What about simply the facts that
we have in this case, which I thought I was doing, maybe
I wasn't clear about it, but the button is different.
Instead of putting a picture of the victim, it's got the
statement, "Hang Musladin." It's worn every day by three
members of his family who sit behind the prosecution
table within the sight of the jury. Assume those facts.
Would habeas relief be required under the
general rule?
MR. OTT: I don't think it would be required. I
think it would be reasonable to say that habeas relief
must lie. There are many -- there are much fewer
inferences that could be drawn there.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a way of saying that it's
required? Should -- look, should a court grant habeas
relief on my facts?
MR. OTT: Not necessarily, Your Honor. It --
there are --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?
MR. OTT: Well, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out,
three family members of the victim sitting in the front
row, buttons or not, the buttons don't add -- add little,
if anything, to the three victim's family members sitting
there grieving through a trial. They add very little,
for instance, in this case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether they are
grieving or not, but I certainly know the sentiment that
they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a
button that says "Hang Musladin."
MR. OTT: Your Honor, I submit that the sentiment
is obvious to the jury.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon?
MR. OTT: I would submit that that sentiment is
obvious to the jury, that a juror --
JUSTICE SOUTER: They may not want him hung. They
may not believe in the death penalty.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you hadn't said that.
Because I had thought that one of the things that made
this case leaning in your direction is the fact that
merely having a picture of their loved one on the button
doesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant,
or even convict the defendant. It just conveys, at most,
to the jury, you know, this is -- we have been deprived
of someone we love, you should take this matter very
seriously and consider the case carefully. It is an
important matter to us. And therefore, you ought to
deliberate carefully. I don't know that it means
anything more than that.
MR. OTT: Your Honor, I did not intend at all to
suggest that that was a message from those buttons. What
I meant to say was the buttons add very little. Because
I think a juror understands what a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You said, you know, convict
what's -- or hang What's His Name. That's quite --
you're equating that with the buttons in this case. And
I don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and
so, or even convict so and so. They just say we have
been deprived of a loved one. This is a terrible matter.
Please, jury, consider this case carefully. That's all
it necessarily says.
MR. OTT: That's, if any message, what the buttons
conveyed in this case. I was only speaking to the
difference between the buttons that Justice Souter posed
as putting forth a more explicit message.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, assuming that explicit
message, could habeas relief be granted in my
hypothetical case?
MR. OTT: Not necessarily, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?
MR. OTT: Because in your case, I don't think that
that message necessarily -- I think it is reasonable for
a state court to conclude that those buttons did not add
much to, if anything, to the presence of --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it reasonable for a state
court to say that three family members sitting in a
courtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of
days the trial ran, saying at the guilt stage, hang so
and so, is exposing the jury to a proper influence, that
it should, and may consider in deciding guilt or
innocence?
MR. OTT: Your Honor, we could concede that for
this case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Why don't you concede that
of course that would be exposing the jury to an improper
influence, in the "Hang Musladin" case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought some states require
that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their
case to the jury for harsh penalty. I don't know that
that's necessarily inappropriate to know that the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's at sentencing after
conviction.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: My hypo is at the guilt stage,
not the sentencing stage.
MR. OTT: At the guilt stage, that's right.
California statutes do require that victims' families be
able to make a statement at sentencing. They also
require that the victim's family, if the victim is not
alive, be present at the guilt phase of the trial, during
the guilt phase of the trial.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the guilt stage, is there
any, is there any question in your mind that allowing the
family members to display this message to a jury
throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a
risk, an unacceptable risk, that the jury will consider
improper influences in reaching its verdict?
Is there any question?
MR. OTT: Your Honor, your -- your buttons might
raise an impermissible risk.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's my hypothetical. My
buttons, "Hang Musladin," is there any question about the
risk of improper influence on my hypothetical? Not this
case, my hypothetical.
MR. OTT: They do, but it might still be
reasonable for a state court to conclude otherwise. And
it was certainly reasonable for the state court here to
conclude that three simple buttons bearing only a photo
did not convey any message of blame, guilt, anything
other than grief of this family.
If I may reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Ott.
MR. OTT: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fermino?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. FERMINO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FERMINO: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the
Court:
I want to direct this Court's attention to the
state court opinion which appears at 55A to 78A of the
appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari in this
case. I want Your Honors to take a look at that opinion.
It is 25 pages in length, but the portion of the opinion
dealing with the buttons issue is two pages in length.
Of those two pages, all but a few sentences deal
directly with the Norris case. I believe it is at
roughly page 72A in their -- 73A of the appendix. All
but three sentences deal with the Norris case.
The Attorney General has said in its briefing that
the court below teased out the particular reference to
the buttons, that it carefully parsed the opinion, that
it gave a tendentious analysis. This is the description
of the Attorney General. Nothing could be further from
accuracy.
These two pages discuss Norris head on. It is the
elephant in the room, if you will. The court below could
not have -- it would have been impossible for the court
below to write this opinion without addressing the Norris
case head on.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the key sentence in
this is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a
button which -- I don't know what the size is. Nobody
has told them what the button is about. Nobody has put
for the judge a picture of it. Nobody showed him what
the button is. So he says a simple photograph of Tom
Studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other
than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family
member. Period. Now, what else is there to say? That's
the court's conclusion.
And it is pretty hard for me -- I looked for the
button. I couldn't even find the button in the record.
I didn't even know what this looks like. It is a button,
somebody later must have said two inches to four inches.
I don't know who said that. I don't know how the judge
could have known that. The button isn't in the record.
So why isn't it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to
influence anybody? That's what they say.
MR. FERMINO: Justice Breyer, I think that the --
JUSTICE BREYER: In this case.
MR. FERMINO: That's correct. And I think that
the court -- it is correct that the record before the
state court of appeals was inadequate to address -- to
answer the question. But I think what -- where the court
erred is in adding and grafting on an additional element.
It goes beyond that sentence that, Justice Breyer, you
focused on. I think it is that the -- it is the element
of branding. It's that this wearing of the buttons in a
sense branded the defendant in the eyes of the jurors.
JUSTICE BREYER: It goes on frequently in an
opinion. I have been known to do that myself. And I say
this court over here says it's a da-da-da, and I say
"sure isn't that." Well, what is it?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that language came from one
of our opinions, didn't it? The branding language?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was quoting Holbrook and
Flynn.
MR. FERMINO: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
That's right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can't fault the court
for just saying it isn't that. Mr. Ott says it isn't
that.
MR. FERMINO: That's correct. But I believe that
it is not part of the test. It was that the branding
language, as in Justice Brennan's -- in Justice Brennan's
dissent was not part of the text articulated by --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Repeated later in opinions for
the majority, I think.
MR. FERMINO: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In later cases, so I mean --
MR. FERMINO: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't just put it in Brennan's
dissent.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand your
point about the state court focusing on Norris. The
question under AEDPA is still whether or not it is an
unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.
MR. FERMINO: Well, in this instance, much has
been said about the opinion and the carefully written
opinion of the state court. But the portion of the
opinion that focuses on this issue is, as I said, roughly
two pages in length and deals almost entirely with
Norris. Norris was the contrast case for the court of
appeals.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in here it -- you agree
that the California court has as much authority to say
what Federal law is as the Ninth Circuit, right? They
are on a par. Ninth Circuit decisions in no way binds
the Supreme Court of California. Isn't that so?
MR. FERMINO: That is correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that this state court of
appeals chose to be respectful to the Ninth Circuit to
consider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a
very strong argument.
MR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would
respectfully disagree. I think that the -- were this
discussion of Norris to be a much longer discussion -- or
excuse me, part of a much longer discussion, that might
be true. But its entire focus was Norris. It used
Norris by way of negative explication to show that the
facts before it didn't fall within the rule as derived
from Williams and Flynn. And I think that goes beyond
respect to the Ninth Circuit.
I think it took the case, it grappled with it, it
decided that it was different than Norris. And I think
that there would have been no way for the court below to
have looked at the facts of this case without addressing
Norris --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what was the -- what in
your opinion -- this is why -- as you can see, I'm
concerned about buttons. I think they're probably a
problem. I think all judges are concerned about them.
But then I think about this particular case. And I look
at that single sentence: "It was unlikely to be taken as
a sign of anything other than normal grief."
I mean, suppose this had been a different case.
Suppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith
didn't pull the trigger. It was an unknown person called
Jones. Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see
the buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was
Smith. Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those
buttons. I could think that.
But this isn't that case. This is a case where
everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger. The only
question is whether the family's son came at him with a
machete. So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure,
they don't think the son came at him with -- I mean, they
don't think that. He's their son. What would you expect
them to think?
So that's why I thought that they are saying that
sentence, in this case. In this case, it would be taken
as sign of grief and nothing more.
MR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Breyer, that is
certainly a plausible reading of the state court opinion.
However, I think you've also identified one -- the
problem with this. It is the risk, not the reality. And
that's why we have to look beyond the facts of this case
and look to the rule as derived from the Williams and
Flynn case, as I think the court below properly did.
And in doing so, in applying it to this case, I
think you have to do away with this kind of courtroom
behavior. It is simply not acceptable. It is not
acceptable to wear --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To wear any buttons? It
says, "Fair Trial."
MR. FERMINO: Any courtroom practice that causes
an impermissible risk that the jury's -- that the jury
would come to a conclusion based on a factor not
introduced at trial is entirely prejudicial --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, most -- I don't
think -- a typical jury will understand that the victim
is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry
that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial.
And they may not like the person accused of murdering
their son. That is not -- that is sort of like in every
case. That's not -- the buttons don't seem to add much
to what the jury will derive from seeing the family
seated behind the prosecution bench.
MR. FERMINO: I agree with Mr. Chief Justice up
unto the point of it's not different wearing the buttons.
I think that you add the buttons, and you are creating --
you are doing essentially what the rule derived from both
Williams and Flynn teaches us is wrong.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Williams and Flynn and
all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they
went, it was always the government requiring a defendant
to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court
with shackles. And in the case that went for the
government, the extra officers in the courtroom.
We haven't had a case, have we, where it is
spectator conduct as opposed to government conduct that's
being attacked?
MR. FERMINO: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.
There isn't a case that is, that -- where the state
action element, if you will, is not present. However, I
would posit that in this case, where you have a judge, a
trial judge who denies a lawyer's motion, that you have
implicit in that state action, that the court has
endorsed the practice of --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That certainly goes beyond
where our precedent leaves off. That is, we are dealing
with direct impositions by government in a way that poses
an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.
MR. FERMINO: That's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. And you're having the
judge say that you can't wear certain signs, you can't
make certain demonstrations. If the family were there
and they -- and one of the members of the family was
sobbing, with tears coming out of her eyes, I -- that --
MR. FERMINO: Justice --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- much, it has much more impact
than a button.
MR. FERMINO: It -- and it might. But that kind
of behavior by a courtroom spectator can be controlled by
a trial judge if -- when it occurs. If it is
spontaneous, it can be controlled. A rule that
spectators aren't allowed to emote would be implausible,
or would be impractical. We are not talking here today
about controlling the emotions of spectators. We are
talking about an impermissible factor like a message or
the risk of a message.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but there is a First
Amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of
people other than the prosecution, people other than the
state, who is bringing this prosecution.
MR. FERMINO: There is no question that there is a
First Amendment issue here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So that makes it a different
case. It makes it very hard to say, well, the Supreme
Court's already decided this matter.
MR. FERMINO: Well, in the First Amendment
context, though, there's a balancing test that needs to
be employed, and it --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, it may come out the way --
it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say
that the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon
it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the
First Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to
wear buttons or cry or --
MR. FERMINO: I believe that Mr. Cohen in New
Hampshire wearing his sign regarding the draft --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that cuts against you.
MR. FERMINO: I understand that, but --
JUSTICE BREYER: This reason -- suppose,
hypothetically, I would think -- well, the rule should be
no buttons. No buttons, no signs, no banners. A
courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a
demonstration of any kind. Now, if I were to think that,
and I also were to think it's just too difficult to
figure out case by case whether there is or is not an
improper influence, suppose I thought both of those
things.
Now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side
says: One, you're supposed to decide whether this was
clear in the law. Two, if you're worried about the
future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law
either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was
cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta.
All right. You write for me the words I'm
supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.
MR. FERMINO: Justice Breyer, I think that the
rule derived from the Williams and Flynn cases is that
courtroom -- courtroom behavior that creates an
unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have -- or
have caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on
evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial.
And unless it advances some important state
interest, some compelling state interest like the concern
that I believe Justice Ginsburg raised about the forcing
a defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling
cases, that rule I think allows the opinion in this case
of the court below to not violate the prescriptions of
the AEDPA. I think that's clear. I think what the court
below did was essentially apply the rule that I just
discussed. And I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what about -- what if
the issue was mourning? The trial is being held and the
families appear and they're all in black because they're
still in mourning. Does that violate this clearly
established rule?
MR. FERMINO: I think you're getting -- Mr. Chief
Justice, I think the hypothetical gets closer to it as
well. I think a defendant's -- excuse me, a victim's
family wearing, appearing in court every day wearing
black gets closer to the kind of message import -- again,
the risk, not the reality -- that this case is -- that
the court below was concerned with.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my question is under
AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going
to keep the family out even in mourning, that would
violate the clearly established rule that you've just
articulated?
MR. FERMINO: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Even if it didn't, though, I
suppose you could draw a line between people who were
doing what they naturally do, and some people do wear
mourning, and some people will come into a courtroom and
be reminded of the person who died and sob. But in this
case, they're going out of their way to do something that
people in mourning do not normally do.
MR. FERMINO: That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And so you've got -- I think
you've got a stronger argument.
The problem that I have in this case is that,
number one, I view the wearing of the buttons, as I just
described it, as something that is abnormal and something
that is intended to presumably get the jury's attention.
I don't know why otherwise they would be doing it.
And from whatever source, we do know that the
button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger.
So it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and
understood perfectly that these were people who were
raising, in effect, an issue of sympathy. I can
understand that, and under the general rule out of
Williams and Flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn
good argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has
been raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations
as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom
evidence.
What, however, do I make of the fact that not one
single court has ever reached that conclusion and -- you
know, as a constitutional matter? Am I in the position
of sort of being Jim, and they're all out of step with
Jim? I'm raising a question about my own judgment
in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have
come to that conclusion. What do you think I should make
of that?
MR. FERMINO: I think it is a factor to consider
in the Court's analysis. However, I think the facts of
this case are unique precisely because this typically
doesn't -- we don't get this far because most trial
judges don't allow this kind of conduct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there have been -- haven't
there been court decisions that have held that buttons
didn't compromise a fair trial right?
MR. FERMINO: That's correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in assessing the
reasonableness of the California Supreme Court's
decision, how could we say Federal law was clearly
established when other courts considering our precedent
have gone the other way?
MR. FERMINO: Because I think that under -- I
think that this Court looking at the "contrary to" prong
of the analysis would -- can come to a conclusion that
the state court's decision wasn't -- I'm getting ahead of
myself.
I think the Court can properly, in looking at it
from a "contrary to" analysis, come to the conclusion
that, even with that body of case law, that the state
court got it wrong, that it misapplied the clearly
established law of this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't want to put your
-- hang your hat on the "contrary to" prong, though, do
you? Your argument, I thought, was an unreasonable
application argument.
MR. FERMINO: I think it's both, Mr. Chief
Justice. I think it's both. I think -- I don't need to
hang my hat on the "contrary to" because I think under
either prong --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, as Justice
Ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case
involving spectators. So it's not contrary to clearly
established law. We have cases stating the general
principle on which it relies, so maybe it's an
unreasonable application. But "contrary to" seems an
awful stretch.
MR. FERMINO: I wouldn't go -- Mr. Chief Justice,
I would not go as far as "an awful stretch," but I would
think that we, under the unreasonable application prong,
we certainly win. I think that there is also an argument
under the "contrary to."
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The record is confusing, at
least as I read it -- please correct me if I'm wrong --
on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn.
A, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons
were worn?
MR. FERMINO: It is not. It is not clear at all
from the record how many days.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it may have been for just one
day of the trial?
MR. FERMINO: It may have been. But according to
the declarations that were submitted in the petition for
collateral review, those are petitions -- those are
declarations of the trial counsel and of respondent's
mother -- it is that they were worn on multiple days by
several members of the family, and that the buttons were
anywhere from two to four inches in diameter. And that's
in the record.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where does it say that?
MR. FERMINO: Those declarations appear --
JUSTICE STEVENS: These are in the joint appendix.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: These were declarations filed
with the United States district court in habeas?
MR. FERMINO: They were filed actually as part of
the state collateral review proceedings. They were filed
with the habeas. And it appears that they are at the JA
6 and 8.
JUSTICE ALITO: Where does it say in there that
the buttons were worn every day?
MR. FERMINO: If I did -- I'm sorry, that question
--
JUDGE ALITO: It says that the family members were
there every day, or for many days. It doesn't say they
wore the buttons every day, unless I'm missing --
MR. FERMINO: No, Justice Alito, if I said that, I
misspoke. I was trying to say that the record is not
clear as to the frequency.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a time when the trial
judge said stop. Was there not? He initially denied the
motion.
MR. FERMINO: Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that there was a
time in the course of the trial when he told the family
members to stop wearing the buttons.
MR. FERMINO: I don't believe so, Justice
Ginsburg. I think that they were never admonished not to
wear them, but that the original ruling of the trial
judge stood as far as the wearing of the buttons was
concerned.
JUSTICE ALITO: In his opinion on denial of
rehearing, Judge Kleinfeld on the Ninth Circuit made the
point that at criminal trials -- and I suppose at other
trials -- it is an accepted feature of the proceeding
that there are going to be spectators who identify with
one or the other party. And there may be relatives of
the defendant in a criminal case. There may be relatives
of the victims. And it's apparent from their behavior
what they think about the case and which side should win.
And that's sort of a baseline that has to be
accepted in judging, not whether wearing buttons is good
as a -- whether we think it would be good if we were
announcing a court rule, but whether there's a violation
of due process. Do you accept that?
MR. FERMINO: Justice Alito, I do, as far as it
goes, accept that as a baseline. I think Judge Bea in a
separate dissent likened it to a family wedding, that we
all know who is here for which party. That we have no
quarrel with.
JUSTICE ALITO: So what is it about these
particular buttons that's reflected in the record that
shows that it goes significantly beyond what would be
inferred just from that rather common feature of trials?
MR. FERMINO: I think in looking at the rule again
derived from Williams and Flynn, we don't have to go
there. It's the risk, not the reality. I don't know
what could be inferred, and we don't know what was in the
jurors' minds as they saw those buttons. But the point
is that it could affect the outcome. It is an
impermissible factor that causes the possibility that the
jurors' verdict is based on something other than the
evidence.
JUSTICE ALITO: Why is there a greater risk? Why
do the buttons convey -- involve a greater risk than the
kind of behavior that Judge Kleinfeld was referring to?
MR. FERMINO: Because you can imagine as a juror
-- jurors are very attentive during trials -- that they
look out into the audience and see in the jury box -- I
mean, out in the audience, a group of people wearing
buttons. What are those buttons? What's on there?
What's the point of -- there's a degree of scrutiny
that's naturally going to occur by an attentive juror.
That's really the issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume -- risk of what?
That's what I'm puzzled by. Let's assume that the
buttons were big enough that they could recognize that
the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose
murder the trial was about. Let's assume all that. What
risk is that?
You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh,
he caused so much grief to so many people, once we found
him guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence.
But during the guilt trial? I mean, I see, gee, the
victim's family loved him a lot. This guy must be
guilty. That doesn't follow at all.
In the guilt phase, I don't see how that can
have any effect on the jury.
MR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's a
risk of a factor that is not subjected to adversarial
testing. It is the possibility that it could have an
impact.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the possibility. You
tell me that --
MR. FERMINO: Here you have --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a real possibility that
a jury is going to say, since this man's -- this victim's
family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?
MR. FERMINO: But that's only one possible message
of this button. And again, that's where I'm contrasting
the risk versus the reality. It's that it could be any
message that's sent.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have to depend on there
being a message? Isn't it enough if there is an
influence that is conveyed? I mean, what I thought the
problem was, was that there was as a result of the
obtrusive wearing of the button, that it created a risk
simply of an emotional approach to the determination of
guilt or innocence.
The jurors are more likely to feel sorry for the
family members sitting there a few feet away from them.
Perhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the
victim, but certainly for the family members. And it
would be that improper influence of emotionalism as
opposed to a particular message that is the problem here,
isn't it?
MR. FERMINO: I don't disagree with that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you accept that?
MR. FERMINO: I do accept that, and I don't need
to rely on a message. I would agree with the argument
that you've advanced.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. FERMINO: The -- I think it is important here
to look at the fact that no party in this case -- that
the state has not advanced that this is a practice that
should be endorsed or adopted. It is clear that everyone
involved has had a concern with the wearing of buttons or
any other kind of introduction into the proceeding that
would otherwise not be subject to meaningful adversarial
testing, and I think that's the problem in this case.
And I do believe if you look closely at the state
court opinion in this case, you will see that the court
below's opinion was correct, that they did not tease out
of the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious
reading, when you look at exactly what the state court
decided.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's just because we
haven't had a First Amendment case yet. I mean, we just
have parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial
for the defendant, for the state. Let's wait until the
ACLU brings a case about people who want to wear buttons
in court. Then you're going to have people arguing,
people ought to be able to wear buttons, just as they can
wear a shirt that says "Blip the Draft."
MR. FERMINO: But this Court, I think, could craft
an opinion that addresses that concern without the need
for simply awaiting that day.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, I'm not sure you're
right that nobody was concerned about -- everybody
thought the factors were wrong. I don't think the trial
judge did. The trial judge said he saw no possibility of
prejudice.
MR. FERMINO: And I misspoke. You're correct,
Justice Stevens. The trial judge did reach that
conclusion.
If there are no other questions, I would --
