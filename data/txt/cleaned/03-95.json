KNORR, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNORR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn its decisions a few years ago in the Ellerth\nand Faragher cases, this Court held that where a\nsupervisor has created a hostile work environment by acts\nof sexual harassment, the liability of the employer is not\nstrict, but rather is subject to an affirmative defense\nwhich centers around the opportunities provided by the\nemployer for corrective or preventive action.\nThe question here is whether that affirmative\ndefense should continue to be available where there is an\nallegation that the hostile work environment resulted in a\nconstructive discharge, and we submit that it should.\nIn our view there is nothing about a claim of\nconstructive discharge that changes the Ellerth-Faragher\nanalysis of hostile work environments. A supervisor's\nacts which create a hostile work environment don't produce\nstrict liability because they are not acts of agency; that\nis, they are not the acts of the employer. They don't\nbear the imprimatur of the employer. They aren't ratified\nby the employer, and they are not the sorts of things\nwhich could only be done by somebody invoking the\nauthority of the employer.\nQUESTION: Mr. Knorr, I'm -- I had a hard time,\nin reading the briefs on this case, figuring out what we\nought to do with the suggestion that there's a\nconstructive discharge theory. Now, I don't think this\nCourt has ever weighed in on that. It comes out of the\nlabor law context I guess.\nMR. KNORR: Yes.\nQUESTION: I'm wondering, you know, in -- in\nEllerth and Faragher, what we said was that when no\ntangible employment action is taken, a defending employer\nmay raise an affirmative defense to the liability. So I'm\nwondering if we shouldn't just try to look at the facts in\nthis case and ask whether what the supervisors did\namounted to a tangible employment action and that would\nanswer the -- the question.\nI -- I don't know that viewing it through the\nlens of a constructive discharge is helpful. What she\nsays is that the supervisors -- that she had taken tests\nto qualify for a promotion, that the supervisors had\nhidden the results of those tests and had thereby\nprevented any promotion, and that there was a false arrest\nI guess. Now, why shouldn't we just look to see if those\nactions occurred, and if so, whether they amounted to a\ntangible employment action? Wouldn't that answer the\nquestion?\nMR. KNORR: Justice -- Justice O'Connor, if we\nhaven't made this clear, then the Court has my sincerest\napologies because that is exactly what we suggest the\nCourt should do. If the underlying actions of the\nsupervisor amounted -- which -- which provoked the\nconstructive discharge amounted to a tangible employment\naction, then there is no affirmative defense.\nQUESTION: But -- but Justice O'Connor is going\na little bit further than that. I think she is suggesting\nthat there cannot be a constructive discharge without some\ntangible employment action because constructive discharge\nitself attributes to the employer the desire to get rid of\nthe employee, and that desire cannot simply be\ncommunicated through some lower -- lower people.\nNow, maybe the -- the tangible employment action\nis the refusal of the employer to respond when the obscene\nactions of -- of the -- of the coworkers here are brought\nto the employer's attention. That would be I -- would\nthat qualify as tangible action in -- in your part -- in\nyour estimation?\nMR. KNORR: I'm not sure if it would be tangible\naction or not, but it would certainly indicate that if the\nemployer didn't respond, that it was in some sense\nratifying or approving what it has done.\nQUESTION: I mean, the point is, how can you\nhave a constructive discharge? The only person that can\ndischarge is the employer. You have to pin it on the\nemployer. I don't know how -- how subordinates alone can\n-- can produce a situation that amounts to a constructive\ndischarge.\nMR. KNORR: That, Justice Scalia, is partly true\nand it partly is not true because the precise elements of\nwhat you need to prove to -- to get a constructive\ndischarge vary quite widely from court to court. And in\nsome courts what you say is quite accurate. There has to\nbe some proof of an intention on the part of the employer,\neven if it's only through a failure to respond to a\ncomplaint, to get rid of the employee. But in other\ncourts -- and -- and this includes the Third Circuit -\nthat is not really the case.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you think it ought to\nbe?\nMR. KNORR: I think it ought -\nQUESTION: There is a right answer to this,\nisn't there?\nMR. KNORR: Well, that's not a question that\nwe've presented or that the court has addressed. In -- in\nour view, the right answer to that would be, yes, you have\nto in some sense prove employer intent -\nQUESTION: Is there -- is there -- you -- you\nsay the -- the standards vary. Is there any jurisdiction\nthat -- for a -- that recognizes constructive discharge\nthat does not require the employee to prove that the\nemployee acted reasonably in relation to avenues for\nredress, filing grievances and so on? Is -- is there any\n-- is there any jurisdiction in which the employee's\nreasonableness in trying to adjust things before leaving\nis not an element of the -- of the claim?\nMR. KNORR: I think that the short answer to\nthat question is yes. There are such jurisdictions and\nthey include the Third Circuit, but I need to be a little\nmore expansive than that because in all jurisdictions,\nincluding -- including the Third Circuit, there is an\ninquiry into whether the employee acted reasonably, but -\nand in some jurisdictions, that inquiry is directed to -\nto the question of whether the employee tried to resolve\nthis -- this matter internally. In other jurisdictions,\nincluding the -- the Third Circuit, the inquiry into\nemployee reasonableness is tied only to the question of\nhow bad were the conditions; that is, were these\nconditions so bad that a reasonable person would quit?\nAnd in that inquiry, it may or may not even be relevant\nwhether the employee tried to -- to resolve it internally.\nQUESTION: But it was in the Third Circuit\nbecause the judge somewhere in that long opinion did say\nthat the evidence that she had complained -- that that\nwould be relevant, but not essential evidence to show the\nreasonableness of her reaction treating this conduct as a\ndischarge.\nMR. KNORR: I'm not sure the court went that\nfar. The court said that -- that it might conceivably be\nrelevant and in -- in a later -\nQUESTION: I thought -- I thought it was\nstronger than -- than that. It may be different -\nMR. KNORR: And it -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- in different places because this\nopinion tended to say everything at least twice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNORR: My recollection is that the court\ndidn't give very much specific direction on what should\ncome in on a remand in this case. As a general matter,\nthe court of appeals was quite clear that it was up to\ndistrict courts to decide whether all, some, or none of\nevidence about anti-harassment policies and remedial\nefforts should come in. And that -\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nMR. KNORR: I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: Did you finish your answer? I -- I\nbeg your pardon.\nMR. KNORR: If -- if I could.\nAnd that inquiry, in turn, is tied simply into\nthe question of how bad were the conditions. That is, if\nthe conditions were bad enough, it doesn't matter if there\nwas an anti-harassment policy. It doesn't matter if there\nwere remedial efforts made. So the -- the inquiry, while\nit all is -- while it is all -- while it is always phrased\nin terms of employee reasonableness, can really be\ndirected to quite different things.\nQUESTION: May I ask you also to clarify? That\n-- you gave Justice O'Connor an answer that surprised me\nbecause she said let's stick to this case, and she said\nthat action involving the not -- not letting her have her\npapers, and then the arrest, that looking at those facts,\ncould that be -- is that the way the Court should go about\nit. But the district judge gave summary judgment for you\nin this case. Is that not so?\nMR. KNORR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So, then on Justice O'Connor's facts,\nthere would be no question whether she acted reasonably,\nwhether it was equivalent, whether it was equivalent to a\ntangible employment action.\nMR. KNORR: In terms of this particular case, in\nour view it is a little bit -- it -- it is too late in the\nday to reopen the inquiry as to whether the underlying\nactions of the supervisors were or were not tangible.\nThat -- that is something that should have been raised at\nthe district court level when we raised the affirmative\ndefense. What I -- what I -\nQUESTION: But there was no trial. This was\njust summary judgment. There was no evidence submitted.\nMR. KNORR: There -- well, there was no trial.\nThere was certainly evidence submitted, and it seems to us\nthat when we as the defendants say we are entitled to the\naffirmative defense and we are moving for summary judgment\non it, it's incumbent on the plaintiff at that point to\nsay, no, you aren't entitled even to assert the\naffirmative defense because we have this action and this\naction and this action which were taken, which are\ntangible employment actions, and therefore you aren't even\nentitled to the affirmative defense. And that didn't\nhappen. At no point in this case has the respondent ever\nsaid that she was subjected to a tangible employment\naction other than the constructive discharge itself.\nQUESTION: Suppose we're back before the summary\njudgment stage and you're telling the trial court what the\ntheory of the case should be. Would your theory be\nsomething like this? Whether we use the phrase,\nconstructive discharge or tangible employment action -\nand we have to use some phrase because the law works with\nlabels -- we're interested in the practical aspects of -\nof these cases, and one of them is this. Were there\navenues of redress? And if the employer was -- employee\nwas unreasonable in not following these avenues of\nredress, then there can be no constructive discharge or\ntangible employment action. Is that your position?\nMR. KNORR: No, Justice Kennedy, and I -- I\nguess I -\nQUESTION: It sounds like a good position. Why\nisn't that your position?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNORR: Our -- our position really is that\nthis case and -- and hostile environment cases generally\nwhich are alleged to be constructive discharges are just\nlike Ellerth, that what you do is you look at what the\nsupervisor did to the employee to provoke the discharge,\nand if those actions were hostile work environment, if\nthey were -- if they were -- I hate to use the word\nmerely, but if they were acts of sexual harassment, not\narising to tangible actions, if the employee had simply\nsued on the hostile work environment, we'd have an\naffirmative defense. Our position is that doesn't change\nor it shouldn't change because there is also a claim that\nit was so bad that I had to quit.\nQUESTION: How is that different from the\nformulation that one component in almost all cases of\nconstructive discharge or tangible employment action,\nwhatever you want to call it, is the existence or\nnonexistence of avenues for redress, and if they did\nexist, whether the employee took reasonable steps to\nfollow them.\nMR. KNORR: If that were true across the board,\nJustice Kennedy, there would be no difference. You're -\nyou're entirely correct.\nQUESTION: Why does -\nQUESTION: Then why --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: No, no please.\nI was -- why isn't the way to simplify the\nproblem and decide this case for us to say in order to\nhave constructive discharge, there has got to be the\nelement that Justice Kennedy just described, i.e., avenues\nof redress, reasonableness on the part of the employee in\navailing or perhaps in some cases not availing of them?\nIf that element is shown, then there is no point in\nrecognizing the affirmative defense because that is in\npretty clear contradiction to one element of the\naffirmative defense. And -- and that would make for a\nfairly simple body of law. Why -- why isn't that the\nappropriate way for us to go?\nMR. KNORR: I think that is certainly a way to\ngo, Justice -- Justice Souter. If it were -- if it were\nclear across the board in all jurisdictions that to prove\na constructive discharge, you do have to have made some\neffort to invoke a remedial process, just as with the\naffirmative defense, then that would certainly -- that\nwould certainly satisfy our concerns.\nQUESTION: Why does a -- why does a plaintiff\nbring a constructive discharge suit instead of just a\nregular sexual harassment suit? Is it -- is it a matter\nof getting more damages? Is that the reason for -\nMR. KNORR: Yes, I think so.\nQUESTION: -- for couching it in those -- in\nthose terms?\nMR. KNORR: Yes, because then you've got the -\nthe lost wages and so forth for -- for the entire time.\nQUESTION: I'm troubled by that too. I mean, I\ndon't understand why we're using that term at all in light\nof the case background here. Why isn't it couched in\nterms of allegations of sexual harassment and tangible\nemployment action?\nMR. KNORR: That is -- that is the way we think\nthat it should be couched, Justice O'Connor. The -- the\nuse of the constructive discharge is -- was the\nplaintiff's choice, of course, and -\nQUESTION: But that -- that too is the Third\nCircuit's theory in the case. They very much relied on\nthe analogy to constructive discharge, didn't they?\nMR. KNORR: Yes. I think that their -- their\nview is that a constructive discharge is -- is just the\nsame as an actual discharge.\nQUESTION: No -- no court has rejected the\nconstructive discharge. The question is how do you define\nit. And you said, in response to Justice Souter, that it\nwould be fine if you said, plaintiff, you're in this\nsituation, you're claiming constructive discharge, you\ncome in and -- and, in effect, negate what would otherwise\nbe the affirmative defenses. But they -\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I thought two circuits\nhold that a constructive discharge is never a tangible\nemployment action. I mean, that's part of the problem.\nMR. KNORR: Yes. That's -- that is correct.\nAnd -- and frankly, I don't think that is a correct\nanalysis either. Our view is that a -- a -- in a -- in a\nsense a constructive discharge can't ever be a tangible\nemployment action because it isn't an action at all. It's\njust a construct. Our view is you look at -- to what it\nis that the supervisor did, and if that's a tangible\nemployment action, then there is no affirmative defense,\nwhether -- whether or not the employer is -\nQUESTION: But there's an -- there's an\nintermediary situation and that's the one where there is a\ntangible action like you get demoted or you get\ntransferred to a -- a worse position. And that -- that's\none category. Another category is you say I was harassed\nconstantly and that amounts to constructive discharge.\nAnother is they did take a tangible action against me,\nthey didn't discharge me, but they were so bad in\nharassing me and in this demotion, that it amounted to a\nconstructive discharge. That -- that constructive\ndischarge is the label used for that too, isn't it?\nMR. KNORR: It can be. An employee can\ncertainly say I was -- I was subjected to a humiliating\ndemotion and that was so bad -\nQUESTION: So I quit.\nMR. KNORR: -- that I quit. Had she just sued\njust on the demotion, clearly a tangible employment\naction, and we would have no affirmative defense. If she\nalso goes on to say, and it was so bad that I quit, I\nthink we again should not have the affirmative defense.\nQUESTION: But the Seventh Circuit goes the\nother way on that.\nMR. KNORR: Yes, they do. Yes, they do.\nAnd by the same token, if the employee simply\nsays, I was sexually harassed and subjected to a hostile\nwork environment, we would have the affirmative defense.\nIf she goes on to say, and -\nQUESTION: Is that true even if the person who\ndid the harassment and so forth but did not otherwise take\na tangible action, was the president of the company and\nsaid -- made the -- the workplace impossible to have it\nfor the employee and she quits. Would that be a tangible\nemployment action?\nMR. KNORR: I don't think you'd reach that\nquestion, Justice Stevens. I -- I think what would come\ninto play there is the idea that there are -- there are\nsome people in every organization who are so high up that\nthey are proxies for the employer itself.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. KNORR: And so it -- it really is -\nQUESTION: And that person who's a proxy does\nnot commit a -- make a -- a tangible decision, doesn't\nfire her. He just makes it impossible for her to work.\nWould that be actionable or not?\nMR. KNORR: That would be actionable because it\nis the action of the employer, and you don't even have to\nget into the question of whether it is an agent of the\nemployer or not.\nQUESTION: Even though it was a tangible -- even\nthough it was a constructive discharge.\nMR. KNORR: I think at that point it -- that is\nall irrelevant because what you're talking about is the\nact of someone who is the proxy of the employer and\ntherefore the employer is responsible for it.\nMr. Chief Justice, if I could reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Knorr.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn employer is strictly liable for a\nconstructive discharge in any harassment that has preceded\nit only when the constructive discharge comes about as a\nresult of an official company act, such as a demotion. If\nthe constructive discharge comes about as a result of a\nsupervisor's creation of a hostile environment, then the\nemployer has an affirmative defense and can show that the\nplaintiff unreasonably bypassed available opportunities\nfor correction.\nNow, the requirement of an official company act\nas a predicate for strict liability comes from the Court's\ndecision in Ellerth and is supported by two important\nconsiderations.\nFirst, a company act is the kind of act that is\nlikely to be documented and subject to higher levels of\nreview, and so it's the kind of act over which the\nemployer can exert the most control. And that heightened\npotential to control makes it fair to hold the employer\nstrictly liable, even if in a particular case the employer\nwould otherwise be able to show that it acted reasonably\nand the plaintiff did not.\nIt -- it -- second of all, furthering title\nVII's -- the -- recognizing the affirmative defense when\nthere's not an official company act, furthers title VII's\nprophylactic purposes because it gives the employer an\nextra incentive to create policies that will help to\nprevent discrimination from occurring in the first place\nand it gives employees an added incentive to complain\nbefore problems become Title VII violations.\nQUESTION: Well, how do you think we should\nanalyze this particular case in light of the Third\nCircuit's treatment? How does this fit into your formula?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, in this -- in this case\nyou might want to -- what I was going to go on to say is\nyou might want to initially decide the logically\nantecedent question of what it takes to -- to make out a\nconstructive discharge claim in the first place. And if\nyou did that, you should say that to prove constructive\ndischarge, a plaintiff has to show that there's no\nreasonable other alternative other than to resign. And a\nplaintiff who has unreasonably bypassed an available\nopportunity for correction can't make out a constructive\ndischarge claim in the first place.\nQUESTION: When you -- when you posit that\nreasonableness requirement, I take it you -- you mean to\ninclude that the employee must show either that the\nemployee reasonably availed herself or himself of whatever\ngrievance procedure there was or at least had a reasonable\nbasis for not doing so.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That -- that's correct, Justice\nSouter.\nQUESTION: Now, if -- if you do that, what is -\nwhat is left of the affirmative defense, whether there was\n-- whether there was a supervisor involved or not, because\nthe affirmative -- as I understand the affirmative\ndefense, the affirmative defense is inconsistent with that\nshowing?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Souter, you are right\nwith respect to the constructive discharge claim itself;\nthat is, proving the constructive discharge will\nnecessarily negate the affirmative defense to the\nconstructive discharge claim. But that -\nQUESTION: So why don't we stop right there?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Because it doesn't necessarily\nnegate -- proving the constructive discharge doesn't\nnecessarily negate the affirmative case -- defense to the\nclaim of a hostile work environment that preceded the\nconstructive discharge.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the hostile work environment\nclaim -- and if -- if we're going to recognize\nconstructive discharge, hostile work environment I -- I\npresume has been subsumed under constructive discharge\nbecause constructive discharge says, hostile environment\nplus something more. And we've been describing the plus\nsomething more. And -- and in order to prove the plus\nsomething more, you've got to prove, as you said,\nsomething which is inconsistent with the affirmative\ndefense.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Let me try to explain to you how\nthis could come up. You could have a situation in which\nat the moment of resignation, the plaintiff was reasonable\nin believing that there was nothing she could do other\nthan to resign and reasonable in bypassing the available\nprocedures at the moment of resignation, therefore, could\nprove a constructive discharge. But it may have been the\ncase that at a prior point in time, she would have been\nunreasonable in failing to complain about the harassment\nand therefore be vulnerable to the affirmative defense on\nthe hostile environment claim even though she's proven her\nconstructive discharge.\nQUESTION: I understand what you're -- I\nunderstand what you're saying, but I -- I would suppose\nthat if -- if the evidence shows that it was -- that there\nwas a point at which she could have resolved this or at\nleast a point at which it would have been reasonable to\npursue grievances and so on to resolve it, and she didn't\ndo it, that she's going to lose. In other words, if -- I\n-- I don't -- I don't see how she's going to get to the\npoint that you describe.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the way that she would\nget to the point that I described, Justice Souter, is if\nyou had an escalating kind of harassment and at the last\nact of harassment, it would have been reasonable that -\nfor the plaintiff to leave at that point -- let us say the\nsupervisor does a lot of things, and then on the last act\nsays, if you come back tomorrow, you're dead.\nQUESTION: I -- I see your point. I -- I have\none question in response to the point, and that is, if -\nif we -- if we construct a system that -- that recognizes\nthe possibility that -- that you just described, are we\ngoing to have a system that is just so darned complicated\nthat it's going to be too difficult to administer?\nIn other words, every case is going to involve\nallegations of what you just say, denials of those\nallegations. In order to have an administrable system,\nshouldn't we simply say that if you can prove the\nconstructive discharge, if the -- if the element includes\nthe unreasonableness on grievance, no affirmative defense,\nand just get over with it simply because otherwise it\nwould be just too complicated a system?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Souter, it would be a\nsimpler system, but the -- the system we are proposing\nreally is just superimposing on this problem the same\nstructure the Court created in Ellerth and Faragher. The\nCourt could have devised a simpler rule in Ellerth and\nFaragher.\nQUESTION: You're saying it's my fault.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm saying that the Court took\ninto account various competing considerations in -- in\nstructuring it, and it made for a somewhat more\ncomplicated scheme.\nQUESTION: But it wasn't -\nQUESTION: Mr. Gornstein, could tell us what the\nGovernment proposes that we do in this case?\nQUESTION: Yes. That's what I want to know.\nQUESTION: You -- you asked us to remand because\nwhy?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: We would say that you would\nremand because it is possible that there is a -- an\nofficial company act that caused the constructive\ndischarge.\nQUESTION: To wit.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: To wit, the sequence of events\nleading up to the arrest, and that the arrest might be -\nwe're not saying that it is -- but it might be an official\ncompany act. If it is and the plaintiff could show that\nthat act left her with no reasonable alternative other\nthan to resign, you would have a constructive discharge\nthat leads to strict liability.\nQUESTION: How -- how could the -- how could the\narrest by an official company act?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It could be an official company\nif it is only the sort of thing -- if it depends on a\ngrant of authority from the employer to the supervisor and\nit's only the sort of thing that a supervisor could do.\nQUESTION: But it patently is not so. I mean,\nit -- it has nothing to do with employment. You don't -\nyou don't arrest somebody because he's your employee.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice -\nQUESTION: I mean, it -- it seems to me that -\nthat this action you're concerned about is not an employer\ntype of action. It is -- it is quite apart from\nemployment.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I think it could\nbe that you're right about that, but it also may be that\nit's the type of action where the -- the person was\nwearing both hats, as a supervisor and as a law\nenforcement officer, and that it was the -- only the sort\nof thing that a supervisor could have done. And all we're\nsaying is that should be fleshed out.\nIf you don't think that should be fleshed out,\nif the Court didn't think that that was a possibility,\nthen there wouldn't be the need for the -- the remand.\nYou could just decide it without a remand and -- and\nreverse on the grounds -- to get back to Justice Souter's\npoint, you still, under my scenario have to get to the\nquestion of whether a constructive discharge is a tangible\nemployment action.\nQUESTION: Suppose that the tangible employment\naction -- say, a demotion or an arrest or a firing -\ncould have been avoided if the employee had been prompt\nand reasonable in pursuing avenues for relief.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In that -\nQUESTION: And a reasonable employee in that\nposition would have done that and they didn't do it. Then\nit escalates. Then there's the discharge.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Then in that situation, there's\na constructive discharge, but there's a potential defense\nto the harassment claim that would depend on whether the\nconstructive discharge is itself a tangible employment\naction. It only is a tangible employment action if it's\nbrought about by an official company act, such as a\ndemotion. If it's not brought about by an official\ncompany act, then the affirmative -- no affirmative\ndefense for the constructive discharge because that's been\nnegated by proving constructive discharge. But there is\naffirmative defense for the prior acts leading up to it\nthat are framed as a claim about hostile environment.\nThere would be an affirmative defense to the hostile\nenvironment claim if the hostile environment culminates in\na constructive discharge that's not effected by an\nofficial company act.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought the first -- the last\nthing you said I thought is already there in Ellerth,\neither at least your tangible discharge or it doesn't or\ndoes. You have to show, you know, that they were\nreasonable in not making -- take advantage of a -- of a\ncomplaint procedure, and insofar as it doesn't, Ellerth\nalready says that there's a -- there's an affirmative\ndefense and we had a reasonable complaint procedure in\nplace. So I don't really see that problem.\nNor do I see the problem with the Third Circuit.\nThe Third Circuit says working conditions were\nintolerable, so intolerable a reasonable person would have\nconcluded there was no other choice but to resign.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?\nQUESTION: Briefly, yes.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. The -- what's that's\nmissing is there is that Ellerth requires an official\ncompany act to have a tangible employment action as a -\nnot just a change in status from being employed to not\nbeing employed. And if there's not an official company\nact, then the employer has the affirmative defense.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Bailey, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. BAILEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BAILEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPursuant to title VII, the general rule has been\nthat employers are liable for the discriminatory acts of\ntheir supervisors. The question presented is whether a\nconstructive discharge is the equivalent of a formal\ndischarge.\nOne of the greatest difficulties in dealing with\nthe law that we're addressing today is one of semantics.\nA formal discharge is the equivalent of a constructive\ndischarge by definition. It is a -- it is a matter of\nmethodology.\nThe United States and the petitioner would have\nthis Court define the culpability of the employer for the\nsupervisor's acts as a matter of official act. That leads\nthis Court down an incredibly complex road of -- of\ndefinitional problems.\nIf the Court goes back to Meritor, the Chief\nJustice's opinion, where the Court held clearly there is\nno automatic liability for the employer's being\nresponsible for the wayward acts, clearly outside the\nscope of employment, clearly not authorized, but we're not\ngoing to find a -- a -- an automatic liability.\nWhat the United States wants to do and why the\nrespondent believes that the Third Circuit -- that the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case properly\nis to devise a general rule and underline if proven, if\nthe constructive discharge is proven, then the obvious\noccurs. It's a tangible employment action.\nQUESTION: Well, but that's the whole question\nthat is presented in the -- in the question here. I mean,\nI don't think you can just say it's obvious.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, it's -- it's the -- to go\nback to some of the questions that Justice Souter was -\nSouter was raising, the issue of the -- of the\nconstructive discharge, when proven, reaches a point as a\npractical matter in litigation that the affirmative\ndefense is no longer viable. And the issue in the\nquestion presented is when a -- if -- if we stick to that\nissue, is that is a constructive discharge a tangible\nemployment action. Conversely, isn't it reasonable to\nassume that a constructive discharge, if proven, is an\nofficial company act?\nQUESTION: But isn't it the same?\nQUESTION: Why? Why? Why is that? It seems to\nme what you're saying is that up to the point where the\nharassment reaches such a level that a reasonable person\nwould leave, up to that point, the individual could not\nsue the employer because the employer is not responsible\nfor it. But suddenly when it goes over the edge and it's\neven worse and the person says, I'm going to leave,\nsuddenly the employer is automatically responsible for it.\nWhy -- why -- that doesn't make any sense at all.\nMR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I believe -- Justice\nScalia, I believe the -- the -- you can sue the employer.\nThe issue -- and that's -- that's the hostile work\nenvironment claim that -- that this Court was really\naddressing in Faragher. The issue becomes -\nQUESTION: You -- you can sue, but you're going\nto lose unless you show that there was some official\naction on the part of the employer that -- that caused\nthis or -- or that the employer didn't have a -- a means\nof remedying it.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, the case would then become a\nhostile work environment case.\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. BAILEY: There would not be a tangible\nemployment action. This -- the -- the employee can still\nsue. The issue then becomes that the affirmative defense\nis available. The issue here is the affirmative defense\nis not available.\nQUESTION: Why? I don't understand. I mean,\nthat's my point. Why is it that up to the point -- you\nknow, there's terrible harassment, and the employer could\n-- and the employee could sue. But if the employee sued\nthe employer, she would lose. But when it goes just -\njust an inch further and is justifiable cause for her to\nquit, all of a sudden the employer becomes responsible for\nwhat he was not responsible for earlier. That -- that\ndoesn't make any sense to me.\nMR. BAILEY: Okay. I -- I don't think it's -\nit's a situation where the employer is not responsible.\nIt's that the employer has mechanisms available to -- if\nproven, again, if -- if they can prevail on the\naffirmative defense to counteract the charges of hostile\nworkplace harassment.\nQUESTION: Okay. May -- may I interrupt you\nwith -- with this question because it goes to Justice\nScalia's question?\nIsn't -- for the reason you just gave, isn't the\nreason that the claim goes from a hostile environment for\nwhich there's a defense to constructive discharge for\nwhich there isn't a defense -- isn't the reason that in\norder to get from hostile environment to constructive\ndischarge, the employee has to prove something that she\ndidn't have to prove merely for hostile environment?\nMR. BAILEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that is the element -- we're -\nwe're assuming.\nMR. BAILEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: That is the element that she either\nreasonably availed herself of -- of the -- of grievance\nmechanisms or was reasonable in not doing so. And that's\nthe element that gets her to the more serious claim, and\nit's also the element that is inconsistent with the\naffirmative defense. Is -- is -\nMR. BAILEY: No, Your -\nQUESTION: Is that fair to say?\nMR. BAILEY: No.\nQUESTION: Okay. Tell me -- tell me why not.\nMR. BAILEY: It's -- it's putting the cart\nbefore the horse. It's taking the burden that this Court\ncarved out in Faragher and Ellerth and it's putting a\nburden on the employee which, as a practical matter, the\nemployee has to carry anyway in proving the constructive\ndischarge. We are back at the original question that you\nasked.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BAILEY: And -- and we're back where the\nThird Circuit in its -- in its opinion underlined if\nproven, held that if the constructive discharge -- if the\nconstructive discharge is proven, the affirmative defense\n-- and even the -- the United States admits this -- is in\nall likelihood not a cogent defense at that point, the\nconstructive discharge has been proven. That's -\nQUESTION: Is the availability of avenues of\nredress and -- coupled with a showing that there was no\npursuit of those reasonable avenues of redress, is -- are\nthose components or facts relevant to determining\nconstructive discharge?\nMR. BAILEY: Yes, they are relevant in this\nsense.\nQUESTION: Then we're not arguing about very\nmuch. Justice Souter says the constructive discharge is\nthen inconsistent. Maybe another characterization would\nbe superfluous. I mean, the reasonable -- the reasonable\nattempts to obtain redress is inconsistent. I -- I think\nmaybe superfluous. What are we arguing about here? Not\nvery much.\nMR. BAILEY: I respectfully disagree. Justice\nKennedy, in the process of proving the constructive\ndischarge, the salient factual issues that by implication\nyou refer to are going to arise. The employer is going to\nhave an opportunity in -- in the real case in controversy\nin the district court or during litigation and discovery\nof addressing issues and answering questions about -- and\nthis is where we get into a great difficulty with the\nposition of the United States. You know, when does the\nemployee -- when does the employee have a responsibility\nto come forward?\nMR. BAILEY: Well, it isn't the responsibility\nof the employee I'm concerned about. It's the\nresponsibility of the employer. And I don't agree with\nyour description of -- of what the rule is. That is, if\nthere were no grievance procedures available -- and that I\nagree ought to -- ought to pin -- pin the tail on the\nemployer. It's his fault and I'd hold him for the\nconstructive discharge. But you say if they were not\navailable or if she reasonably didn't use them, well, I\nmean, these -- these renegade employees who were -- who\nwere performing these acts of sexual harassment -- suppose\nthey tell her if you file a grievance, we're going to kill\nyou. Now, I'd say that's pretty reasonable for her not to\nfile a grievance. But is that the employer's fault? How\n-- how does that somehow attribute all of this action to\nthe employer? She should sue these individuals.\nMR. BAILEY: Justice Scalia -\nQUESTION: He -- he has in place the grievance\nprocedures. The fact that they threatened her life is -\nis not at all his responsibility. So how do you -- how do\nyou attribute to him a constructive discharge? I don't\nsee it.\nMR. BAILEY: Justice Scalia, it begs a multitude\nof questions. Those questions relate -- and they're\nprobative. They're of probative value in any litigation.\nAnd they relate to how that -- that scheme, that remedial\nscheme, the internal, private remedial scheme, how it is\nenforced, how it's policed.\nQUESTION: That's fine. But so -- so long as\nyou're willing to acknowledge that the mere fact that she\nwas reasonable in not resorting to the grievance\nprocedures, does not establish that it's the employer's\nfault. So long as you accede to that, you say that's all\nup for -- for proof in -- in the -- fine. Then -- then\nI'll agree with you. But you're not willing to concede\nthat.\nMR. BAILEY: No, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: So then -- so then it's not true that\nit's all available to be discussed in the -- I mean, what\nare you saying?\nMR. BAILEY: What -- what I'm saying --\nQUESTION: It's either relevant or it's not\nrelevant. Now, which is it?\nMR. BAILEY: It's relevant and it's probative in\nthe conduct of the case, but it's not dispositive of a -\nof a constructive discharge being -\nQUESTION: Why is it relevant then?\nMR. BAILEY: -- being a tangible employment\naction.\nThe relevant facts -- the employee's conduct is\nalways going to be a relevant fact situation for a jury or\na court sitting as a fact finder to hear, to contemplate,\nand understand. There are issues -\nQUESTION: There's not an ounce of evidence of\nany -- any -- activity by the employer. Not an ounce of\nany -- he has in place a wonderful grievance procedure and\nthe only problem is they threatened her life. And that's\nwhy she didn't use it. Now, what is -- what is there for\nthe jury to -- to consider?\nMR. BAILEY: As a matter of law, it dispenses\nwith the definition that set this Court on the road to\nMeritor and Ellerth and Faragher, and that is the\ndefinition of an employer in Title VII law. Of course,\nit's the employer's act, if it's an official act, and if\nthere are issues that are -\nQUESTION: Threatening her life is an official\nact by -- by his employees.\nMR. BAILEY: To the extent the -- how do we\ndefine the employer? The board of -\nQUESTION: I mean, I cannot imagine an act\nthat's more ultra vires. I cannot imagine an act more\nunofficial than that.\nMR. BAILEY: Justice Scalia, I -- I may not -- I\nmay not be understanding your point. I apologize for\nthat. But if I do -- if I do understand it correctly, we\nare now down the road embarking into a multitude of\ndefinitions of what the employer is, while in reality to\nan employee in the workplace, invariably the employer is\nthat immediate supervisor who, as described in -- in\nFaragher and Ellerth, has the power to make those tangible\nemployment decisions. And to that employee -\nQUESTION: May -- may I just interrupt there\nbecause I want to get one thing clear in mind? Is it your\nview that the constructive discharge can only be caused by\na person with the authority to take a tangible employment\naction?\nMR. BAILEY: No.\nQUESTION: So your argument would apply whether\n-- if it's just coworkers as well as supervisors.\nMR. BAILEY: No.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAILEY: I -- I think -- I think it can be\nboth. I think, as correctly defined by this Court\npreviously, there are certainly situations where by\nnegligence -- in fact, the law of constructive discharge\nacross the length and breadth of our country does include\nthe reality that there are circumstances where there's\nratification by omission, acquiescence and negligence -\nQUESTION: Well, -\nMR. BAILEY: -- of the acts of -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Let me just put the -- a little\neasier question for you. To what extent in your view is\nthe -- is the -- is it relevant that the person who did\nthe harassing conduct has some status, enough authority to\nimpose a tangible employment action? Is -- to what extent\nis it relevant?\nMR. BAILEY: It's -- it's relevant to the extent\nof imputing that responsibility to the broader employer,\nthe supervisor in other words. It's relevant. But -\nQUESTION: And if it's -- but if it's not such a\nperson -\nQUESTION: But not conclusive. Right?\nMR. BAILEY: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: But not conclusive.\nMR. BAILEY: I think in -\nQUESTION: Just -- just one of a whole mishmosh\nof things that we sort of chuck at the jury.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, I -- I think in -- as I\nunderstand the original question, we're referring to a\ncoworker-induced discharge, let's say, or -- or\ninvoluntary quitting. And in that case, Justice Scalia, I\n-- I believe you -- you are certainly pointing at\nsomething here because the standards of proof factually\nand perhaps legally are different. They still go,\nhowever, at their core to the conduct and actions of the\nsupervisor.\nNow, unquestionably, the supervisor -- the\nsupervisor's actions are not authorized by the employer.\nClearly they're not. The imputation that the Congress\nmade of employer liability for agent actions was a policy\nconsideration goal and this Court, in an effort to balance\njudgments and to balance realities in the workplace and\nachieve justice in terms of what is fair if you have that\nhardworking employer who works very, very arduously at\nstructuring a workplace program and enforces it -- not the\ncase here -- but enforces it and follows through with it,\nthere should be some recognition, some issue of\nmitigation.\nAnd under those circumstances, of course,\ndepending upon what the trial court finds and -- and\ndepending upon how this Court decides that constructive\ndischarge if it is a tangible employment action, how -\nwhat role it plays and what -- what the demands or\nrequirements this Court would have in Title VII situations\nso that -- so that -- the official act, which the\nGovernment would say is not a tangible employment action,\nin reality has to be. It's a semantic distinction without\na difference.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't follow what you said\neven in the context of the facts here. You said it's not\nthe case that there wasn't -- that there was in place a\ngood grievance procedure and that she availed herself of\nwhatever she could avail herself of. I think that's very\nmurky in this case. She tells one story. The EEO officer\ntells another story, and we don't know how grievances have\nbeen handled in this workplace, whether it has been\neffective for other employees in the past. We just don't\n-- we have -- how can you make a judgment one way or\nanother about the effectiveness of this grievance\nprocedure on the basis of the evidence that's now in the\nrecord?\nMR. BAILEY: Justice Ginsburg, you are correct\nin the sense that the facts of the record reflect that the\nemployee, Nancy Suders, went to the -- the top dog in the\nPennsylvania State Police in the affirmative action and\ndiscriminatory area, as a result of education she received\non a test -- in a seminar taught by that person and\nbecause she could not locate an appropriate form.\nNow, technically speaking -- technically\nspeaking -- and the district court didn't even get into\nthis, but to do fair and honest response to your question,\nNancy Suders did not go and acquire the exact form. She\ncould not find it. She couldn't locate it. It wasn't\nposted.\nThe record will indicate that in fact Nancy Drew\nSuders did complain. That complain found -- complaint\nfound its way to the bureau of -- of the IAD, you know,\nwhere they -- they look at professional responsibility.\nShe didn't have the correct form, quote/unquote, according\nto the record.\nNow, if that's not availing herself -- that's a\nfactual determination that has to be made either as part\nof a -- a decision at law by the court as to whether a\nconstructive discharge has been proven. And I assume in\nthe litigation process at some point the trial judge is\ngoing to look at that record, is going to look at what is\npresented. They're going to be considered -- considering\npoints of charge and a motion by the defendant to -- to be\ngiven permission to present an affirmative defense. To go\nback to what the Government even admits, in many\ncircumstances -- and to questions that were raised by -\nby other Justices here, in many circumstances the -- there\nwill be no affirmative defense available because the\nconstructive discharge will have been proven.\nNow, in this particular case, in the facts in\nthis case, Nancy Drew Suders -- and I think this is what\noffended the sensibilities of the Third Circuit, and -\nand -- and the Third Circuit said that even -\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting that the Third\nCircuit decided the case the way it did because its\nsensibilities were offended?\nMR. BAILEY: Legal sensibilities, Justice\nRehnquist -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.\nQUESTION: That's as hard to figure out as\nconstructive discharge.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAILEY: Well --\nQUESTION: But it -- it -\nMR. BAILEY: Justice Kennedy -\nQUESTION: It seems to me that -- that both\nsides point the finger at the other and say you're using\nlabels. Your -- your brief says a constructive discharge\nis a tangible employment action. And I -- and I assume\nyou argue that there's no affirmative defense.\nMR. BAILEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: So the -- the label is of -- of\nimmense importance.\nMR. BAILEY: Yes, it is. The label -- and -\nand you made reference in earlier arguments this issue of\nlabel --\nQUESTION: Depending on -- depending -\nMR. BAILEY: -- legal labels -\nQUESTION: The -- the question is, what does it\nconsist of?\nMR. BAILEY: Well -\nQUESTION: But you're very unclear on what the\nemployee has to prove to establish constructive discharge.\nIt's very vague to me what it is you say the employee has\nto prove with regard to the availability or lack thereof\nof employer remedies.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, it's an objective person\ntest. The employee has got to prove that the harassment\nwas so intense and intolerable -\nQUESTION: As to remedies available by the\nemployer, it is unclear to me what position you take on\nwhat the employee has to prove. That the employer had no\nremedial scheme in place or what is it?\nMR. BAILEY: I -- I believe that the remedial\nscheme is not relevant for two reasons. The remedial\nscheme is not relevant because the employee cannot avail\nthemselves of the procedures in a procedural due process\nsense of a in-place employer remedial scheme because they\nare, in the case of a formal discharge, fired, in the case\nof a constructive discharge, precluded because they are\nreally fired. Formal discharge equals constructive\ndischarge equals official act.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I don't understand that\npart.\nMR. BAILEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: The part I don't understand is when\nyou say they are precluded from using a -- a corrective\nopportunity, a preventive or corrective opportunity\nbecause they have been fired. I think -- doesn't that beg\nthe question?\nImagine an employer who has notices in print 4\ninches, black print all over the place pasted. If anyone\nhere creates a hostile work environment, threatens you in\nany way, does anything, I want you to phone this emergency\nnumber immediately 24 hours a day, and we will correct it.\nAnd -- and the -- the employee, who is totally not blind,\nin fact teaches a class that that's what they're supposed\nto do --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and now is subject to terrible\nharassment, but does not avail herself of those procedures\nfor no understandable reason. Has that employee made out\na claim of constructive discharge? Of course, I think\nobviously, the answer is no, she hasn't.\nNow I want to know what you think.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAILEY: I -- I believe that you are\ncorrect, Your Honor. You're correct.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: All right. Now, fine. Now, and if I\nam correct, if you believe I am correct -\nMR. BAILEY: And that's -\nQUESTION: -- doesn't the argument in this case\nsimply disappear? Because all you have to say is there is\nno constructive discharge as long as there was a\npreventive or corrective opportunity in place and the\nemployee was unreasonable in failing to take advantage\nthereof.\nMR. BAILEY: I -- I -\nQUESTION: So if the employee was reasonable in\nnot taking advantage, she's constructively discharged.\nBut if she's unreasonable, she is not.\nMR. BAILEY: I -- I -- that part is correct. I\n-- I believe your -\nQUESTION: That's the whole thing.\nMR. BAILEY: Well, I believe your analysis is\nerroneous until when what is brought into what's actually\ngoing to occur is an application of the reasonable person\nstandard. Your hypothetical quite clearly would put a\nhorrendous burden on an employee unless perhaps that\nemployee is so traumatized, they don't have any faith in\nthose great big 4-inch black letters.\nQUESTION: Fine, and if the traumatized employee\nby the judge or jury is determined to have been\nreasonable, she wins. But if she's unreasonable, she\nloses like any other reasonable person test in the law.\nWhat's the problem with that?\nMR. BAILEY: Assuming that what has occurred in\nthat process is we've reached a hiatus where the employee\nhas either proven the constructive discharge, the issue\nthen becomes what the issue in this case is. The\naffirmative defense is then not available. We've reached\nthe same conclusion.\nQUESTION: Yes, of course, I'm saying the\naffirmative defense is not available because there's no\nneed for it. That's what we've been talking about, I\nthought, the last half hour.\nMR. BAILEY: Your Honor, I don't disagree with\nthat.\nQUESTION: Now, do you win this case, by the\nway? Because the -- the Third Circuit seemed to say, as I\nread it, that in not taking advantage of the available\nopportunities, your client was reasonable. In other\nwords -\nMR. BAILEY: My -- my client's actions were\nreasonable.\nQUESTION: Is that what the Third Circuit said?\nMR. BAILEY: That was the Third Circuit\nconclusion, that my client indeed did act reasonable or -\nor at very best, when the district court granted summary\njudgment, there was a disputed material fact as to whether\nor not there was a plan that was in effect and Nancy Drew\nSuders took advantage of it. And then the court -\nQUESTION: Well, if that's true -- if that's\ntrue, the case has to go back.\nMR. BAILEY: I disagree. I -- I was going to\nconclude, if -- if I may, Justice Kennedy.\nThen the court says -- and they use the word -\nlet's look at the last day. If there's any question,\nlet's look at the last day. And if we look at the last\nday, Nancy Drew Suders is brought in. The bathroom, the\ntoilet seat, the handle, everything is dusted with stuff\n-- powder. Her test results are taken. They're stuffed\nin the lingerie drawer. Nancy Suders happens to find\nthem. They set the room up, and Nancy Suders is brought\nin and her hands are photographed and she's read her\nrights. And she's called a thief repeatedly and she's\ntold she can't leave. And then finally, hands shaking,\nhaving drafted a resignation letter, she presents it.\nSo until the last day, which is where the\nhypothetical I was left with ended, it might be arguable\nthat Nancy Drew Suders -- if we want to craft a rule which\nsays -- and we -- and if it's possible to do -- which says\nthere is some point in time where the burden arises for\nthe employee to take a countermeasure or counteraction,\nwhen is that? How do we do that? How can we craft a\ngeneral rule that way?\nQUESTION: Just like you always do in the law.\nIt's a question of reasonableness.\nMR. BAILEY: I -- I agree.\nAnd in this case Nancy Drew Suders did every\nconceivable thing that an employee could do, including\ncontacting the head of the affirmative action in the\ndepartment -\nQUESTION: But as I tried to suggest before,\nNancy Drew Suders and the head of the equal employment\ngave different versions of what happened in the -- in the\nonly encounter that those two had, which was very far down\nthe road. So is it -- if -- if the system works, if\nthere's ample notification of it -- because she went -\nthe first is -- the first episode is - Suders says, I\nthink I may need your help. Nothing specific at all about\nwhat's going on. And then very far down the road -- one\nquestion is did she complain too late. What would have\nhappened? How would this -- how can she say constructive\ndischarge or anything if, had she been diligent about\ncomplaining, maybe none of this would have happened?\nMR. BAILEY: Well, the facts in the case would\nindicate that she complained not only to Virginia Smith\nElliot who blew her off -- by the way, she only worked\nthere for 5 months. She complained to a State Senator.\nShe did everything. She went looking for help. She was\nfrightened. She could do nothing at this rural barracks\nat this station.\nThe issue then becomes, in terms of -- of if -\nif we're looking at her actions in terms -- in a context\nof did she take -- did she assume that employee burden of\nreasonably responding, putting all of those things\ntogether, that's where the Third Circuit I think correctly\nanalyzed that there -- that that Nancy Drew Suders acted\nreasonably. She was subjected to horrendous conditions at\nwork.\nShe did go elsewhere to complain. She\ncomplained to Virginia Smith-Elliot. It's -- the\ndifference is that Virginia Smith-Elliot said that Nancy\nDrew Suders complained about age and a number of different\ncomplaints that were being -- or -- or mistreatments she\nwas suffering, but that she did not raise sexual\nharassment as an issue. That, indeed, is ironic on the\nrecord when you look at these -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bailey.\nMr. Knorr, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KNORR, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNORR: If it were really true that to prove\na constructive discharge and a central element of that\nproof would be that the employee either invoked a remedial\nprocess or reasonably failed to do so, if that were\nrequired as an element of constructive discharge, that\nwould go a very long way toward meeting our concerns in\nthis case. That is not, however, the current state of the\nlaw, at least not in all jurisdictions. That is really\nthe only point I wanted to reemphasize on rebuttal -\nQUESTION: You -- you would find it acceptable\nthat she didn't do it because they threatened to kill her\nand -- right? That's certainly reasonable basis not for\nfiling a complaint, and that -- that would attribute the\nwhole thing to the employer.\nMR. KNORR: Justice Scalia, that I wouldn't say\nis acceptable to us, but that problem -\nQUESTION: You could live with it.\nMR. KNORR: That problem -\nQUESTION: It's not very logical, though, is it?\nMR. KNORR: It is a problem that inheres in the\nEllerth-Faragher affirmative defense from the beginning,\nand we have taken that defense as we found it. I -- I\nagree that it is not entirely satisfactory to us, but that\nis where we are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Knorr.\n"
