KERR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KERR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis case raises the intersection of two\nsimilar doctrines of the same vintage that point in\nexactly opposite directions: The first, retroactivity;\nand the second, the good faith exception. This Court\nshould reverse and hold that the good faith exception\ndoes not apply to reliance on precedent, and instead,\nthat should be governed by the retroactivity principles\nof Griffith v. Kentucky.\nI think it's helpful to start with\nLinkletter v. Walker, the 1965 decision that introduced\nthe concept of retroactivity. Linkletter held that\nMapp v. Ohio, which had held that the exclusionary rule\napplied to State violations of the Fourth Amendment, is\nnot retroactive. The Linkletter decision was premised\non a simple syllogism: The exclusionary rule is about\ndeterrence; a decision that postdates a search cannot\ndeter the police; and therefore, the exclusionary rule\nshould not be available in cases before Mapp.\nLinkletter's syllogism is the same syllogism\nthat the Court is attempting -- that, sorry, the\ngovernment is attempting to rely on in this case.\nHistory has shown that that syllogism is powerful in the\ncontext of collateral review and habeas corpus\nproceedings, but it should not apply on direct review.\nIt should not apply on direct review for two\nbasic reasons. First, because on direct review the\nfirst case must be treated like other cases on direct\nreview, the exclusionary rule must be available in order\nto protect the adversary process and avoid advisory\nopinions, which -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You lose me in\nthe argument because it doesn't seem to me that we -- if\nwe did apply the good faith rule, we would be denying\nretroactive effect to the altered judgment. It\ncontinues to apply to matters beforehand, but it's a\ntotally different question whether, assuming it is\nretroactive, the good faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule applies. It's a -- it's a separate\nquestion from retroactivity, it seems to me.\nMR. KERR: I disagree, Justice Scalia.\nDuring the Linkletter period, the scope of the\nexclusionary rule for the Fourth Amendment was an\nessential concern in a series of retroactivity cases,\nLinkletter being the first, Desist v. United States\nbeing the second. There were -- many of the Linkletter\nera retroactivity cases were concerned with the Fourth\nAmendment exclusionary rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but just to pursue\nJustice Scalia's point: The good faith rule is itself a\nrule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the\nbooks, and the good faith rule qualifies the\nexclusionary rule. So why aren't we just following the\ngood faith rule here?\nMR. KERR: The -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, there's nothing\nretroactive or prospective about it. It's just -- it's\njust applying the existing law.\nMR. KERR: I disagree, Justice Kennedy.\nIt's not applying existing law, because the effect of\nwhat is labeled the good faith exception in this setting\nis actually to apply the prior decision; that is, to\nhave all of the substance and effect of a retroactivity\ndecision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's an\napplication of -- that's a subset, it's one application,\nof the good faith rule, which is an overall principle.\nBut we're being faithful, under the government's view,\nit seems to me, to the overall principle.\nMR. KERR: I think the Court needs to take\naway the labels here. The government is using a label\nof good faith for what is essentially a retroactivity\nargument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a label at all.\nYou're -- we're not denying the application of the\naltered rule to your client's conduct. It applies. But\nthe question of whether, when it does apply, the good\nfaith disregard of it by a police officer nonetheless\nallows the evidence to be admitted, it's a totally\ndifferent -- we're giving full retroactive effect to\nthe -- to the change in the law.\nMR. KERR: At the same time, Justice Scalia,\nwhatever rule is applied in this case would have to be\nthe same rule that applies in Gant itself, and without\nthe incentive of counsel to argue in favor of the change\nin the law, that would block claims by defense attorneys\nto overturn the precedents of this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Kerr, our\ncases have talked about the deterrence impact on police\nconduct. It seems to me you're trying to expand that\nnotion to cover incentives for defendants, and as I\nread -- I guess it's Leon, in footnote 25, it says the\nargument that defendants will lose their incentive to\nlitigate meritorious Fourth Amendment claims as a result\nof a good faith exception is -- is unpersuasive.\nMR. KERR: Leon, I think, raised a different\nsetting. It raised the question of reliance on errors\nby a magistrate judge, which simply does not implicate\nthe concerns of retroactivity, which is this Court\nchanging its interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. I\nthink that raises a distinct set of principles, as\nJustice Harlan recognized in his dissent in Desist and\nhis separate opinion -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think our -\nour theory on the exclusionary rule across the board,\nwithout regard to the underlying substantive violation,\nis that you look to deterrence of police conduct. And\nhere, I mean -- I mean, you agree the police did nothing\nwrong in this case, don't you?\nMR. KERR: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what impact -\nwhy do we want to deter them from doing what's right?\nMR. KERR: Because it takes two branches of\ngovernment for the exclusionary rule to deter\nconstitutional violations. The Court has to properly\nconstrue the Fourth Amendment and the police need to\nthen properly follow the Court's precedents. The Court\ncan't turn away from the role of this Court's precedents\nin the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand your\nargument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I\nthink that's your strongest argument, but would you\nconcede that that argument does not apply when the\nprecedent on which the police are relying is a decision\nof one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court\nFourth Amendment decision?\nIn that situation, there will be plenty of\navenues for obtaining review of the correctness of those\ndecisions; isn't that right?\nMR. KERR: Justice Alito, I think it depends\non what the good faith exception is. The government's\nbrief I think does not exactly articulate what the\nstandard is that -- to which it would like to apply.\nEven so, most Circuit Court decisions\ninterpreting the Fourth Amendment are derivative of this\nCourt's decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment.\nAnd this case is a good example. The facts of this case\nare quite similar to the facts of Belton. The Eleventh\nCircuit had not actually expanded upon Belton; it had\nmerely had relatively routine applications of Belton.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it applied its\nunderstanding of Belton, which turned out to be\ndifferent from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme\nCourt in Gant and the understanding of at least four\nmembers of this Court when Gant got here.\nMR. KERR: At the same time, the Eleventh\nCircuit's development of the law was -- went no further\nthan Belton itself, and this Court needs adversaries to\nmake forthright arguments to this Court which may\ninvolve distinguishing precedent and may involve\noverturning precedent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If I could just come back to\nmy question: Suppose you have a decision in one of the\ncourts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted\nunder the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that\ncircuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that\ncircuit, follow that precedent.\nNow, is -- will there not be plenty of\nopportunities to review the correctness of that decision\nbecause the issue may arise in other circuits where the\nmatter isn't settled?\nMR. KERR: If this Court adopts a good faith\nexception that is quite narrow and would not allow an\nofficer in one circuit to reasonably rely on the clear\ncircuit court decisions of another circuit, that's\ncertainly a possibility. However, it's not clear as to\nwhy the Court would adopt such a narrow version of the\nexception. The language that the government proposes,\nat least, seems to be the language of qualified\nimmunity; the notion of reasonable reliance on a\ndecision being believed to be lawful.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kerr, the line that\nhas been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice\nKennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh\nCircuit took; is it not the case?\nI mean, Judge Kravitch said: Yes, the\nFourth Amendment was violated, so to that extent we're\nfollowing retroactivity precedent. But the remedy is\nsomething different. That was exactly the line that she\ntook, wasn't it?\nMR. KERR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And on your theory, I\nmean, there's another question in this case; that is,\nperhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory,\nas a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the\nCourt decided that question, then -- then the question\nyou're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would\nhave no practical consequences.\nOn your theory, the way you reasoned,\nshouldn't the Court first decide was this a legitimate\ninventory search, and if so, then we never get to any\nexclusionary rule question?\nMR. KERR: That issue, of course, has not\nbeen briefed in this case. It would remain for the\nEleventh Circuit to apply that in the event the Court\nreverses.\nAt the same time, I wish to be clear that\nI'm not arguing that the exclusionary rule is available\nin every case when the Court overturns its precedent,\nmerely that it is a remedy in some cases, and I think\nit's actually a necessary cost.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just\nfollow up on Justice Ginsburg's question. Why did this\ndefendant have any incentive to bring his constitutional\nclaim if, as may or may not appear too likely, the\ninventory search is going to result in the admission of\nthe evidence anyway?\nIt seems that your theory goes too far in\nsaying that defendants will never have an incentive to\nbring a constitutional challenge if there's some other\nground on which the evidence might be admitted, and\nthat's never been our law.\nMR. KERR: I agree that's never been the\nCourt's law, and I think there's an important\ndistinction to be made here. The distinction is between\nan argument that has a remote chance of success, and\ndefendants will make those claims, and arguments that\nhave no chance of success, which is no -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's often -\nwe do that. We take cases where you can bring a\nconstitutional challenge or a different challenge all\nthe time, qualified immunity cases, you know, what was\nthe law and was it clearly established? Defendants\nbring the qualified immunity cases all the time even if\nthey have a tough case on whether it's clearly\nestablished. Harmless error cases, the underlying\nviolation, whether it's a harmless error, and the Court\ncan decide the case on either ground, but that doesn't\nkeep defendants from bringing the claims.\nMR. KERR: But there's a big difference\nbetween a tough case and no case. The difficulty of the\ngovernment's claim is the defendant would know any\neffort to challenge this Court's precedent cannot\nlogically lead to any relief. Either the defendant will\nlose on the merits, if the Court upholds its precedent\nor the defendant will lose under the good faith\nexception.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your incentive\nargument really only holds up when the ground on the\nalternative ground is hopeless? Otherwise we'll expect\nthe defendants to bring a Fourth Amendment claim because\nit's pretty easy to bring.\nMR. KERR: Hopeless meaning a zero percent\nchance of likelihood. That's the difficulty of the\ngovernment's position, is that it -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kerr, let's say I'm\nconcerned about the kinds of issues that you're raise,\nthe incentives on defense counsel and also the oddity of\nthe Court deciding a case in which it's absolutely not\npossible to grant a remedy. Wouldn't the solution to\nthat be not the rule that you are advocating, but\ninstead a much more limited rule which said that in that\ncase the exclusionary rule applied, but not in any other\ncase, not in any case on direct appeal?\nMR. KERR: I think Justice Harlan's answer\nto that is persuasive, that it's inconsistent with basic\nnorms of constitutional adjudication to treat the first\ncase differently from other cases not on -- other cases\non direct review.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess, Mr. Kerr, I'm not\nsure that that's right. Justice Harlan was talking\nabout constitutional rights at a period where, as the\nChief Justice said, the exclusionary rule was viewed as\npart of the constitutional right. But if this Court\ndoesn't view the exclusionary rule that way any more, if\nit views the exclusionary rule as simply a prophylactic\nrule which gives a particular defendant a windfall in\norder to gain systemic effects, systemic benefits, why\nwould we do it any more broadly than we would need to do\nit? And we would just say: Look, we understand your\npoint that this would very much change the incentives\nfor defense counsel. We understand your point that it's\nkind of, I don't know, maybe inconsistent with Article\nIII to take a case in which there was absolutely no\nchance of relief being granted, but we can deal with\nthose issues simply by saying that in your case you get\nrelief, but not in any other.\nMR. KERR: Justice Kagan, that was the\nprecise premise of the Linkletter regime. The idea of\nthe exclusionary rule as a judge-created remedy, the\nidea of the exclusionary rule as not being a personal\nright, that actually was the premise of Linkletter. So\nto go back to something that resembles that regime in\nsubstance, even if with a new label. I think is ill\nadvised in light of the history of the Linkletter era,\nand the Court's struggles to try to articulate a\nconsistent standard that can treat the first case and\nother cases similarly.\nI think Desist was a Fourth Amendment case,\nPeltier also a Fourth Amendment case, Peltier also a\nFourth Amendment case. The government's proposal is\nessentially a return to Peltier with a difference. If\nthe Court wants to treat the first case differently than\nlater cases, it is essentially recreating Peltier.\nJUSTICE ALITO: With respect to the\nincentives that you're talking about, is there really\nmuch difference between what would apply in a case like\nthis and what already applies in cases that fall under\nKrull? Suppose Congress enacts a statute that\nauthorizes a search under particular circumstances, as\nit did, as was the case in Almeida-Sanchez. Now, under\nKrull nobody is going to be able to, and no one who is\nsubjected to a search under that statute is going to be\nable, to challenge, to obtain suppression, unless you\ncan say that a reasonable law enforcement officer\ncouldn't have thought that this statute which was\nenacted by Congress and signed by the President was a\ncorrect interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.\nNow, maybe there'll be a few cases like\nthat, but in the great majority, the vast majority of\ncases, the person will not be able to mount such a\nchallenge. So what is the difference between the\nsituation here and the situation that the Court already\napproved in Krull?\nMR. KERR: I think there are two\ndifferences. One is that there is a substantial\ndifference from the standpoint of a defendant or defense\nattorney between a remote chance of success in a legal\nclaim and no chance of success on a legal claim. Krull\nleaves open the possibility -- and it may be remote, but\nnonetheless a possibility -- of relief if the defendant\ncan persuade a court that a reasonable officer would\nhave known in light of this Court's precedent that the\nstatute allowed unconstitutional searches.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, we could leave that\nopen here. We could say that there's no good faith\nimmunity if a reasonable officer couldn't have believed\nthat a prior decision of this Court was a correct\ninterpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Maybe that\nsounds strange only because we have a higher opinion of\nourselves than we do of the Congress and the President.\nMR. KERR: And yet I think your -- your\nhypothetical, your suggestion that perhaps the Court\ncould adopt that standard, shows the difficulty of\ntrying to craft a good faith exception that ends up\nrunning up against the Linkletter problem. This is\nexactly the issue the Court struggled with during the\nLinkletter era that Justice Harlan -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Essentially, is your\nargument essentially that we should distinguish never,\nwhich would be this case if your position is not right,\nand hardly ever. Is that -\nMR. KERR: That's correct. Where the rule\nis never, defendants are unlikely to make any sort of\nclaim, and this Court would be denied the opportunity to\nreview its own precedents, and that's an essential role\nof this Court's decisions in the Fourth Amendment\nsetting.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you might respond\nthat the government's going to say, well, there's Monell\nthat's in their brief, and you'll probably say that\nthat's a weak substitute for a criminal defense\nattorney's doing it in the trial itself.\nMR. KERR: It is a weak substitute. There's\nbeen no case that I'm aware of at least involving\nliability against a municipality seeking law reform.\nIt's because the Court has rejected the notion of\nmunicipal liability as being based on respondeat\nsuperior.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we were concerned\nwith the costs of your rule in the sense that Gant does\nhave some exception for the safety of the officers, and\nI think you can read the case if there's some general\nsafety considerations for not securing the car in a\nneighborhood rather than leave it by itself. If we\nadopted your rule, the prosecution in all those cases\nwould not have had the opportunity to make those\nadditional defenses or those -- to advance those\nadditional justifications for the search. Maybe you'll\nsay, well, I'm just trying to resurrect Linkletter.\nMR. KERR: I disagree. Just to explain,\nJustice Kennedy, my rule would be to retain the existing\npractice of this Court. I'm suggesting no changes in\nthe practice of this Court, and that is when the Court\nrecognized the need to overturn Belton or at least to\nsubstantially change Belton in the Gant case, the Court,\nJustice Alito in his dissent, recognized that there were\ncosts along with that and that led to review of cases in\nthe lower courts. In many of those lower court\ndecisions, the lower courts held that the searches were\nnonetheless constitutional under Gant, and that was\nabsolutely proper. In those situations there is no\nconstitutional violation, no one goes -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, those cases were\npending. I was concerned with cases that were closed, I\nsuppose.\nMR. KERR: In the closed cases, I'm not in\nany way challenging the traditional rule of Teague v.\nLayne and Stone v. Powell that the new rule is not\navailable. As soon as the conviction is final, the door\nis closed and no defendant can seek review. This is\nonly about direct review and the initial case in which\nthe rule is announced, and that's why I think it raises\na special set of jurisprudential problems because it\nimplicates this Court's need to avoid advisory opinions\nand to avoid what would amount to a one-way street.\nUnder the government's proposed rules, proposed rule,\ndefendants would have a limited ability to challenge\nprecedents that construe the Fourth Amendment too\nnarrowly, but of course of government would be free in\nany case to challenge precedents that the government\nbelieves construes the Fourth Amendment too broadly.\nThe concern is that over time that would lead to an\nasymmetry in the Court's outcomes, not as a result of\nthe measured judgments of this Court, but rather as a\nresult of the incentives on counsel, and the Court\nshould strive to avoid that sort of result.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're asking us for\nan exception to our general approach, assuming the\ngeneral approach is not the one you succeed, for, as you\nput it, cases where there's zero possibility of success,\nwhile allowing application of the good faith precedent,\neven if the chances of success are remote.\nIs it really worth the candle to have\nlitigation over whether it was a difference between zero\nchance and remote chance, as opposed to continuing to\napply the good faith rule across the board?\nMR. KERR: Just to be clear, the Court has\nnot applied the good faith exception in this setting.\nThe government is arguing for an expansion of the good\nfaith exception into territory which has traditionally\nbeen thought to be the regime of retroactivity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your\nposition on that. Now, getting to my question, is it\nreally worth it for us to have litigation over the\ndifference between zero and remote in determining what\nrule we should apply in this case?\nMR. KERR: I don't foresee litigation on\nthat point because, at least as I understand the\ngovernment's rule, as soon as a defendant utters the\nphrase \"This court should overturn its precedent,\" then\nthe good faith exception would automatically apply.\nThat's at least how I understand the government's\nproposed rule. So it would be up to this Court to craft\nexactly what the standard would be, but if the standard\nis broad enough such that upon asking for -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Most lawyers don't\ntake that position. Most lawyers would argue the\nCourt's precedents should be overturned and, if not,\nhere's why our case is different. And we would still be\nrequired under your theory to look if that second\nargument has zero chance or only a remote chance.\nMR. KERR: In that circumstance I think the\nCourt would be forced with issuing what -- forced to\nissue what may amount to an advisory opinion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it seems to\nme -- I mean, in terms of the incentives on the defense\ncounsel, it would be an odd defense lawyer who is going\nto say you should consider argument A because my second\nargument has got zero chance of succeeding.\nMR. KERR: I think the incentive on defense\ncounsel, if the government's rule is adopted, is to\nnever argue that cases should be overturned, and instead\nmake not terribly candid arguments to this Court that\nevery case is distinguishable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kerr, I've been on the\nbench 30 years or so now. I have never, never heard\ncounsel come before the court and say that we should\noverrule a case without making the argument: The facts\nof this case are not within the prior decision anyway.\nIt just doesn't happen.\nMR. KERR: Katz v. United States is perhaps\na case worth focusing on, where the Court overturned the\nrule of Goldman and Olmstead that wiretapping does not\nimplicate the Fourth Amendment. Katz's brief to this\nCourt argued that the Goldman-Olmstead regime had -- was\nno longer applicable, had been implicitly overturned by\nprior cases, and then said if it has not been implicitly\noverturned, it must be overruled. There was no attempt\nto try to distinguish the facts of the Katz case from\nthe Goldman-Olmstead regime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was still not the\nargument you should overrule the prior case, period,\nwith no effort to show why you could come out that way\nwithout overruling the prior cases. I just don't\nknow -\nMR. KERR: Those arguments, I agree, Justice\nScalia, are rare. At the same time they are important\narguments. It is an -- it is an alternative argument -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm saying they're\nnonexistent. I'm not saying they're rare.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The difference\nbetween zero and remote.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KERR: Nonetheless, the incentive on\ncounsel under the government's rule would be not to ever\nmake the claim that a precedent should be overturned.\nAnd the Court needs that argument to be made in\nappropriate cases so the Court can enter decisions and\nconsider the balance of the considerations\nappropriately. It has done so under the current\npractice, and that is really as a result of Griffith v.\nKentucky, which applies not only -- allows the\nexclusionary rule to be available in the first case, but\nin other cases on direct review.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBecause the exclusionary rule has severe\nconsequences for the truth-seeking function of a\ncriminal trial, this Court has restricted its\napplication to those situations in which it's necessary\nto further the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary\nrule, namely to shape police conduct.\nThe Court has repeatedly rejected efforts to\nexpand the exclusionary rule to serve other purposes,\nsuch as schooling judges who issue warrants on the need\nto respect the Fourth Amendment, reminding legislatures\nabout their obligations under the Fourth Amendment, and\nfor other purposes such as to preserve judicial\nintegrity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, what about\nGant itself? Gant severely qualified Belton. Should\nthere have been a suppression remedy for Gant, as\nJustice Kagan suggested, the very case that changes the\nlaw?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, let me give\ntwo responses to that. First of all, the rule that the\nEleventh Circuit adopted in this case, and that is the\nonly rule before the Court, involves a situation in\nwhich there is binding appellant precedent that\ninstructs the officer, tells the officer, what you're\nabout to do complies with the Fourth Amendment.\nThe state of the law in Arizona would not\nnecessarily have risen to that level, in light of the\ndissonance in that court's opinions, in the Arizona\nSupreme Court opinions, about the reach and scope of\nBelton.\nSo the question about whether the rule that\nwe're urging here would have applied in Arizona is a\nseparate question from the one that the Eleventh Circuit\nresolved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how would you answer\nit? Was Gant purely prospective or did Gant itself get\nthe exclusionary rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: Gant obtained relief. This\nCourt granted certiorari in Gant limited to the Fourth\nAmendment question, and Arizona never raised any good\nfaith exception to the exclusionary rule in that case,\nso the Court did not address the good faith issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose it had\nbeen raised?\nMR. DREEBEN: The logic of our position\nwould be that, to the extent that Gant was seeking\nBelton to be overruled, he would not be able to impugn\nthe actions of the officers who relied on it. To the\nextent that he was doing what he actually did do and\nwhich this Court's opinion in Gant accepted, which is to\nsay that the Gant opinion, that the Belton opinion did\nnot resolve the fact pattern in Gant, he would not be\nautomatically governed by the good faith exception. And\nas a result, Gant is really the best illustration of how\nunusual it is for a lawyer to come to this Court and\nsay, please outright overrule a Fourth Amendment\ndecision.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, do you think\nthat if a lawyer did that, if a lawyer filed a cert\npetition and said you should overturn the following\nFourth Amendment precedent, and that was all that was in\nthe cert petition, would we be able to grant that cert\npetition knowing that there was no possibility of relief\nfor that petitioner?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kagan, I believe\nthe Court could grant that petition, although it's\nhighly likely that any criminal defendant who filed it\nwould couple it with a claim that this Court should\neither reverse, modify, or limit any holding that came\nout.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that we would\nhave appropriate Article III authority to decide that\nquestion without any hope of relief?\nMR. DREEBEN: Certainly the Court would have\nArticle III authority, because it's always free to\nlimit, modify or abrogate one of its precedents,\nincluding a holding, if one issued from this decision,\nthat the good faith rule applies when the Court\noverrules its decision.\nLitigants can all the time be faced with\nimpossible arguments under existing precedent, but that\ndoesn't preclude this Court's Article III jurisdiction\nto adjudicate challenges to that precedent. That's\nindeed the very premise of Petitioner's argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume if Petitioner says\nwe should be able to overrule our prior substantive\nprecedent, he should also logically say that we should\nbe able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the\nexclusionary rule. So that whenever somebody wants to\ncome up here to challenge prior precedent, he can just\nsay: You know, Your Honors, we're asking you to\noverrule two cases: The first one, the substantive rule\nof Fourth Amendment law; and secondly, whether that -\nthat change in law can govern the action of the\npoliceman who didn't realize that the law was going to\nbe changed.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice\nScalia, and I think it illustrates why there is no\nArticle III impediment. Now, this Court may\nprudentially be reluctant to take a case in which it\nknows that its resolution of the Fourth Amendment issue\nwould not dictate a reversal of the judgment, even if\nthe Fourth Amendment issue went in favor of the\ndefendant, but it is not that dissimilar from the\nsituation in qualified immunity, when there is no law on\nthe books that governs an issue and a petitioner asks\nthe Court to resolve the Fourth Amendment issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if he asks for the\ndouble overruling that I just suggested, I guess there's\nsome chance that the Court would do it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It would be remote, but not\nzero.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've just raised the\nquestion of qualified immunity and the similarities.\nThere is one problem that I have with the regime that\nyou are suggesting, which is that because laws differ\namong circuits, now we've created a regime where we say\nif the law was clear or if there was law on this issue\nin your circuit, and the police officer relied on it,\nthe exclusionary rule won't apply; but if the law was\nuncertain or not clear in another circuit, then the\nexclusionary rule does apply.\nThere's something illogical about permitting\nthat kind of difference to control the outcome of\nsuppression. Are you through the back door trying to\nget in a qualified immunity thing? If any police\nofficer has a reasonable cause to believe their conduct\ndidn't violate the Constitution, then no suppression?\nThat is what it sounds like your brief is ultimately\nsuggesting.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, we're\nnot kind -- trying to come in through the back door with\nqualified immunity as a standard in this case. If we\never were to urge that, it would be through the front\ndoor. We would make the argument overtly.\nThis case doesn't involve that issue. Judge\nKravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit very\ncarefully distinguished between cases in which governing\nprecedent instructed the officers, your conduct is\nlawful if you do this, from cases in which the law is\nunclear and there is no governing precedent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's no value in\nyour mind to the fact, as your adversary is saying -- I\ndon't -- I haven't found one case previously by this\nCourt where it has applied the good faith exception to\nthe finding by the Court of a Fourth Amendment\nviolation. Have you? It's never been done in any case,\ncorrect?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not directly under the\nexclusionary rule. United States v. Peltier considered\nthe factors that now go into the good faith exception\nunder the rubric of then-prevailing retroactivity law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what we're doing\nis sort of -- your adversary is right, we're returning\nto Linkletter, aren't we? We're sort of saying it's\ngoing to apply, the exclusionary rule is going to apply\nin some cases, but not all.\nMR. DREEBEN: Not returning to Linkletter,\nJustice Sotomayor, because Linkletter was an\nacross-the-board rule that said that this Court had the\nauthority to render -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about what\nhappened before then.\nMR. DREEBEN: Before -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're going to have the\nexclusionary rule apply sometimes but not other times.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's true, but that's a\ndirect consequence of the logic of the good faith\nexception itself; and the considerations that had\ninformed this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in the\nPeltier decision were taken out of the law of\nretroactivity when the Court decided Griffith v.\nKentucky; but those same considerations became relevant\nto the good faith exception, which is tied to the\nquestion of whether there is a need to deter police\nmisconduct because the police have disregarded the\ngoverning law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there\nanything to be said for simplicity? The normal rule is\nwhen the police violate the Fourth Amendment you exclude\nthe evidence. That's the rule. Then there are some\nexceptions, good faith, et cetera. But that's the\nnormal rule.\nYou have a new law in this Court. The new\nlaw says, now this is a violation; we didn't previously\nthink it is, but it is; and that applies to the case in\nfront us and to other cases on direct appeal. The\nreason that's simple is that's what we've always done.\nAnd somebody says let's make an exception here, bring in\nthe exception, good faith, and we say no. Why? Not\nbecause any of the policy arguments are wrong, but just\nbecause, as this last 40 minutes demonstrates, once we\ndo that it's so complicated, only 14 people are going to\nunderstand it and they're not going to understand it,\neither.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nnine of the people who will understand it are on this\nCourt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's very optimistic.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm an optimist.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's so\ncomplicated, counsel. Don't worry about it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: The principle is very\nstraightforward. The principle is that the exclusionary\nrule applies only when it can deter police misconduct.\nWhen police rely on a warrant issued by a magistrate, a\nstatute or a judicial decision issued by a court of\nappeals that governs their conduct, they are not making\na decision about what the Fourth Amendment requires.\nThey are following a different actor in the system, and\nthis Court has held that there is no deterrent value to\nsuppress evidence with an important cost to the\ntruth-seeking function of the criminal trial, which is\nwhy, even if it makes for a simpler rule, the Court does\nnot automatically suppress evidence just to achieve\nsimplicity. It does -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Actually, why don't we just\nabolish the exclusionary rule? That would be really\nsimple. Whatever evidence tends to prove the truth\ncomes in. That would be a very simple system if we're\nlooking for just simplicity, wouldn't it?\nMR. DREEBEN: It would be an extremely\nsimple system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not proposing that,\nthough?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not in this case, because this\ncase represents only an application of existing doctrine\nin the Court with respect to the purposes of the\nexclusionary rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There is something ironic\nin your position that the defendant who lives in the\ncircuit that is most clearly wrong is treated worst.\nMR. DREEBEN: The defendant in these cases\nis not the object of the Court's protection. I think,\nas Justice Kagan's question made clear, the exclusionary\nrule is not a personal individual right. It's not a\nconstitutional right at all. It is a remedy that this\nCourt has devised, not to protect the defendant's\ninterests as such. The Fourth Amendment violation has\nhappened out of court. It cannot be repaired. The\npurpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future\nconduct by other counterparts of that police officer or\nthe police officer himself, so that when he confronts\nthe situation in the future he will be more solicitous\nof Fourth Amendment rights.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if there's a\ncircuit split, how do we encourage police officers to be\ncareful about the Fourth Amendment? There's a\npresumption somehow that because a circuit precedent\nexists that says it's okay to do this, that police\nofficers have to do this. I don't necessarily believe\nthat. If there's a circuit split and a police officer\nknows that other circuits are saying this is\nunconstitutional, why are we taking away the deterrent\neffect of having thoughts occur to the officer about\nthinking through whether there's a better way and a\nlegal way to do things?\nWith respect to the Fourth Amendment, we've\nbuilt -- your adversary is right, we've built in so many\nexceptions, and including in this case the inventory\nsearch, that the officers have many different ways of\ndoing things than merely doing what this particular\ncourt thought was legal or this circuit. So I guess my\nquestion is, when there's a circuit split, why are we,\nas Justice Kennedy is saying, giving protection to the\ncircuit that's plain wrong and to the officer who chose\nto follow that advice?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, we don't\nexpect police officers to attempt to define the content\nof the Fourth Amendment on their own. They are\nrecipients of the status of the law from the courts that\ngovern their activities; training programs will be\ninstituted based on that law. I'm sure that careful\ntraining programs will advise officers that there may be\nsome legal risk if there's a circuit split, and that a\ndecision may ultimately be reversed; but we don't expect\npolice departments to try to make the Fourth Amendment\ndecision on their own. And there's some sound -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're going to be\nprotected -- they're going to be protected from that -\nMR. DREEBEN: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- meaning they're going\nto get qualified immunity from any personal liability.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, but the reason that the\nFourth Amendment balance has been struck in any given\nway in a particular court is because that is felt to be\nthe reasonable way for officers to operate. In other\nwords -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that an officer\nwhen he goes out to do his job does not have primarily\nin mind not to get sued, but I think primarily in mind\nhe wants to arrest somebody in such a manner that the\nperson can be convicted of the crime that he's done,\nright?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, that's exactly\nright. The officers are seeking to protect the public\ninterest, and by not taking advantage of decisions in\ntheir circuits that explain that certain behavior is\nreasonable, they can be putting the public interest at\nrisk by relinquishing procedures that have been held to\ncomply with the Fourth Amendment and yet allow the\npolice to solve crime or to arrest suspects.\nNow, there's been a lot of discussion in\nPetitioner's argument about the need to provide an\nincentive to counsel to raise Fourth Amendment\nchallenges to existing precedent. I think it's useful\nat the outset to look a little bit empirically at that\nquestion, because some members of the Court have\nexpressed concern about that possibility.\nFrom as best as I can tell, this Court has\nnot overruled one of its Fourth Amendment precedents in\na manner that favored defendants' interests since 1969.\nDespite whatever incentives may have existed as a result\nof the exclusionary rule, defendants will typically\nunderstand that stare decisis is the normal course that\nthis Court follows, and as a result, they are highly\nlikely to structure their arguments in a manner that\nwill seek to distinguish, limit, or undermine a\nprecedent rather than calling for its outright\noverruling.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, particularly in light\nof that, what is wrong with the suggestion that Justice\nKagan raised in one of her questions about retaining an\nexception to the good faith exception for the situation,\nfor the defendant whose case comes up here and results\nin the overruling of one of this Court's precedents?\nThe Court invented the exclusionary rule.\nThe Court invented the good faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule. Is there anything to prevent the\nCourt from inventing a new exception to the exception to\nthe exclusionary rule?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Alito, there is\nnothing to prevent this Court from inventing that\nexception. That exception would serve the purpose of\nencouraging litigants to ask the Court to overrule its\ndecisions and thereby to receive a benefit when they do\nso. If it's limited to the first individual who\nactually succeeds in that endeavor, it would limit the\ncosts of the exclusionary rule, which, after all, result\nin the exclusion of reliable probative evidence of guilt\nin every case where it's applied.\nAnd the Court could tailor the exclusionary\nrule in that manner. If it did so, it would certainly\nminimize the costs, and it would represent the least\namount of intrusion on the purposes of the exclusionary\nrule. But I would caution the Court in this respect.\nIf the Court were to adopt another purpose for the\nexclusionary rule, namely creating incentives for\ncounsel to challenge existing precedent, that will\nrepresent a substantial departure from this Court's\nconsistent holdings that the only function of the\nexclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, and\nonce the Court has acknowledged that an additional\nexception to the exclusionary rule is justified, even if\nin these rare situations, it will create pressure for\nlitigants to urge that additional policy interests of\nthe administration of justice would be served if the\nCourt would create yet another exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we'd look\nparticularly good, either, do you? I mean, if.\nWe had one case raising a Fourth Amendment\nquestion, and let's say six others who raise -- that\nraise the same question, what would we do? We would\ngrant the first and hold the second? No use to hold the\nsecond, because they're going to lose anyway, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I guess we would -- we\nwould just grant the first and deny all the rest, even\nthough they're raising the same issue?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the strongest argument\nagainst -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't smell very good.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- the proposal, Justice\nScalia, would be an appearance of arbitrariness in the\nCourt's actions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's why, isn't it -\nthat's why the normal rule has been that the person\nlitigating the case gets the advantage of the new rule,\nas do other people whose initial appeals are not final,\nand there we are. That's a rule existing, I guess, for\na long time. I guess these other people have to have\nraised the question in their case. They have to have\nasked for it. They can't -- they have to follow normal\nrules. Has that caused havoc, or has that caused\nthings -- the legal system, even before -\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, it hasn't\ncaused havoc, for several reasons. One is it's\nextraordinarily rare for this Court to overrule its own\nFourth Amendment precedent. It's apparently equally\nrare, or almost equally rare, for the courts of appeals\nto overrule their precedent and adopt a more\ndefendant-friendly Fourth Amendment rule.\nI cannot claim to have done an exhaustive\nsurvey of all of the courts of appeals decisions that\npossibly overruled Fourth Amendment holdings, but the\nresults of my research disclose only one case in which a\ncourt of appeals overruled its precedent to favor a\ndefendant, and that occurred in 1987 in the Fifth\nCircuit, and the Fifth Circuit adopted a good faith\nexception precisely like the one that the government is\nurging the court to adopt today and declined to suppress\nthe evidence for that reason. No other circuit has\napparently confronted the question of whether overruling\na decision triggers the good faith exception.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought it was\nmore for this Court, actually, anyway. I don't know if\nit has to be the words \"overruling.\" My recollection\nwas: Has the Court created a new rule of law? I think\nit goes back to Cardozo, Sunburst or something, that if\nthe Court creates a new rule of law, then does it apply\nprospective, retroactively? And the worked-out position\nwas it applies retroactively, but to the litigant and to\nthose whose appeals are not final if they raised it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you want to change\nthat, it seems to me.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. That is the retroactivity\nquestion, and the retroactivity question is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're hiving off the -\nthe suppression. I understand.\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court has acknowledged\nthat the exclusionary rule is not an individual right,\nit's a remedy. It doesn't involve any violation of\nconstitutional rights of the defendant. It's a remedy\nthat this Court devised after finding a Fourth\nAmendment.\nAnd I think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed\nout, in Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh\nCircuit, Judge Kravitch acknowledged that Gant is the\nlaw; the search in that case was unconstitutional. The\nnext question is an entirely separate issue of remedy,\nand that remedy issue is governed by this Court's good\nfaith precedents. The rarity with which courts of\nappeals have confronted this simply reflects the fact\nthat, even without the lack of incentive that Petitioner\nsays will result if the Court agrees with the government\ntoday, holdings that overrule Fourth Amendment decisions\nsquarely and favor defendants do not occur all that\noften.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were we right that -\nthere were several cases that were TBR'd in light of\nGant. Maybe some of them shouldn't have been TBR'd\nunder your theory.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, before\nthe litigation that occurred in the wake of Gant, there\nwas only one precedent on the books in any circuit that\nI'm aware of that had applied the -- in the Federal\nsystem -- that had applied a good faith rule to overrule\njudicial decisions. That was United States v. Jackson\nin the Fifth Circuit. It's cited in the Eleventh\nCircuit's opinion in this case. It happened in 1987.\nSo I think it's fair to say that prosecutors\nand government officials were not raising good faith\nexclusionary rule arguments in the cases that were held\nfor Gant. I don't believe that the United States had\ndone so, and as a result, it was perfectly logical and\nin accordance with this Court's normal practice to\ngrant, vacate, and remand those cases for further\nconsideration under Gant.\nBut in the wake of Gant, courts began to\nthink of the logic of Leon and Krull and this Court's\nrecent decision in Herring v. United States and attempt\nto apply the logic of those decisions to a circumstance\nin which a police officer relies on a binding and\ngoverning appellate precedent, and they concluded that\ncourts that announce precedents have every reason to\nexpect that litigants will rely on them and that police\nofficers will rely on them. Therefore, there is no\ndeterrent purpose to be served by suppressing the\nevidence. It's all cost.\nAnd the cost would be that individuals whose\nconvictions have been obtained based on evidence that\nwas seized in reasonable good faith reliance on existing\nappellate precedent will now be able to overturn their\nconvictions, and that's a heavy cost to the\nadministration of justice. It's why the exclusionary\nrule has been confined to particularized circumstances\nwhere it's thought that it will actually achieve a\nbenefit, and it has not been expanded beyond those\npurposes.\nSo given that litigants, criminal\ndefendants, have a tremendous incentive to challenge\ntheir convictions and to try to navigate around\nprecedents while simultaneously showing that those\nprecedents may have underlying material flaws, this\nCourt is highly unlikely to be deprived of cases in\nwhich litigants attempt to undermine precedents without\nactually calling for their overruling. That is what\nhappened, for example, in Batson v. Kentucky, where the\nPetitioner in that case did not want to head-on confront\nSwain v. Alabama and ask for its overruling, and as a\nresult asserted that racially discriminatory peremptory\nchallenges were invalid under the Sixth Amendment,\nrather than the Equal Protection Clause. This Court got\nthe case and concluded that the proper analysis was the\nEqual Protection Clause and it accordingly overruled\nSwain in relevant part.\nSo it's highly unlikely that if, in fact, a\nprecedent of this Court is beginning to fray around the\nedges and justices of this Court have written\nconcurrences or dissents that explain that they no\nlonger believe that the logic of that is sound,\nlitigants will exploit those statements in an effort to\nnarrow the precedent and ultimately expose its flaws, so\nthat if this Court determines it can overrule the\nprecedent, and it can do so even if the exclusionary\nremedy will not follow.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would the rule that you're\narguing for apply only in the situation where there is a\nbinding precedent that affirmatively approves a\nparticular police practice, or would it also apply in\nthe situation in which there is simply absolutely\nnothing on the books that prohibits the police practice,\nso that a reasonable officer wouldn't have any reason to\nthink that the practice was unconstitutional?\nMR. DREEBEN: This case, Justice Alito, only\ninvolves the example of binding appellate precedent, and\nJudge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit\ndistinguished between the two situations. In the\nsituation in which there is no precedent, such that an\nofficer would not be instructed that his conduct is\naffirmatively unconstitutional, qualified immunity\napplies, and there would be arguments that there is\nnothing to deter if an officer acts within that empty\nspace.\nBut there is a countervailing argument, and\nthe countervailing argument, which Judge Kravitch talked\nabout in the Eleventh Circuit, opinion, would be that\nwhen there's no law on the books courts should give\nofficers to -- an incentive to act in favor of the more\nconstitutionally protective manner, rather than taking a\nflier on what might turn out to be unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She did say that if there\nis ambiguity, then the police must err on the side of\nnot searching. Do you think that that's -- do you\naccept that?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Ginsburg, I would\nnot submit to the Court that the United States\nnecessarily agrees with that. I think that this case\ndoesn't involve that problem and, as I said, there are\ncontrary arguments that could be advanced based on this\nCourt's description in Herring of the purpose of the\nexclusionary rule to reach conduct that is either\nreckless or intentional or at the least systematically\nnegligent.\nAnd, so, some day this Court may have to\nconfront whether the narrow limitation that Judge\nKravitch adapted -- adopted in her opinion is the\ncorrect rule of law versus a broader view that exclusion\nis only appropriate when the officers have engaged in\ntruly culpable conduct. But that's not a bridge that\nthe Court needs to cross in this case. It's not an\nargument that the United States is advancing for\naffirmance of the judgment.\nThis judgment can be affirmed simply by\nholding that the syllogism that the court of appeals\nadopted that, absent a deterrent purpose there is no\nbasis for exclusion, there is no deterrent purpose here,\nthat's sufficient to resolve this case and the Court can\nleave for another day, if it agrees with that\nproposition, whether the exclusionary rule should have\nany broader exception for good faith behavior.\nIf the Court has no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMr. Kerr, you have 6 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KERR: Thank you.\nI would like to start with the costs -- or\nreturn to the costs here of the exclusionary rule.\nFirst, the plain error doctrine is going to largely\naddress the concerns that the government has in this\ncase. If this Court is seeking to limit the scope of\nthe exclusionary rule when the Court overturns\nprecedents under the plain error doctrine, if defendants\ndon't raise a challenge to the search or seizure in\ntheir case there will be no relief available to them.\nSo therefore, the only possible relief that\ncould be granted is for individuals that saw the issue,\nraised the issue, and that will, of course, include the\nindividual who raises the claim in a case where the\nCourt overturns its precedent, therefore avoiding any of\nthe difficulties similar to that of retroactivity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in -- in one -- in\none sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the\ngovernment proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that\nthis Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules\nunder the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good\nfaith rule will protect against the -- the costs of -\nof overturning the conviction.\nMR. KERR: That's exactly right, Justice\nKennedy. And, in fact, that exact argument was one of\nthe reasons Justice Harlan concluded that the\nexclusionary rule should be available in the first case\nand on direct review. The Court needs to be aware of\nthe costs when it overturns precedent. It should not\ndepart from precedent lightly.\nAnd I think Gant is a good example. Justice\nAlito's dissent nicely points out the very real costs of\nthe shift from the Belton rule to the Gant rule, and if\nthere were no costs in a regime of pure prospectivity,\nthe Court would feel much more free to overturn its\nprecedents because no one would actually be affected by\nthe rule of any cases that are either on direct review\nor in the initial case or of those individuals whose\nconvictions are already final.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that could work to the\nbenefit of defendants as a class, not the particular\ndefendant?\nMR. KERR: That works to the benefit of\ndefendants as a class, absolutely. In fact, going back\nto the Linkletter era, that was one of the -- perceived\nas one of the benefits of Linkletter, that it freed the\nCourt to overturn precedent. But I think that is an\nimproper consideration. It is necessary for Fourth\nAmendment decisionmaking for the Court to accurately\nweigh the costs and benefits of any shift in the rules.\nAnd so I think that the costs of the exclusionary rule\nin that setting are actually necessary costs.\nAnd I also think concerns of a windfall that\nare available to defendants are overstated because of\nthe many doctrines that limit the scope of the\nexclusionary rule such as inevitable discovery or\nstanding. Actually the only individuals who would\nreceive the benefit of the exclusionary rule would be\nthose individuals who were not searched in the first\nplace if the Constitution were followed.\nSo, those are individuals who actually did\nnot receive -- will not receive a windfall. They will\nessentially, if they were lucky enough to raise the\nissue, go back to the state that they were before the\nConstitution was violated. And again, that's a limited\ngroup of people, and those are, I think, the necessary\ncosts required by the basic norms of constitutional\nadjudication that Justice Harlan raised in his dissent\nin Desist v. United States, and I think in a lot of\nways this case does return to those concerns of Justice\nHarlan, raised both in his Desist dissent and his\nseparate opinion for the Court in Mackey v. United\nStates.\nI also wanted to focus on how similar the\nissue is in this case to -- in the Linkletter era, if\nyou read the Desist dissent, in particular Justice\nHarlan's dissent, it's clear that he's considering the\nissue of retroactivity to be about the scope of the\nexclusionary rule.\nThe Eleventh Circuit below had this idea\nthat retroactivity is about the availability of a rule,\nbut rules are not sort of ephemeral ideas that are\navailable or not without any impact. It must be that if\nthey are available, they are available independently of\nwhen they were announced and should be enforced\naccordingly.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kerr.\n"
