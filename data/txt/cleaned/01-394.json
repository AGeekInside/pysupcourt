CORDRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. May\nit please the Court:\nI represent current and former Government\nofficials who have been sued in their individual capacity\nbased on a claim for denial of access to the courts and\nthe further claim that they violated clearly established\nlaw as of 1993, thus negating their defense of qualified\nimmunity.\nThe substantive due process right of access\nclaim urged here is extremely expansive and unsupported by\nthe Court's precedents. Our position boils down to this.\nThe right of access is not violated unless an individual\nis, in fact, barred from filing claims in the courts. In\nlimited circumstances, far different from those at issue\nhere, the Court has recognized that an actual bar to\naccess in the courts implicates the Due Process Clause.\nHere there is no denial of access to the courts under this\nCourt's precedents.\nThe claim asserted here, moreover, would\nconstitutionalize the handling of informal channels of\ncommunication between Government officials and private\ncitizens. It's entirely foreseeable that recognizing this\nclaim would cause the flow of information to the public to\nbe reduced to stultifying forms of pretrial discovery. We\nknow no holding of this Court that would lead to such a\nresult.\nQUESTION: To begin with right of access, the\nBell case, Bell v. Milwaukee, is discussed in -- in the\nbriefs. That's 1983. This is Bivens. I recognize the\ndistinction. That's, of course, a circuit court case.\nIt's not -- but suppose that case were here. Suppose we\nhad the Bell case. Would you say the Bell case is\ncorrect?\nMR. CORDRAY: Your Honor, we feel that the\nconduct at issue in the Bell case, very serious misconduct\n-- there were actual criminal violations. The\nperpetrators were prosecuted. There would be many ways to\naddress the misconduct at issue in that case. We do not\nbelieve that it would state a claim for denial of access\nto the courts.\nWe also believe -- and in fact, it's -- the\ndistrict court held here the facts of that case are quite\ndistant from this case where here we're in the sensitive\ncontext of foreign policy and the oversight of covert\noperations in a foreign country, and that would result --\nQUESTION: But your basic position is -- is that\nthere's a police coverup and the police destroy the\nevidence and they lie, et cetera, no -- no cause of action\nfor denial of access to courts.\nMR. CORDRAY: That's correct. There would be\nmany remedies that could and should be imposed in such a\ncase.\nQUESTION: Even where the purpose of the action\nof the official is to conceal facts that would have\nprovided the basis for a legal recovery in court.\nMR. CORDRAY: We believe so, Your Honor, and for\nthis reason. In this case, the court of appeals devised a\nmixed motive test if one of the purposes was to prevent or\nimpede a lawsuit.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but we're speaking\nhypothetically.\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes.\nQUESTION: And there's some circuit court\nsupport for where that's the alleged motive, that that\ncould provide a basis for a suit for denial of access to\nthe court.\nMR. CORDRAY: Alleged that that is the sole\nmotive, no other motive. I mean, it's -- what I'm trying\nto communicate is it's very difficult in these cases to --\nto suggest this.\nIt's very easy to allege that this is one of the\nmotives or even the sole motive at a motion to dismiss\nstage where the -- where the allegations are treated\ngenerously and, all of a sudden, all of these claims\nbecome constitutional claims. If there's some failure to\ntimely disclose information and some irreparable harm\nresults, this could apply, for example, in undercover\nGovernment investigations of criminal conduct, sting\noperations. If the allegation is made that maybe my\nattorney inquired, there was some intentionally misleading\nstatement made, and therefore, as a result, some\nirreparable harm occurred, someone was killed during the\nimplementation of the operation, something of that sort,\nall of these would become denial of access to court --\nQUESTION: Suppose that it is an ordinary case,\ncivil case, criminal system, and they're holding -- a\ngroup of rogue policemen are unlawfully somebody in a jail\ncell and his wife comes in and says, I -- I want to get a\n-- go to court and get a writ of habeas corpus on his\nbehalf. Now, will you tell me please, is that -- is this\ngoing on? And they lie so that she cannot go to court and\nget the writ of habeas corpus. Now, in that circumstance,\nwould that be a -- a denial of access to the courts?\nMR. CORDRAY: In a situation where the\nGovernment was holding an individual in custody, therefore\nphysically barring that person from accessing the courts,\nthat person --\nQUESTION: No, no. The person -- the wife --\nMR. CORDRAY: That -- that person --\nQUESTION: -- wants to go.\nMR. CORDRAY: That person would have a claim for\ndenial of access to the courts.\nThe wife or an attorney inquiring on their\nbehalf, et cetera, do not have a right to Government\ninformation. The mere fact that someone is incarcerated\ndoesn't mean that their attorney inquiring of the\nprosecutor's office or the police have some right of\naccess to information.\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose the Government\nimprisons the key witness in my suit in order to deprive\nme of the ability to win the suit. Is there denial of\naccess to courts there? Again, we'll have 1980 -- let's\nassume 1983 because Bivens has an extra problem.\nMR. CORDRAY: Are we talking about a criminal\ncase, a criminal proceeding?\nQUESTION: Either --\nMR. CORDRAY: A witness -- it would matter if it\nwere a criminal proceeding because there are special fair\ntrial guarantees that the Constitution imposes such as\nBrady v. Maryland and the like in a -- an ongoing criminal\nproceeding. If we're talking about a civil case or here\nprior to any civil case even being filed when we're in the\nrealm of potentially pretrial investigation, discovery of\ninformation, people seeking information, that would not\nconstitute a substantive due process right of access to\ncourts claim, we do not believe. Again, those facts,\nagain, are far afield from what's at issue in this case,\nbut we don't believe that -- that that would file a claim,\nwould be our position. You wouldn't need to go that far\nin this case.\nQUESTION: Was a FOIA claim open to the\nrespondent here? Could -- could such information have\nbeen sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?\nMR. CORDRAY: At any time. At any time. And in\nfact, respondent did file FOIA claims later. Her\ncontention here is that she was lulled into inaction, but\nof course, it remained open to her at any time to file a\nFOIA claim. It remained open to her at any time to file a\nlawsuit in the courts. And in fact, she did so. She\nlater pursued litigation to -- under FOIA to get\ndocuments. She received thousands of pages of documents.\nPart of the complaint here is that the\ninformation was not timely disclosed. And again, that's\nunfortunate. It's regrettable. There may even be\nindividuals who should be called to account for it, but it\ndoesn't constitute a substantive right of access to courts\nclaim under the substantive due process line of cases or,\nyou know, all such communications between Government\nofficials and private citizens --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, may -- may I go back to\nyour answer about this being like a sting operation?\nThose are designed to uncover crimes, and the object of\nthe sting is a suspect. But here, we're not dealing with\nsomeone who was suspected of a crime. We're dealing with\nsomeone who was seeking information from her Government\nfor perfectly understandable, appropriate purposes.\nMR. CORDRAY: That -- that's true, nor do we\ncontend otherwise. But even a suspect, a criminal\nsuspect, is innocent till proven guilty, and the purpose\nof those operations is to try to ferret out crime. It's\ntrue. But it --\nQUESTION: But couldn't one make a distinction?\nI mean, you say if this case, then the sting operation,\nand I think that however you come out in this case, you're\nnot touching the sting case.\nMR. CORDRAY: I don't believe that's correct,\nYour Honor, because a constitutional line can't be founded\nthere. It can't be maintained there. It has no moorings\nat that point. We're not talking about guilty suspects\nwho have already been adjudicated. We're talking about\nindividuals --\nQUESTION: People suspected of crimes.\nMR. CORDRAY: Sure. And -- and here, the\nGovernment's purposes involved overseeing covert military\noperations in a foreign country. There may be innocents\ninvolved. There may be people who are impeding our\nforeign policy and the like. The Government is trying to\ncarry out its functions, carry out its duties and\nresponsibilities, and the same is true of police trying to\nuncover crime. And the mere fact that someone is\nsuspected or they may not be suspected -- they may be on a\nlist --\nQUESTION: The person who's being deceived -- I\njust don't see where there's any spill-over that you can\n-- you can disassociate the suspect who was being deceived\nin order to be caught by the Government and someone who\nwas under no suspicion of any involvement in any\nwrongdoing.\nMR. CORDRAY: We don't think a constitutional\nline could be -- could be founded there and maintained.\nI will say in the case of affirmative\nmisrepresentations by Government officials or\naffirmatively misleading statements, there -- there are\nsome circumstances where they perhaps are justified.\nThere are many circumstances where they would not be\njustified, and if they violate a legal duty, there would\nbe legal redress for the violation of the duty. If it's\ncriminal in nature, there would be -- criminal sanctions\ncould be imposed upon the perpetrators. There's a free\npress and there are political checks. People can lose\ntheir job. They'd be subject to censure. People could\nvote them out of office. But it doesn't in our view\nconstitute a substantive due process right of access to\nthe courts or an actual denial of access.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, one of your -- one of\nyour arguments here is essentially a lack of standing\nargument that -- that there's no remediable harm that's\nbeen suffered. Why -- why is that? You say the\ninjunction -- it's -- it's too speculative whether the\ninjunction would ever have issued. But what about a delay\nin -- in getting damages? Why -- why doesn't that\nconstitute harm?\nMR. CORDRAY: A delay in what constitute harm?\nQUESTION: In obtaining -- in obtaining damages;\nthat is, had she known this information sooner, she could\nhave brought suit sooner and would have obtained justice\nsooner.\nMR. CORDRAY: Again, I don't think that that\nfounds -- that that meets the standing requirements.\nWe're -- we're concerned here about the traceability and\nredressability requirements. And at the end of all of\nthis long skein of hypotheticals here is a notion that an\nAmerican court order would have somehow have prevented the\nGuatemalan military from executing her husband.\nQUESTION: Yes, I am not talking about -- I am\nnot talking about that. I'm talking about the -- I'm just\ntalking about her ability to get monetary compensation for\nwhat the Government did. Hasn't that been at least\ndelayed? You say she can still get it. But the answer to\nthat is, yes, well, you know -- but meanwhile, she hasn't\ngotten it.\nMR. CORDRAY: It may have been delayed. She\ndoes have tort claims that are now pending in district\ncourt, intentional infliction of emotional distress,\nnegligent supervision. Those are proceeding under the\nFederal Tort Claims Act. And so, again, we -- we would\nsay that she's not been denied access to the courts.\nShe's pursued that access. She is vigorously pursuing it.\nShe's pursued political relief and the like.\nQUESTION: Is -- are the claims that are now\npending against the individuals or the -- the United\nStates has substituted itself?\nMR. CORDRAY: The United States has substituted\nitself under the Federal Tort Claims Act for the purposes\nof those claims. They're in discovery in the trial court.\nQUESTION: And what -- they're in discovery\nright now?\nMR. CORDRAY: Yes, they are. That's correct.\nQUESTION: Would she have had standing if she\nhad clearly brought or clearly adduced the theory that she\nwanted an injunction against the officials to prevent the\nofficials from continuing to pay money to the agents of a\nforeign government who were torturing her husband, who in\nfact was a -- a foreign national? Would she have had\nstanding if she had made that allegation?\nMR. CORDRAY: I'm not certain, to be honest,\nYour Honor. It would be very close to the line.\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't she have had? Let's put\nit that way.\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, because -- because there\nwould be, again, a traceability, redressability problem.\nIf she's simply seeking -- her standing is somehow to save\nher husband's life. That's always been the claim asserted\nto this case --\nQUESTION: Right, and her -- her allegation is\nthat they are torturing her husband because the United\nStates is paying them to do it. And she says, on my\nhypothetical, I want you to enjoin them from paying more\nmoney. That -- that -- the -- the causal connection, at\nleast in the allegation, would have been very clear,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. CORDRAY: It would be close to the line. It\nwould still depend on third party responses to a court\norder, which this Court has had some --\nQUESTION: Well, she might or might not have\nbeen able to prove ultimately, had it gone to trial, that\nstopping the money would stop the action of the foreign\ngovernment. But as a matter of standing to get to trial,\nshe would have had it, wouldn't she?\nMR. CORDRAY: I frankly think it's like the\nSimon case where the issue was availability of tax credit\nor tax relief, and it was thought that that was not\nsignificant enough to influence clearly the third party's\ncontract --\nQUESTION: Well, then your -- well, was it that\nor was it there was no cause of action? It was --\nMR. CORDRAY: Well, we think -- we think both.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me you have to take\nher complaint the way -- the way Justice Souter wrote it.\nI mean, her complaint --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Her complaint is that the only reason\nthey're -- they're torturing is because we're paying them\nto do that. And if that is the allegation, I -- I think\nthe redressability/causality element is certainly there.\nMR. CORDRAY: It would be close to the line\nbecause we're talking about independent decisions by third\nparties in response to a court order would be the issue.\nThat would be the issue.\nQUESTION: What do you mean third parties?\nMR. CORDRAY: The third party is the Guatemalan\nmilitary who, in the end, have to change their conduct.\nQUESTION: No, no, no. But the injunction is\nagainst the payment which she says is the only reason the\nGuatemalan military are doing this. She wants to enjoin\nthe American officials from paying the money which she\nasserts is the sole reason they're going through with\nthis. Why -- why --\nMR. CORDRAY: But the only claim to standing on\nher part to enjoin the CIA from doing something would be\nsomehow because it affects her husband's well-being and\nthe like. So, you have to make that further step that the\nthird parties are going to be influenced in a positive way\nand a decisive way by an American court order, and that's\nwhere we think it breaks down. But -- but that's a close-\nto-the-line case in terms of standing.\nQUESTION: How can you be so cavalier? It's\nclose to the line. You -- you win anyway even if it's on\nthe other side of the line?\nMR. CORDRAY: We think that there's not standing\nunder Simon and Linda R.S., and we think it's even clearer\nin a foreign military context where we're talking about\nforeign nationals not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, who at\nthe end of the chain of reasoning, have to alter their\nconduct. That's correct.\nI'd also like to address --\nQUESTION: May I just ask you another question\nbefore you leave the subject?\nMR. CORDRAY: Sure.\nQUESTION: Assume, for the sake of argument,\nthat there is standing in that case. Would there have\nbeen a cause of action alleged?\nMR. CORDRAY: Here for denial of access to --\nQUESTION: On my hypothesis.\nMR. CORDRAY: For denial of access to the\ncourts?\nQUESTION: Any cause of action.\nMR. CORDRAY: By Ms. Harbury for denial of\naccess to the courts. That's the only claim we have\nbefore this Court --\nQUESTION: Yes, yes, yes.\nMR. CORDRAY: Again, it's distant from any\nallegations of torture or mistreatment of someone. We're\nonly talking about denial of access to the courts based on\nthe alleged --\nQUESTION: And -- and she said I -- I want to go\ninto court because I want to press this cause of action.\nOne of your arguments is, well, you've got to get into\ncourt first, or -- or at least try to get into court. But\nanother line of argument is whether you're yet at the\ncourthouse door or not, you've at least got to have a\ncause of action that you could press if you got there.\nAnd my question here is, assume standing, assume\nyour second line of argument on access to courts so that\nthe issue comes down to whether there would have been an\nallegation of a cause of action on that hypothesis. Would\nthere have been a cause of action alleged?\nMR. CORDRAY: We still allege there are many\nsteps on the standing argument in terms of what kind of\nclaims she would have brought. There's -- in the court of\nappeals --\nQUESTION: Okay, but I'm -- I'm saying assume\nfor the sake of argument that there is standing. Would\nthere have been a cause of action sufficient to support\nthe access to courts claim?\nMR. CORDRAY: Again, in a situation where the\nclaim is that she did not have timely disclosure of\ninformation that would have helped her formulate her cause\nof action, we do not think that falls within the\nConstitution. But my --\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you concede that at\nleast the claim that there was something unconstitutional\nor illegal about paying the -- about our Government paying\nthe money to a foreign government for this purpose would\nstate a cause of action?\nMR. CORDRAY: We don't concede that. We don't\nthink that that's the case. And again, what we're talking\nabout here is disclosure of information necessary to\nformulate a claim. We don't think that's\nconstitutionalized under the substantive due process.\nIf I might reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cordray.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\n5 years ago in its Glucksberg decision, the\nCourt urged utmost care in creating new substantive due\nprocess rights because doing so removes the matter from\nthe arena of public debate and legislative action. That\nadmonition is acutely compelling in the field of\nGovernment-to-citizen communication. Respondent's theory\nwould not only constitutionalize the Freedom of\nInformation Act and create a constitutional pre-litigation\ndiscovery right against the Government, but would also\naffirmatively discourage an unquantifiable, but immense\nvolume of valuable informal Government communications that\ntake place thousands of times every day. As the Court\nheld in OPM v. Richmond in 1990, the natural consequence\nof a rule imposing liability for Government statements\nwould be a decision to cut back and impose strict controls\nupon Government provision of information.\nGovernment officials respond to informal\nrequests for information every day in -- in an infinite\nvariety of contexts with infinite -- with an infinite\narray of answers, candor, off-the-record disclosures, and\noccasional polite evasions. One of the most commonplace\nof those governmental responses to requests for\ninformation is the equivocal and innocuous I will get back\nto you that forms the core of respondent's constitutional\ntheory.\nToday, the respondent urges that that I will get\nback to you, when accompanied by an easy to allege and\nhard to disprove, in the words of this Court, allegation\nthat such responses were intentionally false for the\npurpose of discouraging a potentially productive\nlitigation will become the trigger for expensive,\nburdensome, and distracting personal suits for damages\nagainst the offending officials. The -- the consequence\nwill be a drying up of informal Government-to-citizen\nexchanges and a regime of no comment or brush-offs or\nbrusk refusals to discuss, the precise antithesis of the\nopen Government the Framers of the First Amendment\nintended.\nSo, to constitutionalize the responses in an\ninformal context where the response was not required by\nany provision of law, no response was required at all, the\nresponse violated no law or affirmative duty to respond,\nit promised no specific action or any specific time table\n-- I will get back to you didn't promise any --\nQUESTION: Well, the allegation, though, is that\nthe response was given in -- with the intent and in order\nto prevent a potential lawsuit. At least that's the\nallegation.\nMR. OLSON: That is the allegation, and that's a\nconclusionary information and belief, easy to allege, hard\nto disprove allegation that can be made in every one of\nthese cases. It's easy to imagine an infinite number of\nsituations. I think it was Justice Ginsburg that was\nasking about the sting operation. The sting is a\nfalsehood that's created by government to accomplish some\nlaw enforcement objective, but if it's a false storefront\nor something like that, it's a falsehood to a lot of\ndifferent people.\nThere are lots of different situations where the\nGovernment quite legitimately may have reasons to give\nfalse information out. We're not defending all the\ncircumstances in which that might occur because there are\nduties and responsibilities and statutes that are imposed\nfor that sort of thing. But to constitutionalize this\nsubject would just put this broad blanket of inhibition\nover the whole disclosure of -- this was an informal oral\ncommunication. It wasn't a written communication. It\nwasn't where writing was occurred.\nShe had at any time -- the respondent had at any\ntime the opportunity and right to bring an action under --\nto -- to bring a request and then an action under the\nFreedom of Information Act, which is Congress' carefully\nstructured regime for receiving information from the\nGovernment. If she had received an evasive or\nnonresponsive answer in connection with the Freedom of\nInformation Act, that would have been remedied or remedial\nin a court under the strictures that Congress carefully\ndeveloped and this Court has implemented over the years.\nThere's --\nQUESTION: General --\nQUESTION: Well, do you say there should be an\nexhaustion requirement? You have to at least go with a\nFOIA request?\nMR. OLSON: Well, Justice O'Connor, even if she\nhad gone -- well, she -- if she -- I wouldn't put it as\nexhaustion. What I'm suggesting is that because there is\nthis regime in place already, there are other ways to get\ninformation from the Government. There -- there could\nhave been a lawsuit brought at any time, although this\nwould have been very, very remote, this lawsuit. And --\nand the answers to questions could have been policed by a\ncourt.\nWe're not suggesting that there's necessary an\nexhaustion requirement, but that to constitutionalize\nthese exchanges and to create remedies for damages under\nthese circumstances, when the legislature has developed an\ninfinite -- I mean, not an infinite, but a substantial\narray of opportunities to both obtain information and to\npolice the type of information that's obtained, if a\nGovernment official lies, there may be certain\ncircumstances where they are subject to discipline.\nThere -- there may be -- and we're talking about\nall levels of government, State, local, and the National\nGovernment. There may be remedies that are available.\nMany of the cases cited by the plaintiff were violations\nof underlying provisions of law. There was manufacturing\nof evidence in some of those cases.\nWhat we're saying is that there are ways to deal\nwith Government-to-citizen communications that don't have\nthe --\nQUESTION: What -- what do you do, Mr. Olson,\nwith the circuit court cases which have held under 1983 a\nviolation of the right of access to courts when there's a\ncoverup of a -- of a police murderer or something of that\nsort?\nMR. OLSON: Well, precisely.\nQUESTION: Is there a right of access to courts\nin your view in those cases?\nMR. OLSON: We believe that there is not. We\nbelieve that in each of those cases, there were\ncircumstances where there were other rights that were\nviolated, and that to take the step that those courts\ntook, to the extent that they go beyond the violation of\nother underlying rights, would create this very problem\nthat the Court urged caution about. The consequence could\nbe the drying up of information.\nThe creation of an additional right in those\nareas is problematical in the first place in terms of what\nit would accomplish beyond the rights that are already in\nexistence. And the down side consequence to the\nConstitution, to the regular exchange of information, and\nthe limitation, as this Court said in Glucksberg --\nQUESTION: I suppose -- I suppose that they\ncould allege that the drying up of information was also\ndone in order to prevent them from bringing a lawsuit,\nthat is, if you say no comment.\nMR. OLSON: Well, they --\nQUESTION: They could allege the only reason you\nsaid no comment was you didn't want to give the\ninformation.\nMR. OLSON: Of course. As a matter of -- as a\nmatter of fact, Justice Scalia, what they did say is that\n-- and this is on page 20 of the transcript in the oral\nargument, and there is something similar in the -- in the\nbrief, that they had -- that they -- we can't get back to\nyou or we're not able to respond to you -- they suggested\nthat that would be a perfectly constitutional response, or\nas you say, a no comment would be a perfectly\nconstitutional response. That could have been a lie too.\nWe can't -- I'm sorry we can't get back to you. Well, in\nfact, they could get back under the theory pleaded in the\ncomplaint. So, that would have been a lie too.\nIt illustrates the slipperiness of the slope\nthat the respondent's theory would ask the Court to embark\nupon. Any of those infinite varieties of exchanges\nunder --\nQUESTION: I don't see how no comment could be a\nlie.\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: I don't see how no comment could be a\nlie.\nMR. OLSON: No comment might not be a lie,\nJustice Stevens, but -- but the -- the respondent\nspecifically says it would have been constitutional to say\nI cannot get back to you, or if there is information,\nwe're not in a position to give it to you. There are --\nthat's -- those specific things that are in the brief\nitself and in the transcript of the oral argument could\neasily be lies as well, and they could easily be\ncharacterized as lies.\nQUESTION: Is it your position, just to be sure,\nthat the refusal to give information can never be a denial\nof access to the courts?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I hesitate ever to say anything\nof that sort. There are circumstances when it conceivably\ncould. There could be legal duties triggering a\nrequirement. In the habeas situation that one of the\nJustices asked about, there are rights of the individual\nwhich may be asserted by -- under appropriate next-friend\nstanding, but it's the rights of the individual in\ncustody.\nQUESTION: Well, withholding could give rise to\ntolling of the statute of limitations.\nMR. OLSON: Absolutely, and that's another\nsituation, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist, in which if\nsomething is delayed -- and I think Justice Scalia asked\nthat question. There's a tolling remedy. There's\nadditional damages because of the delay. There are\nremedies in virtually all of these circumstances.\nOne last point, if I still have time, is that\nthe causation, the actual harm element of this so-called\ncause of action, is extraordinarily remote. The\nrespondent is taking the position that if the Government\nhad just answered constitutionally by saying no comment,\nsomehow she might have filed a Freedom of Information\ncase. It might have been in time. It might have been in\ntime then for her to file some sort of justiciable,\nnonfrivolous cause of action, which she doesn't really\never fully identify except calling it some sort of\ninjunction, and that that sort of injunction would have\ncaused a court somehow to provide the opportunity to save\nthe individual's life that she was attempting to save.\nThat all is extraordinarily remote when -- when compounded\nwith the various aspects of the elusive nature of the\nright being articulated here, the elusive nature of the\nremedy that could be -- possibly be given and the damage\nthat constitutionalizing this right would create. We\nsubmit that this a course that this Court should not and\nwould not under its precedents want to go.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Harbury, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER K. HARBURY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. HARBURY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case turns upon a very narrow question of\nlaw, specifically the United States officials take\naffirmative and wrongful action to deceive a citizen,\nnumber one, with the intention of obstructing her or\npreventing her from proceeding to the courts of law for\nemergency injunctive relief, and where such affirmative\nand wrongful conduct and actions of deceit not only delay\nthe filing of that case, but in fact extinguish the cause\nof action, and when it is known at the time that her\nhusband is in a secret cell being severely tortured and\nthat he is in danger of imminent extrajudicial execution.\nIronically I note that today this case is in the highest\nCourt of the land, but it is exactly 10 years and 6 days\ntoo late.\nGiven the importance of a number of the points\nthat have been made today, I would like to start with a\nfew clarifications.\nNumber one, I'm not arguing here that the\npetitioners simply were negligent or did not get back to\nme on time or that they had some duty, when 6 days after\nmy husband's capture, they learned that he was being\ntortured and secretly detained. I'm not say that they had\na duty to locate me, to knock on my door, and inform --\nand inform me of his situation.\nI'm saying that they could not take wrongful and\naffirmative steps, once I went to them, to deceive me, to\ntell me that there was no information when, in fact, they\nhad numerous bulletins from the CIA telling them that he\nwas captured alive, that he was undergoing torture, that\nthey were falsifying his death, and when I was speaking\nwith them, that he was still alive and could, in fact,\nhave been saved.\nNumber two, I am not alleging here that the --\nthat the Government officials should have given me\nsensitive national security information. I'm alleging\nthat they covered up information that was not sensitive,\nthat our own Government has since decided did not\nconstitute state secrets and could have been given to me\ninitially, and that that nonsensitive information had all\nthe details I needed in 1993 to approach the courts of law\nfor an emergency injunctive to -- injunction to --\nQUESTION: Ms. Harbury, may I ask you --\nQUESTION: If -- if this were a -- if this were\na private cause of -- of action without governmental\nactors, it would be just a tort of deceit, I -- I take it.\nMS. HARBURY: The tort of --\nQUESTION: Like a tortious action for deceit if\nthese were all private actors. We'll leave the Government\nout of it. And it seems to me that what you're trying to\ndo is to make up for the absence of a tort of deceit under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act by creating a constitutional\nright. Is that what's -- is that what's happening here\nstructurally so far as your argument is concerned?\nMS. HARBURY: No, Your Honor. I'm alleging that\nany kind of affirmative and wrongful conduct by a state\nofficial, when the objective and, in fact, the result is\nto prevent the filing of a lawsuit, access to courts, then\n-- then a constitutional right has been violated.\nQUESTION: I'm suggesting to you that the only\nreason you -- you must say that is because if you followed\nthe usual course of the law and file an action for deceit,\nyou'd be barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act. That\nis correct, is it not?\nMS. HARBURY: I believe the Federal Tort Claims\nAct could not have been triggered in the case when one was\nonly asking for injunctive relief, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: In -- in the context of a private\nperson, under the law of torts, there is an action for\ndeceit based on the facts that you've -- that you've\ndiscussed, is there not?\nMS. HARBURY: Yes, there is.\nQUESTION: All right. And the reason that you\nhave to show an access -- right of access to court is\nbecause, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, you can't sue\nfor deceit. I mean, that's -- that's where we -- that's\nthe beginning point here. Isn't that right?\nMS. HARBURY: I could not sued for deceit under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act. That is correct, Your Honor,\nbut that action, even if I could file it under the Federal\nTort Claims Act, would not be focused on the wrong and the\ninjury that I am alleging here. I'm saying that my day in\ncourt, when I could have saved my husband's life, has been\nextinguished wrongfully on the basis of a violation of\nstandard -- of standard duties of conduct.\nQUESTION: Ms. Harbury, on that central\nquestion, an issue kept coming up repeatedly in the D.C.\nCircuit during your argument there, and the court asked,\naccess to court, access to do what?\nNow, the -- they rejected your claim that there\nwas a Fifth Amendment right, a substantive right,\ninvolving the Government's participation in -- in the\ntorture abroad. They rejected your argument about a\nfamilial relationship. So, what I don't understand at\nthis point is rejecting your claims, your substantive\nclaims, of a wrong to yourself, wrongful conduct engaged\nin by the United States, access to court for what? If you\nhave no Fifth Amendment claim, what is there? What claim\ncould you state?\nMS. HARBURY: All of the claims that I would\nhave stated, Your Honor, would have been rooted in the\ncontext that in the absence of extraordinary\ncircumstances, as in Guatemala in 1992 and '93, the use of\ntorture, the causation and participation in torture by\nUnited States officials, was completely outside of the\nscope of their delegated authorities and, in the\nalternative, in violation of their own regulations and\nsubject to review under the APA for emergency injunctive\nrelief. That core concept would, in turn, have allowed me\nto sue for conspiracy to end aiding and abetting, assault\nand battery in his case, emotional distress in my case,\nintentional refusal to supervise independent contractors.\nAnd I would still assert that although my\nfamilial rights have not been recognized in the Bivens\ncontext for a number of good reasons, because there's no\neasy way to draw the line in damages in that context, but\nhad I gone to a court of law and said, this is my family,\nI have the right to choose our medical care, I have the\nright to choose whether or not together we will have\nchildren and how we will raise them and which church we\nshall worship at and what professions we shall exercise,\nthe most fundamental right of all that I would have\npresented seeking injunctive relief is that I have a right\nto defend my family from wrongful outside actions,\nespecially when they're taken by the state. I would have\nbrought all of those issues before the courts of law and\nasked for emergency assistance.\nQUESTION: At bottom, in this case you're\nclaiming damages now. Is that not correct?\nMS. HARBURY: There are some tort claims issues\nstill in the district court, yes, Your Honor, but those\ncannot make good the lost day in court to save a human\nlife.\nQUESTION: No, but -- but what's running through\nmy mind is the -- there's a long chain of causation here,\nand if -- if one were persuaded -- and I'm not saying I\nam, but if one were persuaded that even if you had all the\nhelp that you sought at the time you did, there still\nwould not have been time to save your husband's life. And\ntherefore, the ultimate damage would -- would have been\nsuffered anyway. Would you be entitled to prevail?\nMS. HARBURY: If the question where there was no\ntime to save my husband's life?\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMS. HARBURY: I would certainly want to bring my\nwitnesses and my evidence to a factual hearing on exactly\nthat subject, Your Honor, because I believe there was at\nleast 6 months if not, under more recent information, a\nyear or a year-and-a-half during which I could have saved\nmy husband's life. But under the allegations in the\ncomplaint, 6 months. And that any court faced with\ntorture and the possibility that someone tomorrow may be\nliterally thrown from a helicopter, I do not believe that\nany court in this country could not have acted swiftly to\nredress that situation.\nQUESTION: In -- in this case, Ms. Harbury, you\nare seeking money damages, are you not?\nMS. HARBURY: I am, Your Honor. Money damages\nrelated to other harm which was incurred, not the\nequivalent of the day in court to save my husband's life,\nwhich has been extinguished. There is no -- there is no\nway that I can now recover that day. So, the damages\nclaims in the lower court are on peripheral injuries.\nQUESTION: You began by telling us that this is\na very narrow remedy that you seek. I have trouble with\nthat. The Solicitor General tells us that the\nconsequences of your theory are that for innumerable small\nmatters, which involve access to courts, the Government is\ngoing to be sued all of the time. And as you know, when\nthe law evolves and we decide cases, we -- we, of course,\nlook to the egregious nature of the conduct in a\nparticular case, but we also have to look at what we're\ncreating as a general rule. And the Government says as a\ngeneral rule what you're asking for is a sweeping,\nrevolutionary cause of action.\nMS. HARBURY: Yes, Your Honor. I think that in\nthis case that is not a true concern. If I may elaborate\non that.\nNumber one, the circuit courts that have dealt\nwith the issue of access to the courts in the context of a\nGovernment coverup have created a solution that would so\nfilter out most cases that there would not be a flood gate\neffect. Specifically, just delaying a case, as opposed to\nextinguishing that actual cause of action, as in this\ncase, will not be a harm that in itself, without further\ndamage, is going to be actionable as a constitutional\nviolation for denial of access. So, in the vast majority\nof cases, where an official makes a neutral statement,\nthere's not going to be any damage done that the fact\nfinder or the judge in the district court is not going to\nbe able to remedy with his panoply of equitable tools.\nThe second filter, though, is that there must\nhave been harmful and affirmative and wrongful conduct\naimed at obstructing the access to the courts, blocking\nthat person from going to the courts of law. That means\nthat in the context of deceit, which is presented here,\nthat the statements have to have been intentionally\ndeceptive, not just words of courtesy which would be --\nQUESTION: When -- when you say wrongful, Ms.\nHarbury, you don't mean in violation of any particular\nstatute. You mean something broader than that, don't you?\nMS. HARBURY: In this case it would be a common\nlaw -- common law tort, Your Honor, to commit intentional\ndeceit where the person making the deceptive statements is\nfully aware and intends that a reasonable person will rely\non that statement to their detriment.\nQUESTION: The Secretary of State is liable for\nthe common law tort of deceit under those circumstances is\nwhat you're saying.\nMS. HARBURY: I'm saying that where the common\nlaw tort of deceit is the wrongful act which was taken in\norder to block access to the courts of law, then it\nbecomes a constitutional tort. The simple act of\ndeception I doubt would be actionable in most cases,\nespecially when the words were simply courtesy words and a\nreasonable person, hearing some -- one statement, for\nexample, that oh, we're very concerned, a reasonable\nperson would probably not rely on that statement to mean\nmore than we'll write a letter of inquiry for you.\nBut what is set out in this case, what is\nalleged in this case is that there was an array of\nstatements made by numerous persons in the State\nDepartment and other agencies which were intended and\nwhich did give a number of false impressions and false\nunderstandings, specifically that the United States had no\ninformation at all about what was happening with my\nhusband. In fact, they knew that the CIA was deeply\ninvolved. They knew within 6 days of his capture that\nthey were falsifying his death and planned to torture him\nfor his information.\nQUESTION: Ms. Harbury, from the time you did --\nyou did get information from the Government ultimately\nwhen you brought your Freedom of Information Act suit.\nFrom the time you made your request under FOIA until you\nreceived that information, how much time elapsed?\nMS. HARBURY: I made the FOIA request in January\nof '95. A number of disclosures were made by Government\nofficials in March, and in the ensuing uproar, I then\nbegan to get some preliminary documentation later that\nfall.\nThe reason that I filed my FOIA, for purposes of\nclarification here, in January is that the 60 Minutes\nbroadcast, for the first time ever, had indicated to me\nthat the U.S. officials were deceiving me, that they\nweren't --\nQUESTION: My -- my point is your -- your theory\nis, if I hadn't been lulled into the sense that the\nGovernment was my friend, I would have immediately filed a\nFOIA request and I would have gotten this information in\ntime to seek this injunction. But in fact, if it takes --\nthere was a 6-month interval from March until September,\nassuming that September was the date of execution. If the\nFOIA lawsuit would have taken more than 6 months to\nprocess, then you would not have found out anything in\ntime to bring this injunction action.\nMS. HARBURY: Under those conditions, Your\nHonor, knowing or believing that my husband could still\nwell be alive and being subjected to torture, I would have\nbeen in court immediately for a TRO for expedited handling\nof that case. The reason I didn't do so in '95 is because\nI learned that my husband was dead. There was no longer\nany reason to go for an emergency injunctive relief.\nQUESTION: Do you know of FOIA cases that have\nbeen handled that way with a TRO? Or you're saying that\nthis is a unique situation?\nMS. HARBURY: Your Honor, I believe the FOIA\nitself makes provisions for expedited handling where\nnecessary, and I believe that any Federal district court,\nusing their rights and their equitable remedies for\nemergency situations, could have ordered the emergency\nprocessing. And in fact, those documents were not sealed\naway in remote files. They were being reviewed, actively\nreviewed, by many of the petitioners as those events were\nunfurling.\nQUESTION: Well, would they? That's -- I mean,\nobviously reading your story, one is immediately\nsympathetic, and it's a very sad and difficult. I\nunderstand that.\nAnd suppose you were in court and the court\nmight think there are other people with similar stories,\nand indeed, foreign nationals are quite often perhaps,\nfrom what one reads in the paper, subject to very bad\ntreatment at the hands of other foreign nationals. And\nour Government supports some of those and because we must,\naccording to what they say.\nWell, how is a court supposed to know whether,\nwhen you have the CIA, when you have one group of foreign\nnationals hurting another group of foreign nationals, when\nthere's egregious behavior throughout the world and we\nhave to support some -- how in your view can we\ndistinguish this case from the general problem of foreign\nrelations, from the general problem of the CIA, from\nthings that courts by and large don't go into?\nMS. HARBURY: If I may. I'm not sure if I'm\nunderstanding your question, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm really trying to work\ngetting you to address what I would see as a major\nimplication, which is not at all casting doubt on -- on\nthe sympathy with which an individual might have, but\nrather the problem of conducting foreign affairs, which\nwe're told by the Government requires courts to stay out\nof certain things and your thing is in that category that\nthey say stay out of. And I'd like you to say what you\nwant about that.\nMS. HARBURY: We're -- there are, of course --\nthere is, of course, here a case within a case. There's\nthe 1993 claims I would have brought and there's this case\nfor --\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm thinking of the case\nwithin the case because, after all, you have to have had a\nclaim that a judge would have gone and addressed,\notherwise the blocking you from that wouldn't have\nmattered.\nMS. HARBURY: Yes, Your Honor. In 1993, the\nclaims for emergency injunctive I would have brought,\nalthough as in the redistricting cases, it's not that they\ndon't touch on a political question, or in this case a\nforeign affairs question, but they would have not required\nthe court to interfere with ongoing formation of foreign\naffairs. We would not, for example, have been asking that\nthe courts of law determine whether or not our military or\nour CIA should be present in Guatemala or what our\nrelationships with the Guatemalan military, which was\nlater deemed by the United Nations to have engaged in\ngenocide against the Mayan peasants during the war. The\ncourt would not have been required or even asked to deal\nwith any of those issues.\nThere would have been a very limited question\npresented, which is may the CIA, in the absence of any\nextraordinary circumstances such as war or imminent\nnational security crisis, in the absence of any of those\nconditions, may they request and pay for information they\nknow is being contemporaneously extracted through the use\nof extreme torture and refuse to, in any way, instruct or\nsupervise their own contractors and, in addition, shield\nthose very assets, or informants in this case, from\nCongress which was trying at that time to force the\nGuatemalan military to better respect human rights.\nIn fact, our foreign affairs policy at that time\nwas to promote human rights in Guatemala where the army\nwas quickly becoming an international pariah for a number\nof very good reasons. And these actions of rogue\noperators with respect to the peace process, in respect --\nand with respect to promotion of human rights were\nundercutting the foreign affairs. This Court, by taking\n-- or the court in the United States, by taking action in\n1993, would simply have settled whether or not the CIA may\npay for torture in the absence of any extraordinary\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: May I -- your answer raises this\nquestion in my mind. If you say you're the trial judge in\n1993 with the complaint coming in and you think you're\nright, you should get relief, do you think the relief that\nwould have been ordered by the -- the proper relief at\nthat time would have been simply an order not to pay any\nmore money to the Guatemalan people, or would it have been\nbroader relief covering all the matters you've discussed?\nMS. HARBURY: I would have asked in 1993 for\nthree steps to have been taken by the CIA through --\nthrough an injunctive -- through an injunction by the\ncourts. Number one, which -- would be the obvious.\nPlease don't ask for more information and promise to pay\nfor it, especially when those payments are often 20 to 30\ntimes more than the annual national salary in Guatemala.\nAnd number two --\nQUESTION: Well, let's get the first one. What\nwould the first have been? An order -- tell me again.\nWhat -- what would the injunction say on that first point?\nMS. HARBURY: The first point of the injunction\nwould have been to prohibit CIA officials from requesting\nand promising payment for and making payment for continued\ninformation contemporaneously being extracted through the\nuse of torture from a living prisoner. That would have\nbeen point one.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. HARBURY: Point two would have been these\nare your employees. You may not refuse to engage in any\nproper supervision of them. You must at least sit down\nand talk to them and indicate to them what the parameters\nof human rights law are and international law.\nAnd number three, you may not shield these\npeople from the wrath of the United States Congress. You\nare supposed to report those matters to Congress.\nQUESTION: And you say shield those people.\nWhich people? Shield the members of the CIA or the people\nwho are doing the -- the interrogating?\nMS. HARBURY: The CIA was not properly reporting\nmy husband's situation to Congress at the time, and the\npetitioners in this case were repeatedly writing to\nCongress saying there is no information about Mr. Bamaca\nat all. The same statements that were being made to me\nwere being made to everyone else. We have no information.\nThere was so much information appropriate for\ndeclassification that I could have been inside of a court\nwithin 24 hours.\nWith regards to torture, I would like to borrow\ntwo sentences from Patrick Henry, which I find very, very\nappropriate today. The issue of the times was with recent\nmemory of war on our territory and the scars and the\ntrauma that that had left. There was an ongoing debate in\nCongress as to whether or not sometimes U.S. officials\nshould be allowed to commit torture. His statement: what\nhas distinguished our ancestors was that they would not\npermit torture or cruel or barbaric treatment. Congress\nmay tell you that there is a necessity of strengthening\nthe arm of the Government, but if we do so, we are then\nlost and undone.\nThis is the bright line our Government has\nalways taken, all branches of this Government. The CIA\nwas established in aftermath and horror that went with\nwhat happened in World War II, the Holocaust in Europe,\nthe war crimes that occurred in the South Pacific.\nTreatment of prisoners of war came up again and again in\nIn re Yamashita. It's mentioned again in Johnson --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, that's clearly true.\nWhat in your opinion should the CIA do if it discovers\nthat other people not in the CIA are engaged in this?\nMS. HARBURY: Questions that I would leave to\nCongress and that are not raised in this case would be may\n-- may a CIA agent purchase information from someone known\nto be an unsavory character. That's not presented here.\nThe question in -- that's presented here, the\nfacts that are presented here is when you have an\nextremely close and supervisory relationship with a given\ninformant for years, you know that they are -- they are\nnotorious as a torturer and that, in fact, they were\nengaged in a liquidation campaign against civilians, and\nyou say, we want more information from the living prisoner\nin that room, you have the cattle prod and the pliers,\nhere's a check for several times -- maybe 10 or 20 times\nyour annual income -- would you please get that\ninformation for us, that is crossing the line. That's\ncrossing a very bright line that our Government has never\npermitted. Our Government has allowed under certain\ncircumstances to take life, never to torture.\nQUESTION: Well, and I assume that -- that would\nhave been part of your -- of your lawsuit, that you would\nhave had to establish that it is either what? A violation\nof a Federal statute or of the Constitution to -- to\npermit torture.\nMS. HARBURY: I -- I would be saying that\ncarrying out torture was outside the scope of any\nstatutory delegation of power to the CIA or in violation\nof its own internal policies and regulations.\nQUESTION: You're relying on the statutes or\nlack of statutory authority to do it.\nMS. HARBURY: Or in the alternative, violation\nof any -- any internal regulations they might have for\nextraordinary circumstances.\nQUESTION: But you couldn't make it in violation\nof the Constitution because the D.C. Circuit threw that\nout. There's something just unseemly about your saying it\nviolated a regulation to torture someone abroad, but it --\nI have to accept for purposes of this case that it didn't\nviolate the U.S. Constitution.\nMS. HARBURY: Leaving that issue aside, it\ncertainly violated any authority ever delegated by\nCongress to any person, any official in this country to\nengage in torture. It has never -- no authority has ever\nbeen delegated at that level to any official, not even\nfrom the time of our Founding Fathers right up through the\npresent when we've only recently continued to sign on to\ninternational treaties prohibiting torture of a human\nbeing.\nQUESTION: You make a -- a statement that the\nUnited States could have raised a national security\ndefense, but it didn't choose to do that. What -- what do\nyou envision to be the nature of that defense?\nMS. HARBURY: If the petitioners wished to\npresent to the district court an affirmative defense in\nthe answer, which has, of course, not yet been filed --\nwe're still at the motion to dismiss stage -- stating that\nsomehow there were overriding national security interests\nwhich forced them or justified their actions in this case,\nthat -- that met the strict scrutiny test of a fundamental\nright such as access to the courts, if they wish to make\nthat statement and try to provide that evidence, then I\nwould wish to come to the courts of law and provide my\nevidence of pretext that that -- those extraordinary\ncircumstances of national security did not at all exist in\nGuatemala during this relevant time period. And it would\nbe, of course, for the judge to decide that issue.\nEven giving great deference to the Government\nposition, I believe that I have evidence that would\nclearly establish that any such assertion was pretextual.\nQUESTION: Well, you're not talking then about a\nReynolds defense on the part of the Government where you\n-- where there is no evidence to presented. You're\ntalking about something else?\nMS. HARBURY: I'm saying -- I'm trying to\nconjecture what the petitioners might raise because they\nhaven't raised it yet. But the court below, the appellate\ncourt, left open that if in their answer they wished to\npresent a claim of national security as an affirmative\ndefense, which they have not raised to date, they're free\nto do so. And I'm free to answer.\nLastly I -- I don't believe that the 1983 -- the\n1993 claim would have raised any -- any undue effect or\nimpact on our Government officials in any way. They can\ncontinue to make courtesy statements. They can continue\nto give the Glomar denial, which would have given me fair\nnotice that documents might exist in their files.\nInstead, I was told there's nothing in this file. Maybe\nyou should look elsewhere. So, I did. I went to\nGuatemala and looked in the files of the Guatemalan\nmilitary, which was of itself a less than charming\nexperience.\nAnd I do believe that it's very important that\nwe remember that even in such cases as the conduct of our\nmilitary affairs in the Chappell case, for example, or in\nU.S. v. Stanley, although enormous latitude is given to\nour officials and we have decided not to engage or to\nprovide Bivens remedies under those contexts, in all of\nthose contexts, it has been noted that equitable relief\nwould still be correct and adequate. So, I believe that\nmy right in 1993 to move forward and obtain equitable\nrelief is without question.\nLastly, addressing the issue of -- of qualified\nimmunity for the petitioners here, the issue of access to\nthe courts is not a newfangled cause of action. It was\nstated long ago in Chambers v. the Baltimore & Ohio\nRailway that that right is fundamental. That right is the\nalternative of force. In an organized society, it is the\nright conservative of all other rights and lies at the\nfoundation --\nQUESTION: That was a full faith and credit\ncase, was it not? The -- it wasn't an express right of\naccess to courts claimed as a right under the United\nStates Constitution.\nMS. HARBURY: I believe in that case the\nquestion was the denial of the right of citizens from\nanother State, in Ohio, to actually file suit, and similar\nto In re Hull, it was interpreted as barring the\ncourthouse door.\nQUESTION: But it was decided not under some\nsubstantive constitutional principle, but under the -- the\nfull faith and credit or Interstate Commerce Clause, was\nit not?\nMS. HARBURY: That's correct. But the Court, in\ndiscussing those issues, noted the fundamental importance\nof the access to courts and the equal access to courts of\nall citizens.\nI believe that it was clear enough and very\nclearly established in all of the other circuit cases and\nin the long line of cases, due process and access to\ncourts that this Court has always given, that the rights\nthat I had in 1993 as in today were very clearly\nestablished. The Government cannot take wrongful and\naffirmative steps, in this case intentional deceit,\nknowing that a person will reasonably rely to their\ndetriment on those statements, in order to prevent them\nfrom going to the courts of law and in order to obstruct\nand thwart their ability to investigate their own case and\ngather their own information.\nWhen those affirmative and wrongful steps are\ntaken, whether it be locking a packet of evidence in a\ndesk drawer or locking crucial information in a file\ncabinet and telling the person that there is none, when\nthe Government acts to conceal information and takes\nwrongful steps as opposed to simply passively standing by\nor stating no comment, and the harm occurs as planned, and\nthe case is not simply delayed but destroyed, in that case\nI think that it has been clear since Baltimore and since\nIn re Hull and since --\nQUESTION: Thank you -- thank you, Ms. Harbury.\nMS. HARBURY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cordray, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nAt a minimum, the extent of legitimate debate\ntoday should resolve the qualified immunity issue in this\ncase. There have been allegations made about torture,\nabout atrocious treatment of individuals in foreign\ncountries. It has occurred throughout this century.\nBut before the Court today is a one particular\nclaim, that by saying we'll investigate and keep you\ninformed, Government officials denied a substantive due\nprocess right of access to courts asserted by respondent\nhere.\nThere is no allegation in this complaint, if you\nlook at pages 2 to 3 of our yellow brief, which fairly\nrestates the -- the pertinent allegations of this\ncomplaint, that these people were told there was nothing\nin the file. Instead, the claim was that they said we'll\ninvestigate the matter. We'll keep you informed, and that\nperhaps that was intentionally misleading. That's --\nthat's the allegations here. That's all the allegations\nhere.\nI would also say that in terms of this chain of\ncausation, the allegation is that at the end of the chain,\nGuatemalan military, who allegedly were torturing and\nholding rebels in the midst of a civil war, were going to\nrefrain from conduct because payments might have been\nwithheld by the United States -- that's extremely\nspeculative. It's as speculative or more so than Simon\nand Linda R.S.\nAnd finally, I would say that, again, we are\ndistant here from any allegations of torture. The\nallegations are that our clients perhaps mishandled\ninformal channels of communication about information that\ncould have been provided that they may or may not have\nactually had, and -- and we think that that's just very\ndistant from the facts that are actually alleged in the\ncomplaint in this case.\nMaximizing a particular remedy, which is what's\nbeing sought here, does not equal barring a cause of\naction, and there is no legitimate constitutional claim we\nthink that the Court could recognize based on its\nprecedents.\nIf there are no questions, thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nCordray.\n"
