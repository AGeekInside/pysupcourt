CROSS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CROSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nAEDPA's language, purpose, and legislative\nhistory supports the conclusion that the circuit conflict\nover the meaning of pending in 28 U.S.C., section\n2244(d)(2) can be resolved by reversing the Ninth Circuit\nfor one or more of the following three reasons.\nFirst, the Ninth Circuit improperly permits\ntolling for substantial delay if the State Supreme Court\naddresses the merits when denying an application for\ncollateral review.\nSecond, under California's system of successive\noriginal petitions, nothing is pending under State or\nFederal law following the denial of an application for\ncollateral review and prior to the proper filing of a new\napplication for review.\nAnd third, the gap theory relied upon by the\ndistrict court more accurately reflects congressional\nintent and the policy judgments underlying AEDPA's 1-year\nstatute of limitations than does the Ninth Circuit's\ninterpretation of pending --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cross, would you explain to us\nwhat it is in California -- what is the system and the\ntime within which post-conviction relief can be applied\nfor in California courts? Is there any time limit for\nfiling it with the trial court level?\nMR. CROSS: It's within a reasonable time, Your\nHonor, the general rule of timeliness. However, within a\nreasonable time has parameters which I can give you the\ncase of In re Harris, a California Supreme Court case,\nwhich addresses that. Specifically, it says the following\nin footnote 7. That's -- the cite is 5 Cal.4th at 828-\n829. Footnote 7 says the following. The general rule\nregarding timeliness is the habeas corpus petition must be\nfiled within a reasonable time after the petitioner\ncounsel knew or with due diligence should have known the\nfacts underlying the claim, as well as the legal basis of\nthe claim.\nThey then follow that up with two significant\npoints. The first is, is that ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims, which is the claim in this particular\nlitigation, should be filed as a verified -- excuse me --\na verified petition jointly with the direct appeal. In\nother words, if you know about the claim, you should file\nit at that time.\nNow, as far as how long you should be able to\nwait, the rules specifically state with regard to capital\ncases, which are considered to be much more complex than\nthe average non-capital case, they give them a 90-day\nperiod in which there is a presumption of timeliness so\nthat there is no substantial delay. You have a\npresumption that you have not exceeded substantial delay\nif you do it within 90 days.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, here there was a\nprompt filing in the -- at the trial court level.\nMR. CROSS: Pardon?\nQUESTION: Here there was a prompt filing at the\ntrial court level for habeas, State habeas.\nMR. CROSS: I would -- Your Honor, I would\nrespectfully disagree that it was prompt since he waited 5\nyears --\nQUESTION: Well, all right. It was -- it was\nwithin the statutory period that we have imposed for these\nsituations where it had -- AEDPA became effective.\nMR. CROSS: He filed his claim with 7 days\nremaining --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CROSS: -- in the grace period of the\nstatute of limitations.\nQUESTION: Now, after the trial court resolved\nit and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism\nother than filing an original writ with the court of\nappeals?\nMR. CROSS: Correct.\nQUESTION: Is that how it's done?\nMR. CROSS: Correct, in California.\nQUESTION: And is that again a reasonable time\nperiod within which to seek review by that mechanism in\nthe court of appeals? Or is there a time limit?\nMR. CROSS: As far as the -- the time between\neach original petition, there is no time limit. You would\nbe looking at the overall time period because you're\ndealing with -- Your Honor, with original petitions here.\nSo he has every right in California to go directly to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court or the Third District Court of\nAppeal.\nQUESTION: Well, that's the traditional rule in\nhabeas corpus, at least in -- in England.\nMR. CROSS: Correct.\nQUESTION: Wasn't it? That you could go from\none court to another and have -- have a different judge\nlook at it in a different proceeding and get a different\nresult.\nMR. CROSS: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But if he goes -- if he's -- I take\nit, under the California system, if he starts in the\nSupreme Court of California, and there's a fact issue,\nthey're going to say, go back to the trial court and start\nthere. They're not going to have a factual trial, are\nthey?\nMR. CROSS: In fact, Your Honor, I'd like to\ncorrect a misunderstanding that's promoted by the\nrespondent's brief. If you look at the red brief at page\n31, it gives the impression that you are indicating that\nif you were to go directly to the California Supreme\nCourt --\nQUESTION: Whereabouts on page 31?\nMR. CROSS: On page 31 at the top paragraph,\nthere's a reference in the third line to In re Hillery.\nThen there's a reference, the Ninth Circuit case, Harris\nv. Superior Court, indicating that California appellate\ncourts may refuse to entertain habeas and that it be sent\nback to the trial court. That's an incorrect statement of\nlaw, and I'll refer you to the actual footnote on that\npage, footnote 19, referring to California Rule of Court\n56(a)(1).\nThe problem with respondent's position is that\nhe gives a literal quote of 56(a)(1) and it sounds like\nthat's the proposition that you're referring to, but he\nignores to cite to the subsection (h), which is, as of\nJanuary 1st of this year, is now labeled subsection (i),\nwhich specifically states, quote -- and the title of the\nsubsection is proceedings not covered by this rule.\nQuote: the provisions of this rule shall not apply to\napplications for a writ of habeas corpus or to petitions\nfor review pursuant to rules 57, 58, and 59.\nQUESTION: Well, what happens --\nQUESTION: So, you -- you can begin in a higher\ncourt.\nMR. CROSS: Yes.\nQUESTION: You don't have to begin --\nMR. CROSS: Right, correct.\nQUESTION: What happens if you do begin in a\nhigher court and -- and there are disputed factual issues?\nHow do they resolve the factual issues?\nMR. CROSS: The -- that is explained, Your\nHonor, in Harris v. Superior Court, the Ninth Circuit\nopinion --\nQUESTION: Well, I haven't read --\nQUESTION: Why don't you tell us?\nMR. CROSS: I will tell you, Your Honor. The --\nthe way it is handled is the California Supreme Court\naround 1969 set up a procedure in which for original\npetitions in the appellate court that are filed there,\neither in the -- the district court of appeal or the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, they can have a special master,\nor they can send it back to the trial court, so that\nthere's no prevention from them taking the court and\ndeciding it with or without the hearing. But a prima\nfacie case must be made to them in order for those --\nQUESTION: Did -- in the proceedings involved in\nthis particular case, did either of the appellate courts\ngo the -- do that?\nMR. CROSS: No. There was -- the -- the\ndistrict court of appeal is a one-line denial, simply\nstating denied. And in the California Supreme Court, the\npetition was denied on the merits and for lack of\ndiligence.\nQUESTION: But in this --\nQUESTION: What happens just as a practical\nmatter? You go to the superior court on a collateral\nattack with a -- with a petition for a writ, and the court\nmakes lots of findings and rulings of law. Some of those\nrulings of law are absolutely wrong, but still, the\nultimate outcome may be in doubt. And so then the\npetitioner, the original petitioner, wants to go to the\ncourt of appeals. Does -- does he annex what happens in\n-- in the superior court just for the enlightenment of the\ncourt of appeals as to what the issues are or what the\nwrong rulings were, what the right rulings were, what the\nfindings were?\nMR. CROSS: The forms, Your Honor, are in the\njoint appendix where you are expected to indicate -- it's\n-- all three petitions use the same judicial counsel form.\nCalifornia Supreme Court petition -- if you want to look,\nit starts at page 31. And there -- I believe there is a\nquestion which asks the defendant if they've sought review\nin another court and to explain what the finding was of\nthat court and what claims were requested. That would be,\nfor example, question 9, did you seek review in the --\nexcuse me.\nQUESTION: Well, it's just background. I -- I\nsee where to find it now.\nMR. CROSS: The -- that's the extent of it. And\nso, the purpose of that question is to determine whether\nor not it's a -- it's a successive petition so they cannot\n-- if they had gone to the lower court, it can't be\nremanded back because the -- if the petition has been\ndenied in the lower court, they don't want to send it back\nfor an evidentiary hearing to the same judge or court who\nhas gone through the proceeding before and denied it.\nQUESTION: Well, getting to the issue in the\ncase, the respondent's brief points out that under the\ntheory you propose, what would happen if it's the -- the\nState that's appealing or filing a new -- not appealing,\nbut filing a new action? The -- the prisoner wins in --\nin the lower court, and then the State files an action.\nHow -- how would you count that or not count that so far\nas the limitations period is concerned?\nMR. CROSS: That is the most difficult question\nthat is posed, without question, Your Honor. The response\nI would have is it appears to me that Congress perhaps did\nnot think of that particular scenario other than perhaps\nthat under 2244(d)(1)(B), the State-created impediment\nissue would take care of the extreme case where the --\nwhere the State was trying to prevent the person's time\nfrom --\nQUESTION: This is the case where the petitioner\nprevails --\nMR. CROSS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- in superior court, and by statute,\nnow California allows the State to appeal that.\nMR. CROSS: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly that would be -- that\nwould be pending all that time, would it not?\nMR. CROSS: If you --\nQUESTION: Or would it not?\nMR. CROSS: If you take the position that it's\nnot an appellate system in a State like California, I\ndon't think it would be.\nQUESTION: Well, but you know, it can -- it\ncould be not an appellate system from the point of view of\nthe petitioner who has to have an original petition each\n-- each time he goes again to a new court. But the\nlegislature said, with respect to the State, if the -- if\nthe State loses, it can appeal, then that would be an\nappellate proceeding, wouldn't it?\nMR. CROSS: For California -- under California\nlaw, Your Honor, absolutely. But as far as this statute\nis concerned, I think we're interested in what the Federal\nlaw is and how the Congress would have viewed it.\nQUESTION: So, looking at how Federal law --\nQUESTION: But I -- but -- if -- if I may, just\none moment, Justice Breyer.\nWhat the Chief Justice suggests is that I -- I\ndid not pose a problem because what happens is is that the\nState simply appeals the -- what it thinks to be the\nerroneous ruling, and that means the action is still\npending. But I -- I thought from our earlier interchange\nthat you thought there was a bigger problem than that.\nMR. CROSS: I think there is a bigger problem\nbecause if there is -- it depends on when finality occurs,\nand if -- if you have an original proceeding and the\ndecision is final upon that decision, the clock would, I\nwould assume, start at least under California law. The\ncase laws that's referred to in the yellow brief under\nsubsection (c) --\nQUESTION: Well, but the Chief Justice suggests\nit's not rocket science for us to say it's still pending\nif there's an appeal.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I thought your --\nQUESTION: Or am I missing something?\nQUESTION: I am confused now. I thought your\nposition was that the case may well be pending, as Justice\nKennedy says, but there's no application pending --\nMR. CROSS: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- on the appeal. The application\nhas been disposed of in the first court. There's an\nappeal, but there's no longer an application pending. And\nthat's how the statute reads, not the case is pending.\nMR. CROSS: Right.\nQUESTION: There is an appeal? I thought that\nwhat happened -- I guess I'm mixed up. Maybe go back to\nJustice O'Connor. But I thought I understood this. I\nthought that they -- but that there is -- first of all,\nyou file in the district court normally. You don't have\nto in California.\nQUESTION: Superior.\nQUESTION: But almost always they'll go to the\nsuperior court and file a petition. And then in every\nother State, the losing party would appeal, but in\nCalifornia, they use different words. The words are not\nyou appeal; the words are you file a new petition in the\ncourt of appeals. And indeed, if you lose there, the\nwords are not you have 10 days to seek review in the\nSupreme Court; the words are you have whatever time you\nwant. You have to file a new petition in the Supreme\nCourt, but if you're too late, they're going to tell you\nyou're too late.\nSo, it functions exactly as if the words were\nthe following. You must appeal within -- now, normally it\nwill say 60 days, but in California it says within a\nreasonable time.\nNow, those aren't the words of the statute, but\nthat's how it functions. And if we don't read it that way\nfor purposes of Federal law, I guess we'd have to say that\nin 10,000 case a year in the California superior courts\ninvolving State habeas petitions -- as soon as those are\ndecided, they have to come here because they're all final\ndecisions of the State Supreme Court. And 5,000 cases in\nthe courts of appeals in California. Once they said\nfinal, they have to come here. So, we better have 20,000\nnew petitions each year from the State of California\nbecause California happens to use the word final and new\npetition instead of using the word appeal.\nNow, what's wrong with what I said?\nMR. CROSS: What's wrong with what you said,\nYour Honor, first of all, is that although California may\nsay that it's final at that level, it does not prevent the\nindividual from going to either of the other two next\nlevels or skipping one and going to the other because they\nare in fact original and in fact not -- it's more than\njust mere semantics because they can go to California with\ndifferent claims. It doesn't have to be the same petition\nat all.\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer suggests that when you\ngo, say, from the superior court to the district court of\nappeal, it's -- it's like an appeal. Well, now, is there\na transcript of the record made in the superior court that\nyou have to file with the district court of appeal like\nyou would in other appeals?\nMR. CROSS: Typically not. There could be some\ncircumstances, under rare circumstances, where the\nsuperior court would have some sort of evidentiary\nhearing. There would be a transcript.\nQUESTION: Do you have to file a notice of\nappeal in the superior court to go to the district court\nof appeal?\nMR. CROSS: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: In other words, in the -- I've never\nheard of this, and I know a lot of California lawyers. I\nthought when you go to the superior court in California --\na prisoner and he says, I raise issues 1, 2, and 3, and\nthey have a record and they decide it. And now you go to\nthe California court of appeals. I thought in the normal\ncase they'll say, and the superior court judge made an\nerror, and the reason he made an error is because of --\nand then they'll cite witnesses just like an appeal.\nNow, I grant you they can do some extra things.\nThey can raise extra issues if they want, and they don't\nhave to raise everything below like any other appeal. But\naside from that, I don't know the differences. I've been\naround for a while. I've seen a few cases. I've never\nnoticed some big difference. Now, you'll tell me I'm all\nwrong about California, and I'm open to hearing that.\nMR. CROSS: The California case law, in fact,\nindicates that --\nQUESTION: I'm not interested in California case\nlaw. I want to know what the practice is in California.\nMR. CROSS: The practice is quite different from\nthe description that you gave.\nQUESTION: Fine. That's what I want to know.\nMR. CROSS: In fact, there are -- I don't have\nthe exact statistics, but in my 15 years of experience in\npracticing, I have seen probably around 40 to 50 percent\nof the cases not go to the trial court, that in fact, very\ncommonly they go directly to the California Supreme Court,\nand they are denied. That's a very common experience in\nCalifornia --\nQUESTION: Then can they go -- start over again\nand go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?\nMR. CROSS: Not -- Your Honor, not on those same\nclaims, they certainly can't. California and other States\nwould perhaps bar successive petitions if it's the same\nclaims. It doesn't necessarily prevent them from coming\nback with something else that they've discovered at a\nlater time --\nQUESTION: There's no bar in California to going\nback as many times as you want if you have a new claim\neach time?\nMR. CROSS: There are escape clauses in\nCalifornia, as well as other States, that -- that allow\nyou, if you discover, just like the Federal statute, new\nclaims.\nQUESTION: All right. What -- what is the\ngeneral rule in other States that are unlike California\nthat say you go for post-conviction relief first to the\ntrial court? Let them decide it. Then you have 30 days\nor whatever it is to go to the court of appeals. If\nthat's denied, you have X number of days to go to the\nState Supreme Court.\nNow, in a State like that, is it the case that\nin applying AEDPA in this statute of limitations, that we\nexclude all of the time for decision making as well as\nthat statutory time within which to file the appeal?\nMR. CROSS: AEDPA grants --\nQUESTION: Is that what a majority of courts are\nholding?\nMR. CROSS: The majority of courts are holding\nthat -- and the statute specifically provides for tolling\nfor all the time in which the decision -- excuse me -- in\nwhich the petition is before a court. That's, you know,\nspecifically provided.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but is it -- is it the\ncase that most courts are holding, under the scheme I\ndescribed, that not only while the court is deciding it,\nbut the time allowed to enable them to go to the next\nhigher court is excluded as well?\nMR. CROSS: The majority of courts are holding\nthat you will get time for the appeal time that's\nspecified by the State, for example, 60 days or 90 days.\nQUESTION: Yes, all right. So, the problem with\nCalifornia is we have no time specified. We have a\nreasonable time. How are we supposed to decide what's\nreasonable in California? Should we certify a question\nback to the California Supreme Court and say, was this a\nreasonable time? How do we know?\nMR. CROSS: One --\nQUESTION: What do we do?\nMR. CROSS: One suggestion that was made in the\namicus briefs by the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation is\nto adopt the nearest analogous State rule, which in\nCalifornia under rule 2 or 30 through 31 would be 60 days.\nThat's one thing that could be done by the court which\nwould stretch the statutory language to -- to bring\nCalifornia into an appellate system which --\nQUESTION: Wouldn't that be up to California to\ndo? What we have is a system that allows a reasonable\ntime. I'm asking you how we determine what is a\nreasonable time.\nMR. CROSS: I think, Your Honor, the way to\ndetermine a reasonable time would be to look at the\nCalifornia rules for their original habeas petitions and\ndetermine that under California law, we know that -- that\nyou are expected to file no longer than 90 days in a\ncapital case without having a presumption of timeliness --\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt --\nMR. CROSS: And that would be the absolute\noutside limit for a determination of what would be\nreasonable.\nQUESTION: But may I just ask this question? If\nin this case the California court did decide on the merits\n-- apparently -- it's a little ambiguous, but it seems to\n-- wouldn't that definitely disclose a decision that it\nwas reasonable? They took jurisdiction.\nMR. CROSS: No, Your Honor. I -- I believe that\nthe -- the interpretation would be that even though a -- a\nState Supreme Court decided, at least alternatively on the\nmerits -- simply indicates that for one reason or another,\nthey decided to perhaps excuse untimeliness if they didn't\nhave a -- an untimeliness finding --\nQUESTION: To excuse untimeliness, they're\nsaying in this particular case we think it must have been\nreasonable. Aren't -- isn't that -- doesn't that\nnecessarily follow?\nMR. CROSS: In this particular case, they said\nhe acted with a lack of diligence.\nQUESTION: But that might have been --\nQUESTION: No, but it didn't excuse\nuntimeliness. Untimeliness was one of the two bases for\ntheir decision, wasn't it?\nMR. CROSS: In this case, absolutely.\nQUESTION: We don't know whether that\nuntimeliness was the 5 years that he took to even get\nstarted.\nThere's one fact question here that may make the\nrest of this rather abstract. This petitioner says that\nhe never got notice of the -- of the intermediate\nappellate court's decision and he -- when he did -- I\nmean, the only gap here that's relevant for AEDPA -- the 5\nyears is gone. He gets that free. But the only gap we're\ntalking about, as I understand it, is the 4-and-a-half\nmonths. And he says, as to that, I never knew. I wrote a\nletter and finally they told me, and within 3 days after I\ngot notice, I filed in the next court. So, I was diligent\nfrom the time I knew of that decision.\nThere is no -- there's been no determination by\nanybody whether that 4-and-a-half-month interval was\nbeyond his control. I mean, you recognize that there\nwould be an exception for situations beyond his control.\nSo, how do we determine whether there was any lack of\ndiligence with respect to that 4-and-a-half months? This\nrecord is totally blank on it.\nMR. CROSS: Your Honor, this situation is even\nmore perplexing than what you set forth because there are\nthree possibilities. One is that it's the 5-year period\nthe California is returning to -- referring to. Another\npossibility it's just the 4-and-a-half-month. And the\nthird possibility is the combination of all of those\nperiods.\nThe question simply is what is meant by timely\nand what is meant by properly pursuing.\nQUESTION: Well, and also I think what is meant\nby pending because if -- if we were -- if it were\ndetermined that these separate matters, as you say, before\nthree different courts were pending only during the time\nthose particular courts had them for consideration, it\nmight be quite a different result than if you say look at\nthe reasonableness of the whole series of proceedings\ntogether.\nMR. CROSS: Your Honor, absolutely that is\ncorrect. If we look at the language --\nQUESTION: Mr. Cross, as -- as I understand your\nsubmission, it doesn't matter. That was not the ground on\nwhich the Ninth Circuit decided the case, you contend.\nThey decided it simply on the ground that the Supreme\nCourt of California addressed the merits. End of case.\nMR. CROSS: Right.\nQUESTION: Right?\nMR. CROSS: The California Supreme Court holding\nand the -- the problem it presents for the statute is --\nis that it eviscerates the statute by holding that as long\nas -- as the State Supreme Court addresses the merits,\nthat regardless of the length of the delay, which could be\nnot just 4-and-a-half months in this case, but 4-and-a-\nhalf years or 4-and-a-half decades, they will excuse the\ndelay.\nQUESTION: But isn't the -- the answer that --\nyour -- your friends on the other side give a -- a good\nanswer. They say, look, the -- the point of requiring\nspeed here is to preserve the State interest and make sure\nStates don't have to retry cases years and years later and\nthere's relative finality and so on.\nIf the State wants to allow this kind of, in\neffect, dilatory proceeding, the State has no claim to be\noffended by it. It's in the State's power. So, if the\nState wants to give you 10 years for habeas, the State\nhasn't got any complaint. It gave the 10 years and it can\nchange its rule if it wants to. What's the answer to\nthat?\nMR. CROSS: Your Honor, the answer to that is\nthat this is a Federal statute not a State statute. We're\nnot changing the --\nQUESTION: It is a Federal statute that is keyed\nto a State statute, and the point of doing this is to\npreserve the State's interest in -- in finality in their\nown proceedings and to -- to protect the State from being\nforced, in effect, to retry cases years and years in the\nfuture after the -- the evidence has grown stale.\nMR. CROSS: That's --\nQUESTION: And if that -- if those are the\nobjectives of the statute -- and I thought they were --\nthen California, in effect, or any State can control the\nproceedings simply by its own time schedule.\nMR. CROSS: Your Honor, that is certainly one of\nthe objectives of the statute, but there are a number of\npolicy interests related to the statute of limitations\nitself which is part of AEDPA. You're absolutely correct\nin that finality is one of the three main concerns of\nAEDPA itself, but there are other concerns and policy\nconcerns related to the statute itself.\nQUESTION: Mr. Cross, a State Supreme Court that\nhad that attitude, that didn't care that you were late,\nwould not -- would not have dismissed this case on two\ngrounds, one of which is it's untimely. That's not what\nwe have here. We don't have a situation in which the\nCalifornia Supreme Court said, we don't care how late it\nis; we're going to decide it on the merits. It decided on\ntwo grounds, one of which is you -- you are too late under\nour -- under our rules. And -- and the Ninth Circuit just\nignored that. Isn't that right?\nMR. CROSS: That's absolutely right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Isn't the counter argument equally\npossible? A State that was really concerned about\ntimeliness would not have decided the case also on the\nmerits as an alternative ground. Therefore, if it does\ndecide that it's significant enough to get into the\nmerits, we ought to take the -- the State Supreme Court at\nits word and say, if there was a merits determination, it\nobviously was not untimely in -- in any dispositive sense.\nWhy isn't that an equally good interpretation?\nMR. CROSS: I think, Your Honor, this Court has\nstated before in Coleman v. Thompson that we -- that you\ndon't want to direct the State courts how to issue their\nrulings for whatever State reasons they have for doing it.\nQUESTION: No, but when the State says two\nthings and they seem to be in contradiction -- if it's\nuntimely, then you don't get to the merits. It's -- it's\nunreasonable in time. If you do get to the merits, it\nsuggests that there is something timely about it.\nAnd all, I think, the Ninth Circuit was saying\nand all I'm suggesting is we're not mind readers. We\ncan't say, well, we guess they really meant the first part\nof -- the first reason they gave or they really meant the\nsecond reason. We're simply going to come up with a --\nwith a rule that everyone will understand and that the\nState courts can understand.\nAnd if they get to the merits, we're going to\ndeem it timely because we -- we assume these people are\nnot going to be reaching merits decisions on -- on matters\nthat are totally untimely under their law. Why -- why\ndoesn't that respect the State courts, give a rule that\neverybody pretty much can follow and know where he stands?\nMR. CROSS: Your Honor, because it would, in\neffect, eviscerate the statute of limitations under\nFederal law. If you have unlimited tolling for 20 or 30\nyears, there is not much left of the 1-year Federal\nstatute of limitations. And under Harris v. Reed,\nalternative --\nQUESTION: What's left is a 1-year Federal\nstatute of limitations after the conclusion of the State\nproceedings, and if the State proceedings were begun in a\ntimely fashion, I don't know what else the statute is\nsupposed to accomplish.\nMR. CROSS: Well, Your Honor, the statute --\nstatutory schemes across the country -- there's a wide\nvariety, of which there are over 20 States that have no\nstatute of limitations.\nQUESTION: Do you know how the California\nSupreme Court operates generally with respect to petitions\nof this kind, post-conviction petitions? Is it common for\nthem to say on the merits, but anyway it's untimely, or do\nthey often say it's untimely, that's the end of it without\ngoing on to the merits?\nMR. CROSS: It's usually a combination, Your\nHonor. There's in fact, a dispute between the members of\nthe California Supreme Court as to whether to even pose\nprocedural bars. Justice Brown has argued that it only\nshould be addressed on the merits. So, there's a\ncombination usually or sometimes just a denial on the\nmerits.\nIf you don't mind, Your Honor, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cross.\nMr. Ogden, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. OGDEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. OGDEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI would like to go directly to the two most\ndifficult questions that I need to answer this morning and\nwhich have been addressed extensively thus far.\nFirst, that the rule adopted by the -- by the\nunanimous courts of appeals that any gaps between stages\nof the State habeas process should be tolled so long as\nthe next stage is initiated in a timely fashion should\napply to California.\nAnd second --\nQUESTION: What happens if it -- go on. Give us\nyour second --\nMR. OGDEN: And -- and the second point that I'd\nlike to address is that under that rule on the record in\nthis case, there is an insufficient basis to conclude that\nthe filing in the State Supreme Court was late and\ntherefore that the judgment below should be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Are you going to cover the question\nof whether these various actions were pending and for how\nlong?\nMR. OGDEN: Yes, Your Honor. That's the first\n-- that's -- that's the first subject that I'd like to\ncover because I know that one of the concerns and one of\nthe difficulties of this case is applying the concepts of\nthe statute to California's unique system.\nNow, California's system of original writ should\nbe subject to the rule that tolls the entire period of\ntime for two reasons. First, that is the best\nunderstanding of the text of the statute because\nCalifornia's system --\nQUESTION: The text of AEDPA or the text of\nCalifornia's statute?\nMR. OGDEN: Of AEDPA, Your Honor, of -- of\nsection 2244(d)(2).\nBecause California's system functions as an\nintegrated appellate style process for prisoners seeking\nto exhaust State remedies.\nAnd second, because just as in other States, the\nso-called gap theory espoused by the State would\ndiscourage prisoners from making full use of California's\nprocess and encourage premature Federal filings.\nNow, turning to the text of the statute -- and\nJustice Scalia asked about the -- about the word\napplication in particular -- Congress wrote a statute in\ngeneral terms intended to apply nationwide. It does not\nturn on the particular form of pleading or the nature of\nthe action. To the contrary, an application within the\nmeaning of the statute is simply a request for relief so\nlong as it is submitted in the context of, as the statute\nphrases it, State post-conviction or other collateral\nreview.\nNow, that request for relief is distinct from\nthe claims that support it, and it is pending so long as\nit -- as it is unresolved in the State system.\nQUESTION: You -- you say the -- the application\nis distinct from the claim. Granted, both words -- how\ndoes that work out?\nMR. OGDEN: The claims are the arguments that\nsupport the request for relief in -- in a habeas or post-\nconviction context. Typically the request is to be\nreleased from an unconstitutional confinement. That\nrequest is supported by -- by a set of claims. And -- and\nit's the request that constitutes the application.\nQUESTION: But, you know, we were confronted\nwith precisely the same argument in Artuz which dealt with\nwhat constitutes a properly filed application. And the\nargument was if the claim is not a proper claim, if it\ndoes not lie under the State law, it is not a properly\nfiled application. And we held, no, that's not so. An\napplication is an application and a claim is -- is a\nclaim. And the -- the application is properly filed so\nlong as it's given to the -- you know, to the proper clerk\nin the proper court and -- and so forth. Now, dealing\nwith the very same -- very same provision of law.\nMR. OGDEN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe my\nargument is entirely consistent with Artuz. Indeed, it's\n-- it's really based on the reasoning there.\nArtuz makes a distinction between bars that go\nto claims and bars that go to the form of the -- of the\napplication itself. My submission is that the application\nis the request for relief, that is, regardless of what\nform it takes and what kind of proceeding, it is a request\nthat contains claims in the same way that an application\ncontains claims. A request is an application. And that\nrequest, the request for relief, continues to be pending\nwithin the meaning of the statute until the -- until it is\nresolved within the State system.\nNow, in the California system, that request for\nrelief, that request to be released from confinement,\ncontinues to be unresolved so long as there is another\ncourt to which one can bring a -- a petition to review a\ndecision.\nQUESTION: Or presumably you could go back and\nforth to a number of California courts, if you come up\nwith, you know, a different argument and that sort of\nthing.\nMR. OGDEN: Yes, Your Honor, you could present\ndifferent claims. But the way the California system\nfunctions is that the -- the design of it where factual\ndevelopment is required, quite naturally, is that that\nclaim should be brought in the superior court.\nAs we say in our brief, if you attempt to file\nan original petition initially in a higher court and\nfactual development is required, typically if it's a non-\ncapital case, what that court will do is to issue an order\nto show cause, returnable in the superior court. And once\nyou are there as a -- as a petitioner, if you lose, your\nonly recourse for further review is to file an original\npetition yet again above.\nNow, critically from the standpoint of\nunderstanding whether this is an appellate system or a\nsystem of completely independent free-standing\napplications, it's important to understand that when one\ngoes from the superior court where one develops a record,\nYour Honor, to -- to the court of appeal, that -- that\nnext filing is not considered a successive petition under\nCalifornia law. It's not considered a second --\nQUESTION: What do you mean -- what do you mean\nby a -- do you mean the same thing as an original\npetition?\nMR. OGDEN: It's called an original writ.\nQUESTION: Yes. So, what -- what do you mean by\nthe term successive?\nMR. OGDEN: Successive petition is a procedural\nbar under California law, which if you bring a second\npetition that contains claims that could have been, but\nwere not, contained in your first petition or that\ncontains the same claims as were contained in your first\npetition, it's dismissed as a matter of procedural law in\nCalifornia as a successive petition. That successive\npetition bar does not apply --\nQUESTION: What does it look like in practice?\nI mean, I had thought, as you were saying, that whatever\nthey call it, they call the trial court original, they\ncall the court of appeals original, they call the supreme\ncourt original. But despite that, to an outside observer\nwho wasn't looking at the names, it would look pretty much\nlike any other State where you get an initial hearing and\nthen you get some appeals.\nNow, there's obviously the difference, you could\nfile new claims at the second level, but leaving that\naside, it would look -- now, the attorney general said I'm\nwrong on that, absolutely wrong, that that isn't what it\nlooks like, that sometimes at least it's random, sometimes\nthey -- they -- just as many might likely file, I guess,\nin the court of appeals as the district court. They might\nfile in the supreme court. Maybe they look for appeal in\nthe -- in the trial court. I don't know. But it's a\nrandom and -- and, indeed, if you go to the court of\nappeals, you'll see they don't even look at the record in\nthe trial court.\nAll right. Now, he says that's how it's worked.\nHe's been around a long time. And at that point, I'm not\nsure what to do frankly.\nMR. OGDEN: Well -- well, it's -- it is\ndifficult because so much of this turns on California law.\nBut --\nQUESTION: I mean, what does it look like? I\ndon't know how you get to that question.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, what -- what it looks like, as\ndescribed in a case called In re Resendez, which is not\ncited in our brief is --\nQUESTION: You didn't --\nMR. OGDEN: 19 P.2d, Pacific Second, 1171.\nQUESTION: What's the date of that case?\nMR. OGDEN: It's 2001, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Pacific Second?\nMR. OGDEN: Pacific Third, 1171 at 1184.\nThat -- that case makes clear in discussing the\nsituation in which a subsequent original writ is filed --\noriginally filed in the superior court and you have\nfindings of fact made by the superior court. It is then\nfiled subsequently in the court of appeal and then --\nQUESTION: When you say it is then filed, what\ndo you mean by it?\nMR. OGDEN: A petition encompassing the same\nclaims is filed in the court of appeal and then again in\nthe supreme court.\nFirst of all, the record is -- the record\ngenerally forms the basis for that review. And in Gardner\nagainst California in 1969, looking at this very system\nfor -- for handling habeas petitions on original writ,\nthis Court decided that the system was sufficiently\nsimilar to an appellate process that a habeas petitioner\nfiling an original writ in the court of appeal was\nentitled at State expense to a transcript of the\nproceeding in the -- in the superior court because the\nprocedure in the court of appeal is essentially record\nreview.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Cross said -- and it would\nbe extraordinary if it's record review, but you don't have\nto file the record. When -- when you go into the court of\nappeals, do you have to file the record of -- of the\ndecision below?\nMR. OGDEN: You certainly can file the record\nand the clerk can request it.\nQUESTION: Do you have to?\nQUESTION: Do you have to?\nMR. OGDEN: I don't know the answer to that,\nYour Honor, as to whether it's required.\nQUESTION: Is it ordinarily done?\nMR. OGDEN: I -- I think ordinarily there -- the\nrecord consists of the petition and the decision below.\nBut if there is a hearing where witnesses are presented, I\nbelieve it is ordinarily done, and that's why --\nQUESTION: That's not what the -- that's not\nwhat Mr. Cross said.\nMR. OGDEN: That's --\nQUESTION: What is your -- I mean, Mr. Cross\napparently has been practicing in California for 15 years.\nI think if you're going to make -- you don't claim to be\npersonally familiar with California law, do you?\nMR. OGDEN: No, I don't, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then I think perhaps you\nshould cite some authority.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, I -- I cite for the\nproposition that -- that the record is part of the -- the\nprocess in the court of appeal, both the Resendez case --\nQUESTION: But you say the record is part of the\nprocess in the court of appeal. That's a very, very vague\nstatement.\nMR. OGDEN: Well --\nQUESTION: What we want to know is typically in\nan appeal, you'd have a record from the superior court.\nYou're appealing from the superior court or the district\ncourt of appeal, you have to -- you must file the record.\nIt's a part of the -- before the court of appeals will\nhear your claim.\nMR. OGDEN: The best I can do, Your Honor, is to\nrefer to these three cases -- the Resendez case, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court decision at -- which I've given\nthe cite for; In re Wright, which is 78 Cal. App. 3d at\n801 to 802; People against Singer, which is 226 Cal. App.\n3d at 32 -- which make clear that the process of reviewing\nthese matters coming from the superior court where there's\nbeen a prior petition there and the same claims are\nbrought in the next court is a process of reviewing the\nrecord, and where what is presented are findings of fact\nby the superior court that are based on credibility\ndeterminations, great weight is given to those credibility\ndeterminations by the reviewing court. And -- and that is\nthe -- the fundamental functionality, the way the system\nworks.\nIt can be used in other ways without question.\nA petitioner can attempt to file, you know, claims at a\nhigher level.\nQUESTION: You've practiced here a lot. I mean,\nif the -- if the superior court decision in a State habeas\nmatter is a final decision and there's no more review of\nit in the State, I guess then we have jurisdiction to\nreview that. But I have never seen someone come here\ndirectly from the decision of the superior court of\nCalifornia in a State habeas matter. Maybe they just\nhaven't thought of it.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, no, Your Honor, they're not\npermitted to, and I think that's a very important --\nQUESTION: We wouldn't issue habeas when -- when\nyou have failed to exhaust all of your State remedies\nwhether it's by appeal or not by appeal. If you still\nhave State remedies available, we wouldn't issue Federal\nhabeas. It -- it would be useless to come here.\nMR. OGDEN: This -- this Court's decision in the\nO'Sullivan case has been applied by the Ninth Circuit in\n-- in the case called James against Giles, which states\nthat it is a requirement, in order to fully exhaust one's\nState remedies, that one file and submit one's claims to\nthe California Supreme Court.\nQUESTION: Of course, and that applies whether\nit's an appeal or whether it's an independent action. I\nmean, it -- it sheds no light upon -- upon the central\nissue here.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, I --\nQUESTION: Whichever one it is, you have to\nexhaust those remedies before you apply for Federal\nhabeas.\nMR. OGDEN: I think it sheds substantial light\non it, Your Honor, because as was made clear in Duncan\nagainst Walker by this Court, the very purpose of this\ntolling provision is to facilitate and to, indeed, promote\nthe full and complete exhaustion of State remedies.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, let me ask you this.\nSuppose that a -- a prisoner has filed in California for\nState post-conviction review in the superior court and\nthen in the court of appeals and then makes no filing in\nthe State supreme court, could but years go by. Then\nthere's a petition filed for habeas in the Federal court.\nNow, the Federal court under your view presumably would\nhave to say, no, it's still pending in the State court.\nMR. OGDEN: I believe the appropriate course for\nthe Federal court in that situation --\nQUESTION: What would you do?\nMR. OGDEN: -- would be to apply this Court's\ndecision in O'Sullivan against Boerckel and deem the\npetition to be unexhausted. At that point, the petitioner\ncould apply to the California Supreme Court.\nQUESTION: And say it is unexhausted and -- and\nthe -- a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run.\nMR. OGDEN: Because simply it's unknowable. You\nasked the question earlier whether -- who decides whether\nit's a reasonable time or not, and I think it's very clear\nthe design of the statute of -- of 2244(d)(2) is that the\nState of California decides. Whether something continues\nto be pending in exhaustion law is a question of whether\nit is possible whether there is a -- an available\nprocedure under State law to raise the claim to a higher\nlevel.\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's -- let's continue that\nhypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives. There's a long\nwait, years of wait. They go to the -- the prisoner goes\nto the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme\nCourt said, you are late. You have lacked diligence. We\nwill not rule on the merits. Dismissed. When does the\nFederal statute -- how does the Federal statute apply\nthere?\nMR. OGDEN: That implicates a -- a circuit split\nthat's not presented in this case, Your Honor. There is a\ndifference of opinion among the circuits about how to\napply the -- the endpoint of -- of the tolling process.\nIn the majority of circuits, tolling terminates at the\npoint it is no longer possible to file a --\nQUESTION: What is the position that you urge\nupon us here in that instance?\nMR. OGDEN: Your Honor, I don't believe it's --\nit is important for my client what the answer to that\nquestion is because the second point I want to make this\nmorning is that the submission to the California Supreme\nCourt was not late under California law.\nQUESTION: I'm trying to -- I'm trying to\ninterpret the statute, and so I imagined this case and I\nwant to know how it would come out --\nMR. OGDEN: I think the most --\nQUESTION: -- under your view.\nMR. OGDEN: I'm sorry. I think the most natural\ninterpretation of the statute is the majority of the\ncourt's view which is that it continues to be pending\nuntil it is too late to file a submission, and then the\nopportunity to file -- if you file for leave to file out\nof time, that would then resume the tolling if that motion\nwere granted. In California, that --\nQUESTION: Retroactively. I mean, there's a\nsplit. There are real problems and -- and those problems,\nas well as the problems with the California system, seem\nto me good reason to read the statute the way it's written\nso that there has to be an application pending, not -- not\na case pending, but an application. On appeal, it could\nbe the application of either the petitioner or the\ngovernment if it lost, but the only time counted is the --\nis the time during the pending application. Then you\nwould not have to worry about these problems. What\nhappens if they accept a -- you know, a late petition?\nDoes it automatically toll retroactively for the -- for\nthe period after the due date and so forth?\nMR. OGDEN: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: None of those problems exist if you\n-- if you say it's pending when it's pending.\nMR. OGDEN: I think those problems are more\ncomplicated in a system like California's or North\nCarolina's which is an appellate system that involves an\nunreasonable delay standard than they are in a -- in a\nsystem that has clear time lines. And California and\nNorth Carolina, if they don't like the way it's playing\nout under their provisions, can simply create time\nlines --\nQUESTION: Mr. Ogden --\nQUESTION: Just so -- just so I understand your\nanswer. In the case that I put that I didn't quite get\nthe whole -- the California court says, you've waited 4\nyears. That's too late. How do I apply the statute of\nlimitations to that context or the pending rule that we're\ndiscussing?\nMR. OGDEN: I -- I believe there are about three\ndifferent ways that you can --\nQUESTION: And what is -- what is your\nsubmission as to how we ought to interpret the rule in\nthat instance?\nMR. OGDEN: My submission would be that until\nthe California Supreme Court indicates how long the time\nperiod is that -- that he would have had to file, the best\nthing to do is to look to evidence of other cases that\nhave been decided by California to determine what is an\nacceptable gap in the process.\nAnd that's why in this case the evidence is\nabsolutely overwhelming that the 4-and-a-half-month period\nthat the State relies on simply wasn't the basis for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court's decision.\nQUESTION: How is that? It seems to me the\nrecord is a blank on that, and with all this talk, if you\ndon't count those 4-and-a-half months, he's timely no --\nno matter whether it's discrete applications. So, what do\nwe do? He says, I never got that notice. And it's not\nestablished in the record whether he did or he didn't.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, the only evidence in the\nrecord is that he did not. He submitted a sworn statement\nto that effect in the California Supreme Court in his\npetition.\nBut as the Ninth Circuit said, there are two\npossible bases for the lack of diligence finding in the\nrecord. One is 5 years before he filed his initial claim.\nThe other is this 4-and-a-half-month period in which he\nsays and swears that he did not receive notice.\nThe -- when you look at the record of the minute\norders that have been entered by California on the very\nday and in the very weeks -- the California Supreme Court\n-- around when Mr. Saffold's case was dismissed, you see\nthat cases -- for example, the Davis case. There was an\n18-month gap between the decision in the court of appeal\nand the petition in the California Supreme Court, and the\nCalifornia Supreme Court simply denied it, which under the\nYlst standard, looking through, goes back to the merits\ndetermination before. No lack of diligence, no\nuntimeliness.\nIn the Sampson case, over 9 months had elapsed\nbetween the court of appeal decision and the supreme court\ndecision. Again, absolutely no indication of a lack of\ndiligence or untimeliness.\nIn the Viegas case, over 7 months elapsed\nbetween the court of appeal and the decision -- and the\npetition. No explanation from Mr. Viegas, as there wasn't\nfrom Davis and nothing meaningful from Sampson for the\ndelay again. And the Saenz case is another.\nSo, there are those four --\nQUESTION: Is -- is there any -- some\npossibility that those perhaps inconsistent rulings coming\nfrom the Supreme Court of California might be based on\nwhat Mr. Cross referred to as the division of opinion\nwithin that court as to whether they should give any sort\nof an explanation?\nMR. OGDEN: Your Honor, I think anything is\npossible because, as -- as somebody said, we're in a mind-\nreading mode here, and so certainly that's possible. And\nI can't stand here and tell you it is impossible that they\nsimply acted in an -- in an irrational and inconsistent\nfashion.\nThe fact is while Mr. Saffold submitted a -- an\nexplanation which, at least on the surface, has some\nappeal to it, none of these others did, and yet much\nlonger periods of time --\nQUESTION: That's not the basis on which the\nNinth Circuit decided the case. It did not resolve\nwhether, you know, the 4-and-a-half or the other one. It\n-- it did not do it. It just simply said, since the\nSupreme Court of California alternatively addressed the\nmerits, that's the end of it. And so you're -- you're not\ndefending their basis for -- for deciding the case?\nMR. OGDEN: I think it's somewhat unclear what\nthe Ninth Circuit's basis was, Your Honor. I concede\nthat. To the extent that the Ninth Circuit held that a --\na ruling on the merits would trump a clear finding by the\n-- by the California Supreme Court that the petition to it\nwas untimely, I think that would be an -- an incorrect\ninterpretation of the statute. That's my view.\nQUESTION: What would you say to the possibility\nthat we might certify the question to the California\nSupreme Court whether this case was dismissed because it\nwas untimely?\nMR. OGDEN: The critical question would be\nwhether the case was dismissed based on the gap between\nthe court of appeal and the supreme court as opposed to\nthe -- the portion that preceded the original filing in\nthe -- in the trial court which obviously could not make\nthe case stop pending once it began to pend.\nBut I believe that certification would not fit\nthe profile in California for certified questions. They\n-- they certify questions of law, and this is -- this is\nan --\nQUESTION: Have -- have any courts considering\nthis AEDPA statute applied it in the way Justice Scalia\nsuggests that we look at pending and place all the\nemphasis there and exclude all time after a decision by a\nState court until the next filing?\nMR. OGDEN: 11 courts of appeals have considered\nthat issue to this point, Your Honor, and all 11 have\nadopted the view that the entire period of time should be\ntolled.\nQUESTION: Were any of them dealing with a\nsystem like California's?\nMR. OGDEN: The Ninth Circuit in this case and\nin the Nino case previously, but no other -- no other --\nnone of the other cases really deal with that --\nQUESTION: Can we use Justice Scalia -- he just\nsuggested an idea that -- that -- if this is right\nfactually as to how it works. Suppose you go into the\ndistrict court -- the superior court, trial court. All\nright. Now I get a decision there. Now, I take it, under\nCalifornia law, I cannot file a complaint about how the\njudge decided it, i.e., an appeal, quotes, in any other\nsuperior court, but I can do it in a higher court. Am I\nright? Because they'll treat it as successive if I go to\nthe parallel level, but if I go to the next level, they\nwon't treat it as successive.\nMR. OGDEN: That's my understanding.\nQUESTION: But then if in fact I wait too long,\nI'm beyond a reasonable time.\nMR. OGDEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And so, to put in terms of exhausted,\nunexhausted as if he did -- as he did, you'd say the only\nunexhausted remedy you have left to you, once you're in\nthe superior court, is to go up, as long as you do it\nwithin a reasonable time. But once you exceed the\nreasonable time, you're out.\nMR. OGDEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. So, what we would have to\nsay is that that system, looking to the exhausted instead\nof the technical word appeal, we'd get to approximately\nthe same place, and then our issue would be, well, was\nthis beyond a reasonable time or not. And then I'd have\nto say maybe we don't know. We'd have to find out in some\nway or other. That -- that --\nMR. OGDEN: Well, I think the general\ndescription is fine and I think it's true that we don't\nknow whether it was considered unreasonable by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court.\nQUESTION: I mean, I can't see how we can accept\nthe Ninth Circuit's reasoning frankly because they said\nthe very fact that they say both, the very fact that they\nsay we'll consider it on the merits but it's untimely,\nthat that means that it wasn't untimely. Of course, they\ndidn't use the word untimely. They used a different word\nwhich is harder to understand.\nMR. OGDEN: Your Honor, I think that we -- it's\n-- while we don't know, I think that a fair reading of\nthis record would lead one to the conclusion that it was\nnot the 4-and-a-half months. When we have four other\ncases, two of them decided the same day, one of them\ndecided --\nQUESTION: But it's way beyond what any other\nState would have, isn't it? 4-and-a-half months? Unless\nthere's some excuse here that he didn't get the record or\nhe didn't know about it.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, North Carolina has an undue\ndelay standard. Massachusetts, until just very recently,\nas the First Circuit explained in the Curry case just last\nweek, previously had no time limit, has now imposed a 30-\nday time limit presumably to deal with some of these\nproblems. The times in other States vary. 4-and-a-half\nmonths is -- is somewhat longer than the certiorari time\nin this Court, but it's not by an entire order of\nmagnitude. And the point is that the California Supreme\nCourt routinely seems to reach the merits despite this\nperiod.\nAnd in this case we have a 5-year delay staring\nus in the face in which the only justification offered by\nMr. Saffold was that he needed to hire a private\ninvestigator to -- essentially to interview the jurors.\nThe magistrate judge in this case, applying the due\ndiligence standard of Federal law, which is in 2244 --\nQUESTION: This was a Federal magistrate?\nMR. OGDEN: The Federal magistrate, yes, Your\nHonor, in -- in this case applying the Federal due\ndiligence standard. Mr. Saffold suggested that the time\nshould be tolled for -- for the running of the entire\nperiod because he had not discovered these claims. And\nthe Federal magistrate, looking at it, said, well, you\nshould have discovered these claims long before. you\ndidn't exercise due diligence.\nI think looking at the face -- at the -- at the\njoint appendix at 38, looking at the face of the\napplication Mr. Saffold submitted to the California\nSupreme Court where he attempts to justify the 5 years on\nthat basis and notes, with respect to the 4-and-a-half\nmonths, that he only received notice the very day he\nfiled, the only reasonable interpretation is that they\nrelied on the 5 years, a period of time irrelevant to the\nquestion of whether review in the supreme court was\nunavailable. And therefore, it is -- it is -- it would be\nunreasonable for this Court to suppose that -- that the\nperiod was the 4-and-a-half months.\nThis is somewhat similar to the approach to\nquestions of -- of -- related to procedural bars that this\nCourt adopted and modified in the Coleman against Thompson\ncase where -- where an underlying State decision leaves\nreason to question whether the Federal bar is applicable,\nthis Court has gone ahead and decided the -- the merits of\nthe Federal claim because it's entirely within the power\nof the State, the State of California or in the Coleman v.\nThompson circumstance, to be clear about the fact that\nwhat was the period and when did it expire, or\nalternatively, simply like most States, to have a clear,\ndefinable period of time in which --\nQUESTION: Didn't the -- didn't the superior\ncourt here, or at least the magistrate did, made a\nspecific finding to the effect that the 4-month delay was\nnot excusable, that it was an excessive delay? Wasn't\nthere that finding below?\nMR. OGDEN: The magistrate did not find that he\nreceived notice earlier than he says. What the magistrate\nsaid was that he should have been more diligent in calling\nthe court and contacting them and so forth.\nQUESTION: But it was a finding that the 4-\nmonth period was the -- was a period of inexcusable delay.\nMR. OGDEN: He indicated -- suggested that he\nwould not --\nQUESTION: So, to say that that couldn't have\nbeen what the supreme court was thinking of strikes me as\nimplausible.\nMR. OGDEN: Your Honor, I'm not saying that it\ncouldn't be. I'm saying it's far less likely that it was.\nQUESTION: But that wasn't reviewed by the Ninth\nCircuit.\nMR. OGDEN: No. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit left\nopen the question of equitable tolling which depends on\nthat -- on that fact. And furthermore, again, it doesn't\ngo to whether he received notice. It's simply the opinion\nof the magistrate that he should have called the court or\nsent a letter to the court or done something within that\n4-and-a-half-month period.\nQUESTION: I do -- I do want, if I can, very\nquickly to get to the question that Mr. Cross said was\nvery difficult and you raise it at pages 24 and 25 of your\nbrief. You say what -- what happens if the -- under the\ntheory that the petitioner proposes, if the State files an\nappeal when the State has lost. And the Chief Justice\nsaid, well, that shouldn't be a problem because we can\nthen easily say that the application is still pending.\nHow long does the State have to appeal generally?\nMR. OGDEN: I believe it's 30 days in\nCalifornia.\nQUESTION: So, then -- so, then it seems to me\nthat isn't a problem. A, it's just 30 days, and B, you\ncan say that it's still pending. So, that's not a big\nproblem.\nMr. Cross, whose right of rebuttal we've\ndemolished, so I can't ask him, has said that that's a\nvery hard question.\nMR. OGDEN: Well, I think it's a very hard\nquestion for him because his -- his gap theory taken to\nits literal extreme, taken to -- to the application that\nit would -- that -- that gaps are not tolled, even in a --\nan appeals situation, would cause that entire period of\ntime on the State's clock to run.\nQUESTION: But why can't we easily say the\napplication is pending so long as the State has an\nappeal --\nMR. OGDEN: Well, that --\nQUESTION: -- prevail?\nMR. OGDEN: That would -- that would undermine\nthe so-called gap theory in every State but -- but\nCalifornia where typically you do have appeals on both\nsides. In California, you have a State appeal and a\nfunctional appeal on the petitioner's side. And so, the\nargument could be made -- I think it's a hyper-technical\nargument. I think it's an argument that's inconsistent\nwith the purpose of this statute, but you could make the\nhyper-technical argument that because California gives\nunequal rights to the two sides, an appeal on the one hand\nand a functional appeal on the other, we're going to treat\nthe functional appeal in a different way for Federal\npurposes.\nI would submit there is no way that Congress\nintended to take a functional appeal that has the purpose\nof -- of presenting claims that are required for\nexhaustion and said, we want to treat that differently\nbecause it's merely a functional appeal, not a real\nappeal. That makes no sense.\nAll of the reasons why tolling should apply in\nthe gaps prescribed by the State, the period the State\nbelieves is appropriate for the presentation of these\nclaims, the period the State believes prisoners should\nhave in order to prepare and present their claims, that\nwe're not going to toll that, the consequence of that will\nbe that petitioners will not wait for the transcript.\nThey will file their -- their motions in the -- in the\ncourt of appeal without transcripts. They will not\ndevelop their arguments well, and then those arguments\nwill finally be made for the first time effectively in the\nFederal court. That is not what was intended by the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Ogden.\nMr. Cross, you have 1 minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY A. CROSS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CROSS: I think the answer to Mr. Ogden,\nYour Honor, is that the reason would be that Congress was\nconcerned about undue delay. In the last 10 years before\nAEDPA was passed, over 80 bills were attempted to -- to\ndeal with this problem. And lack of diligence by\npetitioners was the main concern of Congress, and they\ndealt with that by writing into the statute the following\nphrase. 2244(d)(2) at page 3 of the blue brief. Quote,\nthe time during which a properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with\nrespect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending\nshall not be counted toward any limitation under this\nsubsection. They did not choose to use the -- the\nlanguage petition in 2263(b)(2), nor did they choose to\nuse the language in 2244(d)(1)(A) of the time for seeking\nsuch review. They chose application for the reason that\nJustice Scalia was talking about. They were concerned\nthat there would be undue delay in between applications.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cross.\n"
