CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

Stream.
Ms. Reid.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. REID: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court:
The alienage diversity statute provides that the
Federal courts have original jurisdiction in civil actions
between citizens of different States and citizens who are
subjects of a foreign State where the matter in
controversy exceeds $75,000. The question presented today
is whether respondent, Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure
Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands, qualifies as a subject of the
United Kingdom within the meaning of that statute.
Petitioner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, submits it clearly does.
It is well-settled that the term, citizens and
subjects, applies to corporations and not just natural
persons. It is also not controversial that a subject is
one who owes allegiance to and is under the protection of
a foreign State.
QUESTION: Is this a question of Federal law?
MS. REID: In terms of looking to the matter of
the subject?
QUESTION: In determining who is a citizen or
subject of a foreign State, or whether a corporation in
this instance is a citizen or subject? Is that a Federal
law question?
MS. REID: Yes, Your Honor, we would submit it
is in the first instance, but in saying that we must then
look at the nature of the relationship and look at the
foreign State which is asserting the sovereignty, and
certainly that is a matter that we should consider
carefully. In this case, the United Kingdom has clearly
expressed its sovereignty over respondent and over the
other residents and corporations of its overseas
territories.
QUESTION: When you say the United Kingdom has
expressed its sovereignty, Ms. Reid, do you mean that
you're looking at their statutes, or that their diplomatic
representatives have made a representation?
MS. REID: Both, both the fact that they have
intervened as an amicus in this and in other cases, but
also, particularly in the case of respondent, if one looks
at the BVI constitution enacted in 1976, it is enacted as
a result of the act of parliament and the order of
parliament, and it reserves expressly all power to the
Crown ultimately, and it is only from the Crown that the
law is then delegated to the elected legislative council.
Each member of whom must swear allegiance to the Crown and
to the Queen.
The United Kingdom reserves the right to review,
approve, and ultimately disapprove any statute that is
enacted in the British Virgin Islands, which is a right
that they do exercise. In this case, therefore, the
enabling or enacting statute which, under which respondent
is incorporated, is a direct result of the authority
granted from the Crown, so I would argue it is not just a
matter of the diplomatic relationship and the fact that
the United Kingdom is the external face for the British
Virgin Islands in terms of matters of defense and
international relations, but also the fact that all law is
derived ultimately from the Crown.
QUESTION: Ms. Reid, every corporation must be
formed under the law of some sovereign, and if that's
right, a corporation just can't generate itself.
Is there any corporation that is formed under
the law of some sovereign other than the United States not
included within 1332, or is this just a very simple case
where every foreign corporation of course is organized
under the law of some State, and therefore would qualify.
Does your case involve anything more than that?
MS. REID: I would say, Your Honor, in 99
percent of the cases, that you're right. I suppose it is
conceivable that you would have corporations organized by
someone who declares they are sovereign of some island
somewhere, but no one recognizes them as a sovereign, and
the United States would say, we know nothing of this
person, and know they can't be --
QUESTION: Then the United States would also say
that that's not a corporation.
MS. REID: Right, exactly.
QUESTION: So I think you could say in 100
percent of the cases if we acknowledge it as a
corporation, it will have been formed under the law of
some State.
MS. REID: I would agree, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And I suppose even as to natural
persons in this sort of eccentric island in the real
world, if we did not recognize their claim to individual
sovereignty or nationality, in the real world I assume
they would be subject to some other national sovereign and
they'd by that virtue, by virtue of that be swept up under
the term, citizen or subject, wouldn't they?
MS. REID: I would agree.
QUESTION: Yes.
QUESTION: Let's assume -- and I'm not sure that
this is an actual proposition of international law, that a
subject of a sovereign has a special duty to obey the laws
of that sovereign. A United States citizen in China has a
special obligation to obey the laws of the United States
that a British subject does not. Does this corporation
have a special obligation to obey the laws of Great
Britain in any greater degree than it has the obligation
to obey the laws of any other sovereign to whom it might
become --
MS. REID: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: -- subject?
MS. REID: An analogy, though, not completely
perfect, but it -- you know, JPMorgan Chase is a
corporation organized under the laws of the State of New
York. It obviously has to follow the laws of the State of
New York, but it also has obligations that it has to
follow under our Federal law.
QUESTION: Yes.
MS. REID: Similarly, a corporation set up under
the laws of applicable overseas territories in the first
in stance, of course, must follow the laws of their
legislative district, but they must also abide by agreed-
upon laws and conventions of the United Kingdom, and that
is specifically an issue in the Caribbean, where there are
certain financial disclosure, which is mandated in part
through the relationship, constitutional relationship
between the United Kingdom --
QUESTION: Where can we document the proposition
that you've just stated? What do I look to?
MS. REID: To a certain extent, the treaty,
that -- for example the Narcotics Enforcement Treaty.
There are also the United Kingdom -- the one I'm thinking
of is their recent overruling on the homosexuality, which
we cited only to a newspaper article in our brief, will
demonstrate that.
The best sites are the web sites for the BVI and
for the United Kingdom, which detail the relationship
between these two entities, also the white paper we cited
to Your Honor written in, I believe, 1999, goes into great
detail about the relationships between the overseas
territories and the United Kingdom, what the authority and
sovereignty the United Kingdom has --
QUESTION: No more established authority like
Blackstone, or --
MS. REID: Not that we have cited to Your Honor,
though in many ways there are parliamentary debates that
you can access concerning -- which are referenced in the
white papers -- concerning the relationships between the
overseas territories and the Queen, which were quite
reminiscent of the debates before the American Revolution
in terms of virtual representation and --
QUESTION: If we were dealing with a private
individual rather than a corporation, do you think there
could be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this
statute?
MS. REID: In very, very rare instances, and
those instances are where the individual had either
renounced their citizenship, which has on occasion
occurred, or where they have been, you know, exiled, and
have not yet acquired citizenship somewhere else, and we
would submit that the cases cited by the Matimak Court
deal with those kinds of statelessness.
QUESTION: Suppose that kind of person that
Justice O'Connor and you just discussed, a true stateless
person, is temporarily in a port of Australia, San
Francisco, or Monterey, Mexico, can it be said
consistently with the statute here in question that they
are at least temporarily subject to the laws of Australia
while they are there, because they're stateless and they
have no other higher obligation, so they're then
subject --
MS. REID: No. I would submit that what subject
to you must mean is that you have an allegiance to a
sovereign, and the sovereign in turn has an obligation to
you, including protection.
QUESTION: It's not subject to. The phrase is
subject of, isn't it?
MS. REID: Yes, of a --
QUESTION: Everybody living in a country is
subject to the laws of that country, and presumably to the
Government of that country, but they are not necessarily a
subject of that country.
MS. REID: That is true, Your Honor.
QUESTION: So there can be stateless persons who
are not within the clause.
MS. REID: Yes.
QUESTION: And the reason you take that
position, I take it, is that the impetus for the
constitutional grant was in effect to keep countries from
getting mad, rather than for purposes of extending
jurisdiction as such to everyone who one might want to sue
in a Federal court.
MS. REID: Right. I mean, we have argued that
there were two impetuses. One is the prevention of
foreign entanglements by providing a neutral Federal
forum, and the other was the promotion of commerce.
QUESTION: I must say, I didn't understand what
you mean by foreign entanglements. Are you talking about
the foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us
against?
MS. REID: The --
QUESTION: I mean, like alliances with France,
or things like that? What --
MS. REID: No. The foreign entanglements, when
one looks back at the Framers' discussion, seem to
envision that if the British debt could not be collected
we might find ourselves back in another war.
QUESTION: We don't want to make them mad.
MS. REID: We didn't want to make them mad.
QUESTION: Okay.
MS. REID: That, I think, was the entanglement
that they were worried about.
QUESTION: It's a strange term for it, then.
MS. REID: And just briefly on the issue of the
promotion of commerce, I wanted to make the point that
JPMorgan Chase Bank and the financial market, you know,
considered the Matimak decisions as ones who have
potentially very deleterious effects on international
commerce.
QUESTION: Well, why? Aren't New York courts --
this is not a question of saying for our corporation you
can't enter U.S. court. They can enter a New York State
court, and those courts are pretty savvy about commercial
matters, are they not?
MS. REID: Absolutely, and I practice before
them frequently, but the perception on the part of
foreign -- foreigners is that the Federal system is one in
which procedures are uniform across the country, and a --
with predictability, perhaps, that is more a matter of
perception than of reality.
QUESTION: I know Alabamans who are afraid of
New York courts.
(Laughter.)
MS. REID: And vice versa.
QUESTION: But it is a little different from
what it was in the days of the post revolution, when the
British creditor said State courts are simply going to let
them collect on their debts.
MS. REID: That's true. In this particular
case, the reason in large part that it was decided to go
into Federal courts is simply because we wanted to get as
speed a resolution as possible, and the State court system
has interlocutory appeals, which is just the way the
system works, and -- but it does often lead to additional
delay and we had noteholders who were insistent that we
try and get our collateral back as soon as possible.
QUESTION: Anyway, you -- I think no one has
suggested a dynamic interpretation of 1332, so that if the
original rationale is not as strong today as it was then,
that somehow the meaning of 1332 would change.
MS. REID: No. I think it's -- the -- clearly
the United Kingdom at this point is, I guess one could say
at best, annoyed by this continuing refusal to recognize
their sovereignty over these types of entities, and the
fact is that you know, they have submitted an amicus brief
here, several other amicus briefs, two diplomatic notes,
so that the fear of the Framers of having an entanglement
of some sort with an ally is still, I think, valid today.
QUESTION: No other circuit has followed the
Second Circuit, have they?
MS. REID: No. The Third Circuit has split
explicitly. The Fourth and the Seventh Circuit have also
disagreed, though not -- they didn't discuss Matimak, and
one of them was earlier than Matimak, but no, there is no
other circuit that has followed this rule.
If the --
QUESTION: You wish to reserve the rest of your
time?
MS. REID: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Reid.
Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The United States submits that corporations
organized under the United Kingdom overseas territories
are citizens or subjects of a foreign State for purposes
of alienage diversity jurisdiction. We reach that
conclusion based on the plain language of 1332. Section
1332's operative term, subject, describes a personal
entity that is amenable to foreign authority in the sense
that it owes allegiance to that foreign State and is
entitled to the protection of that foreign State. That
term quite clearly embraces a corporation created by a
foreign State. This Court recognized that principle in
Steamship Company v. Tugman 120 years ago.
The crucial issue in this case is whether the
United Kingdom exercises sufficient sovereign authority
over the British Virgin Islands such that citizens and
corporations can be said to be subject to the United
Kingdom's rules, and we think the answer to that is
clearly yes. The United States expressly recognizes the
United Kingdom's sovereignty over the British Virgin
Islands. We do so through treaties such as the Consulate
Convention that we have with the United Kingdom. We also
recognize it through our diplomatic relations with the
United Kingdom. Now, we fully support the United
Kingdom's claim here of sovereignty over the British
Virgin Islands.
In addition, if the Court needs to look further,
and we think it does not, it's clear from the British
Virgin Islands' constitution that the United Kingdom has
retained its sovereignty over the British Virgin Islands.
That constitution expressly states that the United Kingdom
reserves full power to exercise and pass laws for the good
government, order, and peace of the British Virgin
Islands.
We think the language of section 1332
conclusively resolves this case, but if the Court needs to
look further still, then we think the policies that
underlie section 1332 further buttress the conclusion that
we reach.
QUESTION: Mr. Minear, what if the -- say, the
U.K. takes one position and makes a representation, but
the State Department, our State Department disagrees.
MR. MINEAR: The --
(Slide.)
QUESTION: Then what sort of an action should
our courts take?
MR. MINEAR: We think that you should defer on
the United States views on these matters. As far as
disagreements between the United Kingdom and the United
States, that's a matter for the State Department to deal
with, but this Court's own decisions, cases such as Jones
v. The United States, which is at 137 U.S. 202, explicitly
state that questions of sovereignty are political
questions that are entrusted to the political branches.
QUESTION: Well then, if you were to submit the
views of the State Department in a case like that, no
matter what else there is in the record, we should accept
the views of the State Department?
MR. MINEAR: Your cases suggest that that is the
result that would follow.
QUESTION: Yes, but do you have a position --
MR. MINEAR: Yes, we do. To answer pointedly,
yes, we do believe that you should defer to the United
States views, because oftentimes on the question -- let me
distinguish here that the question of subject is, of
course, the meaning of that term is a legal question that
this Court would interpret according to its normal
practices, but the question of whether a foreign entity is
a foreign State is a question that is properly entrusted
to the political branches.
We believe that the Second Circuit's decision
stands alone here because it is quite plainly wrong. The
Third Circuit has expressly rejected it, and the Fourth
Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have not followed it.
Under these circumstances, we think it is appropriate for
the Court to reverse the decision below and remand the
case for further proceedings.
QUESTION: Can you comment on the stateless
person problem, not a legal person?
MR. MINEAR: But an individual. Yes, we can
conceive that there can be such a thing as a stateless
person, and we cannot believe that section 1332 by its
plain language would reach a person who is not a citizen
or a subject of a foreign State. Pure alienage is not
sufficient. Nevertheless, the class of stateless persons
is vanishingly small, and as was pointed out in the
earlier discussion, the idea of a stateless corporation is
an oxymoron, as Judge Altimari had stated.
QUESTION: But there are some U.S. citizens who
don't have access to the Federal court because they're not
a citizen of any State. Let's take a U.S. citizen who is
residing in Switzerland.
MR. MINEAR: That is correct. That is correct,
and again, we think the courts have consistently answered
these questions by adherence to the plain language of the
jurisdictional provisions. For instance, for many years,
until Congress dealt with the issue, citizens of the
District of Columbia were not entitled to ordinary
diversity jurisdiction, but these are matters that we
think are best resolved by looking closely at the language
that Congress has provided in the jurisdictional
provisions.
If there are no further questions, thank you.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.
Mr. Albert, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG J. ALBERT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ALBERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There are two statutes at issue here, both of
which have plain language. Section 1332 of title 28 says
that diversity jurisdiction extends only to citizens or
citizens and subjects, and it does not extend to all
aliens. The British Nationality Act of 1981 defines those
persons whom the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland views as its citizens or subjects, and
natural persons who are living within the British
Dependent Territories do not fall within the category of
being British Citizens.
There is a special class, a subclass that is
delegated to those people. They are British Dependent
Territory citizens, or British Overseas Territories
citizens, and this is an important distinction, because
they do not have the full measure of rights that any
English citizen would have.
QUESTION: You're now relying on English law, I
take it.
MR. ALBERT: I'm referring to English law, yes.
QUESTION: Yes. I think that creates some
difficulty for United States courts, particularly when the
U.K. is making representations here as to one point, then
you tell us we have to read English law, which we're much
less familiar with, of course, than American law.
MR. ALBERT: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Under Rule
44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court can
look to any source for finding where --
QUESTION: I realize that. It's not that we're
somehow disqualified from it, but it makes it a much more
difficult inquiry.
MR. ALBERT: It would be a much more difficult
inquiry had the United Kingdom actually cited to any
statute or any case ever decided in any English court
anywhere on the subject, but it is --
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Albert, even if the British
Nationality can be read as saying that corporations formed
in the British Virgin Islands are not citizens, it doesn't
say they're not subjects of the United Kingdom, does it?
MR. ALBERT: Well, actually, the British
Nationality Act carves out classes of citizens, and
classes of subjects, and persons who are neither citizens
nor subjects, so in fact it --
QUESTION: I just didn't find anything that
indicated to me that a corporation formed in the British
Virgin Island was not a subject of the U.K., and we are
dealing here with a brief filed by the U.K. that says they
are subjects, so what do we --
MR. ALBERT: Well, I think that the question
here is whether the deference should be unyielding to a
litigation and advocacy position which the British
Government puts forth in its briefs versus the substantive
basis for that position which one would find in a statute.
QUESTION: Just looking at it from an American,
U.S. perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects,
and the fact that it is a corporation formed in the
British Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a
subject of a foreign nation under our own statute.
MR. ALBERT: Respectfully, Justice O'Connor, I
think that the conclusion ought to be different, because
there is nothing with -- the first step in the inquiry is,
what would 1332(a)(2) have to say about corporations, and
we know that 1332(a)(2) is a reference to citizens or
subjects which is consistently -- which before the Letson
fiction was adopted had resulted in severe conflict over
whether there was jurisdiction for corporations at all.
What this Court did in Letson was adopted the
fiction not that the corporations were citizens or
subjects, but that the corporations would be deemed to be
citizens or subjects by virtue of the imputed citizenship
of its shareholders and, applying the same principle here,
you would impute the citizenship of the -- the citizenship
of natural persons resident within the British Virgin
Islands to a British Virgin Islands --
QUESTION: That's going back to a law that has
long since become obsolete. A corporation within the
United States is a citizen of the State in which it's
incorporated and where it has its principal place of
business. We don't look to the citizenship of the
shareholders any more. Why should there be such a
tremendous disparity between our modern view of what a
U.S. corporation is and the rest of the world when we
don't even really think of the corporation as an entity in
itself but say it's stuck by what its shareholder
citizenship is.
MR. ALBERT: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,
1332(c) does not say that corporations are citizens of
their States. It says that for purposes of diversity they
are deemed to be citizens of these States. It is a
counting rule, not a citizenship rule, and hence, the
Letson fiction still obtains. All that Congress did when
it adopted the 1332(c) language was to restrict the scope
of diversity jurisdiction by providing a second political
jurisdiction, principal place of business, which would
further limit the number of diversity cases which were
appearing in Federal courts.
This Court has never held that corporations were
political citizens or political subjects. Only 1332(c)
deems them to be so, and taking that a step further, it is
Congress' choice, because Congress' language in 1332(a)(2)
is that only citizens or subjects -- it does not use the
word aliens or anything broader -- are subject to
diversity jurisdiction.
QUESTION: Are you saying those words cover only
human individuals and not corporations?
MR. ALBERT: For 1332(a)(2), humans, then
applying the 1332(c) presumption, that would bring
corporations within the scope of diversity jurisdiction.
QUESTION: Well, 1332(a) does use the term,
aliens at the very end.
MR. ALBERT: Yes, there is a reference to it,
but not in the provision of 1332(a)(2) on the extension of
that dispute between citizens of a State and citizens or
subjects of a foreign State, and in fact, Mr. Chief
Justice, Congress in fact had used the word, aliens, the
broader word, in the original enactment, in the Judiciary
Act of 1789, but Congress abandoned that language when it
revised the statute in 1875.
QUESTION: Is a Spanish corporation -- as I
say -- is that -- does that come within 1332 jurisdiction,
a corporation formed in Scotland?
MR. ALBERT: In Scotland, yes, because a --
because the Scottish people, the English and Welsh people,
and the people of Northern Ireland all are citizens of the
Metropolitan United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.
QUESTION: Well, my problem is if -- take
some -- the British Virgin Islands, a place that's still
held in something like colonial status, that you say that
Scotland, which has a great deal more independence,
belongs to the U.K. in the sense that it is a subject of
the U.K., but the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman
Islands, that have less independence, are not subjects?
That may be something a lawyer could understand, but I
don't think it makes much sense, does it?
MR. ALBERT: I think that the distinction is, no
one is disputing here that the British Virgin Islands is
subordinate to the United Kingdom, no one is disputing
that its people ultimately are answerable to the authority
of the United Kingdom, but that simply goes --
QUESTION: Does it make them subject --
subjects?
MR. ALBERT: Subject to, not subject of, and
that is why the British Nationality Act is so important
here.
QUESTION: If it's so important, I guess then
maybe corporations incorporated in Scotland are not
citizens and subjects either, because it doesn't say
anything about corporations, does it?
MR. ALBERT: No, Justice Breyer.
QUESTION: Wouldn't people then be surprised if
it doesn't say anything, if we said that Scottish
corporations weren't citizens, or -- in fact, wouldn't the
people who live in these islands be a little surprised if
the Supreme Court were to say, you're not nationals? How
does it work? This is not an act that refers to
corporations.
MR. ALBERT: The proper allegation in a case
like this would be that a corporation is incorporated
under the laws of Scotland and is therefore a citizen or a
subject of the United Kingdom.
QUESTION: And the reason that they are but
these people aren't is?
MR. ALBERT: Is because England, Wales,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland, along with the Channel
Islands, are the constituent parts of the Metropolitan
United Kingdom. That is the Government with whom we
maintain a direct relationship, and when we treaty with
them, we -- our treaties are binding as to that nation and
those persons who are within those political subdivisions.
QUESTION: As of English law, the reason that --
although their law says, I guess, the counselor law, the
diplomatic manual,the thing that says you have to swear
allegiance if you're in the British foreign -- you know,
you're in the British Virgin Islands, all the laws are
subject to British authority and so forth, so the reason,
in your opinion, despite all those things they list in
their brief, that makes it very, very similar, the reason
that a corporation incorporated in Wales is a citizen of
the United Kingdom or subject of the United Kingdom but
these are not, because it's the British Virgin Islands,
is?
MR. ALBERT: Because when parliament enacts a
law of general applicability within the United Kingdom,
its applicability is to those four jurisdictions that I've
mentioned, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,
along with in some instances the Channel Islands, but it
does not, of its force, extend to the British Overseas
Territories, the British dependent -- what's now known as
the British Overseas Territories. They are regulated
separately.
When we enter into a treaty with the United
Kingdom on any subject whatsoever, unless our treaty
specifically extends to those territories, what happens in
those territories is unaffected by our treaty, so it is
not a two-way street of reciprocal obligations within the
United Kingdom. All of their powers of these
jurisdictions are derived from the United Kingdom, but
they don't have any reciprocal rights, and that is
especially true of the natural people who live within
these territories.
The natural people who live within these
territories have no right of abode within the -- have no
right of abode within the Metropolitan United Kingdom. If
you call them citizens or subjects, and in fact the United
Kingdom uses both terms now, it no longer adheres to the
old concept of subjects, they cannot travel to the United
Kingdom --
QUESTION: Are they stateless people?
MR. ALBERT: They are not stateless people at
all. They do have a State. Their State, their
overarching State is the United Kingdom, which extends to
them defense protection. The United Kingdom protects them
in an international sense, but they do have -- and in that
sense they a State.
QUESTION: They are British -- their State is
the U.K.?
MR. ALBERT: They are just -- they are very
similar to what our territorial residents would have been
before we extended citizenship.
QUESTION: They are subject of and to the United
States, I assume, the residents in the U.S. Territories.
MR. ALBERT: Residents of U.S. Territories are
now citizens by virtue of an amendment to the Immigration
and --
QUESTION: What were they before they were
citizens?
MR. ALBERT: They were nationals and natives.
They had no status. They were very much --
QUESTION: They were not stateless, were they?
MR. ALBERT: No, they were not.
QUESTION: And so why isn't a corporation
organized in the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman
Islands -- why is that stateless? There's only one State
it can belong to, because these are not independent
sovereigns. The BVI is not an independent sovereign.
What State does that -- you tell me that the individual
would belong to the U.K. What does a corporation belong
to?
MR. ALBERT: I do not advocate the position that
the Matimak -- the Matimak Court adopted that these
corporations were stateless. I do not think that that is
essential to the determination below, and I think that it
was a poor choice of words. There is a State involved.
The United Kingdom granted to the British Virgin Islands
the authority to adopt a Companies Act, just as United
States territories have authority under statute of
Congress to adopt their own incorporation laws. That does
not mean that the corporations that are incorporated
within the British Virgin Islands are subjects of, rather
than subject to --
QUESTION: They belong to some State, and either
they belong to the U.K., or they belong to something that
isn't a sovereign, or they're stateless. It's got to be
one of those three, so which is it?
MR. ALBERT: They belong to the United Kingdom,
but that does not answer the statutory question at issue
here, because even if they belong to a kingdom, even if
they belong to the United Kingdom, that does not make the
citizens or subjects of the kingdom. You can be an alien
and subject -- an alien to the United States, subject to
the kingdom, yet not be a citizen or subject of the United
Kingdom, and that was Congress' choice to make.
Congress --
QUESTION: Could I ask, the word subject in the
statute just tracks the word subject in the Constitution,
and I -- wasn't the status of the colonists before our
Revolution precisely the same as the status of the British
Virgin Islands?
MR. ALBERT: Justice Scalia --
QUESTION: Which would lead me to the inquiry
whether the -- even the revolutionaries considered
themselves subjects of the British Crown. If they
weren't, I guess they weren't engaging in a revolution
really, were they?
(Laughter.)
MR. ALBERT: The laughter from the audience in
fact focuses the point here, because that was the
fundamental shift in the understanding of the colonists
and their relationship to the British Government. Before
the Revolution, the old idea of subjectship was that it
was permanent. One could never abandon one's subjectship.
The political idea during the Revolution was a shift
toward the idea of volitional allegiance.
That is, that once the Crown abdicated parts of
its protective authority, then the people no longer were
subjects of the Crown, and the legal basis for the legal
philosophers during the formation -- in the 1774 to 1776
period was to justify how it was that we could throw off
our bonds to the British Crown, and the way in which they
justified it was to say that the King had abdicated, and
therefore, in the words of the Declaration of
Independence, we were no longer his subjects. What were
we? Well, there was a --
QUESTION: But we had been. We had been.
MR. ALBERT: Oh, we had been. We had been.
QUESTION: We occupied the same status in those
days as the British --
QUESTION: Why wasn't that status the one that's
comparable to the status of citizens in the Virgin Islands
here --
MR. ALBERT: Justice --
QUESTION: -- because they're not claiming that
they've been abandoned by the Crown here.
MR. ALBERT: Justice Stevens, there are two
places in which that abandonment can come about. One is
by the people themselves declaring themselves independent,
they saying that those bonds have been thrown off.
QUESTION: Of course, that hasn't happened here.
MR. ALBERT: It certainly has not happened here,
but there is another way, because when nations adopt the
idea of volitional allegiance, the new idea of what a
subject is, then the nation itself can change its laws to
determine what the status of its people are. Here, the
United Kingdom has changed the status of its persons. The
United Kingdom has moved away from that 18th and 16th,
17th century view of what a subject is and moved to our
view of what a subject is, and the British Nationality Act
explains exactly what these people are.
QUESTION: The British Nationality Act has
nothing to do with corporations.
MR. ALBERT: But the British Nationality Act
does have to do with what the people in the British Virgin
Islands are --
QUESTION: And the other thing they --
MR. ALBERT: -- and then applies --
QUESTION: I understand your point there, but --
so I'm cutting you off, but they say that in these places
the Queen appoints the Governor, the Governor is
responsible for internal security, public service, and
court administration, but all the laws they pass in these
places are subject to review by the Foreign Office, the
Commonwealth Office, and then the Queen in Council, which
is a group of particular individuals, that the Legislative
Council swears its allegiance to the Crown before it takes
place, and so they haven't just discarded this place at
all. They've sort of treated it as we might treat a city
inside a State, or some other kind of semi-independent
entity, and you say to that, what?
MR. ALBERT: Or more particularly, as we would
treat one of our territories, because the ability of
Congress to legislate for its --
QUESTION: You mean, people in our Territories
like Puerto Rico, let's say, which is a Commonwealth --
MR. ALBERT: Yes.
QUESTION: -- or Samoa, they are not subjects of
the United States?
MR. ALBERT: They are not subjects of the United
States.
QUESTION: They don't owe their allegiance to
the United States, and they're not subject to its laws.
Which is it?
MR. ALBERT: The position that has been
advocated here, and I think that the -- and that has been
uniformly advanced by the scholars is that citizenship
versus subjectship is simply -- are simply two sides of
the same coin determin -- describing what the relationship
is of one in either a democracy or a monarchy, and what
has happened in the United Kingdom is that as the country
has evolved from a strict monarchy to a constitutional
monarchy with democratic principles, that the ideas of
subjectship have evolved, and the idea of citizenship has
been incorporated into their law. This --
QUESTION: Do you feel some discomfort in
saying, well, that's what the U.K. law is, and you told us
that what the Companies Act means, when U.K. itself is
telling this Court, you've got it all wrong? You're
standing before the Court as an interpreter of U.K. law.
You're riding the whole -- your whole case on what U.K.
law is, and yet the U.K. tells us, you read it wrong.
MR. ALBERT: I would have thought that had the
United Kingdom had a statute on which it could rely, or
any decision on which it could rely, it would cite them.
The only authority to which it cites in the record at all
is in the lodging --
QUESTION: Which -- go ahead.
MR. ALBERT: Is in the lodging at page L31, an
excerpt from its diplomatic manual which describes the
various categories under the British Nationality Act.
The other authority upon which it relies are its
diplomatic notes in which it asserts that it views these
people as its subjects, but if you look to each citation
of that -- those diplomatic notes, they come not in a
submission to a court, asking a court to determine what
British law is, but in a protest to the State Department
after a case has been decided saying, we don't like the
decision of this court.
Now, I've cited to the -- I've certainly cited
to the text of the British Nationality Act which tells you
where the diplomatic -- where the diplomatic manual
derives its basis.
QUESTION: Is it a fair summary to say that it's
a litigating position and therefore we do not owe it
Chevron deference?
MR. ALBERT: I think it is a pure advocacy
position, and it does not deserve --
QUESTION: Are you arguing for what we might
call a variable definition of subject, that VI residents
are subjects of Great Britain in some cases and not
others?
That is to say, you said earlier that the U.K.
could make a treaty binding on VI residents, VI citizens,
so that you can be subject of Great Britain in some
instances and not others.
MR. ALBERT: Justice Kennedy, the U.K. itself --
QUESTION: If I characterize your argument that
way, would that be a proper characterization of your
argument?
MR. ALBERT: I think that at the second level of
Matimak inquiry, when -- that the Court would necessarily
have to inquire as to whether or not a person is or is not
a subject, and I think that I would be -- I am willing to
concede that Britain could change its statute for general
purposes or for limited purposes so as to give to these
territorial citizens the right to proceed in American
courts, and we would defer to that simply by reason of --
simply for reasons for international comity.
QUESTION: But doesn't that potential indicate
that there is sovereignty, because --
MR. ALBERT: Once --
QUESTION: -- isn't sovereignty the capacity to
exercise power and authority?
MR. ALBERT: Sovereignty is that power. The
question is whether or not they are subjects.
I'll give you an example.
QUESTION: They are subjects because of the
potential of the exercise of that power.
MR. ALBERT: The land that sits in the middle of
London at Leicester Square, the famous Tolk v. Moxie Land,
is subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, but
that does not make the land a subject, and so the mere
fact that the United Kingdom adopts legislation which
regulates behavior of its people, both within the
metropolitan United Kingdom and within its territories,
does not mean that the people within its territories are
subjects for purposes of 1332, and I say that especially
in light of the fact that as we stand here today the
United Kingdom has adopted a new statute which has not yet
come into force, because a statutory instrument has not
yet been signed for it, which will render the British
Territories' citizens to be British citizens, giving those
British citizens now the right of abode within the United
Kingdom, and that will happen in the future. It probably
will happen soon, maybe in a matter of months, maybe in a
matter of years, but it has not happened yet, and we
determine subject matter jurisdiction as of the time of
the commencement of --
QUESTION: How does that affect a corporation?
You're talking about what will be the status of
individuals.
MR. ALBERT: I think that a -- that applying --
that the proper way to apply the Letson principle here is
that a British Virgin Islands Corporation should never be
subject to diversity jurisdiction precisely because the
presumption is that its shareholders have opted for
British Virgin Islands status rather than opted for
British status.
QUESTION: And that would be the case -- it
would be -- the Congress would be immobile as well. In
order to make -- if I follow your argument correctly, in
order to make a BVI corporation subject to 1332
jurisdiction, there would have to be a constitutional
amendment, because the Constitution uses the same words
for a citizen or subject -- citizen or subject.
MR. ALBERT: The Second Circuit did not reach
the constitutional --
QUESTION: That's what I'm putting to you,
because the statute uses the same term, citizens or
subjects.
MR. ALBERT: I do not think that there is a
presumption in this Court that the use of the same
language in Article 3 and in title 28 means that the
statute has --
QUESTION: Well, tell me what subject means
within Article 3 that it doesn't mean within 1332 and why
a court should interpret it -- interpret them differently.
MR. ALBERT: Because if you look to the
Judiciary Act of 1789, which was adopted nearly
contemporaneously, Congress used the broader language,
alien, rather than the narrower language, citizen or
subject, and --
QUESTION: That's not -- the Constitution says
citizen or subject, doesn't it?
MR. ALBERT: That's correct, it does, and --
QUESTION: What does it mean -- what does
subject mean within the Constitution, within Article 3, as
it reads?
MR. ALBERT: It would be mere speculation on my
part to suggest what it was that they meant, since this
was one of the least debated provisions of the
Constitution.
QUESTION: But you're urging a certain statutory
interpretation, and you said, well, maybe it has a
different meaning, the word subject, in the Constitution,
so I'm asking you to tell me what could be those different
meanings.
MR. ALBERT: I think that it is entirely
possible that in 1787 Congress -- the Convention intended
to extend the grant of authority to the full measure of
diversity jurisdiction over cases involving all
foreigners, but the reason that I don't think that they
focused on the issue was because in 1787 there really were
not these cases of -- there were not a lot of cases,
probably no cases in which there were people who lacked
subjectship yet nevertheless were foreigners.
With respect to these trading colonies in
particular, the people who were involved in the mercantile
trade involving these Caribbean colonies were not people
who were resident within those colonies --
QUESTION: What about Canadians? Until Canada
domesticated its constitution, I suppose for most of the
19th Century Canadians were not subjects of the Crown?
MR. ALBERT: I think Canadians were subjects of
the Crown by virtue of the fact that they were in a
settler colony rather than in a plantation, a plantation
colony, and the -- one of the difficulties of the British
law of that entire era is that it never really had a
uni -- it never had a uniform picture of who its persons
were, and what the relationship was between the Crown and
each one of the different types of colonies that were
created, and it was very, very difficult for the -- it was
very difficult for Britain, because Britain had different
types of colonies which promoted different types of
British interests, and therefore it created different
types of Governments within them, and created different
statuses with respect to immigration and migration to
Europe for those people.
QUESTION: So among the subjects, or -- well,
the entities that are under U.K. sovereignty, which are
those are subjects and which of them are not?
MR. ALBERT: The ones which are certainly not
subjects right now are those which are the British
Overseas Territories, which include the British Virgin
Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Turks and
Caicos --
QUESTION: Which ones are? Which ones are?
MR. ALBERT: Pardon?
QUESTION: Which ones are?
MR. ALBERT: The Isle of Man, the Channel
Islands are British -- are British citizens, and --
QUESTION: I didn't ask citizen, I said,
subjects.
MR. ALBERT: Oh, British subjects, sorry.
British subjects, and --
QUESTION: How about the Falklands?
MR. ALBERT: The Falklands -- the Falklands,
those residents are not British citizens. They are
British Overseas -- Overseas Territories citizens.
QUESTION: How about Leicester Square?
(Laughter.)
MR. ALBERT: It has no status whatsoever,
because it is property, not a person.
Thank you.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Albert.
Ms. Reid, you have 6 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. REID: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
this Court:
I will try to be brief. I would like to
separate the inquiry between corporations and then address
natural persons. Corporations are incorporated through
the laws of their legislative district. The United
Kingdom's brief details quite clearly how the corporations
are incorporated, rather like our States, corporations in
Northern Ireland are incorporated under the laws of
Northern Ireland. As I understand respondent's argument,
that would make them stateless entities, because they are
not actually incorporated in Scotland, Wales, or the
United Kingdom. Clearly, that is an absurd result, given
the presence of the British --
QUESTION: I think his answer was that if
they're formed under Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland,
they're okay, but if they're formed under BVI, they're
not.
MS. REID: Right. I think he may have
inadvertently been in error, because the Northern Ireland
corporations are actually incorporated under a different
law than those of the ones in England, but the point is
the same. All of these entities incorporate under their
own individual quasi State or district law, all subject to
the Crown, and they all should be analyzed in the
identical way. They are all subject to and subjects of
the United Kingdom.
In terms of the natural citizens, I just wanted
to point -- the British Nationality Act, of course, has no
applications to corporations, and the analysis that
somehow we should adopt the old Letson rule is
inapplicable both because it's United Kingdom law, we have
no learning -- I mean, United States law, no learning on
what -- how the United Kingdom would do it, but it seems
sensible to adopt the more modern view, but the 1981
Nationality Act, interestingly, in schedule 5 to section
41, in terms of naturalization and becoming a citizen or a
British Overseas Citizen, or a British, what was then
known as Dependent Territory citizen, you're required to
take the following oath of allegiance: I, name, swear by
Almighty God that on becoming a British Dependent
Territory citizen I will be faithful and bear true
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs
and successors, according to law.
I submit to you that that is the definition of a
subject, and of allegiance, and that really is --
demonstrates that the United Kingdom has come before this
Court not as a litigation posture, because it has no
interest really in any of these cases, but as a concern
over the fact that its sovereignty is not being recognized
by the judiciary when it has been recognized by the United
States Government in numerous treaties, and again, I won't
read them, but I would simply refer you to the Consular
Convention and footnote 17 of the United Kingdom's brief,
which details the numerous treaties that have been entered
into governing the British Virgin Islands and other of the
Overseas Territories.
If the Court has no further questions, I will
submit.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Reid.
The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
