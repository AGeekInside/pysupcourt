BENNETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BENNETT: Justice O'Connor, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor 70 years the Federal courts have\ndeferentially reviewed both the efficacy and the wisdom of\nlegislation, even when it affects property interests.\nThis case squarely presents the question, should we now\nturn back the clock?\nWe make two main arguments: first, that the\nsubstantially advance test should not be a standalone test\nfor determining whether regulation affects a taking\nbecause such a test is fundamentally divorced from a major\nprinciple of the regulatory takings doctrine itself,\neconomic injury; and second, if there is such a standalone\ntest, it ought to be no more searching than the rational\nbasis test of due process.\nAs this Court has stated in First English, the\nJust Compensation Clause is not designed to interfere with\nthe ability of government to affect property interests,\nbut rather to require just compensation in the event of an\notherwise valid taking.\nIn this particular case, we had a circumstance\nwhere one single Federal judge conducted a fact trial\nwhere she evaluated the demeanor and credibility of one\nexpert from Chevron and one expert from the State of\nHawaii in order to make a determination of whether or not\ngarden variety economic regulation was constitutional or\nunconstitutional. There was no -- the test applied would\nhave been no different if this had been an act of Congress\ninstead of an act of the Hawaii State legislature. In\nthis case, what the district court did was wholly\ninconsistent, we submit, with any reasonable concepts of\nfederalism, and if it had been an act of Congress that\nthis district court judge was sitting in judgment of, it\nwould have been entirely inconsistent with the respect\nthat this Court has consistently said is due to a co-\nequal branch of government.\nA particular irony of the way the Ninth Circuit\napplied what it believed to be the Agins test, which it\nindicated the standard of review fell somewhere between\nrational basis and rough proportionality, but the -- the\nsupreme irony of that, we suggest, is that if that test\nwere applied, it would have the effect of overruling the\nvery cases that Agins cited in supporting the language it\n-- it used, that if indeed you have this type of\nintermediate scrutiny, cases like Nectow and Euclid v.\nVillage of Ambler could not stand because, as this Court\nhas said, those cases set out a rational basis test,\nwhether the object was in the power of the legislature or\n-- or the municipal authority and whether the means used\nto achieve it were rational. And the test the Ninth\nCircuit set up in this case, and as applied by the\ndistrict court, would have overruled those very cases\nbecause there would have been a fact trial necessary to\ndetermine whether or not the -- the zoning ordinances at\nissue in that -- in those cases were efficacious or\ninefficacious.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does the fact that\ndiscrete or individual property rights are being affected\nand, indeed, taken justify some higher level of scrutiny\nthan we would apply to general economic regulation by the\nState?\nMR. BENNETT: No, Your Honor. We -- we would\nthink, first of all, this -- this Court has established\nthat it doesn't look at whether some stick in the bundle\nof rights is affected by the regulation. It looks at the\nparcel as a whole.\nAnd second, this Court has said that it is\nshying away from per se tests, and indeed, it -- it looks\nat these types of cases under the rubric of Penn Central\nwhere the primary factor that the Court looks at is the\nextent of the economic injury and also the extent to which\nit interferes with reasonable investment-backed\nexpectations.\nA particular irony of this case is that the\nNinth Circuit has said this particular statute of the\nHawaii legislature affects a taking without any regard to\nwhether or not it caused any economic injury to Chevron at\nall. This Court has found that when the major flaw in\nlegislation or the -- the major argument as to why\nlegislation should be deemed to be unconstitutional turns\non the legitimacy of the legislation, that finds a natural\nhome in the due process analysis, rather than in an\nanalysis that looks at whether or not the legislation\nactually effects a taking or not.\nIndeed, this Court, Your Honor, despite what it\nsaid in Agins in relying on the due process analysis, has\nnever found a taking based upon doubt as to the likely\nefficacy of economic legislation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've said it a lot,\nthough, haven't we? Why do we keep on saying it?\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, I think that in\n-- in Del Monte Dunes, every opinion in the case discussed\nthis language and -- and said that the Court has never\nindicated that this sets out a more exacting test than\nrational basis other than in the rough proportionality\ncontext of Nollan and Dolan. And I think the language\nused in Agins, which came from due process cases, has\nsomewhat taken on a life of its own, and the lower courts\nand the -- the supreme courts of the several States have\nhad quite -- have had a great deal of difficulty in -- in\ndealing with what exactly the language means. We believe,\nas we've set forth in our brief, that to the extent it\nestablishes this intermediate scrutiny, as the Ninth\nCircuit felt it did, that it would be dicta in Agins, but\nif the Court viewed it as not dicta, we think that the\nCourt ought to reconsider the constitutional rule under\nthe standards for such reconsideration that the Court has\nidentified in cases like Payne v. Tennessee.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose a person has\na piece of property, and they zone it suddenly, no\nbuilding -- no building -- which destroys the value of the\nproperty pretty much. Now, should we just -- I think\nthose might be the cases where this language began to\nappear, something like that. Should that be just a simple\nrational basis review too? Because I'm trying to put the\ncase where it might be -- arguably you should have\nsomething stronger since the property value is -- is\nseriously hurt and --\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, if -- if the claim was\nthat the legislation was irrational, that it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. They're going to say,\nwell, we can imagine a reason, but if you look at it\nrealistically, you know there's no good reason.\nMR. BENNETT: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if you put your mind to\nit, you can make one up, which is sort of the test for\nrational basis in the economic context. But as soon as we\nbecome more realistic, there isn't much of a reason. It\ncan't satisfy the stronger test, though it could satisfy\nthe weaker.\nMR. BENNETT: No, Your Honor. We would suggest\nthat this Court's jurisprudence indicates that that type\nof a claim of a taking ought to be analyzed under the Penn\nCentral test where you first do look at the extent of the\neconomic devaluation, if you will, of the property and you\nlook at whether there is an interference with reasonable\ninvestment-backed expectations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are we supposed to do, to\nreturn to Justice Scalia's question, with the fact that\nthis appears -- I counted about 12 cases, I mean, where it\nimplicitly or explicitly appears, something like it. Are\nwe supposed to just, oh, say all those cases were wrong\nand -- what are we supposed to do about that?\nMR. BENNETT: Well, we would suggest, Your\nHonor, that what the Court does is say that -- that in\nAgins, what the Court was essentially doing was restating\na due process test, and either say --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you speak up a little?\nMR. BENNETT: I'm sorry, Your Honor. We would\n-- we would say that the Court ought to say that in Agins\nthe Court was restating a due process test, and if this is\nto be a standalone test, it ought to be part of due\nprocess. But if it finds a home in the Just Compensation\nClause, it ought to find a home in the -- in the public\nuse portion of the Just Compensation Clause where if,\nindeed, the economic impact in a regulatory takings\ncontext is so severe that it constitutes a taking, then\nwhether it rationally advances a State goal ought to be --\nought to inform the question of whether or not it's a\npublic use, but that it shouldn't be a standalone test for\nreally sitting as a super-legislature to determine whether\nor not this really advances the government's goals as\nopposed to whether it could rationally have advanced\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you feel --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you want us to put --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you feel better about\nour doing that in order to determine whether -- whether\nthere's a public use than you would feel our doing it in\norder to decide whether there's been a taking?\nMR. BENNETT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, wouldn't all of your --\nall of your objections apply equally?\nMR. BENNETT: Certainly if it were more than\nrational basis. So we're -- we're suggesting that it\noughtn't, wherever it's put, be more than a rational basis\ntest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're not really\nurging us to -- to defer the -- the evil day and simply\nsay, well, this test, which is more than rational basis,\nmay well apply to -- to whether there's been a -- a public\nuse or not, but it certainly doesn't apply to whether\nthere's been a taking.\nMR. BENNETT: No, absolutely not. It shouldn't\n-- it shouldn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I hope you won't do that.\nMR. BENNETT: -- it shouldn't apply to -- to\neither one, and wherever this -- if the Court wants to say\nthat this language needs to find a home somewhere and it\nisn't in due process, then it shouldn't be more than a\nrational basis test wherever it's put.\nIn many ways, Your Honor, this statute, Act 257\nof the Hawaii legislature, is -- is almost identical,\nalthough less intrusive, than the statute that this Court\nupheld in Exxon v. Maryland. The goal of the statute in\nboth cases was the same. It was to preserve competition\nin the retail market, and in Hawaii, where we have at the\nrefinery level a duopoly and at the wholesale level an\noligopoly, it certainly was rational for the legislature\nto believe that trying to prevent the -- the oligopolist\nfrom projecting their market share into the retail level\nwould have the effect of preserving competition. And it\nwas certainly rational for the -- the legislature to\nbelieve that limiting the rents that oil companies could\ncharge their independent service stations so that they\ncouldn't charge excessive or predatory rents would serve\nthe goal of preserving competition in the retail market in\na State where the oil -- where the gasoline prices at the\npump are the highest in the country and the -- the market\nat the two levels above the retail level is\nextraordinarily concentrated.\nThis Court, indeed, has said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it were clear,\nfrom what the legislature said, that the only purpose of\nthis legislation was to help out some local dealers who\nwere politically powerful and the gasoline prices would go\nup. I assume you would be here defending the statute.\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, what we would\nsay is that this Court's jurisprudence is that in applying\na rational basis test, one doesn't look at what the\nlegislature said was the purpose of the statute, but one\nlooks at what could be advanced as a purpose for the\nstatute and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you would be here\ndefending the statute on -- in my hypothetical case.\nMR. BENNETT: Yes, Your Honor, and we would --\nwe would be, I imagine, positing additional reasons why\nthe statute would pass a rational basis test than those\nactually reflected in the legislative history because I\nthink, as this Court has indicated a number of times, that\nrequiring the legislature to state reasons or, indeed,\nlooking at the precise reasons stated by the legislature\nin deciding whether the statute furthers those goals as\nopposed to other goals the legislature might have had,\nsimply sets this Court up as a -- as I said, a super-\nlegislature, and -- and really opens the door to the type\nof intrusive review of legislative acts that this Court\nhas not engaged in for more than 70 years.\nThe number of cases that the Court has looked at\nin which it has indicated that it is not going to get into\nthe business of determining efficacy or wisdom is, indeed,\nlegion, and really since the New State Ice era, the\nLochner era, this Court has not engaged in that type of\nreview. And in fact, in Lochner itself, the -- the Court\nstated that we do not believe in the soundness of the\nviews which uphold this law, and one can take that and\nlook at the Ninth Circuit opinion in this case in which\nthe Ninth Circuit does essentially the same thing.\nYour Honor, in our representative democracy,\ndecisions as to the wisdom of economic legislation are for\nthe political branches, not the courts. The voters of\nHawaii have a remedy if their elected officials fail them.\nIt is in that forum that the wisdom of Act 257 should be\ndebated.\nJustice O'Connor, I'd ask to reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Very well, General Bennett.\nWe'll hear next from Mr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Justice O'Connor, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe reasons why this Court has applied the\nrational basis standard to review economic legislation of\nthe sort involved here go to the heart of the role of\ncourts in our democratic society. Legislatures, not\ncourts, are elected to enact the laws, and courts,\ntherefore, do not substitute their judgment for the\neconomic wisdom of legislation for that of the\nlegislature. And courts typically lack the fact-finding\nability and expertise of legislatures, especially to make\nthe sort of predictive judgments that the Ninth Circuit\nrelied upon in this case.\nThese fundamental principles about the role of\ncourts in our society would be greatly undermined if a\nplaintiff could simply -- could obtain heightened scrutiny\nof legislation by simply recasting his claim as a takings\nclaim. And therefore, it's not surprising that this\nnotion doesn't find support in the Just Compensation\nClause.\nWhen the government affirmatively exercises the\npower of eminent domain to take property, the requirement\nthat compensation be paid doesn't rest on the proposition\nthat the legislation is ineffective. To the contrary, the\ntaking presupposes that the -- that the action will --\nwill further a legitimate governmental purpose or at least\nthat the legislature could have rationally so concluded.\nAny inquiry into the legitimacy of the\ngovernmental purpose or whether it will be served,\ninstead, arises under the Public Use Clause, not whether\nthere is a taking. And if those purposes are not served\nor the legislature could not rationally so conclude, it is\nnot a public use and it's invalid and it should be\nenjoined, the consequences not to trigger the payment of\n-- of compensation.\nAnd the -- the same analytical approach applies\nfor regulatory takings. In deciding whether there is a\nregulatory taking, this Court has developed tests to look\nto see whether the nature of the government's restrictions\nare essentially the functional equivalent of the exercise\nof the power of eminent domain or appropriation. And that\n-- that the Court has done by looking principally at the\nimpact on the property owner, not the rationality of what\nthe legislature has done. That has not been part of it.\nFor example, in the Lucas case, the -- the test\nfor finding a taking is whether all economic value has\nbeen destroyed. Or in the physical appropriation cases,\nthe Court has said that's such a fundamental interference\nburden on the landowner that there is a per se taking.\nAnd similarly under the Penn Central test, the central\ninquiry is on the economic impact and the interference\nwith investment-backed expectations, things that look to\nthe impact on the -- on the landowner.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you're going to use\nthe public use prong of the -- of the -- the Constitution\nfor what we think are regulatory takings, then what\nhappens is you just invalidate the regulation. You don't\npay compensation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's correct,\nalthough I -- although I should say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because if it's not a public\nuse, then you can't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. No. That -- that's\ncorrect. And I think that's -- that's the difference. If\nsomething doesn't -- if the legislature couldn't\nrationally conclude that -- that the measure will -- will\nserve a legitimate governmental purpose, it's invalid and\n-- and therefore not a taking. It's improper governmental\naction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about substantially\nadvances a legitimate State interest, which does sound\nlike it's a higher standard? And it has been said, as was\npointed out, in several cases of this Court -- not that it\nmade any difference to the bottom line, but that language\nis -- sounds -- sounds like it's a more toothful standard\nthan rational basis.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in fact, the point\nyou made that it has not actually affected the outcome I\nthink is an important consideration for this Court. And\n-- and now that the Court is focusing on the question of\nwhether this really does logically fit into the Just\nCompensation Clause jurisprudence, I -- I think it -- I\nthink it's important to consider that the Court has not\nactually ever struck down a measure under the Just\nCompensation Clause outside the exactions situation which\npresent the different consequence of -- of a physical\nappropriation. The Court has not ever actually struck\ndown a statute on -- on that basis.\nBut with respect to that language, it -- it\narose in Agins. There was a little bit of discussion\nalong those lines in Penn Central, but in Agins, which\nmost people see as -- as the origin of it, the Court, as\nwas pointed out, relied upon Village of Euclid and upon\nNectow, both of which were due process cases and both of\nwhich applied a rational basis test. And in fact, on\npages 24 and 25 of our brief, we set out the quotations\nfrom Nectow and Euclid which show that the Court -- the\nCourt there was using the notion of whether the measure\nwill -- will further a substantial or has a substantial\nrelation to the public health, really in contradistinction\nto something that is irrational.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about Moore?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about Moore?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Moore?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, City of East Cleveland\nwhere they had the grandmother and the -- the --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. Well, cases -- cases\ninvolving the -- the family unit I think -- I mean, those\nare -- those go beyond simply the question of the -- of\nregulating property. Those -- those get into -- those get\ninto questions of -- of who's occupying -- who's occupying\nthe house. But -- but in Village of Belle Terre, the --\nthe Court applied a rational basis test to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so we might still keep a\n-- a stronger test where a zoning ordinance affects the\nnumber of people that could live in a house or --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, not the number -- not the\nnumber of people.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or who could live in the house.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That case concerned --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Grandparents --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- a family, the -- the question\nof interfering -- possible interference with a family\nunit. But in Village of Belle Terre, the Court applied a\n-- a rational basis test to a zoning ordinance that\nregulated unrelated people living in -- living in the same\nhouse.\nSo the phrase, substantially advance, while it\nmay have that ring to it, in fact its origins, when you\nlook at page 25 of our brief, the -- the Court in Nectow\nexplained the test as being a -- a court may not set aside\nthe determination of public officers unless it's clear\nthat it has no foundation in reason and is a mere\narbitrary or irrational exercise, having no substantial\nrelation to the public health. The Court was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they don't sound like\nsynonyms. So I'm asking you what you would recommend that\nthis Court do. If you say that the standard is the same\nas rational basis, perhaps this confusing phrase should be\neliminated.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I'm sorry. I\nmisunderstood, if that was the question. We think it\ndefinitely should be eliminated, and the -- and the Court\nshould say that it is applying the rational basis test.\nAnd I think it's instructive in the -- in the\npost-Agins era to look at the Keystone decision, both the\ndissent and the majority in that case. It was -- the\nCourt was essentially unanimous that the -- that the\ntaking provision of a clause does not authorize an inquiry\ninto the efficacy of legislation. And in fact, on that\npoint, the dissent quoted this Court's decision in\nMidkiff.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, when you have a\nphysical invasion of property and a inverse condemnation\nis tantamount to a physical invasion, then we've built up\nsome doctrine in order to protect the concept of physical\ninvasion so that that can't be avoided. Perhaps that's\nnot applicable to a -- to an economic regulation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- yes, this -- this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though this is a\nleasehold interest. I -- I understand that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the Court applied a rational\nbasis test in Pennell under the Due Process Clause and it\nwould be odd to apply a -- a higher test.\nI mean, it would be a different question if\nthere was a claim of -- of confiscation of the property,\nbut Chevron has stipulated that it could not make out a\ntaking claim on the basis of -- of its economic impact.\nSo we're talking about a standalone inquiry into the\nefficacy of the legislation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, Mr. Kneedler, simply\ngiving -- giving the phrase, substantially advance, the --\nthe more modest meaning that you argue for doesn't solve\nthe problem. The -- the statement in Agins would still be\nincorrect. Agins says that the application of a general\nzoning law to a particular property effects a taking if\nthe ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate\nState interests.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Now I -- and that was the\npoint --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, so we have to eat crow\nno matter what we do. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why -- why go through all\nthe trouble of, you know, redefining substantially\naffects?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. No. I -- I didn't mean\nto say that -- that it should --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- be a rational basis test and\ntherefore the Court would conclude it was a taking. In --\nin the regulatory area, if the court -- if a taking is not\nmade out on the basis of economic impact under -- under\nPenn Central or one of those tests, there's no taking.\nYou don't get to the public use requirement then because\nthat only kicks in if there is a taking. So it's the due\nprocess rational basis test that -- that would apply. And\n-- and as I said, I think Keystone, with -- with respect\nto applying a rational basis test on the efficacy question\nis -- is dispositive on that -- on that question.\nNow, the -- the Court did say you can look at\nthe character of the governmental action, what -- what the\ngovernment is doing as part of the Penn Central test, but\nnot this sort of means-end efficacy question. And we do\nthink it would be appropriate for the Court to jettison\nthat.\nI would point out that throughout the course of\nhistory, the Court has sometimes used takings and due\nprocess kind of interchangeably. And we -- we quote, for\nexample, the -- this Court's Rowan decision which refers\nto the plaintiff's constitutional claim as saying that the\nregulatory action violates the Fifth Amendment because it\nconstitutes a taking without due process of law. I think\nsometimes the Court has used or parties have used those\nterms interchangeably, and that may well be what the Court\nwas doing in Agins.\nAnd I think if you look at Penn Central where\nthat phraseology was -- was used, the same is true where\nthe Court was -- was relying upon the due process part of\nGoldblatt, and the Court put the word taking in -- in\nquotes, I think perhaps indicating that it was not looking\nat a literal taking.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG E. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Justice O'Connor, may it please\nthe Court:\nThe issue in this case is the content of this\nCourt's regulatory takings doctrine and, in particular,\nwhether that doctrine includes the inquiries called for by\nthe substantially advances test, which this Court\narticulated in Agins, but which is grounded in principles\nthe Court has long recognized both before and after Agins.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it a regulatory taking in\nyour view because the substantially advances test is not\nmet, or is a regulatory taking and then I ask if it\nsubstantially advances?\nMR. STEWART: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How do I know that this is a\nregulatory taking, in other words?\nMR. STEWART: It's a -- it's a regulatory taking\nbecause the government has not physically appropriated the\nproperty or condemned it. Instead, by operation of its\nregulation, it has taken the property interest from\nChevron. It's like --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- that means if\nit's a taking at all, it's got to be a regulatory taking.\nBut Justice Kennedy's question is what is the test for\ndetermining whether it is a taking.\nMR. STEWART: And I believe that question, Your\nHonor, is answered by Pennsylvania Coal where the Court\nfound that the fact that the statute at issue there\nprevented Pennsylvania Coal from mining a certain amount\nof the coal that was in the ground that it was otherwise\nentitled -- be entitled to mine -- took that property just\nas assuredly as a condemnation of it would. And then the\nCourt said, but the seemingly absolute protection of the\nJust Compensation Clause in the context of a -- of a\nregulation that affects that kind of appropriation, as\nopposed to an outright condemnation of it, that that\nprotection is subject to an implied limitation that\nexists to allow the government to serve its purposes, as\nPennsylvania Coal described it, if the government could\nhardly function at all, if it were required to pay for\nevery interference with property rights occasioned by its\nregulation. So what we have growing out of Pennsylvania\nCoal is a -- a rationale for allowing the government to\ninterfere with private property rights that would\notherwise be protected and otherwise could not be taken\nwithout compensation in order that the government may\nserve its legitimate purposes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the question, of\ncourse, is let's imagine you're either right or you're\nwrong as to its being a regulatory taking. And maybe if\nit's -- they have no reason for it at all, they can't do\nit. Period. And if they have some reason for it, even a\nsort of bad one, they can do it. But if that's the\ncontext -- we're in the game where they can do it -- why\nshould it matter, in respect to paying compensation,\nwhether their reason is quite a good one or just barely\ngood enough? And that's -- that's the puzzle, I think,\nthat the other side is putting to you, and I must say I'm\nrather moved by their argument because it seems to me\nwhether it's a very good reason or just a barely adequate\nreason has nothing to do with whether they should pay\ncompensation.\nMR. STEWART: I think it goes to the difference,\nYour Honor, between the public use standard and the --\nwhich governs in a situation in which the government is\npaying compensation. And in that standard, as we've been\ndiscussing today, in that context, the Court has applied\na very deferential standard because the -- the burden on\nproperty rights is lesser and the -- the impediment --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the burden on --\nMR. STEWART: -- to governmental action is\ngreater.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I'm not -- I thought --\nare we in the world in which you agree the government can\ndo it even though their reason -- or is your basic\nargument, no, they can't do this at all? In which case\nit's not a compensation question. It's a question of\nwhether the Constitution of the United States forbids them\nfrom doing it. Period.\nMR. STEWART: We -- we believe, Your Honor, that\nit is a compensation issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a compensation issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you want money? You want a\nmoney judgment? I thought you wanted them to stop it.\nMR. STEWART: We wanted a declaration from the\ncourt that the -- that they cannot proceed with a statute\nthat takes our rents without paying -- paying for us.\nWhat's happened here is that this legislature has\nenacted --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but isn't -- I thought\nyour premise was that because the statute doesn't\nauthorize any payment, that is a way of stopping it.\nMR. STEWART: Yes. The statute does not\nauthorize payment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So if -- if Hawaii modifies its\nstatute and says, we will give to you the difference\nbetween, you know, whatever the rent we -- if we can\nfigure it out -- whatever the rent would be and -- and\nwhat our statute requires, you'd be perfectly happy.\nMR. STEWART: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: What we are arguing about here is\ncompensation, and the standard that we --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it would seem that\nyou're arguing about whether this amounts to a taking --\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- at all. And you have to\nlook at how severely the State law burdens the property\nrights. Don't you?\nMR. STEWART: Your Honor, the -- in Lucas, this\nCourt found that a -- a complete deprivation of the\neconomic value of property constitutes a categorical\ntaking. But the Court has not held -- it did not hold in\nLucas and it has not otherwise held -- that a regulation\nthat affects less than a complete destruction of economic\nvalue is categorically not a taking. The point of the\nCourt's regulatory takings doctrine and the inquiries that\nit mandates is to determine those circumstances in which a\ndeprivation that is less than a complete destruction of\neconomic value require compensation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- let me go back to\nmy question because I haven't heard the answer. And I'm\nin a world, imaginative if you like, where Hawaii passes\nthis statute, and what we're interested in is not whether\nthey can do it, but whether they have to pay compensation.\nAnd my question is, what in heaven's name has the goodness\nor badness of their reason to do with that question?\nAfter all, I can imagine instances in which their reason\nfor the regulation is pretty bad. It just barely\nsurvives, and they shouldn't have to pay. And I can\nimagine cases where their reason is wonderful and they\nshould have to pay or maybe they shouldn't. It's neither\na necessary nor a sufficient condition. It has nothing to\ndo with whether you should have to pay.\nNow, that's their argument I think, or at least\nas I understand it, and I want you to explain to me why\nthe goodness or badness of the reason, once it has passed\nthe minimal point, has anything to do with whether you\nshould have to pay compensation.\nMR. STEWART: And my answer to that, Your Honor,\nis that it goes -- it stems from the rationale expressed\nin Pennsylvania Coal for allowing the government to\ninterfere with private property --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Holmes said, though he didn't\nhold that -- what he said was you have to pay when the\nregulation, a legitimate regulation, goes too far. So I\nwill repeat. Why does the goodness or badness of the\nreason, past the minimal point, have anything to do with\nwhether a regulation goes too far?\nMR. STEWART: Well, part of the question whether\nthe regulation goes too far is whether there is a basis\nfor imposing the burden on a particular property right.\nHere we have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and in that respect,\nHolmes did not use the word legitimate. He said just when\nthe regulation goes too far, and if it's illegitimate,\nthat tends to show -- I suppose the jurisprudence is --\nthat this is not an accepted form of regulation in the\nusual course and therefore unnecessary. I take it that's\nyour argument.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think, Your Honor, that\nthe -- growing out of Pennsylvania Coal, the Court has\nrecognized that one of the critical factors, if not the\nmost critical factor, in regulatory takings analysis is\nthe character of the government's action and the nature of\nthe government's interest. It's not simply a matter of\nhow much property has been taken. The question is the\ngovernment's basis for taking that property.\nWhen we -- what we have here, Justice Breyer, is\na -- is a -- a right specifically protected by the\nConstitution. The Constitution provides that private\nproperty shall not be taken for public use without just\ncompensation. And Justice Holmes in Pennsylvania Coal was\n-- said that that seemingly absolute protection is\nqualified, and the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he -- he didn't go into\nthis question.\nLet me give you an example that will make it\nclear. Let's take a case where there's the best reason in\nthe world, fabulous reason. We're taking this property to\nbuild a highway, which is absolutely necessary. Would you\nsuggest that compensation doesn't have to be paid?\nMR. STEWART: Compensation, of course, has to be\npaid.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it does.\nNow, let me suggest the other side of the coin,\na really terrible reason. You cannot build your house\nwithout using metal pipes. That's our building reg in\nthis State. Now, everybody knows -- I'm imagining anyway\n-- plastic pipes are just as good, but not quite, so they\nhave a barely adequate reason. Do you think that they\nhave to pay compensation to have a general building code\nsaying you can't use plastic pipes?\nMR. STEWART: Your Honor, I -- to me there's a\nthreshold question of whether a general building\nregulation of that type really would be a -- a regulation\nthat would implicate the Takings Clause at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it is an -- it does\nregulate the use of your property and it means added cost,\nin fact, several thousand dollars added cost, to the\nbuilding of a house, and come up here and argue we agree\nthere's a rational reason, but it isn't so you can do it,\nbut it isn't a really good reason, not substantial. Now,\ndo you think that has anything to do with paying\ncompensation?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, Your Honor, I do. And\nbecause the -- the -- assuming -- on the assumption that\nthis is really a -- a burden on property rights that would\nbe subject to the Takings Clause, then that burden\nrequires compensation unless there's some limitation on\nthe compensation principle. And the limitation that the\nCourt has recognized, growing out of Pennsylvania Coal, is\nthe need for the government to function. So we have an\ninquiry into whether this furthers the governmental\npurposes.\nNow, in your example, Your Honor, I don't think\nthere's any question that that inquiry would be satisfied.\nOur point is simply that the inquiry must be made.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, I'm trying to\nunderstand not your theory but its concrete applications.\nHere we're dealing with the rent to be paid by a lessee of\na gas station, but what you're saying, I take it, would go\nfor any kind of rent control. You could make the same\nargument. So you're -- so you are saying that rent\ncontrol is a taking and the State could do it with\ncompensation?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and the measure of\ncompensation would be? How would the State -- let's take\na -- an ordinary rental property, and the city puts a rent\ncontrol ordinance into effect. You say that's a taking,\nand how would one measure the compensation?\nMR. STEWART: The compensation would be measured\nas the difference between the -- the rent that was allowed\nunder the regulation or the statute and the rent that the\n-- that the landlord, the lessor, would otherwise be\nentitled to collect in the marketplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand you as\nsaying that all rent control constitutes a taking. I\nthought it is only unintelligent rent control that\nconstitutes a taking.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or do you not think that any\nrent control is intelligent?\nMR. STEWART: No, that is not our position, Your\nHonor. The -- the -- and in fact, the -- the State has\nspecifically disclaimed any contention that -- that this\nis like the typical residential rent control. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking for not the\nState's position but your position.\nMR. STEWART: And our --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And let's -- let's assume\nthat there's no better reason for the rent control for the\nbuilding, residential building, than there is for the rent\ncontrol on the lease for the gas station.\nMR. STEWART: Your Honor, our -- the question\nwould be, under our analysis, is not the validity of the\n-- of the ends, of the legislative ends. That would be\ntaken care of in the inquiry under public use. So -- so\nthe -- so the question of the legitimacy of the\ngovernment's interest in controlling rent would not be at\nissue.\nWhat would be at issue under our test is the\nconnection between the -- the rent control, the burden on\nprivate -- private property rights that's imposed and the\nnature of the asserted interests and the degree to which\nthat burden furthers that interest.\nNow, in the typical residential rent control\ncircumstance, where the purpose of the statute -- where --\nwhere the -- where the legislature is concerned about the\n-- the price, the rent -- the rental amount that residents\nare having to pay, in that circumstance, the test that\nwe're proposing would be easily met because the purpose of\nthe statute would be to grant rent relief to the -- to the\ntenants. And that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And on your theory it would\neasily be met no matter how severe the control. I -- I\ntake it on your theory, if -- if the -- if the rent\ncontrol ordinance said, $5 an apartment, that's the top\nrent, fine with you because it's extraordinarily efficient\nin relieving poor renters from the -- from the burden of\n-- of high rents.\nMR. STEWART: I think our --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That can't be the test.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think our position, Your\nHonor, is that there are -- this -- this is a threshold\ninquiry, the -- the hypothetical --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but it would -- in any\ncase it would pass the threshold inquiry on your test.\nYou would say, boy, it doesn't get any more efficient than\nthis until it gets to zero.\nMR. STEWART: I think that it would pass the\ninquiry. I suppose you could -- you could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you would say at the\nthreshold level, there's no taking.\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And what would you then do? Go\non to Penn Central?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: You would have an inquiry into\nwhether there is a categorical taking under Lucas because\nit deprived essentially all economic value of the property\nand you would inquire under Penn Central whether --\nbecause the threshold inquiry into the nature of the\ngovernment's interest is satisfied, you then inquire into\nwhether the burden is such in light of the purposes to be\nserved that we believe it goes too far --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But if -- if the test is\ngoing to be as unhelpful as it would be in my extreme\nhypothetical, why have the test at all? Because in the\nmore difficult case where it's not $5 an apartment, but a\ncase like this in which the justification is ultimately a\njustification in gasoline prices and so on, the -- the\ninquiry is going to be much more complex. Penn Central is\na way of approaching that complexity. Why do we bother\nwith this threshold test which produces a bizarre result\nin one case and is going to be very difficult to apply in\nanother case, in which event I don't see the reason for\nhaving it as distinct from the Penn Central difficulty\ntest. What's -- what's its value?\nMR. STEWART: I mean -- part of my answer to\nthat, Your Honor, is that this test, in our view, does\nhave very narrow application, which is the reason why we\ndon't believe that the State is correct in suggesting that\nit will result in the invalidation of all kinds of\neconomic regulation.\nHaving said that, though, I do believe that it\nis an important threshold requirement that should be met,\nand if the government has not identified a basis for\nsingling out a given property right and imposing on that\nthe burden of a regulation and if it has not demonstrated\nthat the burden it is imposing is related in a -- in a --\nin advancing the purpose for which the burden is being\nimposed, then in that circumstance, the -- the rationale\nfor imposing that burden without compensation, in\ncontravention of the compensation requirement in the Fifth\nAmendment, is missing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the sensible response\nto the situation you posit that the government shouldn't\nbe doing it? I mean, it's a little crazy to say the\nGovernment is acting crazy. Therefore it -- it ought to\ncontribute money so the net economic effect is somehow\nzero. There's simply a transfer. The taxpayers bear a\nburden as -- as opposed to somebody else.\nOn the -- on the justification you're giving for\nthe test, you would say, look, if it's not substantially\nadvancing this interest, why let the government do it at\nall? I'm not saying that should be the test for whether\nthe government should do it at all. But isn't that kind\nof the sensible tendency of the test, to suggest that the\ngovernment shouldn't even be doing it?\nMR. STEWART: And I -- the distinction we're\nrelying upon there, Your Honor, is -- is the question\nwhether the government can proceed with compensation as\ndistinct from proceeding without compensation. When the\ngovernment proceeds with compensation -- it's going to pay\nfor the private property rights, the constitutionally\nprotected private property rights, with which it's\ninterfering -- then we demand a lesser showing. But when\nthere is a constitutional right at stake, the -- the\nshowing should be higher. We're not asking whether the\ngovernment can proceed at all. We're simply asking\nwhether the government can proceed without compensation.\nAnd the without compensation is what triggers and\ninfringes upon the very rights that are protected by the\nJust Compensation Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say I agree with Justice\nSouter. It seems to me if you say -- you're saying it\ndoesn't make sense, so you got to pay for it. I think it\n-- it's much more reasonable to say it doesn't make sense,\nso you can't do it. Why isn't the latter the -- the\nintelligent reaction?\nMR. STEWART: Your Honor, I -- the -- the\nquestion of whether it makes sense turns upon the standard\nof review that the Court is going to apply to answer that\nquestion. And when we are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. The -- I mean, it seems to\nme that the -- the whole point of the argument you're\nmaking is it won't hurt me, the landowner, quite so much,\nbut if it doesn't make sense at all, why should we even\nhave to get to that question? Why isn't the more sensible\nthing to say to the government, stop doing it?\nMR. STEWART: Because of the -- the -- the\ndifference in the relative interests at stake when we're\ntalking about proceeding with compensation as against\nwithout compensation.\nIn -- in the -- it's similar to the other\nprotections extended under the Bill of Rights. The Court\nhas indicated that the Just Compensation Clause is just as\nmuch a part of the Bill of Rights as any of the other\nprotections of the Bill of Rights. And there are\ncircumstances in which the government may proceed. There\nwould be a rational basis for it to proceed under a very\ndeferential standard that would be applied under the Due\nProcess Clause, but the Court, nonetheless, requires a\nhigher showing because of the intrusion on\nconstitutionally protected rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't the effect of what\nyou're arguing that you can't do it? Because you -- the\ngovernment would have to pay the same amount that -- by\nthe -- that the rent is being reduced. We'd have to\nfigure out how much higher the rent would have been, and\n-- so it -- it would be a -- a nonsensical thing for the\ngovernment to engage in.\nMR. STEWART: Your Honor, the State's position\nin this case is that by preserving a network of lessee\ndealers, there will be benefits to the public in terms of\nlower gasoline prices. And I think their -- their theory\nis that those benefits would far outweigh the -- the\nmodest decrease in rent, lost rent to the oil companies.\nAnd so that it -- it would make sense if the government\nwished to make that choice and -- and to pay compensation,\nif the government's theory were correct.\nAnd one of the values of the Just Compensation\nClause and the constitutional rights that it protects is\nthat it forces that choice to be made. It -- it puts the\ndecision on budget as opposed to off budget.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why wouldn't it make\nsense then for the government to say, Chevron, you charge\nwhat you want and, station owner, we, the government,\ngives you -- Hawaii gives you this money so you'll be able\nto pay the excess rent?\nMR. STEWART: In fact, we believe that is -- is,\nin essence, what is occurring here. There -- there is no\nclaim that the rents that Chevron or the other oil\ncompanies were charging are excessive or that they have\nbeen the cause of any problem in the State of Hawaii that\nHawaii is trying to address.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Explain it -- explain your\ntheory in terms of the example. That is, imagine that the\nbenefits of the network of dealers of gasoline into the\ncommunity are fabulous and obvious. So there's a great\nreason for doing this. Now, why is it that, on your\ntheory, the government shouldn't have to pay compensation\nthen, but it should have to pay compensation just because\nthe benefits are not obvious, that they're bizarre, that\nthey don't -- may not really exist? That's -- you see why\nI'm having a problem?\nMR. STEWART: Let me see if I can get to it\nbetter, Your Honor. One reading of the Takings Clause,\nthe Just Compensation Clause, would be that the government\nshould pay compensation in those circumstances where it is\ndepriving property owners of protected property rights.\nBut in Pennsylvania Coal, the Court said in the regulatory\ntakings area, because of the need for the government to\nfunction, we are going to allow the government in certain\ncircumstances to -- to interfere with rights without\npaying for them. And the inquiry that we're saying the\nCourt should make is whether that need exists and whether\nthe burden being imposed serves that need.\nAnd -- and again, I'd like to emphasize that\nthis should not be considered an unfamiliar concept in\nconstitutional law. This Court has consistently\nrecognized that when the government seeks to intrude on\nprotected -- rights protected by explicit provisions in\nthe Constitution, on the basis that its needs, its\nlegitimate interests require that intrusion, then the\ncourt's role to enforce the constitutional protections is\nto make that inquiry into whether the need is -- is being\nactually served.\nNow, I'd like to at -- at this point emphasize\nthat our position is not that no deference may be given to\nlegislative judgments under this test. Our position is\nsimply that it must be more than a mere rational basis\ntest. The reason why the Court, in repudiating the\nLochner-era cases, has held that mere rationality is\nenough to satisfy the constitutional standard is that\nthere was no specific constitutional prohibition. In the\n-- and -- and the Court specifically distinguished those\ncircumstances in which there is a constitutional right --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are so many things\nthat you could dress up as being a taking. And -- and so\nit seems to me that it's up to the artful pleader to say\nwhether this is a due process excessive regulation or this\nis intrusive to the point where it amounts to a taking.\nI mean, the -- the -- would you -- rent control\nis one. What about -- suppose Hawaii had said, we're\ngoing to cap the price of gas so it will make it easier\nfor these stations to survive.\nMR. STEWART: I think, Your Honor, that most\ncourts have recognized, although I don't know that it's\nsettled, that a -- a control on the price of a product\nthat -- that a business has produced would implicate the\nTakings Clause. And -- and in that circumstance, the\nsubstantially advances test almost certainly would be met,\nand our --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have a case involving\nprice control where we have analyzed that as a taking?\nMR. STEWART: Yes. The Florida Power case v.\nthe FCC where there was a regulation on the prices that\ntelecommunications companies could charge for access to\ntheir poles. Back in the war era, there was cases\ninvolving rent control where the Court found that the rent\ncontrol was justified because there was a market\ndistortion caused by the extraordinary imbalance in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't know that those were\ntreated as taking cases.\nMR. STEWART: I believe they were, Your Honor,\nand that they have been -- that this Court has discussed\nthem in those terms.\nBut I would like to, if I could, address the\nbroader point that I believe Your Honor was -- was making,\nwhich is can these claims just simply be repackaged and --\nand sweep into the takings analysis all of the regulation\nand apply to it the very same test that the Court has\nrepudiated in Lochner. And the answer to that I believe\nis clearly no.\nThe -- the Just Compensation Clause is limited\nto rights of private property, would not extend -- and I\ndon't believe there's anything in this Court's precedents\nthat would require it that it extend to the kinds of laws,\nminimum wage laws, wage and hour provisions, regulations\non the size of bread loaves, that were the professional\nlicensing requirements that were the subject of the\nLochner-era cases.\nAnd the Due Process Clause extends even to\nexpectancy interests or -- or reliance interests on\ngovernmental benefit programs. Nothing in our position\nhere would -- would apply to that because those, we don't\nbelieve, have ever been held and -- and should not be held\nto be covered within the specific provision of the Just\nCompensation Clause.\nYour Honors, in Nollan and Dolan and First\nEnglish, this Court recognized that the Just Compensation\nClause is not a poor relation among the provisions of the\nBill of Rights. In First English, the Court recognized\nthat the constitutional provisions by their very nature\nlimit the freedom and flexibility of the government in\norder to protect constitutional rights. And the Court in\nFirst English said that the Just Compensation Clause of\nthe Fifth Amendment is one such provision.\nAnd our position here is that this\nconstitutional right, that private property shall not be\ntaken without just compensation, should be entitled to the\nsame protection as the other constitutional protections in\nthe Bill of Rights, and that just as with respect to those\nrights, when the government seeks to intrude on those\ninterests, the court should properly inquire into the\nnature of that intrusion and the justification for that\nintrusion.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you.\nAttorney General Bennett, you have 7 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. BENNETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honors, this case is not\nabout compensation. Indeed, Chevron's discussion of\ncompensation -- the first time that that occurred in the\nentirety of this case was in its brief in this Court, as\nwe point out, in particular, in footnote 6 at page 11 of\nour reply brief. This case is, indeed, about whether this\neconomic regulation is legitimate. The Ninth Circuit's\ntest was it doesn't work well enough, so it is\nillegitimate. That type of a test belongs under the Due\nProcess Clause, not under the Just Compensation Clause.\nThis Court has time and time again said that it\nis not going to set up separate per se tests except in\nvery limited circumstances and, indeed, it's not going to\ndivide parcels in the way Chevron suggests here and\nwhether it's in Tahoe-Sierra or Penn Central or Keystone,\nthe Court has said, absent taking all value or use of the\nproperty or in Loretto, in the case of a physical\ninvasion, it is going to allow these types of regulatory\ntakings tests to be judged under Penn Central.\nWhat Chevron is arguing for here is a separate\ntest outside of Penn Central, divorced from economic\nimpact, that concerns solely the legitimacy of the\nregulation. We suggest that that belongs in due process.\nWe believe that what the Court should do is say\nthat what was stated in Agins does not state a standalone\ntest. Tests for judging the legitimacy of a regulation\nbelong in due process based upon a rational basis test and\nthat other than the very limited per se categories that\nthis Court has established, regulatory takings claims\ndepend on economic impact and belong under the Penn\nCentral analysis.\nThank you.\n"
