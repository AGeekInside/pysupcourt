FRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn holding that Hernan O'Ryan Castro's first\ntitled 28 U.S.C., section 2255 petition was second or\nsuccessive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nhas placed itself in conflict with every other court of\nappeals circuit in the United States, save the Fifth, in\nhow they view or treat the impact of a prior post-\nconviction motion which has been sua sponte re-\ncharacterized or treated as a 2255 petition by the\ndistrict court.\nQUESTION: Is recharacterization pretty much of\na judge-made thing? There's -- there's no statute that\nprovides for it, is there?\nMR. FRICK: That is absolutely correct. It is a\njudge-made -- it is a judge-made thing. It is something\nthat has been -- that has grown up among the courts in an\nattempt to save what would otherwise be generally in the\ncase of a pro se prisoner, a facially deficient or an\nineptly pleaded document, and by recharacterizing it, it's\ntrying to take substance and putting into form so that the\ncourt can actually rule on the substance of the particular\nmotion that was pleaded.\nQUESTION: Well, what's the difference in the\ntwo? I'm -- I'm the trial judge and I receive a motion\nunder rule 33 that's within the time limits under rule 33.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: When do I recharacterize it?\nMR. FRICK: Justice Kennedy, at the present time\nrecharacterization in our opinion should only be done at\nsuch time as the court determines that there is absolutely\nno viable way that it's going to be able to take the\ndocument as pleaded under the title that it's given to the\ncourt and effectuate a remedy therefrom.\nNow, it is our contention that, as in the Adams\nand Miller cases from the Second and Third Circuits, that\nat the present time, under the restrictions of the AEDPA,\nthat a recharacterization should never take place by a\ncourt unless there is concurrence on the part of the\npetitioner himself and he's given the --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I understand that -- that\nargument of yours.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: But what I'm asking is what is --\nwhat factors does the judge take into account or should\ntake into account when he or she is asked to\nrecharacterize the motion? I -- I get -- I'm the trial\njudge. I get a rule 33 motion, which is within the time\nlimits, and then the Government or -- says, now you should\nrecharacterize. What -- what are factors that I consider\nwhen I recharacterize? You -- you indicate that you\nshould never recharacterize unless you have to for some\nreason?\nMR. FRICK: Yes, sir, and I do not believe that\nit is the Government's part to ask the court to\nrecharacterize something.\nQUESTION: Is there any authority for that? If\n-- if I wanted to go look in -- in some manual or --\nMR. FRICK: No, Your Honor. There --\nQUESTION: -- some practice book to know when I\ncan recharacterize, when I can't?\nMR. FRICK: No, Your Honor, but the D.C. Circuit\n-- but first of all, all of the cases that we have cited\nexcept for the Eleventh Circuit and the Fifth Circuit have\naddressed issues, have addressed circumstances under which\nrecharacterization was done of certain motions that were\npleaded in order to help ostensibly the individual who\npled the motion.\nQUESTION: But here the Government and the trial\ncourt the first time around just said they would have no\nobjection, didn't they, having treated it as a 2254? They\ndidn't urge that it be recharacterized, the rule 33\nmotion.\nMR. FRICK: No, they did not ask that it be\nrecharacterized, Your Honor. What they said is that they\nhad no objection to it being considered as also seeking\nrelief under 2255. But my client, Mr. Castro, had\npresented to the court, unlike in virtually all of the\nother cases in the other circuits -- and this is one of\nthe points that makes this such a strong case for Mr.\nCastro -- his rule 33 motion was absolutely correct in all\nrespects insofar as seeking the remedy that he did.\nThe Eleventh Circuit's initial opinion in this\ncase, in fact, recognized the opinion that it later\nvacated sua sponte -- actually recognized the fact that he\nhad brought a proper rule 33 motion under -- under Brady.\nQUESTION: And when you say a proper rule 33\nmotion, you don't necessarily mean one on which relief\nwill be granted I take it.\nMR. FRICK: No, Your Honor. It is, nonetheless,\na motion that does not require recharacterization in order\nfor the court to get to the merits of the issue presented.\nThe district court --\nQUESTION: It was the Government who intruded\n2255 into this case. The district judge didn't suggest\nit. The prisoner, who never appeared before the court,\ncertainly didn't suggest it. 2255, as I understand, was\nfirst uttered by the Government in -- in its pleading to\nthe court.\nMR. FRICK: That's absolutely correct, Justice\nGinsburg, and the court -- the district court's order,\ninterestingly enough, starts out by saying we have before\nus Hernan O'Ryan Castro's motion for a new trial under\nrule 33, and then it ends in conclusion by stating for the\nabove reasons, we deny Hernan O'Ryan Castro's rule 33\nmotion for new trial. It is only in the body of the\nopinion itself that there is reference to the Government\nhaving requested that it also be considered as requesting\nrelief under 2255 and that they would, therefore, take\nthat consideration.\nQUESTION: Well, let's get exactly straight what\nthe Government said because I had thought the Government\nsaid it have -- it would have no objection. Now, you're\nsaying the Government requested. Those are two different\nthings.\nMR. FRICK: Your Honor, if I stated that, I'm\nincorrect. The Government suggested -- the Government\nstated that it had no objection, as Your -- as Your Honor\nhas stated. It had no objection to it being so\ncharacterized.\nQUESTION: But no one had proposed it other than\nthe Government.\nMR. FRICK: That's correct. Not up until that\npoint in time, there had been no suggestion whatsoever of\n2255 --\nQUESTION: And the Government was -- I take it,\nwas intending to be helpful. They thought that 2255 was a\nbetter rubric. Why I don't know. It isn't clear even\nnow. The -- the district judge in the end I -- didn't he\nsay I'll treat it as both?\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor. He -- he said that\nhe would treat it as seeking relief under both rule 33 and\n2255. Mr. Castro, in his brief in response to the\nGovernment's brief, stated that I didn't file a -- a 2255\nand I object to it being characterized or considered as\nseeking relief under 2255. But there was no argument on\nthe point, and it was never anything that -- where\nargument was presented other than through the briefs on\nthat issue.\nQUESTION: And what -- at what point did Mr.\nCastro get representation? Not at this stage he didn't\nhave any lawyer.\nMR. FRICK: Absolutely not, Your Honor. We --\nwe were not appointed by the court until this matter had\ngone before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals who\nvacated the opinion of the district court and remanded it\nbecause the -- now we're talking about the subsequently\nfiled 2255. The -- the first titled 2255 that was filed\nseveral years later. It was not until that was on appeal\nthat the Eleventh Circuit appointed counsel -- had the\ndistrict court appoint counsel.\nQUESTION: So throughout the original rule --\nMR. FRICK: Totally pro se.\nQUESTION: And even when he -- his first styled\n2255, he was still pro se until that one went up on\nappeal.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: And pro se, Castro filed an appeal\nfrom the merits determination of the district court?\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: But didn't raise, as an issue, the\ntreatment of his -- the recharacterization --\nMR. FRICK: That is correct.\nQUESTION: -- to also consider --\nMR. FRICK: That was not raised -- that was not\nraised as an issue by him at that point in time.\nQUESTION: And what are we to make of that?\nMR. FRICK: Your Honor, I would suggest that we\nmake nothing of it. The Government has suggested that\nthis places this case under one of three things. It's law\nof the case, or if the Court doesn't buy law of the case,\nthen look at either waiver or forfeiture to the extent\nthat there may be some difference between those two\nparticular things.\nQUESTION: At the time Mr. Castro appealed, had\nAEDPA been enacted?\nMR. FRICK: At the time that he appealed?\nQUESTION: Mm-hum. We can find it out.\nMR. FRICK: I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. FRICK: We -- we have two or three different\nappeals.\nQUESTION: I thought, frankly, that he had\nappealed in March of 1996 and AEDPA was enacted in April.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor. At page 147 of the\njoint appendix there's a March 19th, 1996 Eleventh Circuit\naffirmance of the district court denial of the rule 33\nmotion for new trial, and in that order the court states\nthat this is an appeal from the denial of relief in regard\nto a combined motion to vacate, set aside, or correct\nsentence, 2255, and motion for new trial.\nOf course, it is our contention that that\nstatement is not actually accurate because there had never\nbeen a motion filed by anyone seeking relief under 2255.\nIt had simply been a characterization.\nQUESTION: Now, that -- that would mean that\nwhen the district court decided to treat this as being\nunder either or both of those provisions, it was doing him\nno harm, AEDPA not yet being in existence. Is that right?\nMR. FRICK: I believe that that was the -- yes,\nYour Honor. I believe that is -- that is correct from the\nstandpoint --\nQUESTION:\nAEDPA that caused the recharacterization to be harmful to\nhim.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor, and not only that,\nbut not only was this a pre-AEDPA filing of the rule 33\nplus recharacterization at that time, it was a denial of\nthe -- that relief, that joint relief, pre-AEDPA.\nQUESTION: What do you make of the argument on\nthe other side that although, of course, there was no\nAEDPA at that point, we did have a -- a structure of -- of\nrules governing abuse of the writ and second and\nsuccessive petitions and that he would have -- he would\nhave run afoul of those rules, or at least there was\nreason to be concerned that he might run afoul of those\nrules, and therefore, the enactment of AEDPA really\nshouldn't make any difference in our analysis?\nMR. FRICK: Well, Your Honor, I -- the\nGovernment's brief seems to pretty much equate abuse of\nthe writ with the restrictions placed under 2255.\nQUESTION: And I'll -- I'll stipulate here that\nthey're -- you know, they're not exactly identical. But\nthe argument is your concern basically here with the\nunfairness of tagging him with an earlier petition, and\nit's unfair because of the -- the consequences under\nAEDPA. And they're saying it would have been just as\nunfair or just as fair in the pre-AEDPA law. It's a\nfairness argument. What do -- what do you say to that?\nMR. FRICK: Yes, sir. I -- I believe that the\nother circuits of this country, courts of appeals, have\naddressed the difference between the abuse of the writ and\nthe impact of having filed an initial 2255 under AEDPA and\nhaving that.\nQUESTION: Right. What -- what do you say?\nWhat do you say? What's your answer to the Government?\nMR. FRICK: I say that there is a significant\ndifference as stated by those other circuits between the\ndifficulty in getting a second petition filed under abuse\nof the writ. It -- it wasn't as difficult to get a second\npetition filed.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the -- is the basic\ndifference that you have to go to the court of appeals and\nthat's a tough standard, whereas under our prior law, you\n-- you didn't have to go through that step?\nMR. FRICK: That would certainly be one of the\ndifferences, Your Honor. But the recharacterization\nitself in Mr. Castro's case was not to his benefit. There\n-- there's no contention that the Government did it to\nlegally entrap him, but that's the circumstance that he\nultimately found himself in, having had the court\nrecharacterize it, so to speak.\nQUESTION:\nanother point that filing a legitimate -- maybe -- on the\nmerits motion for new trial on ground A and later -- and\n-- and having it denied, then later filing a 2255 on\nground B under our abuse of the writ doctrine -- that\nwould not have been an abuse of the writ, would it?\nMR. FRICK: That's correct, Justice Stevens.\nIt's also important, I believe, to -- to consider that\nwhile Mr. Castro was -- while Mr. Castro was pro se,\nthat's not -- that's not a critical element in connection\nwith this case. These same pitfalls would have befallen\nattorneys representing him with a recharacterization\nproblem as -- as it was done at that time, although I'm\nnot so sure that the Government would have suggested that\nit would not object to it being recharacterized as a 2255\nif there had been counsel on the other side at that time.\nQUESTION: But as far as raising a question on\nappeal, it's more likely, if he had counsel, that the pro\nse prisoner gets to see a document that starts out by\nsaying you made a rule 33 motion, and the bottom line is,\nas you pointed out, your motion is denied, and that 2255\ncomes up only in the body of the opinion. That is\nsomething that a lawyer is far more likely to spot than a\npro se prisoner who sees I made a motion under rule 33,\nand the bottom line of this judgment is my motion is\ndenied.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor. That's correct.\nQUESTION: Would he have been able to appeal the\ntrial court's treatment of it as -- as under the habeas\nprovision? Would he have been able to appeal? I mean,\nthe Government says it's law of the case because he should\nhave appealed it. He -- he was the --\nMR. FRICK: Your Honor, I don't know what point\nhe would have appealed. The -- the district court's\nconsideration of the motion throughout the entire motion\nused the analysis of -- of Brady and Giglio in reaching\nthe point that his motion for new trial should be denied.\nThere was one brief remark about 2255 and the\nconstitutional application in it, but it was not, in\neffect, necessary to the decision that the court rendered.\nAnd therefore, I do not believe that law of the case\napplied.\nQUESTION: Well, even -- even if it wasn't\nnecessary, he would have had to go to appeal saying I\nagree with the judgment below. I should have been denied\nrelief. But I want you to write an opinion saying that it\nwas wrong for the court to treat this -- I mean, the\nnormal appellate judge would say, look it, you know, you\nhave nothing to complain about if you agree that you\nshould have been denied relief under the other one.\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nYour Honor, the -- the question presented before\nthis Court is not quite as narrow in our view as looking\nspecifically at the facts of this case, with it being a\npre-AEDPA when most of the other circuit cases are post-\nAEDPA, both in the recharacterization phase and in the\nfiling of a first titled 2255. The question that we were\nasked pertaining to this Court dealt with when a first\npost-conviction motion is recharacterized sua sponte as a\n2255, is a subsequent first titled 2255 rendered second or\nsuccessive under the AEDPA. The -- the answer to that is\nno in our opinion.\nBut the significance and the point I wanted to\nmake there is that the Government's contention that we've\ngot a law of the case issue -- law of the case is very --\nI'm not sure exactly what the law of the case is going to\nultimately result in other than the determination that\nthere had been a recharacterization sua sponte as a 2255.\nAnd under that circumstance that's what we're here arguing\nabout.\nQUESTION: One thing you might touch on, Mr.\nFrick, during the course, the Government contends we don't\nhave jurisdiction over this petition. Perhaps you might\nwant to discuss that --\nMR. FRICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- at some point.\nMR. FRICK: Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist.\nUnder Stillert -- excuse me -- Stewart v.\nMartinez-Villareal and Slack v. McDaniel, this Court has\nalready made the determination that it has jurisdiction to\nconsider and review a circuit court of appeals' decision\npertaining to whether or not a first titled 2255 is second\nor successive following recharacterization. Both of those\ncases dealt with that issue. They were different fact\nsituations, but the bottom line was this Court took\njurisdiction under those cases to consider the issue of\nsuccessive or second petition under AEDPA.\nIn addition, a -- an actual look at the statute,\n28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E), which is in the appendix of the\nGovernment's brief, appendix 2a, that is the statute that\nthe Government contends shows that this Court does not\nhave jurisdiction. What that particular section deals\nwith is a proscription against this Court having\njurisdiction when a court of appeals has granted or denied\na request for authorization for a district court to\nconsider a second or successive petition. That is a\nrecognition on the part -- the statute recognizes that\nthere has been a first 2255 so characterized as such, so\npleaded as such by the petitioner, and that he has then\ncome before them with what he recognizes is a second\nmotion, and he's going to the court of appeals and saying,\nunder AEDPA there are restrictions that we have not had\nbefore, and I am required to come before you and meet\ncertain gatekeeping requirements in order for the district\ncourt to hear my second or successive petition. There is\nno first 2255 for a second -- for -- for the first titled\n2255 to be successive to or to be second to. And\ntherefore, section 2244(b)(3)(E) is not applicable.\nNow, the Government's argument in that regard is\nthat because the Eleventh Circuit looked at the appeal and\nsaid, you don't meet the gatekeeping requirements, that\nthat determination that it did not meet the gatekeeping\nrequirements was a further sua sponte determination and\nrecharacterization of his appeal into a request for\ncertificate of authorization, and that therefore, under\nthat scenario, 2244(b)(3)(E) should serve as a bar to\njurisdiction. We strongly suggest, Your Honors, that that\nis not the case.\nThe AEDPA and the -- changed jurisdiction. It\n-- it limited this Court's jurisdiction to review very\nimportant habeas corpus -- habeas petitions, and in so, it\nshould be strictly construed. The Government would have a\nfurther sua sponte recharacterization in this chain and\nprevent this Court from having jurisdiction to even hear\nthe matter.\nQUESTION:\nthough, you don't even have to read strict construction.\nYou -- I think it's your view, isn't it, that subsection\n(E) just doesn't speak to the question whether we have\njurisdiction over a decision by a court of appeals as to\nwhether or not a particular petition is second or\nsuccessive?\nMR. FRICK: That is correct, Your Honor. I was\nsimply addressing the Government's position in trying to\ncraft a -- a way under 2244(b)(3)(E) to prevent this Court\nfrom having jurisdiction of the matter.\nQUESTION: Mr. Frick, the other -- some of the\nother courts of appeals have given the district court\ninstructions about how they should deal with cases of\nrecharacterization.\nMR. FRICK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Those tests are not identical. Of\nthe array of instructions to district judges to deal with\nthis situation, which do you think is the soundest\napproach?\nMR. FRICK: Your Honor, I believe that the --\nthe Second Circuit Adams case sets forth probably the best\nbright line test, that being that the petitioner -- that\n-- that when a court has a petition that it thinks would\nbetter be served as recharacterized, that they should\ninform the petitioner first that they believe it should be\nrecharacterized in order for them to grant relief, that it\nshould be recharacterized as a 2255, obtain the consent of\nthe petitioner, and if they don't obtain the consent of\nthe petitioner, then offer the petitioner the opportunity\nto withdraw the petition and file it at a later point in\ntime, assuming that it can be refiled at some point in\ntime, and not be -- not run into problems with the statute\nof limitations, or at least tell the petitioner that it is\ngoing to consider this recharacterized and they've got 5\ndays, 10 days to add any other constitutional claims that\nwould appropriately be brought under a 2255 before they\nwill rule on it so that --\nQUESTION: Is recharacterization done only with\npro se litigants? If I were an attorney, I'm not sure I'd\nbe terribly happy to have a lawyer -- to have the judge\nsay, well, this is the wrong kind of writ, I'm going to\ntreat it thus.\nMR. FRICK: Chief Justice Rehnquist, there are\ncircumstances I understand, not from personal knowledge,\nwhere recharacterization does take place in spite of the\nfact that there is an attorney. But the actual process\nand -- and the recharacterizations that have taken place\nover the years have been for the benefit of a pro se\nprisoner.\nYour Honor, I know --\nQUESTION: But -- but you -- you want us to\nsimply adopt a rule for what happens, what warnings have\nto be given, what requirements have to be met, when\nthere's recharacterization. You're not asking us to go\nfurther and say when recharacterization is appropriate.\nMR. FRICK: I think when recharacterization is\nappropriate, it's appropriate.\nQUESTION: You're not asking us to address the\n-- the --\nMR. FRICK: Yes, Your Honor. I think that --\nthat the issue of recharacterization should continue to\ncome up. It should continue to benefit pro se prisoners\nin particular and prisoners in general, but it should only\nbe done under circumstances where the particular petition\nthat has been filed is inadequate or ineptly pleaded and\ncannot be considered, under which circumstance it should\njust then be dismissed, as the Palmer case in the D.C.\nCircuit has suggested. Let the petitioner be the master\nof his own motion or petition.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Frick.\nMr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court lacks jurisdiction to review the\ncourt of appeals' decision because the court of appeals\ndenied authorization to file a second or successive 2255\nmotion.\nQUESTION: But that's only if you know that it's\na second or a successive petition.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Stevens, the\ninterpretive question we think that's presented, as far as\nthe jurisdictional issue goes, is whether a denial of\nauthorization is simply a finding that the gatekeeping\nrequirements have not been satisfied or rather whether it\nencompasses both that determination and the subsidiary\ndetermination that the motion is in fact second or\nsuccessive. It's our position that it is a single order\nencompassing both.\nQUESTION: Is -- is it your view that the Court\nwould never have jurisdiction to review a determination by\na court of appeals that a petition was or was not a second\nor successive?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. There -- there are two\ncircumstances when it can. One is the Martinez-Villareal\nsituation, and there this Court had jurisdiction because\nthe court of appeals found that the motion was not second\nor successive and so didn't grant or deny authorization.\nSo it didn't fall within 2244(b)(3)(E).\nThe second situation will be one where the court\nof appeals finds that the motion is second or successive\nand doesn't go on to reach --\nQUESTION: So our jurisdiction depends on how\nthe court of appeals resolved the issue.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. It depends upon,\nas the statute makes clear, whether there was a grant or\ndenial of authorization.\nQUESTION: I don't understand your second\ninstance.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: The second instance -- let me\nback up to try to answer that as clearly as I can.\nThe ordinary case where a court of appeals is\nable to address the question whether the district court\nproperly found that a motion was second or successive is a\ncase where a motion for authorization to file the motion\nis filed in a court of appeals. That's because in many\ncircuits, once a district court finds that a motion is\nsecond or successive, it's obligated to transfer the case\nto the court of appeals so it can make the gatekeeping\ndetermination. And even in cases where a district court\nis permitted to dismiss and does rather than transfer, and\nonce it's found that the motion is second or successive,\nit's going to be a rare case where the defendant is able\nto take an appeal from the dismissal because under this\nCourt's decision in Slack v. McDaniel, he'll only be able\nto get a certificate of appealability if he makes two\nshowings: first, that the procedural ruling that it was\nsecond or successive is subject to debate among reasonable\njurists; and in addition to that, that there was some\nunderlying constitutional claim that has arguable merit.\nSo in a rare circumstance, when an appeal can be\ntaken on the issue of whether the motion is second or\nsuccessive, and in the rare circumstance where the court\nof appeals, after affirming that finding, does not go on\nto reach the gatekeeping issue, as courts of appeals often\ndo just to bring the case to a close, that will be the\nrare case where there has been a court of appeals' finding\nthat the motion is second or successive, but yet no grant\nor denial such that 2244(b)(3)(E) does not deprive this\nCourt of jurisdiction.\nThat is not this case.\nQUESTION: So in any case, your view is no\nmatter how absurd, if a -- the court of appeals says a\n60(b) motion is second or successive, if they say a\ncomplaint in a 1983 action is a second or successive\nhabeas petition, no matter how absurd, once the court of\nappeals says this is a second or successive application,\nnobody has any right to appeal here, even though that\nisn't what the statute says.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: So long as there is a grant or\ndenial of authorization, the court of appeals' decision\ncannot be second-guessed.\nQUESTION: Now, why would we -- why would we\ninterpret a statute that doesn't say that to -- what it\nsays is, it says that they shall not file a second or\nsuccessive application, in other words, if it is a second\nor successive application. It doesn't say if it isn't.\nIt doesn't tell us what to do if it isn't. So why would\nwe adopt this interpretation that you say where the\nstatute doesn't say it, which would perhaps deprive people\nof all kinds of right to petition the Supreme Court in\ncases where they might be right?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: The interpretive question is\nwhether a denial of authorization under 2244(b)(3)(E) is\nsimply a finding that the gatekeeping requirements haven't\nbeen satisfied or whether it's both that and the\nsubsidiary finding that the motion is second or\nsuccessive. Nobody would take the position I think that\nif the court of appeals finds the gatekeeping requirements\nnot satisfied and therefore denies authorization, and yet\nmanifestly errs in so finding, this Court would,\nnevertheless, have jurisdiction to review it. There's no\nmanifest error exception to 2244(b)(3)(E).\nQUESTION: Well, but that's -- you -- you call\nit a subsidiary question, whether or not it's second or\nsuccessive. You want to reach the gatekeeping question\nfirst. That's not the way the statute reads.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, we think it is.\nQUESTION: And why isn't it -- why isn't it a\npredicate? You read the statute. So it says the denial\nor grant of an authorization by the court of appeals to\nfile what the court of appeals finds is a second or\nsuccessive petition, but that's not what the statute says.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We think the statute does say\nthat, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons. The first is that\n2244(b)(3)(E) speaks at -- speaks of a denial of\nauthorization. If Congress had intended that to mean only\na finding that the gatekeeping requirements had -- had not\nbeen satisfied, it could have used narrower language, as\nindeed it did in 2244(b)(3)(C) which refers specifically\nto the gatekeeping requirements. We think that's the\nfirst textual indication that our position is correct.\nThe second textual indication is that in\n2244(b)(3)(A) and (b)(3)(B), Congress speaks of an order\nauthorizing the district court to consider the\napplication. We think it's reasonable to view an order\ngranting or denying an authorization to be synonymous with\n2244(b)(3)(E)'s reference to a grant or denial of\nauthorization.\nQUESTION: Well, at the very least, if the\nstatute is ambiguous, it seems to me you have to answer\nJustice Breyer's concern that an erroneous determination\nhere can foreclose the petitioner from exercising some\nvery important rights.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Our view is that the statute is\nnot ambiguous. After applying all the relevant tools of\nstatutory construction, the best reading of it is that\nCongress intended to include the subsidiary determination\nwhen it said that this Court may not review a denial of\nauthorization.\nQUESTION: Sometimes there might be a\nconstitutional question. I mean, where for example an\nopinion appealed to this Court might be required as a\nmatter of due process and what the lower court does, the\ncourt of appeals -- it -- it erroneously characterizes\nthat effort to come to the -- that effort to appeal, which\nthe Constitution would protect. It erroneously\ncharacterizes it as a second or successive petition, and\nin your view Congress would have just said, even however\nerroneous it is, it can't come here. What do we do about\nthe constitutional requirement?\nMR. HIMMELFARB:\nimagine a case where there is a very serious\nconstitutional claim raised, but there's absolutely no\ndispute that it's being raised in a second or successive\nmotion, and the defendant can't satisfy at the substantive\ngatekeeping requirements. The court of appeals says it's\nsecond or successive. You don't satisfy the gatekeeping\nrequirements. We deny authorization. I don't think\nanyone would take the view that under 2244(b)(3)(E) that\ndefendant would, nevertheless, be able to seek certiorari\nfrom this Court. So the whole point of 2244(b)(3)(E) is\nto give the court of appeals the final say.\nQUESTION: And one final thing. You realize the\nlanguage, of course, says that you cannot ask for cert\nfrom the denial of an authorization by a court of appeals\nto file a second or successive application. And your\nopponents are saying we're not appealing the denial of the\nrequest to file a second or successive application. We\nare appealing the determination that this is a second or\nsuccessive application, a matter that the statute is\nsilent about.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: What my opponent is appealing\nis the court of appeals' decision, which is a single\norder, which does two things. It affirms the district\ncourt's finding that the motion was second or successive,\nand then goes on repeatedly to say that under AEDPA's\ngatekeeping requirements, he may not file it. The court\nof appeals denied authorization to file the motion under\n2244(b)(3)(E). This Court lacks jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: But what do you say to his point that\nhe didn't even try to file a -- try to seek an\nauthorization to file a second or successive because he\nnever thought it was a second or successive? He did not\nseek authorization to file such a motion.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: So how can you have denied such an\nauthorization?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it's -- as -- as I've\nsaid, the ordinary way that a defendant is able to\nchallenge a district court's determination that his motion\nis second or successive in the court of appeals is not via\nappeal because ordinarily either the case has been\ntransferred or he can't get a certificate of\nappealability. So he does it in the context of an\nauthorization motion. And in that case, the court of\nappeals may find --\nQUESTION: But, of course, he didn't file an\nauthorization motion in this case.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true. That brings me to\nmy second point. In many cases within the category of the\nrare case where a defendant is able to take an appeal from\na dismissal of a motion as second or successive, after the\ncourt of appeals affirms the finding that the motion is\nsecond or successive, it will often go on to treat the\nappeal as an implied request for authorization to file the\nmotion because otherwise you've got a lingering question\nof whether this motion found to be second or successive\ncan or cannot be filed, and it will reach that question\njust to bring the matter to a close.\nIt's our position, of course, that if the Court\ndoes have jurisdiction, the court of appeals' decision\nshould be affirmed. The district court treated\npetitioner's first post-conviction motion as one that\nsought relief under two different provisions of Federal\nlaw, rule 33 --\nQUESTION: Why didn't the U.S. attorney who\nsaid, Your Honor, I don't object -- this is a rule 33\nmotion, but introduced 2255. Why didn't the assistant\nU.S. attorney advise the pro se litigant of the\nconsequences of that recharacterization? If the U.S.\nattorney is going to take a pleading that a prisoner puts\nin and says this is my rule 33 motion and for whatever\nbenign purpose, the assistant U.S. attorney thinks it\nwould be in the interest of justice to treat it as a 2255,\ndidn't someone have an obligation to alert the prisoner of\nthe consequences of that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Ginsburg, we do not\ndefend what was done in the district court in connection\nwith the first post -- post-conviction motion. We do not\ntake the position --\nQUESTION: Well, wasn't that all -- didn't that\noccur before AEDPA had been passed?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Yes, it did, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Were there the same consequences then\nas there were post-AEDPA?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: In -- in some respects they\nwere the same; in some respects they were different. We\nthink, for relevant purposes, they were the same. This\nCourt has characterized the abuse of the writ doctrine,\nwhich of course predated AEDPA, as a modified res judicata\nrule. A slightly less modified res judicata rule is\ncodified in AEDPA. But at least since McCleskey v. Zant,\nwhich is a 1991 decision, a prisoner was presumptively\nentitled to file only one 2255 motion. The showing he\nwould have to make to be able to file a second one was\nslightly different and slightly easier to make than it is\npost --\nQUESTION: Well, he -- he never -- he did not in\nthe district court file such a motion. He filed this rule\n33(b) thing, that the Government then volunteered it\nwouldn't mind if the court treated as a 2255 and the\ndistrict court treated it as such. It was not Castro's\nurging.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice O'Connor,\nand --\nQUESTION: And there was no enactment at that\ntime of AEDPA.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That -- that is true as well.\nWe do not take the position that the motion was properly\ncharacterized as a 2255 motion. We take two positions.\nOne is that the Court may not reach that question because\nit lacks jurisdiction, and second, that if the Court does\nhave jurisdiction, it should not reach that question\nbecause there was a forfeiture. The characterization\ncould have been appealed, but wasn't.\nQUESTION: Well, this -- this business of having\na court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a\ndoctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA\nwas enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of\nAEDPA have decided that if they're going -- if the\ndistrict court is going to do that, that some notice\nshould be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about\nthe consequences of that recharacterization. Now, should\nwe propose such a rule or adopt such a rule in our\nsupervisory capacity?\nMR. HIMMELFARB:\nobjection in principle to requiring that -- to -- to a\nrule requiring that a district court provide a defendant\nwith notice before characterizing a post-conviction motion\nas a 2255 motion. Our position is that --\nQUESTION: If we were to do it, which -- which\nversion would be the best?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I'll answer that\nquestion. Before I do, I just want to make clear that our\nposition is that this is not an appropriate case to do\nthat because our view is that any objection to notice,\neither a lack of notice or an inadequate -- inadequacy of\nnotice has to be made in connection with a motion that's\ncharacterized. And once you get to a subsequent stage of\nthe litigation, it's too late for that to happen.\nQUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, the -- the reality is\nwe have a pro se litigant who loses in the district court.\nHe gets a piece of paper that says, your motion under rule\nis now being disposed of, and then the bottom line\nsays, your motion is denied. Do you really think that a\npro se litigant forfeits his rights to raise what may be a\nvery important substantive question on habeas because he\ndidn't know to look to the body of the opinion that said\nsomething about 2255 and that that's a forfeiture? I\nmean, even a lawyer might have missed it when the thing\nstarts out, this is a rule 33 motion, motion denied.\nThat's what you're urging, that that kind of\nforfeiture be visited on a pro se prisoner who was\nuncounseled and never appeared before any court to be told\nanything. That strikes me as the Government not turning\nsquare corners.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Ginsburg, we don't\nthink that's the case at all. There is, of course, no\nright to counsel in connection with post-conviction\nlitigation and the vast majority of --\nQUESTION: The right to know the consequences of\nwhat you're doing. You can -- a forfeiture is usually\n33\nknowing. Here, this litigant had no reason to know about\nanything other than he was appealing from the denial of\nhis rule 33 motion.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the defendant in this\ncase, petitioner, did litigate the question of\ncharacterization. When the Government in its opposition\nto his rule 33 motion recommended that it be treated as\nboth a rule 33 motion and a 2255 motion, in his reply he\nobjected. He took the position that it should not be\ntreated as a 2255 motion and should be treated only as a\nrule 33 motion. So he was aware of -- of what was being\ndone and he felt that it was a significant enough decision\nthat it should be litigated, and he objected.\nOur position is that he should have continued to\nobject. AEDPA imposes all types of restrictions on post-\nconviction litigation.\nQUESTION: Yes, but my question to you is, did\nhe have any reason to know? You say he put in his\nobjection, yes. Then he gets a document that only in the\nbody refers to 2255. Why couldn't he reasonably see that\npiece of paper as saying, you filed a rule 33 motion, your\nmotion is denied? I mean, you are loading a lot onto a\npro se litigant who has never appeared before any court.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We don't think that the fact\nthat he is pro se should have any part in the analysis\nbecause that would create all sorts of difficulties in\nother AEDPA cases where you have difficult questions,\nparticularly difficult, perhaps byzantine, procedural\nrules that a petitioner is obligated to follow.\nQUESTION: Well, usually courts do their best\nwhen they deal with pro se litigants to have them\nunderstand what's going on. I mean, we have all kinds of\nprocedures in our criminal justice system just to assure\nthat people will understand what the rules are and what\nthe pitfalls are.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Ginsburg.\nAEDPA is not one of those statutes. Once a -- a defendant\nwho files a self --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you're not relying on AEDPA\non this branch of the case. We're back before the days of\nAEDPA. You're saying because he didn't in his appeal from\nthe denial of the rule 33 motion say, and P.S., court of\nappeals, there was a mischaracterization -- all of that\nhappened before AEDPA, and that's what you're holding him\nto.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Ginsburg,\nbut even before AEDPA, the rules governing post-conviction\nlitigation could be quite difficult to navigate, and even\nbefore AEDPA, most post-conviction litigation was carried\nout pro se. There are two different places in -- in the\ndistrict court --\nQUESTION: But you just -- you just agreed. You\nsaid you had no reservation about what these other courts\nhave said must go on in the district courts. You just\ndon't think that this is a proper case because there's no\njurisdiction. But you -- you are recognizing that courts,\nwanting to do justice, do and should inform litigants of\nthe consequences.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Ginsburg, I don't want\nto leave the Court with that impression. I think I\nstarted to answer another Justice's question and in -- in\nanswering it, I said that in principle we have no\nobjection to a rule requiring notice before\nrecharacterization.\nQUESTION: In principle, you have no objection.\nWhat about in practice?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: In practice as well. It's the\nnature of the notice that I wanted to say a little bit\nmore about. Some of the decisions on which petitioner\nrelies have -- have language in them that not only --\nsuggesting that not only must the defendant be notified\nthat the district court plans to treat the motion as a\n2255 motion, but also that he be warned of its\nconsequences. We have no objection insofar as there's a\nrequirement that he be notified of how it would be\ntreated.\nWe don't think there should be warnings about\nthe consequences. Once a defendant is notified that the\nmotion is going to be treated as a 2255 motion, he stands\nin no different position from somebody who's filed a self-\nstyled 2255 motion, and the law has never required that\nthat --\nQUESTION: Is -- is there one of the circuits\nthat has taken the position that you, in principle and in\npractice, would say is a sound one?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think if -- if we had to\nchoose, we would prefer the Third Circuit's rule under\nwhich essentially there are three options when a post-\nconviction motion, not styled a 2255 motion, is filed.\nThe defendant has the option of having it ruled upon as\nfiled. He can be given notice that it's going to be\nrecharacterized, and it will be recharacterized, or he can\nwithdraw it so that he will not be prevented from filing a\nsecond --\nQUESTION: See, do you think on that -- that --\nyou're now answering Justice O'Connor's question which is\njust what I was interested in. On page 42 of your brief,\nyou basically say that on the substantive rule here, you\nagree with the other side. I mean, pretty much. And\nthat's what all the circuits have done. And then you\nimpose a couple of procedural obstacles.\nWell, assume you don't win your procedural\nobstacles. All right. Suppose I find and the Court finds\nthat this is appealable, and suppose this law of the case\nthing is -- you say -- why shouldn't he have the advantage\nof the rule, this particular person, the rule that we're\nabout to announce?\nNow, at that point, I want to know what rule are\nwe about to announce under what power. And here I'd like\nyour opinion on two approaches which are different.\nOne is we announce a rule on our supervisory\nauthority, as most of the courts have done, and then we\nhave two difficulties. One, we're in an area we know not\nwhat. You know, we're not involved in recharacterization\nas a daily basis. And moreover, we're not sure what rule\nto pick or what exact formulation, which will make a huge\ndifference.\nNow, the other approach is the First Circuit's\napproach, which is not the reason it commends itself to\nme, but I just put it out there. And that is to say we\ninterpret the words, second or successive petition, in\nAEDPA not to include this. You see, what they were\ntalking about in Congress was not this. They didn't think\na second or successive petition was second or successive\nwhere the first one took place under these no-warning\ncircumstances before AEDPA was even enacted. Now, I think\nthey come to exactly the same place, but that second\napproach, which they followed, doesn't get us into the\nbusiness of writing rules in some kind of supervisory\ncapacity in the dark.\nNow -- but I want the SG's view, i.e., your\nview, on the comparative merits of those two ways of\ngetting to the same place. And I'm really uncertain. I\n-- I'd be very interested in what you think.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Our view is that the First\nCircuit's view, which does not require notice but simply\nsays that if there is no notice, the second motion is\ndeemed to be a first motion, should not be adopted because\nwe think it's inconsistent with the basic principle of\npost-conviction litigation, which we're urging this Court\nto adopt in this case, that you have to file your\nchallenges to rulings made against you at the earliest\npossible opportunity. The First Circuit's rule, in\neffect, gives the defendant a right to file a later\nappeal.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I think you're missing --\nsay -- say the same content. Let's have equivalent\ncontent to the rule. Is it better for us to -- to say\nwe're reading AEDPA or is it better for us to say we are\n-- which is open to the -- this kind of reading. We have\nto decide the scope of those words in the -- in the block\nof AEDPA. Or is it better for us to try to write a rule?\nThat -- that's what I'm interested in. I can work out the\nrest of the content, and actually the First Circuit\napproach needn't have a content. I mean, it can really\nhave quite a minimal content, but -- but that's what I'm\ninterested in.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We don't --\nQUESTION: Am I being clear? Do you understand\nit?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Yes. We don't AEDPA can\nreasonably be read to say that a 2255 motion is one that\nis characterized as not filed as one, but is characterized\none after notice, and that if there's no notice, it's not\na 2255 motion. Our position on notice is that it's\nessentially an adjunct of the prior decision to\nrecharacterize.\nAnd I want to be clear. Recharacterization,\nparticularly in a post-AEDPA world, does not benefit only\nthe defendant, a defendant who might be able -- might not\nbe able to get his claim ruled upon if it's not\nrecharacterized.\nQUESTION: I'm sure that's right, but you -- you\nthink we should go into the rule-writing business, say, in\nour supervisory capacity. These -- these rules -- this\nkind -- this is the consequence that attaches to\nrecharacterization. A recharacterization is not a\nrecharacterization that fits within AEDPA unless it gets\nnotice, et cetera, et cetera. That's what you think we\nought to do.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No.\nQUESTION: If we -- I know you don't really, but\nI mean, if we get to that point and we've -- we reject\nyour other two.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: To the extent that the Court\nwishes to impose a notice requirement, our view is that it\nshould go essentially like this. It is important to\nrecharacterize a post-conviction motion not styled a 2255\nmotion if it seeks relief available only under 2255. It's\nimportant because it can help the defendant. It's also\nimportant because if it's not recharacterized, you run the\nrisk that Congress' clear purpose to prohibit second or\nsuccessive post-conviction motions could be evaded.\nWe -- that -- that is essentially a judge-made\nrule, recharacterization. We think, as a matter of\nfairness and also as a matter of reducing potential\nlitigation, it is appropriate, once you've got the judge-\nmade rule that says you should recharacterize, to go\nfurther and say, before you do, notice has to be given.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't it -- wouldn't it be much\nsimpler just to say if a district court recharacterizes,\nit must do this without going into when or why you should\nrecharacterize?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It probably -- I think it\nwould, Mr. Chief Justice.\nthere's going to be a recharacterization and there's going\nto be notice, the only notice should be I plan to\nrecharacterize. We don't think that the district court\nshould give any kinds of warnings about the consequences\nof recharacterization for the reasons I gave Justice\nGinsburg.\nQUESTION: But didn't the -- doesn't that --\nisn't that included in the Third Circuit formulation?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think it may well be. I\nthink most of the courts of appeals take the view that you\nshould not only give notice of the intent to\nrecharacterize, you should also give some sort of warnings\nabout the consequences of the --\nQUESTION: Why do you want --\nQUESTION: You should give an opportunity to --\nto say I'll withdraw my petition or I'll amend my petition\nto say everything that I could say under the heading of\n2255.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Our view is that giving notice\nof an intent to recharacterize puts the defendant in the\nsame position as one who filed a self-styled 2255, and\nunder the law of post-conviction litigation, such a\ndefendant is held responsible for the consequences of\nfiling that motion.\nQUESTION: That's not the position that any of\nthe circuits have taken.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that -- I think that's\nprobably right. I think they -- to the extent they\nrequire notice, within that notice, they think there\nshould be some warning about the consequences of\ncharacterization. We think that that can't be reconciled\nwith the fact that there's a detailed procedural scheme\ngoverning post-conviction motions and Congress said\nnothing about warnings as it did, for example, in the\ncontext --\nQUESTION: Isn't there a difference between a\ncase in which a litigant makes up his mind to file a 2255\n-- presumably he should have found out what's the\nconsequence of that -- and the situation in which he files\nsomething else and the judge says, I'm going to change it?\nHow does he know what the consequences are if he hasn't\nhad a chance to think it through?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Stevens, the way we\nenvision the regime working is that the motion is filed\nand the district court issues an order which it serves on\nparties, giving notice that it intends to recharacterize\nand some amount of time will elapse before the defendant\nis obligated to come back to the court and tell the court\nwhether it wishes for the court to go forward with\nrecharacterization or allow him to withdraw. So within\nthat period of --\nQUESTION: But you would say the\nrecharacterization could not take place until after there\nwas that time -- notice and a time to accept or object to\nit.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. I think that's\nreasonably encompassed --\nQUESTION: Which, of course, didn't happen here.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's true. No notice was\ngiven here.\nQUESTION: The -- the point of implausibility I\n-- I have with your argument is that when the district --\nyour argument to the effect that no notice of consequence\nneeds to be given, merely a notice that recharacterization\nwill take place. The -- the point is that when a point\ndoes that, the court is understood to be trying to help\nout the defendant. Whether the court puts it in precisely\nthose words or not, that's -- that's the object. The --\nthe court, in effect, is saying, look, I'm going to help\nyou here because you don't know how to plead this stuff,\nand -- and I'm going to recharacterize this as under 2255.\nIt seems very odd for the court, in effect, to\nbe in the position of saying, I'm going to help you out by\nrecharacterizing and at the same time keep its mouth shut\nabout the fact that when it does recharacterize, the\nconsequence is going to be that that fellow is going to be\nout on his ear if he ever wants to walk in with another\nclaim that could have been made under 2255. It seems to\nme that if courts are going to help, they've got to help\nin a -- in a way that does not mislead the defendant, and\nyour argument says they can help, as it were, in a way\nthat does mislead him.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Souter, the -- the\npurpose of helping defendants is not the only reason for\nrecharacterization. It also serves the interest of\nvindicating Congress' purpose in enacting the bar on\nsecond or successive motions in AEDPA. It vindicates --\nthis Court made that clear --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.\nMr. Frick, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nMR. FRICK: Your Honor, if there are no further\nquestions, we would waive rebuttal.\n"
