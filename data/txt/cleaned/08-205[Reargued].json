The Federal Election Commission.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nRobust debate about candidates for elective\noffice is the most fundamental value protected by the\nFirst Amendment's guarantee of free speech. Yet that is\nprecisely the dialogue that the government has\nprohibited if practiced by unions or corporations, any\nunion or any corporation.\nThe government claims it may do so based\nupon the Austin decision that corporate speech is by its\nnature corrosive and distorting because it might not\nreflected actual public support for the views expressed\nby the corporation. The government admits that that\nradical concept of requiring public support for the\nspeech before you can speak would even authorize it to\ncriminalize books and signs.\nThis Court needs no reminding that the\ngovernment when it is acting to prohibit, particularly\nwhen it is acting to criminalize, speech that is at the\nvery core of the First Amendment has a heavy burden to\nprove that there is a compelling governmental interest\nthat -- that justifies that prohibition and that the\nregulation adopted, in this case a criminal statute, is\nthe most narrowly tailored necessary to accomplish that\ncompelling governmental interest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, are you taking\nthe position that there is no difference in the First\nAmendment rights of an individual? A corporation, after\nall, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable\nrights. So is there any distinction that Congress could\ndraw between corporations and natural human beings for\npurposes of campaign finance?\nMR. OLSON: What the Court has said in the\nFirst Amendment context, New York Times v. Sullivan,\nRose Jean v. Associated Press, and over and over again,\nis that corporations are persons entitled to protection\nunder the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that include --\nMR. OLSON: Now, Justice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that include\ntoday's mega-corporations, where many of the investors\nmay be foreign individuals or entities?\nMR. OLSON: The Court in the past has made\nno distinction based upon the nature of the entity that\nmight own a share of a corporation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Own many shares?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nowadays there are\nforeign interests, even foreign governments, that own\nnot one share but a goodly number of shares.\nMR. OLSON: I submit that the Court's\ndecisions in connection with the First Amendment and\ncorporations have in the past made no such distinction.\nHowever --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they in your view,\nin the view that you are putting forth, that there is no\ndistinction between an individual and a corporation for\nFirst Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation,\neven -- even if most of the investors are from abroad,\nCongress could not limit their spending?\nMR. OLSON: I'm not -- I'm not saying that,\nJustice Ginsburg. I'm saying that the First Amendment\napplies. Then the next step is to determine whether\nCongress and the government has established a compelling\ngovernmental interest and a narrowly tailored remedy to\nthat interest. If the Congress -- and there is no\nrecord of that in this case of which I am aware.\nCertainly the government has not advanced it in its\nbriefs: That there is some compelling governmental\ninterest because of foreign investment in corporations.\nIf there was, then the Court would look at,\ndetermine how serious is that interest, how destructive\nhas it been to the process and whether the -- maybe the\nlimitation would have something to do with the ownership\nof shares of a corporation or some --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think Congress could\nprevent foreign individuals from funding speech in\nUnited States elections?\nMR. OLSON: The -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Private individuals,\nforeigners who -- who want to --\nMR. OLSON: That's, of course, a different\nquestion. I haven't studied it, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not different.\nI asked it because I thought it was related to the\nquestion you were answering.\nMR. OLSON: The fundamental point here is --\nand let me start with this, and I think we should -- we\nshould start with this, and the government hardly\nmentions this.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before you do, Mr. Olson\n--\nMR. OLSON: The language of the First\nAmendment, \"Congress shall make\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson -- Mr. Olson,\nwould you answer Justice Ginsburg's question yes or no?\nCan the -- leaving aside foreign investors, can the --\ncan -- does the First Amendment permit any distinction\nbetween corporate speakers and individual speakers?\nMR. OLSON: I am not -- I'm not aware of a\ncase that just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I am not asking you that.\nI meant in your view does it permit that distinction?\nMR. OLSON: My view is based upon the\ndecisions of this Court and my view would be that unless\nthere is a compelling governmental interest and a\nnarrowly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if there is a\ncompelling government -- can there be any case in which\nthere is a different treatment of corporations and\nindividuals in your judgment?\nMR. OLSON: I would not rule that out,\nJustice Stevens. I mean, there may be. I can't imagine\nall of the infinite varieties of potential problems that\nmight exist, but -- but we would eventually come back to\nthe narrow tailoring problem anyway.\nWhat the government has done here is\nprohibit speech. I don't know how many unions there are\nin this country, but there are something like 6 million\ncorporations that filed tax returns in 2006.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Olson, do you\nthink that media corporations that are owned or\nprincipally owned by foreign shareholders have less\nFirst Amendment rights than other media corporations in\nthe United States?\nMR. OLSON: I don't think so, Justice Alito,\nand certainly there is no record to suggest that there\nis any kind of problem based upon that. And I come back\nto the language of the First Amendment: \"Congress shall\nmake no law.\" Now, what this Court has repeatedly said\nis that there may be laws inhibiting speech if there is\na compelling governmental interest and a narrowly\ntailored remedy. But there is no justification for\nthis.\nI was going to say that 97 percent of the 6\nmillion corporations that filed tax returns in 2006 had\nassets less than $5 million -- assets, not net worth.\nSo we are talking about a prohibition that covers every\ncorporation in the United States, including nonprofit\ncorporations, limited liability corporations, Subchapter\nS corporations and every union in the United States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what are the -- you\nhave used the word \"prohibition,\" Mr. Olson. One answer\nto that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it\nis a question of not whether corporations can contribute\nbut how. They can use PACs and that way we assure that\nthe people who contribute are really supportive of the\nissue, of the candidate.\nBut so the -- the corporation can give, but\nit has to use a PAC.\nMR. OLSON: I respectfully disagree. The\ncorporation may not expend money. It might find people,\nstockholders or officers, who wanted to contribute to a\nseparate fund, who could then speak. That in one -- to\nuse the words of one Justice, that is\nventriloquist-speak. I would say that it is more like\nsurrogate speech. If you can find some other people\nthat will say what you want to say and get them to\ncontribute money through a process that this just --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who is the \"you\"? I mean\ndo you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not\nthe shareholders? We don't know what they think.\nMR. OLSON: Well, this statute is not\nlimited to cases where the shareholders agree or don't\nagree with what the corporation says. As the Court said\nin the Bellotti case, the prohibition would exist\nwhether or not the shareholders agree. But let me go\nback to your question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it covers totally --\ntotally owned corporations, too, doesn't it?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if I owned all the\nstock in a corporation, the corporation still can't --\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And it includes membership\ncorporations such as Citizens United that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the individual\ncontribution also covers people who would like to give\n$2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit. And maybe\nthere are 100 million or 200 million people in the\nUnited States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400,\nnobody could say that that was really an effort to buy\nthe Senator or the Congressman. So is that\nunconstitutional, too?\nMR. OLSON: No -- well, what this Court has\nsaid is that in connection with contribution limitations\nthere is a potential compelling governmental interest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: This is what Buckley says.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: Then that -- in that -- but\nexpenditures, which is what we are talking about today,\ndo not concern the -- the question, the actual threat of\nquid pro quo corruption or the appearance of quid pro\nquo corruption. And you know, Justice Breyer, what the\nCourt said in that case is because it's not inhibiting\nsomeone from actually speaking, it's -- it's giving\nmoney to someone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So here the obvious\nargument is: Look, they said the compelling interest is\nthat people think that representatives are being bought,\nokay? That's to put it in a caricature, but you\nunderstand what I'm driving at, okay? That's what they\nsaid in Buckley v. Valeo. So Congress now says\nprecisely that interest leads us to want to limit the\nexpenditures that corporations can make on\nelectioneering communication in the last 30 days of a\nprimary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not\non books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else. All\nright?\nSo in what respect is there not conceptually\nat least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, I\naccept what the Court said in Buckley, that expenditures\ndo not raise that concern at all. Congress has not made\nthat finding. You are talking -- and you mentioned just\n-- just a matter of radio and television, but in Buckley\nv. Valeo the Court specifically said that that is the\nmost important means of communicating concerning\nelections --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's important --\nMR. OLSON: And the Court used the word\n\"indispensable.\" So what -- and -- and what the Court\nsaid in Buckley v. Valeo is it compared a limitation on\nexpenditures, independent uncoordinated expenditures,\nwith the prohibition that the Court addressed when it\nhad a statute before it that said newspapers couldn't\nendorse candidates on the day of election, and the\nTorneo case, where it required a right of reply to be\ngiven. And the Court said those restrictions, which\nwere unconstitutional, were considerably less, and that\nthe restriction in Buckley v. Valeo on expenditures --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I agree -- I agree\nthat Buckley made the distinction between contributions\nand expenditures, and it seems to me that the\ngovernment's argument necessarily wants to water down\nthat distinction. But in response or just in\nfurtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two\ncases, one in which an officeholder goes to a\ncorporation and says: Will you please give me money?\nThey say: We can't do that.\nThe other is in which a corporation takes\nout an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves\nthat candidate of the responsibility of -- of\nsubstantial television coverage. Isn't that about the\nsame?\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, if\nthere is any coordination --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and I think\nBuckley says no.\nMR. OLSON: Buckley says --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, as a practical\nmatter, is that always true?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it may not always be true.\nIn the infinite potential applications of something like\nthat, Justice Kennedy, anything might possibly be true.\nAnd Justice Breyer said, well, what if Congress thought\nor what if Congress thought the people might think that\nthat was kind of somehow suspect? That is not a basis\nfor prohibiting speech by a whole class of individual --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course, it did --\nwas a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of\ngiving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people\nin the United States. But the point, which I think is\nthe one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we\narguing here between you and my questions, is the\nargument in this case about the existence of a\ncompelling interest? Because Congress seemed to think\nthat there was certainly that; it's this concern about\nthe perception that people are, say, buying candidates.\nAre we arguing about narrow tailoring?\nCongress thought it was narrow tailoring. Or are we\narguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on\nwhether there is enough of a compelling interest and the\ntailoring is narrow enough?\nMR. OLSON: You must always second-guess\nCongress when the First Amendment is in play. And that\nwe are arguing -- we are not -- we are discussing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- both the compelling --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: -- both the compelling\ngovernmental interest and the narrow tailoring, and\nwhat -- what -- there is not a sufficient record. The\nreason --the government has shifted position here. They\nwere, first of all, talking about the so-called\ndistortion rationale in Austin, the distortion rationale\nwhich they seem to have abandoned in the -- in the\nsupplemental briefs filed in connection with this\nargument, and they resorted to the corruption,\nappearance of corruption. There isn't a sufficient\nrecord of this. There isn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the\ndistrict court's finding? Wasn't there a finding before\nthe three-judge court that Federal officials know of and\nfeel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads\nurging their election or the defeat of their opponent?\nThere was a finding of fact to that effect, was there\nnot?\nMR. OLSON: The find -- yes. I -- there is\nsomething to that effect in the district court opinion,\nbut it doesn't cover all corporations. It didn't focus\nin specifically on expenditures.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- so if they just\ncovered large corporations, so you take out the mom and\npop single shareholder --\nMR. OLSON: Well, that is 97 percent of the\ncorporation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not 97 percent of the\ncontributions. I mean, the contributions that count are\nthe ones from the corporations that can amass these huge\nsums in their treasuries.\nMR. OLSON: I think that goes back to\nJustice Kennedy's question, and my response, which\ndistinguishes between contributions and expenditures.\nThe point that Justice Kennedy was making in his\nquestion is that under -- under some circumstances an\nexpenditure might coincide or resonate with what the\ncandidate wishes to do, but the Court looked at that\nvery carefully in Buckley v. Valeo and said that might\nnot be the case. It might, in fact, be these\nexpenditures might be counterproductive when they are\nindependent, they are not coordinated with the\ncandidate, they are more directly expression by the\nparty spending the money, they are not like a\ncontribution, so they are more of an infringement on the\nright to speak.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. OLSON: And they are less of a threat of\ncorruption because there is less -- there is no quid pro\nquo there, and if there is it would be punishable as a\ncrime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in your\ndiscussion of Austin, you rely on its inconsistency with\nBellotti. Bellotti, of course, involved a referendum\nand Austin expenditures in an individual election. Why\nisn't that a significant distinction?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is -- it is -- what the\nBellotti Court said is that we are not deciding that\nquestion.\nAnd -- and Austin did address, you are\ncorrect, expenditures, but it based it on a rationale --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It more than said we are\nnot deciding. It said they are entirely different\nsituations. You read that long footnote which has been\ncited six or eight times by our later cases.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And I also read the\nfootnote 14 in the Bellotti case that cited case after\ncase after case that said corporations had rights,\nprotected rights under the First Amendment. I am not\ndisagreeing with what you just said, Justice Stevens.\nThe Court said it was -- it was dicta, because the Court\ndid not deal with --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it has been\nrepeated -- that footnote has been repeatedly cited in\nsubsequent cases, most of which were unanimous.\nMR. OLSON: Well, because it was -- and I\nagree the Bellotti Court was not discussing that. But\nThe Bellotti Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It did discuss it\nprecisely in that footnote and it said it's a different\ncase.\nMR. OLSON: I understand and I don't\ndisagree with what you have just said, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say it would come\nout differently. It just said, we're not deciding that\ncase, right?\nMR. OLSON: That -- that is -- that's the\npoint I'm trying to make.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't mind citing that.\nBellotti didn't decide that.\nMR. OLSON: What Bellotti also said is --\nand I think this is also in many decisions of this Court\n-- the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity\nfor informing the public does not depend upon the\nidentity of the source, whether corporation,\nassociation, union, or individual.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now that we've\ncleared up that Bellotti didn't decide the question,\nwhat is the distinction that -- why don't you think that\ndistinction makes sense? In other words, a corporate --\nyou don't have a potential for corruption if a\ncorporation is simply speaking on a referendum that may\ndirectly affect its interest. If you are dealing with a\ncandidate, what the Court has said in the past is that\nyou do have that problem of corruption.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, why\nisn't that distinction a way to reconcile Bellotti and\nAustin?\nMR. OLSON: There is a distinction, but I\nthink the distinction goes back to, A, expenditures\nversus contributions, number one; and then secondly, it\ngoes back to what this Court said in conjunction with\nthe impossibility of finding a distinction between issue\nads and candidate ads. The line dissolves on practical\napplication. The interest --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where did we say\nthat?\nMR. OLSON: You said that repeatedly,\nincluding most recently in the Wisconsin Right to Life\ncase. And it first appeared in Buckley itself. The\ndistinction is very hard to draw between the interest\nthat the speaker is addressing and whether it's a\ncandidate or an issue, because issues are wrapped up in\ncandidates. The corporation interest and the interests\nthat its fiduciary officers are representing when it\nspeaks on behalf of the corporation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think you are\ncorrect to say the Court said there was no distinction.\nIt said the distinction requires the use of magic words.\nAnd that's what they said in Wisconsin Right to Life,\ntoo. Both of them said there is a distinction.\nMR. OLSON: Well, but the words --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's difficult to draw in\nsome cases, but nobody said there is no distinction that\nI am aware of.\nMR. OLSON: Well, what the Court -- to\nuse -- to use the words of the Court, which occurred\nrepeatedly, is that the distinction dissolves\nimpractical application. That, Justice Stevens, I think\naddresses the very commonsense point that when you are\naddressing an issue, whether you are addressing a\nreferendum matter, whether it is a proposed legislation\nor a candidate that is going to raise taxes on the\ncorporation, those distinctions dissolve. It's all\nFirst Amendment freedom.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I -- I thought that\nBuckley had narrowed the statute precisely to magic\nwords and still found it unconstitutional as applied to\ncorporations that made independent expenditures.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that what happened in\nBuckley?\nMR. OLSON: The $1,000 limit in Buckley was,\nfirst of all, limited to the magic words \"candidacy\nexpression\"; then secondly, the Court -- and the -- and\nthe words of the statute were \"any person,\" which\nincluded corporations found, the statute as narrowed\nunconstitutional and said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And some of the plaintiffs\nwere corporations.\nMR. OLSON: Some of the plaintiffs were\ncorporations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that point wasn't\neven discussed in the opinion, was it?\nMR. OLSON: It was not discussed in the\nopinion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No.\nMR. OLSON: But what was discussed in the\nopinion was the breadth of the definition of \"person,\"\nwhich did include corporation. Corporations were\nparties in the case. And in that part of the Buckley\ncase, the Court repeatedly cites cases involving\ncorporations, including NAACP v. Alabama and New York\nTimes v. Sullivan, all cases involving corporations.\nSo while it wasn't specifically discussed,\nit was a part of the decision of the Court that a $1,000\nlimitation was worse, more restrictive than the -- than\nthe restriction of editorials appearing on election day\nor requiring a newspaper to give a right of reply.\nThe Court in Buckley in fact says, this\nis -- with respect to that expenditure limitation, the\nwords of the Court were this is the most drastic of the\nlimitations imposed by the Federal Election Campaign\nAct. It goes to the core of First Amendment freedom.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that is so -- this is a\npoint that is concerning me. I don't know the answer\nprecisely. But suppose you are right. Suppose we\noverrule these two cases. Would that leave the country\nin a situation where corporations and trade unions can\nspend as much as they want in the last 30 days on\ntelevision ads, et cetera, of this kind, but political\nparties couldn't, because political parties can only\nspend hard money on this kind of expenditure? And\ntherefore, the group that is charged with the\nresponsibility of building a platform that will appeal\nto a majority of Americans is limited, but the groups\nthat have particular interests, like corporations or\ntrade unions, can spend as much as they want?\nAm I right about the consequence? If I am\nright, what do we do about it?\nMR. OLSON: I think you are wrong about the\nconsequence. There are 27 States that have no\nlimitations on either contributions or expenditures and\nthat -- the Earth is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I\nam saying am I right in thinking that if you win, the\npolitical party can't spend this money, it's limited to\nhard money contributions, but corporations and trade\nunions can spend unlimited funds?\nMR. OLSON: Well, if -- if the Court decides\nin favor of the arguments that we are making here, I\nthink what you are suggesting is that because there are\nother limitations that someone has not challenged in\nthis case, that that would be somehow unfair and\nunbalanced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not suggesting\nthat. I am suggesting we will make a hash of this\nstatute, and if we are going to make a hash of this\nstatute, what do we do about it? And that's why I want\nyou to take a position on another important part of that\nstatute, and that is the part that says political\nparties themselves cannot make these expenditures that\nwe are talking about except out of hard money.\nMR. OLSON: What -- I want to address that\nin this way, and I said when we were here before the\nmost fundamental right that we can exercise in a\ndemocracy under the First Amendment is dialogue and\ncommunication about political candidates. We have\nwrapped up that freedom, smothered that freedom, with\nthe most complicated set of regulations and bureaucratic\ncontrols. Last year the Federal Election Commission\nthat was supposed to be able to give advisory opinions\ndidn't even have a quorum for 6 months of the year 2008\nwhen people would have needed some help from the Federal\nElection Commission.\nWhat I am saying, in answer to your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, there are, I suspect, all\nkinds of problems with Federal election laws where they\napply to parties and where they apply to what candidates\nmight do and so forth; but that has never been a\njustification. We will uphold a prohibition on all\nkinds of people speaking because if we allowed them to\nspeak someone else might complain that they don't get to\nspeak as much as they would like.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, with reference to\nany incongruities that might flow from our adopting your\nposition, are you aware of any case in this Court which\nsays that we must refrain from addressing an\nunconstitutional aspect of the statute because the\nstatute is flawed in some other respects as well?\nMR. OLSON: No, I'm not, and that's -- I\nthink that was what I was attempting to say in response\nto what Justice Breyer was asking me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, are you\ngiving up on your earlier arguments that there are ways\nto avoid the constitutional question to resolve this\ncase? I know that we asked for further briefing on this\nparticular issue of overturning two of our Court's\nprecedents. But are you giving up on your earlier\narguments that there are statutory interpretations that\nwould avoid the constitutional question?\nMR. OLSON: No, Justice Sotomayor. What --\nwhat -- there are all kinds of lines that the Court\ncould draw which would provide a victory to my client.\nThere are so many reasons why the Federal Government did\nnot have the right to criminalize this 90-minute\ndocumentary that had to do with elections, but what the\nCourt addressed specifically in the Washington Right to\nLife case is that the lines if they are to be drawn must\nnot be lines that are ambiguous, that invite litigation,\nthat hold the threat of prosecution over an individual;\nand in practical application that is what the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, my difficulty\nis that you make very impassioned arguments about why\nthis is a bad system that the courts have developed in\nits jurisprudence, but we don't have any record\ndeveloped below. You make a lot of arguments about how\nfar and the nature of corporations, single corporations,\nsingle stockholder corporations, et cetera. But there\nis no record that I am reviewing that actually goes into\nthe very question that you're arguing exists, which is a\npatchwork of regulatory and jurisprudential guidelines\nthat are so unclear.\nMR. OLSON: I would like to answer that.\nThere are several answers to it and I would like to\nreserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. It is the\ngovernment has the burden to prove the record that\njustifies telling someone that wants to make a 90-minute\ndocumentary about a candidate for president that they\nwill go to jail if they broadcast it. The government\nhas the obligation and the government had a long\nlegislative record and plenty of opportunity to produce\nthat record and it's their obligation to do so.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the facial\nchallenge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask one question\nyou can answer on rebuttal? No one has commented on the\nNational Rifle Association's amicus brief. None of the\n-- none of the litigants have. That's in response to\nJustice Sotomayor's thought that there are narrow ways\nof resolving the problem before us. On rebuttal, will\nyou tell us what your view on their solution to this\nproblem is?\nMR. OLSON: I will, Justice Stevens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you tell\nus now. We will give you time for rebuttal.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't keep us in suspense.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Every line, including the lines\nthat would be drawn in several of the amicus briefs, and\nthey are not the same, could put the entity who wishes\nto speak before you again a year from now. Because the\nmovie might be shorter, it might be video on demand, it\nmight be a broadcast, it might have a different tone\nwith respect to a candidate. Every one of those lines\nputs the speaker at peril that he will go to jail or be\nprosecuted or there will be litigation, all of which\nchills speech and inhibits individual --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but to answer my\nquestion, the line suggested by the NRA is the line\nidentified by Congress in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment\ndealing with individual financing of speech which would\nseparate all of these problems. What is your comment on\nthat possible solution to the problem?\nMR. OLSON: I would like to take advantage\nof Justice Stevens' offer and respond to that during the\nrebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nOlson.\nMr. Abrams.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FLOYD ABRAMS\nON BEHALF OF SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. ABRAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe first case cited to you by Mr. Olson\nhappened to be New York Times v. Sullivan, and I would\nlike to begin by urging two propositions on you from\nthat case.\nIn that case the Court was confronted with a\nsituation where the Times made three arguments to the\nCourt. They said -- for us to win, they said, you\neither have to revise, basically federalize, libel law\nto a considerable degree, which they did; or, they said,\nwe only sold 390 copies in Alabama, so you could rule in\nour favor by saying there was no jurisdiction; or, they\nsaid, we didn't even mention Sheriff Sullivan's name, so\nyou could rule in our favor on the ground that they\nhaven't proved a libel case.\nThe Court did the first. It did the first,\nwhich is the broader rather than the narrowest way to\naddress the question, and I suspect they did it -- don't\nknow, but I suspect they did it -- because they had come\nto the conclusion that the degree of First Amendment\ndanger by the sort of lawsuits which were occurring in\nAlabama and elsewhere was something that had to be faced\nup to by the Court now, or --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Abrams, Times v.\nSullivan was not -- did not involve overruling\nprecedents of this Court that had been followed by this\nCourt and others. So, I think the situation is quite\ndifferent.\nMR. ABRAMS: That's true, Your Honor. It\ndid involve overruling 150 years of American\njurisprudence. I mean, there was no law at that point\nthat said that actual malice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was\nno decision of this Court, I mean --\nMR. ABRAMS: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We do tend to adhere to\nour precedents --\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- especially a case like\nAustin which was repeating the business about amassing\nlarge funds in corporate treasuries. It was not a new\nidea in Austin, and it was repeated after -- after\nAustin. But there was -- so Times v. Sullivan I think\nis quite distinct.\nThe question that was posed here is, is it a\nproper way to resolve this case, to overrule one\nprecedent in full and another in part?\nMR. ABRAMS: And what I'm urging on you,\nYour Honor, is that by a parity of reasoning, although\nnot precisely the same situation, that there are cases\nin which there is a -- an ongoing threat to freedom of\nexpression which may lead -- if you were to agree to\nthat, which may lead the Court to say, rather than\ntaking a narrower route to the same result, that it is\nworth our moving away in this case from looking for the\nnarrowest way out, and determining it now, rather than\nthe next as-applied challenge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are -- there are two\nseparate questions that -- that have been raised in\nopposition to your position. One is -- one is that we\nshould not resolve a broad constitutional issue where\nthere are narrower grounds, and that's the question you\nare responding to.\nAn entirely separate question is the issue\nof stare decisis, and you acknowledge that stare decisis\nwas not involved in New York Times v. Sullivan, but the\nfirst question obviously was.\nMR. ABRAMS: And stare decisis of course is\na question much -- much briefed by the parties, and it\nis one which involves of course a consideration not only\nof the merits of the decision, but certain other\nfactors, the length of time the decision has been in\neffect and the like. The time in this case for the\nMcConnell case, of course, is only 6 years. The time\nfor the Austin case is 19 years, which is less than one\nruling of this Court's just last term.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what the Court said\nin Austin it also said in the NRWC case, which was I\nthink 8 years before Austin. So Austin was not a new\ninvention.\nMR. ABRAMS: Well, Austin was the first time\nthat corporate speech was barred -- corporate\nindependent expenditures were barred by a ruling of this\nCourt. That had not happened prior to Austin, and the\nSolicitor General's brief acknowledges that. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there have been\nlimits on corporate spending in aid of a political\ncampaign since the turn of the 20th century.\nMR. ABRAMS: There had been limits on\ncorporate contributions since the turn of the century.\nCorporate independent expenditures came much later and I\nthink that is something that I think is worth --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Much later than 1947.\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, Your Honor. In 1947,\nPresident Truman vetoed that bill, saying that it was a\ndangerous intrusion into free speech. That has always\nbeen an area of enormous controversy, not just in the\npublic sphere but in the judicial sphere. The early\ncases about Taft-Hartley were ones in which what the\nCourt did was to basically say in one case after another\nthat the statute did not govern the particular facts of\nthe case so as to avoid --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those were union\ncases, weren't they, rather than corporate cases?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, they were three union\ncases. And the case after that essentially was Buckley.\nAnd Buckley held unconstitutional the limits posed there\nto independent expenditures. All I'm saying is that\nthis is not a situation as if we have an unbroken amount\nof years throughout American history in which it has\nbeen accepted that independent expenditures could be\nbarred. It has always been a matter of high level of\ncontroversy, with courts at first and understandably\nshying away from facing up to the issue directly and\nthen the first ruling on point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But have you read Justice\nRehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?\nMR. ABRAMS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Have you read Justice\nRehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, I have.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is somewhat\ninconsistent with what you said.\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes, it is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And also\ninconsistent with his later view, correct?\nMR. ABRAMS: Yes.\nYes, Justice?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Going back to the\nquestion of stare decisis, the one thing that is very\ninteresting about this area of law for the last\n100 years is the active involvement of both State and\nFederal legislatures in trying to find that balance\nbetween the interest of protecting in their views how\nthe electoral process should proceed and the interests\nof the First Amendment.\nAnd so my question to you is, once we say\nthey can't, except on the basis of a compelling\ngovernment interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting\noff or would we be cutting off that future democratic\nprocess? Because what you are suggesting is that the\ncourts who created corporations as persons, gave birth\nto corporations as persons, and there could be an\nargument made that that was the Court's error to start\nwith, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the\nCourt imbued a creature of State law with human\ncharacteristics.\nBut we can go back to the very basics that\nway, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good\nby a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more\nbusiness corporations and actually doesn't even involve\nthe traditional nonprofit organization? It involves an\nadvocacy corporation that has a very particular\ninterest.\nMR. ABRAMS: Your Honor, I don't think you'd\nbe doing more harm than good in vindicating the First\nAmendment rights here, which transcend that of Citizens\nUnited.\nI think that, reading my friend's brief here\non the right, they come -- some of them at least come\npretty close to saying that there must be a way for\nCitizens United to win this case other than a broad way.\nIn my view the principles at stake here are the same.\nCitizens United happens to be sort of the paradigmatic\nexample of the sort of group speaking no less about who\nto vote for or not who to vote for or what to think\nabout a potential ongoing candidate for President of the\nUnited States. But in lots of other situations day by\nday there is a blotch to public discourse caused as a\nresult of this Congressional legislation.\nAnd so we think it is not a matter of\ncutting off what legislatures can do. They can still\npass legislation doing all sorts of things. They can do\npublic funding. They can do many other things that\ndon't violate the First Amendment. If we are right in\nsaying that independent expenditures, that category of\nmoney leading to speech that we are talking about today,\nif we are right that that is the sort of speech which is\nat the core of the First Amendment, then you would be\ndoing only good, only good, by ruling that way today\nacross the board.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nAbrams.\nGeneral Kagan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ELENA KAGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE\nGENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI have three very quick points to make about the\ngovernment position. The first is that this issue has a\nlong history. For over 100 years Congress has made a\njudgment that corporations must be subject to special\nrules when they participate in elections and this Court\nhas never questioned that judgment.\nNumber two --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait, wait. We\nnever questioned it, but we never approved it, either.\nAnd we gave some really weird interpretations to the\nTaft-Hartley Act in order to avoid confronting the\nquestion.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I will repeat what I said,\nJustice Scalia: For 100 years this Court, faced with\nmany opportunities to do so, left standing the\nlegislation that is at issue in this case -- first the\ncontribution limits, then the expenditure limits that\ncame in by way of Taft-Hartley -- and then of course in\nAustin specifically approved those limits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you\nare saying. I mean, we are not a self -- self-starting\ninstitution here. We only disapprove of something when\nsomebody asks us to. And if there was no occasion for\nus to approve or disapprove, it proves nothing whatever\nthat we didn't disapprove it.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, you are not a\nself-starting institution. But many litigants brought\nmany cases to you in 1907 and onwards and in each case\nthis Court turns down, declined the opportunity, to\ninvalidate or otherwise interfere with this legislation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that judgment was\nvalidated by Buckley's contribution-expenditure line.\nAnd you're correct if you look at contributions, but\nthis is an expenditure case. And I think that it\ndoesn't clarify the situation to say that for\n100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have\nallowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work\nat all have to have a speaker-based distinction,\nexemption from media, content-based distinction,\ntime-based distinction. We've never allowed that.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think\nJustice Stevens was right in saying that the expenditure\nlimits that are in play in this case came into effect in\n1947, so it has been 60 years rather than 100 years.\nBut in fact, even before that the contribution limits\nwere thought to include independent expenditures, and as\nsoon as Congress saw independent expenditures going on\nCongress closed what it perceived to be illegal. So in\nfact for 100 years corporations have made neither\ncontributions nor expenditures, save for a brief period\nof time in the middle 1940's, which Congress very\nswiftly reacted to by passing the Taft-Hartley Act.\nNow, the reason that Congress has enacted\nthese special rules -- and this is the second point that\nI wanted to make --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before you go to your\nsecond point, may I ask you to clarify one part of the\nfirst, namely, your answer to the question I proposed to\nMr. Olson, namely, why isn't the Snowe-Jeffords\nAmendment, which was picked on by Congress itself, an --\nand which is argued by the NRA, an appropriate answer to\nthis case?\nGENERAL KAGAN: That was my third point,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, I'm sorry.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: So we will just skip over\nthe second.\nMy third point is that this is an anomalous\ncase in part because this is an atypical plaintiff. And\nthe reason this is an atypical plaintiff is because this\nplaintiff is an ideological nonprofit and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are giving up\n-- you are giving up the distinction from MCFL that you\ndefended in your opening brief? There you said this\ndoesn't qualify as a different kind of corporation\nbecause it takes corporate funds, and now you are\nchanging that position?\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, I --I don't think we are\nchanging it. MCFL is the law, and the FEA -- FEC has\nalways tried to implement MCFL faithfully. And that's\nwhat the FEC has tried to do. But if you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess -- do you\nthink MCFL applies in this case even though the\ncorporation takes corporate funds from for-profit\ncorporations?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't think MCFL as\nwritten applies in this case, but I think that the Court\ncould, as lower courts have done, adjust MCFL\npotentially to make it apply in this case, although I\nthink that would require a remand. What lower courts\nhave done -- MCFL was set up, it was written in a very\nstrict kind of way so that the organization had to have\na policy of accepting no corporate funds whatsoever.\nSome of the lower courts, including the D.C.\nCircuit, which, of course, sees a lot of these cases,\nhave suggested that MCFL is too strict, that it doesn't\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you\nthink it's too strict?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I -- I -- the FEC has no\nobjection to MCFL being adjusted in order to -- to give\nit some flexibility. What the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want to give\nup this case, change your position, and basically say\nyou lose solely because of the questioning that we have\ndirected on reargument?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Solely because? I am sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because of the\nquestion we have posed on reargument.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, I don't think that that\nis fair. We think -- we continue to think that the --\nthe judgment below should be affirmed. If you are\nasking me, Mr. Chief Justice, as to whether the\ngovernment has a preference as to the way in which it\nloses, if it has to lose, the answer is yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What case of ours --\nwhat case of ours suggests that there is a hierarchy of\nbases on which we should rule against a party when both\nof them involve constitutional questions? Extending --\nmodifying MCFL would be, I assume, by virtue of the\nFirst Amendment. Overruling Austin would be by virtue\nof the First Amendment. So what case says we should\nprefer one as opposed to the other?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think the question really\nis the Court's standard practice of deciding as-applied\nchallenges before facial challenges. And this case\ncertainly raises a number of tricky as-applied\nquestions. One is the question of how the -- the\nstatute applies to nonprofit organizations such as this\none. Another is a question of how it applies to VOD\ntransmissions. Yet another is the question of how it\napplies to a 90-minute infomercial as opposed to smaller\nadvertisements.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you -- if you\ninsist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that\ninconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in\nThornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati? What\nabout the Thornhill doctrine? It is not cited in the\nbriefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant\nwithout standing to object to a particular form of\nconduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order\nthat the statute does not have an ongoing chill against\nspeech. And there is no place where an ongoing chill is\nmore dangerous than in the elections context.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think even --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you are asking us to\nhave an ongoing chill where we have as-applied\nchallenges which are based on, as I indicated before,\nspeaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling\neffect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly\nagainst.\nGENERAL KAGAN: You know, I think even in\nthe First Amendment context, Justice Kennedy, the Court\nwill not strike down a statute on its face unless it\nfinds very substantial overbreadth, many applications of\nthe statute that are unconstitutional, as opposed to\njust a few or just some. What I am suggesting here is\nthat the Court was right in McConnell and then confirmed\nin WRTL to find that BCRA, which is of course the only\nstatute directly involved in this case, did not have\nthat substantial overdraft.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this.\nSuppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations\ncould not be covered by the statute. Would that --\nwould the statute then have substantial overbreadth?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I would urge you not\nto do that in that kind of sweeping way, because the\nreason for the nonprofit corporations being covered is\nto make sure that the nonprofit corporations don't\nfunction as conduits for the for-profit corporations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose we were to say\nthat. Would the statute then not be substantially\noverbroad?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I don't think that the\nstatute is substantially overbroad right now. So if you\ntook out certain applications, I can't think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I am asking you to\nassume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction.\nThen the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall\nbecause, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the\nlanguage.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I see what you are saying.\nWell, you could do a couple of things. You could do\nwhat Justice Stevens suggested. Justice Stevens\nsuggested -- I suggested to Chief Justice Roberts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think you -- I\ndon't think you really caught what I suggested because\nyou treated it as an enlargement of the MCFL example.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I was going to go back.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that is not what the\nNational Rifle Association argues or what Snowe-Jeffords\ncovers. It covers ads that are financed exclusively by\nindividuals even though they are sponsored by a\ncorporation.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's exactly right.\nWhat you are suggesting, Justice Stevens, is essentially\nstripping the Wellstone amendment from the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct and treating the\nSnowe-Jeffords amendment as being the correct test. And\nnobody has explained why that wouldn't be a proper\nsolution, not nearly as drastic as -- as being argued\nhere.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, and there are some, you\nknow -- there are -- there are some reasons that that\nmight -- that might be appropriate. The Wellstone\namendment was a funny kind of thing. It was passed very\nnarrowly, but beyond that it was passed with a -- a\nreally substantial support of many people who voted\nagainst the legislation in the end, presumably as a\npoison pill.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we -- if we go --\nif we go that route, what we are doing is creating an\naccounting industry, aren't we? Corporations give huge\namounts of money to the C-4 organization, and then\nsomebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact\nthat is a way of subverting the prohibition against the\ndirect payment for the communication, right? Okay, so\nCongress said, we don't want that. Congress said,\nthat's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone,\nfor whatever reasons.\nNow don't we have to focus on whether\nCongress can say that or whether it can't?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I don't know why it\ncannot say it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Congress also said if you\nstrike down the Wellstone amendment, we want the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And why shouldn't we\nfollow that direction?\nGENERAL KAGAN: If you strike down the\nWellstone amendment, what is left is the Snowe-Jeffords\namendment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- which allows nonprofit\norganizations of the kind here to fund these ads out of\nseparate bank accounts, not PACs just separate bank\naccounts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- which include only\nindividual expenditures.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then why is that not the\n-- the wisest narrow solution of the problem before us?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, it is -- it is\ncertainly a narrower and I think better solution than a\nfacial invalidation of the whole statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what do you\n-- what do you understand to be the compelling interest\nthat the Court articulated in Austin?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think that what the Court\narticulated in Austin -- and, of course, in the\ngovernment briefs we have suggested that Austin did not\narticulate what we believe to be the strongest\ncompelling interest, which is the anticorruption\ninterest. But what the Court articulated in Austin was\nessentially a concern about corporations using the\ncorporate form to appropriate other people's money for\nexpressive purposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So but you\n-- you have more or less -- \"abandoned\" is too strong a\nword, but as you say you have relied on a different\ninterest, the quid pro quo corruption. And you -- you\narticulate on page 11 of your brief -- you recognize\nthat this Court has not accepted that interest as a\ncompelling interest.\nSo isn't it the case that as you view Austin\nit is kind of up for play in the sense that you would\nground it on an interest that the Court has never\nrecognized?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, a couple of points.\nThe first thing is, as you say, we have not abandoned\nAustin. We have simply said that in addition --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where --\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- to other people's money\ninterest that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in your --\nwhere in your supplemental briefing do you say that this\naggregation of wealth interest supports Austin?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I would not really call it\nan aggregation of wealth interest. I would say that\nit's -- it's a concern about corporate use of other\npeople's money to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting it outside,\nputting the quid pro quo interest aside, where in your\nsupplemental briefing do you support the interest that\nwas articulated by the Court in Austin?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Where we talk about\nshareholder protection and where we talk about the\ndistortion of the electoral process that occurs when\ncorporations use their shareholders' money who may or\nmay not agree --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that to\nbe a different interest. That is the shareholder\nprotection interest as opposed to the fact that\ncorporations have such wealth and they -- they distort\nthe marketplace.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I -- I think that they\nare connected because both come --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so am I right\nthen in saying that in the supplemental briefing you do\nnot rely at all on the market distortion rationale on\nwhich Austin relied; not the shareholder rationale, not\nthe quid pro quo rationale, the market distortion issue.\nThese corporations have a lot of money.\nGENERAL KAGAN: We do not rely at all on\nAustin to the extent that anybody takes Austin to be\nsuggesting anything about the equalization of a speech\nmarket. So I know that that's the way that many people\nunderstand the distortion rationale of Austin, and if\nthat's the way the Court understands i, we do not rely\nat all on that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we have to\npreserve -- if we are going to preserve Austin we have\nto accept your invitation that the quid pro quo interest\nsupports the holding there or the shareholder protection\ninterest.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I would say either the quid\npro quo interest, the corruption interest or the\nshareholder interest, or what I would say is a -- is\nsomething related to the shareholder interest that is in\ntruth my view of Austin, which is a view that when\ncorporations use other people's money to electioneer,\nthat is a harm not just to the shareholders themselves\nbut a sort of a broader harm to the public that comes\nfrom distortion of the electioneering that is done by\ncorporations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's talk about\noverbreadth. You've -- let's assume that that is a\nvalid interest. What percentage of the total number of\ncorporations in the country are not single shareholder\ncorporations? The local hairdresser, the local auto\nrepair shop, the local new car dealer -- I don't know\nany small business in this country that isn't\nincorporated, and the vast majority of them are\nsole-shareholder-owned.\nNow this statute makes it unlawful for all\nof them to do the things that you are worried about, you\nknow, distorting other -- the interests of other\nshareholders. That is vast overbreadth.\nGENERAL KAGAN: You know, I think that the\nsingle shareholders can present these corruption\nproblems. Many, many closed corporations, single\nshareholder corporations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the\ncorruption interest. You -- you have your quid pro quo\nargument, that's another one. We get to that when we\nget there. But as far as the interest you are now\naddressing, which is those shareholders who don't agree\nwith this political position are being somehow cheated,\nthat doesn't apply probably to the vast majority of\ncorporations in this country.\nGENERAL KAGAN: You are quite right,\nJustice Scalia, when -- we say when it comes to single\nshareholders, the kind of \"other people's money\"\ninterests, the shareholder protection interests do not\napply. There --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that can't be the\njustification --\nGENERAL KAGAN: There --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because if it were, the\nstatute would be vastly overbroad.\nGENERAL KAGAN: There the strongest\njustification is the anticorruption interest.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, with respect to that\nwhat is your answer to the argument that more than half\nthe States, including California and Oregon, Virginia,\nWashington State, Delaware, Maryland, a great many\nothers, permit independent corporate expenditures for\njust these purposes? Now have they all been overwhelmed\nby corruption? A lot of money is spent on elections in\nCalifornia; has -- is there a record that the\ncorporations have corrupted the political process there?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think the experience of\nsome half the States cannot be more important than the\n100-year old judgment of Congress that these\nexpenditures would corrupt the Federal system, and I\nthink that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress has a\nself-interest. I mean, we -- we are suspicious of\ncongressional action in the First Amendment area\nprecisely because we -- at least I am -- I doubt that\none can expect a body of incumbents to draw election\nrestrictions that do not favor incumbents. Now is that\nexcessively cynical of me? I don't think so.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think, Justice Scalia,\nit's wrong. In fact, corporate and union money go\noverwhelmingly to incumbents. This may be the single\nmost self-denying thing that Congress has ever done. If\nyou look -- if you look at the last election cycle and\nlook at corporate PAC money and ask where it goes, it\ngoes ten times more to incumbents than to challengers,\nand in the prior election cycle even more than that.\nAnd for an obvious reason, because when\ncorporations play in the political process, they want\nwinners, they want people who will produce outcomes for\nthem, and they know that the way to get those outcomes,\nthe way to get those winners is to invest in incumbents,\nand so that's what they do. As I said, in double digits\ntimes more than they invest in challengers. So I think\nthat that -- that that rationale, which is undoubtedly\ntrue in many contexts, simply is not the case with\nrespect to this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But under your position,\nif corporations A, B, and C, are called to Washington\nevery Monday morning by a high-ranking administrative\nofficial or a high-ranking member of the Congress with a\ncommittee chairmanship and told to tow the line and to\ntell their directors and shareholders what the policy\nought to be, some other corporation can't object to that\nduring the election cycle. The government silences a\ncorporate objector, and those corporations may have the\nmost knowledge of this on the subject.\nCorporations have lots of knowledge about\nenvironment, transportation issues, and you are\nsilencing them during the election.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When other corporations,\nvia -- because of the very fact you just point out, have\nalready been used and are being used by the government\nto express its views; and you say another corporation\ncan't object to that.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, to the extent,\nJustice Kennedy, that you are talking about what goes on\nin the halls of Congress, of course corporations can\nlobby members of Congress in the same way that they\ncould before this legislation. What this legislation is\ndesigned to do, because of its anticorruption interest,\nis to make sure that that lobbying is just persuasion\nand it's not coercion. But in addition to that, of\ncourse corporations have many opportunities to speak\noutside the halls of Congress.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: One of the amicus briefs\nobjects to -- responds to Justice Kennedy's problem by\nsaying that the problem is we have got to contribute to\nboth parties, and a lot of them do, don't they?\nGENERAL KAGAN: A lot of them do, which is a\nsuggestion about how corporations engage the political\nprocess and how corporations are different from\nindividuals in this respect. You know, an individual\ncan be the wealthiest person in the world but few of\nus -- maybe some -- but few of us are only our economic\ninterests. We have beliefs, we have convictions; we\nhave likes and dislikes. Corporations engage the\npolitical process in an entirely different way and this\nis what makes them so much more damaging.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not --\nI'm sorry, but that seems rather odd. A large\ncorporation just like an individual has many diverse\ninterests. A corporation may want to support a\nparticular candidate, but they may be concerned just as\nyou say about what their shareholders are going to think\nabout that. They may be concerned that the shareholders\nwould rather they spend their money doing something\nelse. The idea that corporations are different than\nindividuals in that respect, I just don't think holds\nup.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, all I was suggesting,\nMr. Chief Justice, is that corporations have actually a\nfiduciary obligation to their shareholders to increase\nvalue. That's their single purpose, their goal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if a candidate --\ntake a tobacco company, and a candidate is running on\nthe platform that they ought to make tobacco illegal,\npresumably that company would maximize its shareholders'\ninterests by opposing the election of that individual.\nGENERAL KAGAN: But everything is geared\nthrough the corporation's self-interest in order to\nmaximize profits, in order to maximize revenue, in order\nto maximize value. Individuals are more complicated\nthan that. So that when corporations engage the\npolitical process, they do it with that set of you know,\nblinders -- I don't mean it to be pejorative, because\nthat's what we want corporations to do, is to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose some\ndo, but let's say if you have ten individuals and they\neach contribute $1,000 to a corporation, and they say,\n\"we want this corporation to convey a particular\nmessage,\" why can't they do that, when if they did that\nas partnership, it would be all right?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, it sounds to me as\nthough the corporation that you were describing is a\ncorporation of the kind we have in this case, where one\ncan assume that the members all sign on to the\ncorporation's ideological mission, where the corporation\nin fact has an ideological mission.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Kagan, most -- most\ncorporations are indistinguishable from the individual\nwho owns them, the local hairdresser, the new auto\ndealer -- dealer who has just lost his dealership and --\nand who wants to oppose whatever Congressman he thinks\nwas responsible for this happening or whatever\nCongressman won't try to patch it up by -- by getting\nthe auto company to undo it. There is no distinction\nbetween the individual interest and the corporate\ninterest. And that is true for the vast majority of\ncorporations.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yet this law freezes all of\nthem out.\nGENERAL KAGAN: To the extent that we are\nonly talking about single shareholder corporations, I\nguess I would ask why it's any burden on that single\nshareholder to make the expenditures to participate in\nthe political person in the way that person wants to\noutside the corporate forum? So single shareholders\naren't suffering any burden here; they can do everything\nthat they could within the corporate form, outside the\ncorporate form. They probably don't get the tax breaks\nthat they would get inside the corporate form, but I'm\nnot sure anything else is very different.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, he wants to put up a\nsign --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ultra Vires would take\ncare of about 90 percent of the small corporations that\nJustice Scalia is talking about. They can't just --\nthey can't even give money to charities sometimes\nbecause of Ultra Vires. Giving political contributions\nis not typical for corporate activity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is -- I -- I remember\nspending quite a few days one summer reading through\n1,000 pages of opinion in the D.C. Circuit. And I came\naway with the distinct impression that Congress has\nbuilt an enormous record of support for this bill in the\nevidence.\nAnd my recollection is, but it is now a\ncouple of years old, that there was a lot of information\nin that which suggested that many millions of voters\nthink, at the least, that large corporate and union\nexpenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate\nlead the benefited political figure to decide quite\nspecifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or\nexpending organization, the corporation or the union.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, it was on the basis of\nthat, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA.\nBut we have heard from the other side there isn't much\nof a record on this.\nSo, if you could save me some time here,\nperhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those\nthousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of\nunderlying bits of evidence where there might be support\nfor that proposition?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's exactly right,\nJustice Breyer, that in addition to the 100-year old\njudgment that Congress believes this is necessary, that\nvery recently members of Congress and others created a\ngigantic record showing that there was corruption and\nthat there was the appearance of corruption.\nAnd in that record, many times senators,\nformer senators talk about the way in which fundraising\nis at the front of their mind in everything that they do\nthe way in which they grant access, the way in which\nthey grant influence, and the way in which outcomes\nlikely change as a result of that fundraising.\nJUSTICE BREYER: BCRA has changed all that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I\nask, it seems -- to your shareholder protection\nrationale, isn't it extraordinarily paternalistic for\nthe government to take the position that shareholders\nare too stupid to keep track of what their corporations\nare doing and can't sell their shares or object in the\ncorporate context if they don't like it?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't think so, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I mean, I, for one, can't keep stack of what\nmy -- where I hold --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have a busy job.\nYou can't expect everybody to do that.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: It's not that -- it's not\nthat I have a busy job.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is\nextraordinary -- I mean, the -- the idea and as I\nunderstand the rationale, we -- we the government, big\nbrother, has to protect shareholders from themselves.\nThey might give money, they might buy shares in a\ncorporation and they don't know that the corporation is\ntaking out radio ads. The government has to keep an eye\non their interests.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I appreciate that. It's not\nthat I have a busy job, it's that I, like most\nAmericans, own shares through mutual funds. If you\ndon't know where your mutual funds are investing, so you\ndon't know where you are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is -- I mean,\nI understand. So it is a paternalistic interest, we the\ngovernment have to protect you naive shareholders.\nGENERAL KAGAN: In a world in which most\npeople own stock through mutual funds, in a world where\npeople own stock through retirement plans in which they\nhave to invest, they have no choice, I think it's very\ndifficult for individual shareholders to be able to\nmonitor what each company they own assets in is doing or\neven to know the extent of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In that respect, it's\nunlike the union, because the -- the worker who does not\nwant to affiliate with a union cannot have funds from\nhis own pocket devoted to political causes. But there\nis no comparable check for corporations.\nGENERAL KAGAN: That's exactly right,\nJustice Ginsburg. In the union context, of course, it's\na constitutional right that the unions give back\nessentially the funds that any union member or employee\nin the workplace does not want used for electoral\npurposes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that mean that\nunions should be taken out, because there isn't the\nsame -- the shareholder protection interest doesn't --\nthere is no parallel for the union?\nGENERAL KAGAN: You are right about that.\nBut I -- the government believes that with respect to\nunions, the anticorruption interest is as strong, and\nthat unions should be kept in.\nI think what your point suggests, that\nthe -- that the union member point suggests why Congress\nmight have thought that there was a compelling interest\nto protect corporate shareholders in the same way that,\nlet's say, dissenting union members are protected by the\nConstitution. There is no State action, of course, so\nthere is no constitutional right in the corporate\ncontext.\nBut Congress made a judgment that it was an\nimportant value that shareholders have this choice, have\nthe ability both to invest in our country's assets and\nalso to be able to choose our country's leaders.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not investing\nin our country's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the course of this\nargument, have you covered point two?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: I very much appreciate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would like to know\nwhat it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I very appreciate that,\nJustice Kennedy. I think I did cover point two, which\nwas an explanation of some of the questions that the\nChief Justice asked me about what interests the\ngovernment was suggesting motivated these laws and are\ncompelling enough such that this Court certainly should\nnot invalidate these laws.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it we have\nnever accepted your shareholder protection interest.\nThis is a new argument.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think that that's fair.\nCertainly Bellotti does not accept it. I would think --\nyou know, National Right to Work is an interesting\nopinion, because National Right to Work accepts for a\nunanimous court both the shareholder protection argument\nand the anticorruption argument with respect to the\nsection 441b in particular.\nNow, in later cases the Court has suggested\nthat National Right to Work was only focused on\ncontributions. If you read National Right to Work, that\ndistinction really does not -- it's not evident on the\nface of the opinion, and I think Chief Justice Rehnquist\nat later -- in a later dissent suggested that he had\nnever understood it that way.\nBut -- so National Right to Work is a\nconfusion on this point. It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess other\nthan that, and I think there may be some ambiguity\nthere, but I wouldn't say NRWC is a holding on\nshareholder protection. So to the extent that you\nabandoned the original rationale in Austin, and\narticulated different rationales, you have two, the quid\npro quo corruption interest and the shareholder\nprotection interest --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Which we think is not in\nAustin.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Austin, I thought,\nwas based on the aggregation of immense wealth by\ncorporations.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Again, Austin is not the\nmost lucid opinion. But the way we understand Austin,\nwhat Austin was suggesting was that the corporate form\ngave corporations significant assets, other people's\nmoney that when the corporations spent those assets --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- can you\ngive me the citation to the page in Austin where we\naccepted the shareholder protection rationale?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think it comes when the --\nwhen the Court is distinguishing MCFL. And the message\nof that distinction of MCFL is the shareholder\nprotection interest? But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do the words\n\"shareholder\" -- I don't know, do the words \"shareholder\nprotection\" appear in the Austin opinion?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I honestly don't know,\nMr. Chief Justice. And -- and I don't want to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they don't --\nlet's assume they don't, then I get back to my question,\nwhich is, you are asking us to defend the Austin or\nsupport or continue the Austin opinion on the basis of\ntwo rationales that we have never accepted, shareholder\nprotection and quid pro quo corruption?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I would say on the quid pro\nquo corruption, of course you have accepted that\nrationale --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the context of\ncontributions, not expenditures.\nGENERAL KAGAN: That's correct. And I think\nwhat has changed since -- since that time is the BCRA\nrecord that Justice Breyer suggested, which was very\nstrong on the notion that there was no difference when\nit came to corporate contributions and expenditures,\nthat there actually was no difference between the two.\nThat they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a yes? Is\nthat a yes? In other words, you are asking us to uphold\nAustin on the basis of two arguments, two principles,\ntwo compelling interests we have never accepted, in\nexpenditure context.\nGENERAL KAGAN: In this -- in this\nparticular context, fair enough. But, you know, I\nthink --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And to undercut Buckley in\nso doing?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I don't think so,\nbecause I do think Buckley was about individuals rather\nthan corporations, and Buckley was in 1976, not in 2009,\nafter the very extensive record that was created in\nBCRA.\nI see my time is up. I don't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you one\nquestion that was highlighted in the prior argument, and\nthat was if Congress could say no TV and radio ads,\ncould it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign\nbiographies? Last time the answer was, yes, Congress\ncould, but it didn't. Is that -- is that still the\ngovernment's answer?\nGENERAL KAGAN: The government's answer has\nchanged, Justice Ginsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KAGAN: It is still true that BCRA\n203, which is the only statute involved in this case,\ndoes not apply to books or anything other than\nbroadcast; 441b does, on its face, apply to other media.\nAnd we took what the Court -- what the Court's -- the\nCourt's own reaction to some of those other\nhypotheticals very seriously. We went back, we\nconsidered the matter carefully, and the government's\nview is that although 441b does cover full-length books,\nthat there would be quite good as-applied challenge to\nany attempt to apply 441b in that context.\nAnd I should say that the FEC has never\napplied 441b in that context. So for 60 years a book\nhas never been at issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What happened to the\noverbreadth doctrine? I mean, I thought our doctrine in\nthe Fourth Amendment is if you write it too broadly, we\nare not going to pare it back to the point where it's\nconstitutional. If it's overbroad, it's invalid. What\nhas happened to that.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't think that it would\nbe substantially overbroad, Justice Scalia, if I tell\nyou that the FEC has never applied this statute to a\nbook. To say that it doesn't apply to books is to take\noff, you know, essentially nothing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't put our\n-- we don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands\nof FEC bureaucrats; and if you say that you are not\ngoing to apply it to a book, what about a pamphlet?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think a -- a pamphlet\nwould be different. A pamphlet is pretty classic\nelectioneering, so there is no attempt to say that 441 b\nonly applies to video and not to print. It does --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the\nparticular -- what if the particular movie involved here\nhad not been distributed by Video on Demand? Suppose\nthat people could view it for free on Netflix over the\ninternet? Suppose that free DVDs were passed out.\nSuppose people could attend the movie for free in a\nmovie theater; suppose the exact text of this was\ndistributed in a printed form. In light of your\nretraction, I have no idea where the government would\ndraw the line with respect to the medium that could be\nprohibited.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, none of those things,\nagain, are covered.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but could they? Which\nof them could and which could not? I understand you to\nsay books could not.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, I think what you --\nwhat we're saying is that there has never been an\nenforcement action for books. Nobody has ever\nsuggested -- nobody in Congress, nobody in the\nadministrative apparatus has ever suggested that books\npose any kind of corruption problem, so I think that\nthere would be a good as-applied challenge with respect\nto that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- you are a\nlawyer advising somebody who is about to come out with a\nbook and you say don't worry, the FEC has never tried to\nsend somebody to prison for this. This statute covers\nit, but don't worry, the FEC has never done it. Is that\ngoing to comfort your client? I don't think so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- this statute\ndoesn't cover. It doesn't cover books.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, no, that's exactly\nright. The only statute that is involved in this case\ndoes not cover books. So 441b which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does cover books.\nGENERAL KAGAN: -- which does cover books,\nexcept that I have just said that there would be a good\nas-applied challenge and that there has been no\nadministrative practice of ever applying it to the\nbooks. And also only applies to express advocacy,\nright? 203 has -- is -- is -- has a broader category of\nthe functional equivalent of express advocacy, but 441b\nis only express advocacy, which is a part of the reason\nwhy it has never applied to a book. One cannot imagine\nvery many books that would meet the definition of\nexpress advocacy as this Court has expressed that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I'm sorry, we\nsuggested some in the last argument. You have a history\nof union organizing and union involvement in politics,\nand the last sentence says in light of all this, vote\nfor Jones.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think that that wouldn't\nbe covered, Mr. Chief Justice. The FEC is very careful\nand says this in all its regulations to view matters as\na whole. And as a whole that book would not count as\nexpress advocacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF SENATORS JOHN McCAIN, ET AL.,\nAS AMICI CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLEE\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe requirement that corporations fund\nelectoral advocacy the same way individuals do, that is\nwith money voluntarily committed by people associated\nwith the corporation, is grounded in interests that are\nso compelling that 52 years ago, before Buckley was\ndecided, before FECA was enacted, before Buckley-style\nquid pro quo corruption was ever addressed, this Court\nexplained that, quote: \"What is involved here is the\nintegrity of our electoral process and not less the\nresponsibility of the individual citizen for the\nsuccessful functioning of that process.\"\nIf the Court now wishes to reconsider the\nexistence and extent of the interests that underlie that\nsentiment expressed for the Court by Justice Frankfurter\nin the context of a prosecution of union officials for\nrunning television ads supporting political candidates,\nit should do so in a case in which those interests are\nforthrightly challenged with a proper and full record\nbelow.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the amicus\nbriefs, I'm not -- maybe it's professor Hayward, if I am\ngetting that right -- suggested the history of this 1947\nprovision was such that it really wasn't enforced\nbecause people were concerned about the First Amendment\ninterests and that the courts to the extent cases were\nbrought did everything they could to avoid enforcing the\nlimitations.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't recall who the\nprofessor was either, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do recall\npretty well the history that was recounted -- I would\nsay the history that was recounted by this Court in the\nAuto Workers case, in CIO, in the Pipefitters case,\nwhich is quite inconsistent with that. We've never had\nthis case -- until this Court's supplemental order, we\nnever had a case that challenged directly, quote,\n\"Austin\" and Austin-style corruption, which is a term I\nthink that is quite misleading.\nWhen the sober-minded Elihu Root was moved\nto stand up in 1894 and urged the people of the United\nStates, and urged the Congress of the United States, to\nenact legislation that would address, quote, \"a\nconstantly growing evil which has done more to shake the\nconfidence of plain people of small means of this\ncountry in our political institutions than any practice\nwhich has ever obtained since the founding of our\ngovernment,\" he was not engaging in a high level\ndiscussion about political philosophy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But he was talking about\ncontributions in that context. That's quite clear.\nMR. WAXMAN: He -- with all due respect,\nJustice Kennedy, I don't think that there was any\ndistinction whatsoever in that time between the\ndistinction that this Court came to understand as a\nresult of FECA, and its adjudication of FECA and that --\nreally the prehistory of Taft-Hartley, between\ncontributions expenditures.\nFor this reason, Justice Kennedy, was that\nwhat Root said was the idea -- and I am quoting now from\nhis speech which is also partly reprinted in this\nCourt's opinion in McConnell -- the idea is to prevent\nthe great companies, the great aggregations of wealth\nfrom using corporate funds directly or indirectly to\nsend members of the legislature to these halls in order\nto vote for their protection and the advancement of\ntheir interests as against those of the public.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Great aggregations of\nwealth. The brief by the Chamber of Commerce, the\namicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce points out that\n96 percent of its members employ less than 100 people.\nThese are not aggregations of great wealth. You are not\ntalking about the railroad barons and the rapacious\ntrusts of the Elihu Root era; you are talking mainly\nabout small business corporations.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, I take your\npoint and I think you have made this point forceful lily\nmany times before. A unanimous court in National Right\nto Work Committee concluded that Congress was entitled\nto make the judgment that it would treat in order to\naddress this root evil, a problem of such concern that\nit goes to the very foundation of the democratic\nrepublican exercise, that is, the notion of integrity in\nrepresentative government.\nNow this -- this case, of course, is not a\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that\nanswer. I mean, if that's what you were concerned\nabout, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could\nhave said all corporations that have a net worth of more\nthan, you know, so much or whatever. That is not what\nCongress did. It said all corporations.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right. And Justice Scalia, if\na small corporation or even any corporation of any sort\nwants to bring an as-applied challenge to 441b or a\nState law analogue and say, you know, I am not the\nproblem that Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root was\naddressed at; there isn't a compelling interest because\nI only have three employees and $8,000 in my bank\naccount, that's fine. But what is extraordinary, truly\nextraordinary, given the sentiments that underlay the\nTillman Act and the Taft-Hartley Act is that we would be\nhaving a discussion today about the constitutionality of\na law that has been on the books forever when no party,\nno corporation, has ever raised the challenge. I well\nrecall --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say it's been on --\nit's been on the books forever. But, No. 1, the\nphenomenon of -- of television ads where we get\ninformation about scientific discovery and -- and\nenvironment and transportation issues from corporations\nwho after all have patents because they know something,\nthat -- that is different. And the -- the history you\napplied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of\nexpenditures.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Kennedy, first of all,\nI -- I think it is actually true that patents are owned\nby individuals and not corporations. But be that as it\nmay, there is no doubt -- I am not here saying that this\nCourt should reconsider Bellotti on first principles any\nmore than I am saying that it shouldn't consider Austin\non first principles. Corporations can and do speak\nabout a wide range of public policy issues, and since\nthe controlling opinion was issued in Wisconsin Right to\nLife, the -- the kind of campaign-related speech that\ncorporations can't engage in, in the pre-election period\nis limited to the functional equivalent of expressed\nadvocacy and nothing else.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Waxman, all of this talk\nabout 100 years and 50 years is perplexing. It sounds\nlike the sort of sound bites that you hear on TV. The\n-- the fact of the matter is that the only cases that\nare being -- that may possibly be reconsidered are\nMcConnell and Austin. And they don't go back 50 years,\nand they don't go back 100 years.\nMR. WAXMAN: My point here is, Justice Alito\n-- and I don't mean to be -- to be demeaning this Court\nwith sound bites. The point is that what -- Austin was,\nto be sure, the very first case in which this Court had\nto decide -- actually had to decide whether or not the\nprohibition on corporate treasury funded campaign speech\ncould properly be limited and was supporting by a\ncompelling interest. All I am suggesting -- and I hope\nthat if you take nothing else from my advocacy today it\nwill be this -- is that we have here a case in which the\nCourt has asked a question that essentially goes to the\nbona fides, that is, the factual predicates of the\ninterests that have been viewed as compelling in Austin,\nin MCFL, in McConnell itself, whether you call it the\ncorrosive effect of corporate wealth, whether you call\nit, quote, \"shareholder protection\" --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And my point is that there\nis nothing unusual whatsoever about a case in which a\nparty before the Court says, my constitutional rights\nwere violated, and there is no prior decision of this\nCourt holding that what was done is constitutional. And\nin that situation is it an answer to that argument that\nthis has never been challenged before? The Court has\nnever held that it was unconstitutional? It has been\naccepted up until this point by the general public that\nthis is -- that this is constitutional? No, that is not\nregarded as an answer to that question.\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Olson is -- was quite\nright -- either Mr. Olson or Mr. Abrams, I find it so\ndifficult to tell the two apart. One of them was\nsaying, well, it's, you know -- yes, I think in response\nto Justice Sotomayor's question, you know, about there\nis no factual record here. There is absolutely nothing\nin this case.\nAnd the response was, well, it's the\ngovernment's burden. The government has to prove that\nany restriction that it imposes passes strict scrutiny.\nFair enough, but the question has to be\nraised. The issue has to be raised. If the -- if\nAustin, Justice Alito, or the compelling interests that\nAustin and McConnell relied on were forthrightly\nchallenged in a case, the government would have the\noption --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Waxman,\nthe government did have that opportunity, and the\ngovernment compiled a record. And when the Citizens\nUnited abandoned that position -- you are quite right,\nthey changed their course -- the government and the\ndistrict court complained that it had to go to all this\nwork to develop this record, and yet we hear nothing\nabout what the record showed.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, that's because the\nultimate -- I assume I have your permission to answer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the only challenges that\nwere litigated in the district court -- and they largely\nwere related to disclosure -- were very direct\nas-applied challenges that had -- that did nothing\nwhatsoever to implicate the foundation of McConnell or\nAustin. And all I'm saying is, if you want to re-\nexamine the predicates, the existence and magnitude of\ninterests that Congress has, going back a -- whether\nit's 60 years or 100 years, and courts, whether it has\nbeen the actual rationale of the decision or a predicate\nof the rationale of the decision, you ought to do it in\na case where the -- where the issue is squarely\npresented so that the government can do what it did in\nMcConnell and in another context in Michigan v. Grutter\nwhen it suggested that Aderand had undermined this\nCourt's controlling opinion in Bakke. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nWaxman. Mr. Olson five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe words that I would leave with this Court are the\nSolicitor General's. The government's position has\nchanged. The government's position has changed as to\nwhat media might be covered by congressional power to\ncensor and -- and ban speech by corporations. Now we\nlearn, contrary to what we heard in March, that books\ncouldn't be prohibited but pamphlets could be\nprohibited. We also learn --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- the --\nthe statute that we are involved in, in this case does\nnot cover those.\nMR. OLSON: Unless they are engaged in,\nquote, \"expressed advocacy.\" And the other way in which\nthe government has changed its position, if I listened\ncarefully, is what type of corporation might be covered.\nThe government now says that it wouldn't -- the -- the\nFEC is now willing to recede from its regulations which\nexplicitly covered this corporation, and I don't know as\nI stand here today what kind of corporations the\ngovernment would choose to prosecute.\nRemember, the Federal Election Commission,\nwhich didn't even have a quorum and couldn't function at\nall for six months during the important election year of\n2008 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the FEC chooses to\nprosecute only those who do not -- who do not rely\nexclusively on individual contributions.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's your question from\nbefore.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. I want to see he\ngets it.\nMR. OLSON: And that -- (a), it wouldn't --\nthis corporation accepted a small amount, $2,000 out of\n-- out of the funding of this, so that wouldn't solve\nthe problem for my corporation, my client's corporation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it would solve it for\nthe advertising, and there are two things. There is the\nlong Hillary document and the advertisements. It would\ncover those.\nMR. OLSON: If -- but the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they are the only --\nonly ones that clearly violate the statute.\nMR. OLSON: My point is that the overbreadth\nin this statute -- that solves the problem by saying\nthat corporations still can't speak, and if you don't\nhave anything to do with them, you -- you -- they wear a\nscarlet letter that says \"C.\" If you accept one dollar\nof funding, then you had better make darn sure that when\na check comes in for $100 from the XYZ hardware store in\nthe neighborhood, that it wasn't a corporation that you\nused to -- to make a documentary about a candidate.\nThe other way in which the government's\nposition has changed is we do not know --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean you\ndisagree with the NRA's submission?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I submit that it does not\nsolve the problem. It would lead exactly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it solved the problem\nas it would for the advertising, would it be an\nappropriate solution?\nMR. OLSON: It -- I can't say that it -- if\nit solved the problem, because it doesn't solve the\nproblem of prohibiting all corporate speech. And I\nthink -- and I am submitting, Justice Stevens, that that\nis unconstitutional. I think what you are suggesting is\nthat some limitation that -- what -- what you were\nsuggesting is not a whole lot different than PAC. It\nwould lead, I think Justice Breyer was saying, to an\naccounting nightmare. It would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is a nightmare that\nCongress endorsed in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment.\nMR. OLSON: Well, but the -- but the\nWellstone Amendment sort of in a sense repealed it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We have held the Wellstone\nAmendment literally cannot be applied.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We unanimously held that.\nMR. OLSON: I think what -- what the -- my\nresponse is that that does not solve the problem of\ninhibiting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You do not endorse the\nNRA's position?\nMR. OLSON: No, we don't Justice Stevens,\nand -- and, as I said, it would not exempt my clients.\nThe other -- the third way in which the government has\nchanged its position is its rationale for this\nprohibition in the first place. Is it corruption? Is\nit shareholder protection? Is it equalization?\nThere was some dispute. I heard the\nSolicitor General say that the equalization rationale\nwas something the government disavowed. It wasn't what\nAustin said, the government -- the government said. And\nI --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Marshall said\nthat he was not trying to equalize all voices in the\npolitical process. He has a sentence that says, well,\nthat's not what the rationale of this case is.\nMR. OLSON: I don't -- I don't -- with all\ndue respect Justice Ginsburg, the words that jump out at\nme are the words from page 665 that say the desire to\ncounterbalance those advantages unique to the corporate\nforum is the state's compelling interest in this case.\nThat sounds to me like -- like equalization.\nI don't know. I am -- I am representing an\nindividual who wants to speak about something that's the\nmost important thing that goes on in our democracy. I'm\ntold it's a felony. I am not -- and I -- I don't know\nwhat the rational basis is. It's overbroad. Now I hear\nabout this shareholder -- protecting shareholders.\nThere is not a word in the congressional record with\nrespect to the -- which was before the Court in the\nMcConnell case about protecting shareholders. As the\nBellotti case pointed out, that would be overbroad\nanyway because this statute applies to every --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually I read that\nsentence that you just read as meaning the corporation\nis an artificial person in respect to which the State\ncreates many abilities and capacities, and the State is\nfree also to create some disabilities and capacities.\nNot a statement about balancing rich and poor.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- it -- it strikes me\nthat it is, because it follows the words that say\ncorporations are given unique advantages to aggregate\nwealth and that we must take away that advantage by\nequalizing the process. I think that's the plain\nmeaning but my point I guess is -- if I may finish this\nsentence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.\nMR. OLSON: My point is that the government\nhere has an overbroad statute that covers every\ncorporation irrespective of what its stockholders think,\nirrespective of whether it's big, and whether it's\ngeneral -- a big railroad baron or anything like that,\nand it doesn't know, as it stands here today two years\nafter this movie was offered for -- to the public for\nits view, what media might be covered, what type of\ncorporation might be covered and what compelling\njustification or narrow standard would be applied to\nthis form of speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
