Michigan.\nMr. Rothfeld.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe issue in this case is a narrow one, but it\nhas considerable practical importance for the continuing\nflow of interstate commerce.\nIn 1991, Congress enacted a statute that was\ndesigned to ease the burdens that State registration fees\nimpose on trucks that travel interstate. To help\naccomplish that purpose, the statute provides that a\nState's registration fee may not exceed the fee that the\nState collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.\nThe question here before the Court is whether\nthat Federal standard precludes a State from now imposing\na fee on a category of trucks when the State waived the\nfee as to that category of trucks and therefore did not\nactually collect or charge it as of the controlling date.\nQUESTION: May I ask, did it waive the fee for\nall carriers or just the carriers involved in this case?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It -- it waived the fee for all\ncarriers in the category that are involved in this case.\nThe State had in place a reciprocity policy.\nQUESTION: But did it waive the fee for all\ncarriers in the State?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I do not believe. There is\nactually nothing in the record, Justice Stevens, that\nindicates how many States paid fees -- how many trucks\npaid fees and how many did not. It's my -- our\nunderstanding that there were trucks that were not\nbenefitting from the reciprocity policy and therefore they\nwould have paid fees. So I think -- I think that the\nanswer, although not reflected in the record, is that some\ntrucks paid fees and some did not.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. ROTHFELD: As I say, the question is whether\nif there is a fee that is waived as to a category of\ntrucks in 1991, whether or not that waiver must continue\nto remain in place currently because of the --\nQUESTION: You -- you say as to a category of\ntrucks. Why do you add that qualification? Why shouldn't\nit be true, if you're right, that if a truck -- if a fee\nwas waived as to any truck, it should remain in place?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we think that the inquiry\nthat's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a\nparticular type treated. And for example, imagine if a\nState had in place a sliding scale of fees as to different\ntypes of trucks at $10 for red trucks, $5 for white\ntrucks, and nothing for blue trucks. The statute refers\nto in -- in terms -- it says that the State's fee must\nequal the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that the State\ncollected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. Well,\nwhat in that -- in that circumstance, what is the fee that\nthe State charged when there are these different\ncategories of trucks?\nWe think it has to be understood to mean the fee\nthat the State charged to trucks of that type, and so, as\nI say, in 1991 in Michigan trucks of a particular type,\ntrucks that were base-plated in the State of Illinois,\nwere not subject to fees. We, therefore, think that under\nthe plain language of the statute, the same policy has to\napply to trucks in that category now.\nQUESTION: Now, was there some change as of 1992\nin connection with the fee applicable here?\nMR. ROTHFELD: There was a change that was\nannounced for the 1992 registration.\nQUESTION: Yes, and I guess that isn't before\nus --\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that --\nQUESTION: -- in this case.\nMR. ROTHFELD: To elaborate on -- on Justice\nO'Connor's question, in 1991, the 1991 registration year,\nthere is no question, and it is undisputed, that for the\nentitlement to operate in the State in 1991, on November\n15th, 1991, the date identified as -- as crucial in the\nstatute, trucks that were base-plated in States that had\nreciprocity understandings with -- with Illinois did not\nhave to pay fees. And therefore, Yellow Transportation,\nthe petitioner here, whose trucks were base-plated in --\nin Illinois did not pay fees.\nIt is true, Justice O'Connor, that in -- towards\nthe end of 1991, prior to November 15th, the State\nannounced a change for the 1992 registration year, and\nYellow, being a diligent taxpayer, actually paid for 1992\nprior to November 15th.\nQUESTION: What does the term base-plated mean?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Base-plated means that plates,\nlicense plates, were issued by that State. So the State\n-- the title for the vehicles were in those States.\nThose --\nQUESTION: When you say base-plated in Illinois,\nthen that means the title was issued in Illinois --\nMR. ROTHFELD: The title --\nQUESTION: -- and it had Illinois license plates\non its truck?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Either Illinois license plates or\nplates that were issued through Illinois. There -- this\ngoes beyond any issue that's presented here, but there is\na understanding between the States, the International\nRegistration Plan, and there are international\nregistration plates that can be provided by -- by any\nState, but it's provided through a single State. And so\nthe license plates here for Yellow trucks, it is sort of\nundisputed, were provided by Illinois. So there is no\nquestion that within the understanding of -- of the\nMichigan scheme in 1991, the Yellow trucks were based in\nIllinois and therefore benefitted from the reciprocity\npolicy in place in -- in Michigan.\nQUESTION: Your -- your test that you propose is\nthat it's the type of truck. It -- I take it there's\nnothing in -- in the statute or in regulatory\npronouncements that talk about types of trucks unless it's\nthe number of axles or something. But type of truck, it\nseems to me, can be applied in the generic way that\nMichigan argues. It's a type of truck because it was\nwithin the exemption or without the exemption.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me be clear what I --\nwhat I mean by that, Justice Kennedy. I don't mean type\nof truck in terms of the number of axles or -- or the\nweight of the truck. I -- I mean the category -- the rule\nthat the State applied in 1991 -- the State had in place a\nsystem of rules that applied, different -- as we know,\ndifferent fees to different types of trucks. Let me give\nyou an example.\nImagine that the State had a scheme in place in\nwhich it charged $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks,\nnothing for blue trucks, as I suggested before. What is\nthe -- what is the fee that the State applied? You have\nto say the fee the State applied to who and look at the\nrule that the State would have applied in 1991. And that\nmeans identifying the type of truck in the sense of how\nwould the rule categorize it. And Congress has frozen in\nplace, we believe, the rules that governed fee levels at\nthe time.\nIf that were not the approach one took and there\nwere these different --\nQUESTION: May I ask, under your hypothetical,\nwould that rule have prevented the company from repainting\nits trucks, paint the blue trucks white or the white\ntrucks red, to get in a different category, which is what\nhappened here? They moved from one place of registration\n-- one rule where the trucks were licensed to a place of\nthe home office or something like that. So could they\nhave later repainted their trucks? Or in this case, could\nthey 2 years later have moved -- changed the -- the rule\non -- on which -- whether it's a place of licensing or the\nhome office?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if the question,\nJustice Stevens, is whether the -- the fee payer could\navoid the fee by somehow modifying its trucks --\nQUESTION: No, no, no. Whether the State could\nchange its -- its -- as it did here. It did it in one\nyear. Could it have done the same thing, say, 3 years\nlater?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Our -- our understanding, Your\nHonor, is that that -- the State could not do that. We\nthink that Congress has frozen in place expressly by the\nterms of the statute --\nQUESTION: Locked in permanently to 1991. So\neven if -- let's say, the reciprocity agreement persists\nin 1991, but Michigan wants to change it in 1993 and '94.\nIt cannot. It's locked in forever to a reciprocity\nagreement that it made with its sister State only for the\nyear 1991. Is that your reading?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes, and let me explain how we\nthink that applies.\nFirst, the statute went into effect in 1994,\nalthough it was enacted in 1991. So in the intervening\nyears, the State could have done whatever -- whatever it\nwished.\nWe think that Congress has frozen the fee levels\nin place. Now, whether those fee levels were established\nby reciprocity rule or by unilateral State law or by\nadministrative fiat, it wouldn't matter. The State had in\nplace in 1991 a policy that said trucks of a certain\ncharacter, trucks in this instance license plated in a --\nin Illinois, were not subject to fees. Fees were not\ndemanded from those trucks. They weren't collected. They\nweren't charged. Those trucks did not have to pay a fee\nto entitle them to operate on the State's roads as of the\nrelevant period. And that being the case, we think\nCongress, which said the State's fee must equal the fee,\nnot to exceed $10 per vehicle --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Rothfeld, the problem I\nhave with -- with your -- your argument is how does one go\nabout identifying the category? Is the category Michigan\ntrucks, or is the category trucks subject to a reciprocity\nagreement so that if a reciprocity agreement that used to\nexist with Michigan were canceled, or if -- if a -- for\nthat matter, a reciprocity agreement that did -- that used\nto not exist with New York were adopted, you come into the\ncategory or go out of the category, depending upon whether\nyou have a reciprocity agreement? What category are --\nare you urging, and why do you pick that category instead\nof -- instead of another one?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we are picking the category\nthat we think is -- was selected by Congress because\nCongress said the fee in place in 1991 is frozen. And so\nif that --\nQUESTION: For -- for the particular truck, or\nfor the particular State as to which there is a\nreciprocity agreement, or with respect to any State as to\nwhich there is a reciprocity agreement? It's hard to\nfigure out which category they -- they were talking about.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it's not\ncomplex in practice. I think that what Congress was\nasking the State to do is look at how it would have\ntreated a truck of this type in 1991.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's the key word, of\nthis type.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well --\nQUESTION: But what type?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, of whatever --\nQUESTION: Owned by this company?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, no.\nQUESTION: Or from this State, or subject -- or\nfrom a State that has -- that currently has a reciprocity\nagreement?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think one would consider the\nrule that was in place in the State just as it did in 1991\nand say here's a truck, this truck is base-plated in\nIllinois. That is a characteristic this truck has, which\nis relevant under our rule, because our rule says under\nour existing reciprocity policy, we will not impose a fee\non a truck that has its license plate issued by Illinois.\nTherefore, this truck is not subject to a fee.\nIf such a truck comes along in 1995, after the\nstatute goes into effect -- and I should say the statute\nhere is the refreshing acronym, ISTEA, the Intermodal\nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act. When the ISTEA\nstatute went into effect, this same -- same truck goes\ninto the State of Michigan. It has characteristics which\nwaive the fee to -- as to it, had this truck been there in\n1991, those same characteristics make the State waive the\nfee as to it now, because Congress has -- has used the\nterm the State may not charge fees that it was not\ncharging in 1991. Again, the precise language is the\nState's fee must equal the fee that the State collected or\ncharged.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. --\nQUESTION: What about new vehicles? What about\na vehicle purchased, say, in 1995 base-plated in Illinois?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If such a vehicle is base-plated\nin Illinois, that is the characteristic that is made\nrelevant by the State's rule in place in 1991.\nQUESTION: So it's not only vehicles that\nexisted in 1991, it's any vehicle thereafter acquired.\nSo one -- one element of this is that Michigan\ncould not, on your reading, go over to the principal place\nof business, which in this case is -- I take it, is Kansas\nwith no -- no reciprocity with Michigan -- could not\nchange that. Everything is frozen forever under ISTEA.\nIs that your view?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is our view, and we\nthink --\nQUESTION: Well that's one of your views.\nAnd may -- may I ask you about the -- the answer\nyou didn't give to Justice Scalia? Let's assume the\nstatute isn't as clear as -- as you are arguing that it\nis. Isn't this the point at which you say, if it's not\nthat clear, Chevron controls the answer?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely\ncorrect, Justice Souter. And if -- it is our view that\nthe -- that the statutory language is -- is unambiguous,\nbut if we are wrong about that and if there is any\nopportunity to find any sort of -- any wiggle room for the\nState in the statute, there is no doubt that the statute\ndoes not unambiguously require that reciprocity --\nrequires States to -- to change their reciprocity rules\nbecause the State -- the -- the statute refers, as I say,\nonly to the fee that was charged. It certainly doesn't\nsay that States may change rules, particular types of\nrules. And that being the case, Chevron deference is\nmandatory.\nHere, in fact, agency deference should be at its\nheight. The agency here was expressly delegated by\nCongress the responsibility for promulgating\ninterpretations of the ISTEA legislation. It conducted\nnotice and comment rulemaking. It received dozens of\ncomments from all interested parties, including the State\nof Michigan. It issued regulations. It issued formal\ninterpretations of the statute. It published a closely\nreasoned explanation for its conclusion. And in those\ncircumstances, I think every member of the Court has\nrecognized that deference under Chevron principles is at\nits height, and because I think it -- it simply cannot be\nsaid that the statutory language is clearly inconsistent\nwith the approach taken by the agency, the agency's\napproach must be dispositive.\nAnd here, what the agency found, unambiguously\nand expressly, dealing precisely with the question at\nissue before the Court now, is that if States had\nreciprocity policies in place in 1991, they may not amend,\nchange, rescind, modify those policies in such a way --\nQUESTION: Well, but did they change their\nreciprocity policy? They just changed the way of\nidentifying the State that's relevant for determining\nwhether a particular truck has to pay or not.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that is, in\nour view, a change in the reciprocity policy. The\nreciprocity policy is determined by what -- by certain\nfactors. The State -- it could be a principal place of\nbusiness. It could be a different rule, place of license\nplating.\nQUESTION: Where in the regulations does it say\nthat the State may not do what it did here?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The agency issued their\ninterpretations of its regulations, which were published\nactually at two points. There -- there was a rulemaking\nproceeding, and along with rulemaking proceeding, it\nissued, as I said, formal interpretations of the statute\nand its rules. There it indicated expressly that in its\nview reciprocity agreements must be frozen and cannot be\nmodified.\nA number of States indicated that they wanted to\nchange their reciprocity rules, and the commission then\nheld a second administrative proceeding --\nQUESTION: Well, but did they change their\nreciprocity -- did Michigan change its reciprocity\nagreement with either Illinois or Arkansas in this case?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there is actually some\nquestion as to whether there were formal reciprocity\nagreements in place. There is no question Michigan had a\npolicy of providing fee waivers to trucks that were based\nin States that in Michigan view provided equivalent\nwaivers to trucks that were based in Michigan. Applying\nthat policy in 1991, Michigan was of the view that\nIllinois provided such a waiver for Michigan trucks, and\ntherefore, Michigan, under its policy announced by its\npublic service commission, provided equivalent waiver for\ntrucks that were based in Illinois. That was\nunquestionably the rule that was in place in Michigan at\nthe relevant time, and because of that, we think, that was\nthe fee that was collected or charged.\nTo identify the fee that was collected or\ncharged or can now be collected or charged from a\nparticular truck that comes from the State, one has to\nlook at the rule that was in place then and say, what was\nthe fee that would have been applied then to this truck?\nUnder that approach, Michigan cannot now change its -- its\nway of implementing reciprocity policies and therefore\ncharge trucks that would not have been charged at that\ntime.\nIf there are no further questions now, Your\nHonor, I'll reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Rothfeld.\nMr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress assigned responsibility for\nimplementing the single State registration system to the\nInterstate Commerce Commission. The ICC determined that\nwhen States apply the statutory fee cap, they must\nconsider the reciprocal fee reductions and reciprocal fee\nwaivers that were in place as of November 15th, 1991.\nThat interpretation serves the central purpose of the fee\ncap provision, which was to grandfather the fees that were\nin place as of 1991, but only those fees.\nThe Michigan Supreme Court's generic fee rule,\non the other hand, would convert Congress's grandfather\nprovision into a provision that would allow new fees.\nThe ICC's interpretation ensures that the capped\nregistration fee is equal to the fee that the State\nactually collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.\nCongress did not set the cap at the amount that the States\ncould have charged. If Congress had wanted to do that,\nthe obvious thing to have done would have been to set the\ncap at $10, which is the amount that the ICC allowed all\ncarriers to charge as of November 15th, 1991.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't there at least an\nargument that Congress could have had that in mind by the\ndistinction between charged and collected? I mean, if\nthere is presumably a difference between them, then the --\nthen the reference to charge would be to a fee that was\nnot collected, which would get you to the point which you\nsaid Congress could have but did not provide for by the --\nby the flat $10.\nSo, I mean, I -- I'm not -- I guess what I'm\nsaying is, unless I'm missing something, I don't think\nyour statutory argument compels the conclusion, but your\nChevron argument is -- is -- perhaps takes care of your\nposition.\nMR. SCHLICK: Certainly the Chevron argument is\n-- is essential to this case. We think that the most\nnatural reading of charge or -- of collected or charged,\nthough, is charged, demanded, collected, received.\nQUESTION: Even though that was not the\ncommission's first view. The commission's first view of\nthis case is that the States would not be bound by the\nreciprocity agreements and could charge -- whatever they\ncharged anyone, they could charge everyone.\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe ICC did, during the rulemaking proceeding, change its\ninterpretation. As the D.C. Circuit said in NARUC v. ICC,\nthat's what comment periods are for. And the -- the\ncommission ultimately relied not only on the plain\nlanguage of the statute, but also on the purposes\nunderlying the statute.\nThe conference report on ISTEA makes clear that\nthere were two purposes in -- in Congress's mind when it\ndrafted the statute. One was ensuring that -- ensuring\nbenefit to carriers, ensuring that the overall costs of\nthe -- of the State registration requirements were\nminimized. The second was preserving existing State\nrevenues.\nMichigan's approach, on the other hand, would\nallow dramatic increases in the fee amounts, in this case\nan increase from 0 to $10 per truck, that would overwhelm\nthe administrative savings that Congress intended to\nensure through the single State approach.\nThat -- that also would be a very odd policy to\nallow those increases since Congress would, in fact, have\nbeen authorizing increases that the States themselves\nchose not to implement as of 1991.\nQUESTION: Let me just be sure you agree with\nyour colleague. You take the position that they could not\nhave changed the -- the State to which they give\nreciprocity by changing from licensing State to State of\nprincipal place of business, even if they had done it 2 or\n3 years later.\nMR. SCHLICK: As a general matter, that's\ncorrect, but let me explain, Justice Stevens, the\nparticular problem presented here, which has not been\naddressed by the ICC or the Department of Transportation\nand that we think is preserved on -- on remand.\nAs of November 15th, 1991, Michigan arguably had\ntwo different fee systems in place. The first was the fee\nsystem for 1991. If Yellow Transportation had come to the\nState of Michigan and said, we'd like to add an additional\ntruck to -- to our registration for this year, effective\nimmediately, Michigan would have -- it would have charged\nand Yellow would have paid under the old reciprocity\narrangement, under which the fact that the truck was base-\nplated, had a license plate for Illinois would have been\ndispositive.\nHowever, simultaneously, Michigan -- Michigan\nwas -- was demanding and Yellow paid fees under the 1992\nreciprocity approach where the fact that the -- the truck\nhad a license plate from Illinois would not be relevant\nand the fact that Yellow was headquartered in Kansas would\nbe relevant. The ICC did not determine in its American\nTrucking Associations proceeding, which -- which is the\nrelevant one on this question, whether the -- whether that\nsort of -- of conflict would be resolved in favor of the\nold rule or the new rule. And that's the question that we\nthink should remain open on remand. As a matter of fact,\nright now the --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't understand. I thought\n-- I thought '91 is the -- is the -- is the base period\nthat -- that's consulted. Why -- why would you use the\nnew rule?\nMR. SCHLICK: The new rule would -- would be\nimplemented as -- as a result of this unusual situation,\nunique in our -- in our experience, where there were two\n-- where there two fee systems in place at the same time.\nQUESTION: There was only one in '91. The\nsecond one came in after '91. If you allow a new fee\nsystem to -- to change things, you should -- you should\nallow a new reciprocity agreement to change things. I --\nI just don't see why this is a problem.\nMR. SCHLICK: Well, the unique feature here is\nthat both were in place and operational as of November\n15th, 1991. And the -- that -- there's also a question of\nwhether the move to the new fee system --\nQUESTION: They -- they were both operating in\n'91?\nMR. SCHLICK: That's right. As of November\n15th, 1991, both were in place.\nQUESTION: Okay. I -- I --\nMR. SCHLICK: And operational. Yellow might --\nQUESTION: I thought the change occurred in\nJanuary 1, 1992, but that's okay.\nMR. SCHLICK: To answer your question, Justice\nScalia, the -- the change -- the new system became\neffective for the 1992 registration year commencing\nJanuary 1st, 1992, but the charges were assessed in the\nfall of 1991.\nQUESTION: So if Yellow Freight hadn't paid\nearly, would this argument be off the board? In other\nwords, this -- this fee was paid. The 1992 paid -- fee\nwas paid before November 15th, '91. Suppose Yellow\nFreight had waited till after January 1.\nMR. SCHLICK: The significance of that, Justice\nGinsburg, would be something for the Department of\nTransportation in a pending proceeding that's -- that is\nopen now to consider. That -- that's -- that question has\nnot been answered, the significance of -- of the date of\npayment.\nQUESTION: But you're suggesting there's a\npossibility that somebody would be penalized for early\npayment, for prompt payment.\nMR. SCHLICK: No. I think there would be much\nmore to it than that. And again, this is -- this is a --\na unique situation. There have not been problems with\nimplementing this system, and the Department of\nTransportation has before it a request for declaratory\nruling filed by Michigan, that was mooted by the Michigan\nSupreme Court's decision which adopted this generic view\nrule that moots out all these questions. And that\nproceeding could be reopened if this Court were to remand\nto the Michigan Supreme Court.\nBut the -- the specific significance of the date\non which Yellow made payment has not been addressed by the\nICC or by the Department of Transportation.\nThe -- the fee system here -- the actual fee\nrule of the ICC has been in place for almost 9 years now.\nThere have not been serious problems of administration.\nIt's a mechanical process where States simply fill out the\n-- carriers fill out a chart which has the applicable\nState, the number of trucks in the State. It's a matter\nof multiplication and then adding some -- the fee for --\nfor each State.\nAs I was explaining, the Michigan situation is\nunique and should be left to be resolved by the Michigan\ncourts and by the Department of Transportation.\nThe ICC --\nQUESTION: Do you say the same thing for the\nargument that there in fact was no reciprocity in place\nwith Illinois in 1991?\nMR. SCHLICK: We do, Justice Ginsburg. That's a\n-- a subpart of -- of this State-specific question. The\nfacts surrounding that have -- have really not been\ndeveloped before the Michigan courts or even before the\nDepartment of Transportation at this point.\nThe ICC's interpretation of the fee cap is a\nreasonable implementation of Congress's provision. It's\nconsistent with the language of the statute and its\npurposes and we submit that it should be upheld. The\ndecision of the Michigan Supreme Court should be reversed,\nand the case should be remanded.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.\nMr. Casey, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBefore I begin my principal argument, I would\nlike to spend just a moment on this -- this point of the\nchangeover in Michigan from base-plating to principal\nplace of business. We believe it is not present in the --\nin this case at this point.\nThis case was litigated on that point throughout\nthe Michigan courts up until the Michigan Supreme Court\ndecision.\nMichigan had in place a system called base-\nplating where we imposed fees based on the State in which\nthe vehicle was licensed. In early 1991, the system\nchanged from that base-plating system to a system that all\nthe other States used based on the principal place of\nbusiness of the truck carrier.\nQUESTION: That was what determined reciprocity.\nMR. CASEY: That's what determined reciprocity.\nThat's correct.\nAnd Yellow Freight Company, at that time Yellow\nTransportation -- their trucks were licensed in Illinois,\na State with which Michigan has reciprocity, but its\nprincipal place of business of the parent company is\nKansas, a State with which Michigan does not have\nreciprocity. And so when Michigan made this change during\n1991, we then switched over and imposed fees for Yellow\nFreight for the registration year of 1992. But those\nfees, as normal industry and State practice, were sent out\nin September of 1991 for the next registration year. And\nYellow Freight paid them in October of 1991. Again,\nthat's typical industry practice. They're assessed and\npaid in advance of the registration year.\nThe statute took effect here in December of\n1991. The statutory language that we're dealing with\ntalks about a fee that such State collected or charged as\nof November 15th, 1991. Our argument on the -- the way it\nwas litigated through the State courts is that Michigan\ncharged Yellow Freight before November 15th, 1991 and we\ncollected from Yellow Freight prior to 19 -- prior to\nNovember 15th, 1991.\nQUESTION: Albeit on a system that didn't go\ninto effect until --\nMR. CASEY: For the registration year 1992, we\ncharged and collected. Yellow Freight disputed that.\nThat's the way it was litigated up to the Michigan Supreme\nCourt. It didn't involve this question of whether\nreciprocity was relevant or irrelevant.\nThe Michigan -- pardon me. The Michigan Supreme\nCourt decided it on a -- a different basis than the other\nState court opinions had. And that raised the question\nwhich this Court granted certiorari.\nIn its briefs, Yellow Transportation has implied\nthat we've somehow waived that issue. We have not. We\ndid not brief it in this Court because this Court limited\nthe grant of certiorari to the issue that the supreme\ncourt did decide. So we -- we believe that the case\nshould be affirmed on the basis that the Supreme Court of\nMichigan decided it. If it is not affirmed, however, we\nagree with the United States that the case should be\nremanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration\nof this other issue which is still viable.\nSo turning now to our principal argument in\ndefense of the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, the\nstatute required the ICC to implement a fee system, to\nadopt a fee for the States, a fee system for a fee not to\nexceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or\ncharged as of November 15th, 1991.\nBeginning with the statutory language, under\nChevron, if the intent of Congress is clear, that's the\nend of the matter.\nThe precise question that needs to be addressed\nhere is what did Congress intend. How do you determine\nthe fee? We believe that Congress's intent is clear.\nUnder the language of this statute --\nQUESTION: Well, if we think it isn't altogether\nclear and in fact could be read the other way, don't we\nhave to consider Chevron deference? Because that's how\nthe agency has interpreted it.\nMR. CASEY: If it -- yes, if -- if the statute\nis not clear, then you proceed to the second step of\nChevron, which is whether the agency's interpretation is a\npermissible one. We believe we don't need to get to the\nsecond step of Chevron because the text of the statute is\nunambiguous.\nQUESTION: But if you're wrong about the text\nbeing unambiguous -- and you do have an uphill argument\nthere because didn't the two lower courts in Michigan\nreason the other way? Didn't they reject the argument\nthat the Michigan Supreme Court embraced?\nMR. CASEY: The -- I agree the second step of\nChevron is always an uphill argument, to overcome an\nagency interpretation. It's -- but on -- on the facts of\nthis case, on the text of this statute, we believe that\nthe agency interpretation is impermissible. What the --\nwhat the agency did here was not just interpret the\nstatute; they have, in fact, rewritten it. They have\nimposed conditions in the statute which are simply not\nthere.\nQUESTION: But didn't the lower courts in\nMichigan say that was a proper reading, that the ICC's\nreading --\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- was a proper --\nMR. CASEY: Yes, they did.\nQUESTION: Which makes it harder for you to\nargue that there is a plain meaning the other way.\nMR. CASEY: Yes, it does make it harder. I\nagree. But it -- it is still a burden that we believe we\ncan overcome because we believe that, as this Court did in\nthe Whitman v. ATA, it is possible to look at a statute,\nsay a statute is ambiguous, and still say that an agency\ninterpretation is unreasonable. We believe what the\nagency has done here is unreasonable.\nWhat the agency has done here is add language to\nthe statute. They have imposed the requirement in the\nstatute that you look at reciprocity agreements. There is\nnothing in the statute about looking at reciprocity\nagreements. There's nothing in the statute about looking\nat particular carriers or how particular carriers are\ntreated. All this statute -- this subsection of the\nstatute requires and permits is to look at what the State\ncollected or charged as of 1991, November 15th.\nQUESTION: Is there anything in the record that\nindicates what percentage of revenue a State like Michigan\ngets on the basis of these reciprocity agreements or how\nmuch -- how much of its revenue from this kind of tax is\nnot affected by reciprocity agreements?\nMR. CASEY: The record in this case is very\nscant. It was decided on summary disposition right after\nfiling of the complaint. I do know that in the year 2000,\nwhich is 9 years after the enactment of the statute, total\nMichigan revenue from registration fees was $2.7 million.\nThere are 38 States participating in the single State\nregistration system. We have reciprocity agreements with\n21 of those States.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. CASEY: But I don't know how those\nindividually break down. Michigan registers approximately\n5,000 trucking carriers each year. About half of them are\nfrom Canada. But I don't know. That's intra- and\ninterstate carriers. The fees for intrastate carriers are\ndifferent. They're $100 instead of $10. But the record\nis very scant in this case because of the way it\ndeveloped.\nQUESTION: Would you tell me again why you think\nthe statute is -- is clear and unambiguous in your favor?\nMR. CASEY: There --\nQUESTION: I see -- I see the sense of a generic\napproach because of the trucks being painted a different\ncolor or reincorporation and so forth.\nMR. CASEY: There -- there --\nQUESTION: But I'm not sure that I can find that\nunder the clear language of the statute. There's a common\nsense aspect to it.\nMR. CASEY: There are very few words which are\nat issue here. The fee that such State collected or\ncharged as of November 15th, 1991. We believe that means\nyou look only to what the State collected or charged under\nits fee system. That is, what -- if -- if a State\ncollected or charged its fee -- it's $10 in Michigan --\nfrom any carrier as of November 15th, that ends the\nmatter.\nQUESTION: So you're reading in -- you're\nreading in from any carrier. And -- and, yes, that's\nreasonable to read that in, I suppose. But it's also\nreasonable to read in from a carrier of -- of this sort.\nOr you could read in from this particular truck. You\ncould read in a lot of -- you have to read in something,\nit seems to me.\nMR. CASEY: Well, if -- under our\ninterpretation, under -- under the plain text, we submit\nyou don't have to read in anything. The -- the words,\ncollected or charged, are in the disjunctive. They --\nthey're verbs. They require something. Charged means\nsent out a bill or an invoice. Collected means we\nreceived something.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you this. Did -- does\nMichigan -- did Michigan at the relevant time have a\nscheme in which every truck of every size, weight, class,\net cetera was charged the same fee? No.\nMR. CASEY: These -- these fees deal only\nwith --\nQUESTION: No, but can you give me a yes or no\nanswer to that? Did Michigan say, we have a law that says\nif you are a truck, you pay X dollars, no ifs or buts? Is\n-- was that the Michigan law?\nMR. CASEY: The statute in Michigan imposes a\n$10 fee but permits a waiver, meaning 0.\nQUESTION: So are you telling me that the answer\nto my question is yes? There is only one category known\nin Michigan and that is the category of a truck?\nMR. CASEY: No. There -- there -- there's a fee\nof $10 or 0. Some trucks were charged 10. Some were\ncharged 0.\nQUESTION: So there are at least two categories.\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: And if there are at least two\ncategories, don't you have to do just what Justice Scalia\nsaid you have to do? You have to read something into the\nstatute, or you would be reading it in such a way as to\ncharge against a truck in category A what, under the\nMichigan law, you would have charged against a truck for\ncategory B. That can't be right. So that you've got to\n-- as Justice Scalia has suggested, you've got to read in\nsome kind of a categorization in addition to the plain\nmeaning of the statute. Isn't that right?\nMR. CASEY: I -- I disagree. The -- the words,\ncollected or charged, are in the disjunctive. So if the\nState either collected the fee as of November or charged\nit as of November --\nQUESTION: No matter to whom. No matter to what\ntruck.\nMR. CASEY: No matter to whom. The fact --\nQUESTION: May I also suggest that the -- when\nyou look at those words in the context of the whole\nsubparagraph (4), which is the part --\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- which begins, shall establish a\nfee system, so you're talking about collected or charged\nas part of a system.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct, Your Honor. Well,\nit's -- it's true. And that -- that goes to another part\nof our argument. This -- this system or this section,\nsubsection (3), is the section in which Congress\nimplemented its goal of preserving State revenues. There\n-- there are two goals that Congress had in passing the\nsingle State registration system. One is to simplify the\nwhole procedure for the trucking industry and for States,\nand two was to preserve State revenues.\nThis subsection (3) that we're dealing with is a\nsection that preserves State revenues. And when you look\nat it in that context, the text here deals only with fees\nthat the State collects. There are other sections that\ntalk about payments by trucks to States. There are\nsections that talk about carriers specifically. Congress\ndidn't use the word carriers in this subsection. They\ndidn't use the words, payments by trucks to -- or by\ncarriers to States. They could have used those words, as\nthey did in other subsections.\nQUESTION: Carrier in your view signifying the\nentity that owns the trucks?\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nWhat -- you -- earlier you mentioned trucks of\ndifferent weights and things. We're talking only here\nabout the power vehicle. We're not talking about the\ntrailer part of the truck. This is just for proof of\ninsurance. It's a $10 only. There are other fees that\nvarious interstate agreements have for different axle\nweights, and that kind of thing.\nQUESTION: I -- I guess our point is that for\nyou to make the statute work, you are reading something\ninto it that isn't there, which is this generic system and\n-- or this generic theory. And there's a certain amount\nof common sense to that, but it seems to me that by your\nhaving to do that, you in effect concede the statute is\nambiguous and then your clear argument case collapses.\nMR. CASEY: Well, I would -- I respectfully\ndisagree, Your Honor. I --\nQUESTION: The words, fee system, are in the\nstatute itself. That's -- those are the first words in\nthe subsection to which you're --\nMR. CASEY: This -- correct. This -- this\nsubsection is part of a fee system, and this -- this\nsubsection of that system is the section that deals with\nensuring that States receive their revenue. And when you\nput it in that context and you look at the specific words\nof the statute here, when you look at the collected or\ncharged in the disjunctive, the statute --\nQUESTION: I don't understand what you get out\nof the disjunctive.\nMR. CASEY: The statute --\nQUESTION: How -- how does that help you?\nMR. CASEY: The statute --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that for the trucks\nthat were from reciprocity States, the fee was neither\ncharged nor collected. So how does the disjunctive help\nyou?\nMR. CASEY: That's what the Michigan Supreme\nCourt said, in essence, that if the -- if the State\ncollected or charged the $10 fee, period, then the statute\nis satisfied.\nQUESTION: Did the State sponsor that --\nMR. CASEY: Everything else is irrelevant.\nPardon me.\nQUESTION: In Michigan you -- you helpfully\nbegan your argument by pointing out that the case had been\ndecided on a different ground below.\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: And this question of plain meaning or\nnot surfaced for the first time in the Michigan Supreme\nCourt, and that was the basis for its decision.\nMR. CASEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Did you make that argument? Did the\nState of Michigan make that argument, or was it something\nthat the Michigan Supreme Court brought up on its own?\nMR. CASEY: It was made in a few paragraphs as\none alternative argument in a long brief, but the\nprincipal thrust of the argument -- it was -- it was\nmentioned in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion and\nrejected. It's in the appendix, I believe, on page 29\nwhere they rejected it. But, yes, it was presented to the\nMichigan Court of Appeals. It is still active in the\nMichigan courts.\nQUESTION: You presented it but not as your main\nargument.\nMR. CASEY: Our argument -- our principal\nargument, the way the case was framed in the State courts\nwas this timing issue. Did Michigan properly switch over\nfrom the base-plating to the principal place of business\nand could we, therefore, impose the fee and apply the\nstatute to Yellow Freight?\nWe also argued as one of our alternative\narguments that it didn't matter or that the -- the statute\ndidn't matter -- didn't apply to specific carriers, that\nit applied broadly to everyone. The supreme court at oral\nargument asked -- started asking questions about this\ntheory that they ultimately decided it on. But the -- the\ntheory that the Michigan Supreme Court decided the case on\nwas, by no means, the -- the principal focus of the -- the\ncase that was briefed and argued below.\nQUESTION: General Casey, you -- you say that\nthe purpose of this section was to preserve State\nrevenues, but -- but -- the consequence of the -- the\ntheory that you're espousing is -- is not just to preserve\nState revenues, but to augment them. It -- it allows the\nStates to -- to take in significantly more than they took\nin before. That is, all of those considerable States that\nhad reciprocity and from whom they collected, from whose\ntrucks they collected nothing, they can now collect $10.\nThat -- that's -- it goes far beyond preserving State\nrevenues.\nMR. CASEY: Well, the -- we -- we submit that\nthe fears that have been expressed in our opponents'\nbriefs that these reciprocity agreements will\nautomatically be abrogated is unfounded, for a couple of\nreasons, principally because those reciprocity agreements\nwere originally entered into by States for economic\nreasons, totally apart from the -- the statute. It's not\nas though the -- the State is looking at this as a -- as a\ngiant money-making event --\nQUESTION: I understand that. I'm -- I'm not\nworried about the sky falling, but I'm addressing your\nargument from the purpose of the statute. And you say the\npurpose is to preserve State revenues, but you come up\nwith a theory that goes far beyond preserving State\nrevenues. It permits the States to augment their -- their\nrevenues considerably. In -- in order to preserve State\nrevenues, you need go no further than -- than your\nopponents' theory.\nMR. CASEY: Under their interpretation what has\nhappened, in effect, is that State revenues are at best\nfrozen, but in practical effect, they may really be\nratcheted downward because of changing economic\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Would you explain one thing to me\nthat response -- it relates to Justice Scalia's question,\ntoo. In this particular case, it clearly augmented State\nrevenues because the place of -- principal place of\nbusiness of this carrier doesn't have a reciprocity\nagreement. But it would seem to me that with respect to\nother carriers, it might diminish the revenue because some\nof them -- it might be just the reverse. They might have\n-- that change might go from a State with -- with a --\nwithout a reciprocity agreement to one that does have --\nMR. CASEY: Well, when Michigan changed from a\nbase-plating to principal place of business, it resulted\nin, on balance, no economic benefit.\nQUESTION: With respect to some States, it would\nincrease revenues; with respect to others, it would\ndecrease revenues.\nMR. CASEY: Correct. But --\nQUESTION: But your -- your argument is you can\ncharge everybody $10 no matter from what State. Isn't --\nisn't that your theory?\nMR. CASEY: Our -- the Michigan Supreme -- under\nthe --\nQUESTION: That you can, as far as the Federal\nstatute is concerned, charge everybody $10.\nMR. CASEY: Or the maximum that they were\ncharging at the time that the statute took effect. It may\nnot have been $10. Whatever their State maximum that they\nwere charging at the time, and some States don't have $10.\nQUESTION: No. I'm -- as far as Michigan is\nconcerned --\nMR. CASEY: As far as Michigan is concerned.\nQUESTION: -- your argument is that you can\ncharge everybody the full $10.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But Michigan has some interest in\ngetting its own trucks -- having lower fees in other\nStates I suppose.\nMR. CASEY: Of course. As we've indicated in\nour briefs, Michigan has committed that we are not going\nto abrogate our reciprocity agreements, but as I -- as\nI've indicated, there are economic reasons why States are\nnot going to, in a wholesale, abrogate these -- or these\nreciprocity agreements. They're not going to cut their\nown throats by -- by doing that. They -- they have to\nlive with these trucking companies. They have to live\nwith these economic benefits that cause them to enter into\nthese reciprocity agreements in the first place.\nAnd -- and there's another factor at work here\ntoo. The -- the 1994 ICC Termination Act required\nCongress -- or excuse me -- required the Department of\nTransportation to replace this entire regulatory scheme as\nof 1997, but it has not happened yet. Depending on the\noutcome of this case, it -- this may serve as an impetus\nto replace this entire system with something that could\nserve both the States and the trucking industry better\nthan the current system. But the -- as -- as you\nindicated, the sky is very unlikely to fall regardless of\nwhat this Court does if -- if it affirms the supreme court\nor not.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question? What --\nhow would you come out or how would the case come out if\nwe decided that the statute required every State to\nmaintain existing reciprocity agreements? It couldn't --\nthey couldn't charge higher fees and they couldn't cancel\nreciprocity agreements. Would you win or lose if we\ninterpret it that way?\nMR. CASEY: Would Michigan win or lose?\nQUESTION: Yes, in this case. As I understand\nit, you haven't changed any reciprocity agreement. You've\nmerely changed the method of deciding which State is\nrelevant for the purposes of granting reciprocity to\nparticular truckers.\nMR. CASEY: Michigan probably would not win or\nlose in that. It would probably be no change --\nQUESTION: You assert the right to terminate\nreciprocity agreements. You -- you --\nMR. CASEY: That -- under the --\nQUESTION: Your basic point here --\nMR. CASEY: Under the theory --\nQUESTION: -- is that despite this Federal\nstatute, you can terminate your reciprocity agreement with\nKansas and charge the full $10. Right?\nMR. CASEY: That's the theory of the Michigan\nSupreme Court opinion. Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But you haven't terminated the\nagreement, have you?\nMR. CASEY: We -- we have an agreement with\nIllinois, not Kansas. But we have not. We have --\nMichigan has not terminated any reciprocity agreements.\nMichigan will not. Other -- under this rationale, other\nStates could as a --\nQUESTION: General Casey I have a question about\nthe response you just gave. I thought there was lurking\nin this case as an issue, if there should be a remand,\nthat there was no viable reciprocity agreement with\nIllinois, that that terminated in 1989. Are you -- are\nyou --\nMR. CASEY: Well --\nQUESTION: -- abandoning that argument?\nMR. CASEY: No. There -- in the past, back in\nthe early 1980s, there were formal written contracts of\nreciprocity. When Michigan passed its statute in 1989\nformalizing the $10 fee, the public service commission\nterminated those contracts and contacted every State with\nwhich it had reciprocity to verify this.\nThis whole question of reciprocity is somewhat\nuncertain. Many States are not sure with whom they have\nreciprocity because various State --\nQUESTION: Is that a -- is that a live issue in\nthis case?\nMR. CASEY: Michigan has a reciprocity agreement\nwith Illinois, we believe. We -- we operate our system as\nthough we -- we give reciprocity to trucks licensed in\nIllinois, and it's our understanding that Illinois gives\nreciprocity to trucks licensed in Michigan.\nQUESTION: So there would be no point in saying\nthat that's an issue open for a possible remand.\nMR. CASEY: That's -- I believe that's correct.\nQUESTION: But that's not right. You don't give\nreciprocity to trucks licensed in Illinois. You give\nreciprocity to trucks who are owned by companies who have\nprincipal place of business in Illinois.\nMR. CASEY: That's correct. I misspoke myself,\nYour Honor. Thank you. For purposes of this case, at the\ntime we had the base-plating system, but now it's -- if --\nif we ultimately lose on that other point and we are stuck\nwith the base-plating method and could not -- and the\nMichigan court rules against us and we are stuck with the\nbase-plating method, that could cause a problem for\nMichigan.\nLet me -- let me just close by saying that we\nbelieve that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision is\nfaithful to the text, results in a consistent and a\ncoherent interpretation of the Federal statute, that is\nconsistent with the congressional intent, and we believe\nit should be affirmed. If it is not affirmed, we urge the\nCourt to remand the case back to the Michigan Supreme\nCourt for consideration of the other issues that were not\nconsidered by it.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Casey.\nMr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. A\ncouple of quick points.\nFirst, we think that the key issue in the case\nhas been identified by questions from a number of members\nof the Court. Something has to be read into the statute.\nNow, we think what we would read into the statute is\nclearly the correct thing to read into it, but even if we\nare not absolutely right about that, petitioner should\nprevail because given the agency's determination here, the\n-- the tie goes to this side of the table and we think\nthat that should be dispositive on that issue in the case.\nSecond, there's been some discussion about\nissues that are other issues in the case and -- and the\nproper disposition as to them. We think that there is no\nquestion about the existence of reciprocity agreements or\npolicies that would require remand, in response to Justice\nGinsburg's question. I think Mr. Casey has candidly\nacknowledged that there was clearly a reciprocity policy\nin place in Michigan, whether identified reciprocity\nagreement or simply unilateral policy. There was no\nquestion about the nature of that policy. There has been\nno dispute throughout the entire course of this litigation\nabout whether there was such a policy and whether it was\nconsistently enforced. And therefore, there -- I think\nthere is no subject there to be considered further on\nremand.\nThe question of whether Michigan's prospective\nchange in its policy for the 1992 registration year and\nwhether Yellow's diligence in paying that early should\nsomehow affect the proper outcome here and require Yellow\nto pay in the future --\nQUESTION: I didn't understand the last clause\nthat you just spoke.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the -- the question whether\nthe fact that Yellow paid in advance of November 15th,\n1991 for a registration year that was not going to go into\neffect until sometime in 1992 --\nQUESTION: Well, the statute says collected or\ncharged.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, as of 1991, and the\nquestion is collected or charged, in our view, for what?\nAnd we think it's for the entitlement to operate on\nMichigan's roads at the relevant time.\nI guess I would take a little bit of issue with\nwhat Mr. Schlick said. The -- the ICC we think expressly\naddressed that point in its declaratory order when States,\nincluding Michigan, said --\nQUESTION: Well, but it really hasn't been fully\nfleshed out here, that particular angle. I -- I think it\nwould be perfectly consistent to agree with your basic\nposition and still feel that was open on remand, as -- as\nthe Solicitor General said.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, our view is that if that is\n-- if there's to be further litigation on that point, the\nproper forum for that is the administrative proceeding\nthat -- that Mr. Schlick also mentioned. There is\nactually pending before the Department of Transportation a\nproceeding initiated by Michigan which takes issue with\nthe ATA's -- with the -- the ICC's determination on that\npoint and asks for reconsideration by the agency. We\nthink that that is the appropriate place to consider that\nwhere the agency can exercise its expertise. We then\nappeal to the D.C. Circuit if there's to be some -- some\nquestion about it. So that -- that's what we would\nsuggest is the appropriate --\nQUESTION: But why should we get into an issue\nthat the Michigan Supreme Court didn't resolve? It is an\nissue. You may be right or wrong on the merits of it, but\nat least we would not -- we are here reviewing a\ndetermination made by the Michigan Supreme Court. You are\nsaying that we should, at the same time, strike at an\nissue that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't reach.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, it is true the Michigan\nSupreme Court did not decide it. Our suggestion is that\nthe more appropriate place for it to be subject to further\nlitigation, if there is to be further litigation, is in\nthis agency proceeding with an appeal to the Federal\ncourt. But -- but you are correct that it was not\nexpressly addressed by the Michigan Supreme Court in this\n-- in this case.\nOne final point quickly in response to Justice\nStevens' question about whether the State terminated\nreciprocity agreements or -- or not, or simply changed its\npolicy. We think it doesn't matter how you look at it.\nEither way, the State clearly changed the rule that it was\napplying. It had a clearly articulated rule consistently\napplied that trucks based in certain places would not be\nsubject to fees. It is now changing that rule and it's\ntherefore trying to collect and charge fees as to those\ntrucks that it did not charge before or collect before,\nand we think that is clearly precluded by the statutory\nlanguage and is certainly decided by the ICC adversely to\nMichigan.\nIf there are no further questions, Mr.\nJustice --\nQUESTION: Could I ask on that question? The --\nthe point is should not exceed the fee that was charged.\nIf in the aggregate the change from the place of\ndetermining which State applies, if the aggregate were to\ndecrease the collections, which theoretically it could be,\nthen there would be no violation of the statute, as I\nunderstand it.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we think it can't be\nconsidered in the aggregate. First of all, the statutory\nlanguage refers to the fee per vehicle.\nQUESTION: No, a fee system it refers to.\nMR. ROTHFELD: It does, but if I may, Mr. Chief\nJustice, just respond briefly. The particular provision\nwhich has the fee-freezing provision refers to the fee per\nvehicle. So I think that would be precluded.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n"
