OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nKansas imposes a tax on the distributors of\nmotor fuel. The legal incidence of that tax is\nexplicitly, by statute, imposed on the distributor of the\nfirst receipt of the fuel. The tax is, thus, imposed and\ncollected off-reservation from non-Indians. The who,\nwhen, and where of the tax is all off-reservation and non-\nIndian.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, may I ask you to go\none step beyond that on an issue of fact that I just don't\nunderstand from reading the briefs? Let me give you three\nquick quotations.\nFirst, the court of appeals opinion contains\nthis statement, \"An expert on behalf of the tribe reported\nthat basic economic theory teaches that the nation's\nstation cannot charge prices high enough to allow\ncollection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel\ntaxes.\"\nThe red brief says, on page 8, \"It is undisputed\nthat enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to\nthe station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel\ntax.\"\nFinally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, \"By\nselling its fuel at market prices, respondent\" -- the\ntribe -- \"is making both a profit and collecting a tax.\"\nMy question is, Do we know, from the record,\nwhether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in\nfact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic\neffect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the\nState tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at\nmarket prices?\nMR. OLSON: I had -- I had the same question,\nJustice Souter, as I was looking at this yesterday. And I\ninvestigated it. And it is my understanding, but I did\nnot find this completely in the record, that the\ndistributor is, indeed, paying the tax, and that the tribe\nis also collecting a tax. Now, I don't quite understand\nhow you reconcile those two points that you've just\nraised. If it's -- if it's something that is economically\nnot possible, how can it -- how is it that it's being\ndone. Despite the fact that the tenth circuit held the\ntax impermissible, it's my understanding that the\ndistributor is still paying the tax. Now, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Make it up on volume, I think.\nMR. OLSON: Maybe they make it up on volume.\nMaybe people that are at the casino are willing to pay\nmore of the tax. There is a differential between the\namount of the State tax and the tribe tax. It's only a\ncouple of cents, as I understand it. But I think the\npoint --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if I may interrupt\nyou -- if it's getting passed through, and they're still\nselling their gas, then there's no -- then the tribe\ncannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing\nauthority is being compromised or threatened. And the\nargument, basically, would boil down to the argument that\nthey want to make a bigger profit.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I agree with that. And I also\nwould point out --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or want to impose a higher tax.\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or want to impose a higher tax.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. OLSON: Yeah. And what -- I think that what\n-- what this boils down to -- and I'm skipping ahead of\nmyself -- is that the tribe would like to be able to\nmarket a product without having to pay the burdens of\ntaxation all the way upstream. There are taxes on the\ndistributors' property, there's taxes that are imposed\nwhen the fuel comes out of the ground and at the refinery\nstage. So, the tribe would like to market a product\nunburdened by any upstream taxation, the cost of doing\nbusiness --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but aren't they going to\ntell us that -- as a practical matter, that the tax is\nreally being collected for the retailers? It's just being\npassed on to the retailers, but paid by the -- I take it\nthat the distributor -- the way this works -- I, again,\nhad problems with effect -- I take it the distributor\nsends out a truck. And if he sends out the truck to the\ntribe, then the distributor just pays the tax, and the\ntribe would want that tax to be -- that fuel to be\ndistributed, less the cost of the tax.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if the tribe view\nprevails, then the distributor still sends the truck to\nthe stations that are in the State and passes on the tax\nfor those --\nMR. OLSON: It's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- distributors only. I take\nit that's --\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding -- and this is\nexplained -- the details of this are explained in Section\n3410 -- I can't give you a citation to the record, but the\nstatutes, I'm presuming, are available -- that the\ndistributor pays a -- pays a tax as a result of taking the\nfuel down from what they call the rack, and then taking it\nto various service stations --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what event triggers, if\nyou will, the incidence of the tax on the distributor?\nMR. OLSON: It's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it -- is it the obligation\n-- is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas? Is\nit when it is delivered to the distributor?\nMR. OLSON: It's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or is it later?\nMR. OLSON: The statute explicitly says, Justice\nO'Connor -- this is on page 2 of the petition -- the\nincidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the\nfirst receipt of the motor fuel. And then Section --\nthat's Section 3408(c) -- Section 3410 then describes, in\na little bit more detail, the physical operation of the\nreports that the distributor has to make, and the\ndistributor has to pay the tax.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, the distributor gets the\nfuel and incurs the obligation at that point, whether or\nnot it's resold.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't incur it, or gets\na credit or get it back, if it sells to the United States\nor if it sells out-of-State. In other words, it's not\njust the receipt.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- Justice Ginsburg, it is the\nreceipt that triggers the liability for the tax. There is\na -- an exemption that may be taken in connection with\nsales to the United States, and that's a part of a massive\nquid pro quo operation, where fuel is sold to the United\nStates, and the United States pays the State back\nsubstantially all of the tax that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And out-of-State or abroad --\nMR. OLSON: And out-of-State, there is a\ndeduction for fuel sold out-of-State. That's logical,\nbecause the purpose for the tax is to pay for the roads in\nKansas, and it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then that's the problem, right\nthere, because I thought -- first, there is a tax -- you\nget a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody. So, I\ndon't think it's quite -- if you just sit there with --\nMR. OLSON: I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe not --\nMR. OLSON: I think -- I would disagree with\nyou, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't? All right.\nMR. OLSON: I think it's my understanding that\nif you sat on that fuel for the next year --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You'd still have to pay tax.\nMR. OLSON: -- you'd still have to pay --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. OLSON: -- the tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, on --\nMR. OLSON: That's my understanding. Now --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. OLSON: -- with respect to the out-of-State\ndistribution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- that's because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. OLSON: -- that fuel is not going to be used\non --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine.\nMR. OLSON: -- Kansas highways, presumably.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are Kansas. You sell --\nthe retailer in Kansas sells it to Nebraska. Nebraska is,\nin a sense, a foreign and independent State. And I guess,\nat some level, the tribes are arguing, \"Well, you sell to\nus, our local retailer. We, too, are a foreign and\nindependent State, even more so. So, if you're going to\ntreat them this way -- give the people in Nebraska a\ncredit so they don't have to pay -- why don't you treat us\nthat way? We drive on Kansas roads sometimes. So do the\nNebraskans\" --\nMR. OLSON: Well, sometimes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- -- \"sometimes.\"\nMR. OLSON: The vast --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, they say -- get into\ninterest balancing.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what -- now you have the\nwhole argument that I'm thinking of. What do you respond?\nMR. OLSON: Well, one of my responses is that\nthe tribe is located entirely within the State. The\nrecord is clear that most of the fuel purchased at that\nstation is used on highways paid for by Kansas. An\noverwhelming majority of the fuel is not used on a\nreservation road; its used on the highways of the State of\nKansas to get to the casino or to leave the casino. The\nroad that's at issue in this case is 1.5 miles long. The\nrest of the driving, according to the record, is on the\nhighways of Kansas. So, there's a clear difference there.\nWhen you sell -- when the distributors market\nfuel in Nebraska --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Olson, would it make\nany difference if all of the driving was inside the\nreservation? Would it --\nMR. OLSON: No, we would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- make any difference?\nMR. OLSON: -- we would argue that it would not\nmake any difference, Justice Stevens, because this is a\ntax on distributors. It is -- the Legislature of Kansas\nfollowed the specific advice of this Court in its\nunanimous opinion in the Chickasaw Nation that if there is\nan issue with respect to the tax being imposed on --\narguably burdening the tribe, the State can change the\nlegal incidence of the tax. That's a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- that has been\nwhat's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court,\nin Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence\non the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further.\nThat's what it said. When the State levies a tax directly\non the tribe or members inside the reservation, no\nbalancing. But then it also said that if the incidence\nrests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here,\nthen there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in.\nSo, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule,\nis when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the\ntribe.\nMR. OLSON: I -- that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. But the answer is that this is an entirely off-\nreservation tax on non-Indians. We're -- we submit that\nthere's no balancing necessary in this case unless you're\ngoing to involve an -- require States to submit to\nlitigation and engage in balancing every time an off-\nreservation tax on non-Indians has some downstream\neconomic effect. But what about the tax on the car that\nbrings the casino patron to the reservation? What about\nthe tax on the cigarettes or the alcohol or the gambling\nmachinery?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Olson, the\nSolicitor General tells us that -- and here we have -- you\nhave the statute, but they have the Kaul case that\nsuggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.\nMR. OLSON: But the Kaul case, in the context of\ndeciding whether other retailers there had standing,\nbasically said that there was an economic impact that\naffected the retailers. The Kaul case specifically\nreferred, Mr. Chief Justice, to the fact that the\nlegislature had -- and this is on page 67 of the Pacific\n2nd cite of the Kaul opinion -- the legislature amended\nthe statute -- this is at the bottom of the second column\n-- or the first column -- to clarify the question where\nthe incidence of taxation falls. The legislature provided\nthat, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax\nfalls on the distributor. Then, Mr. Chief Justice, the\ncourt went on to evaluate the standing question and\nallowed the distributors the -- to raise the issue,\nbecause the economic burden did come through the\ndistributors.\nIt's important, in that context, to note that\nthe ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling\non the retailer, it's falling on the consumer. It's\nfalling on the consumer of the gasoline. The consumer\nputs the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven\noverwhelmingly -- the facts are unquestionable in this\ncase -- overwhelmingly on the highways of the State of\nKansas. So that the burden -- ultimately, the burden --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but, again, that would\nstill be true if the incidence -- the tax was on the\nretailer rather than the wholesaler.\nMR. OLSON: It still would be true. And -- but\nthe fact is, in this case you have a -- off-reservation\ntax, on the -- all distributors --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which the statute contemplates\nwill be collected when the gas is sold to the -- by the\nretailer.\nMR. OLSON: It -- what the statute specifically\nsays -- this is Section 3409 -- it says that the\ndistributor may pass on -- \"may\" -- it's a permissive\nprovision -- may pass on the cost of the taxation as a\npart of the cost of doing business. And, of course, the\ndistributor does that with respect to the cost of its\nvehicles, the cost of other taxes it pays. It may include\nthose provisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what a strange provision.\nI mean, who would have thought that he couldn't? Why did\n--\nMR. OLSON: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they ever put that provision\nin, unless it means something different from --\nMR. OLSON: I think what it means -- I\nunderstand, Justice Scalia, and I -- because I've had the\nsame reaction, \"Well, of course he could. Why does he\nneed a statute to do that? It is a cost of doing\nbusiness.\" I think that provision is a part of the effort\nto make clear one of the factors that distinguishes this\ncase from the Chickasaw Nation case, where the court found\nthat it was significant that the distributor was required\nto pass on the tax, act as a collection agent for the\nretailer, and took a 1.5 percent commission. So, this\ncourt thought that might be significant. Kansas, in part,\nI think, want to make -- wanted to make it very clear that\nthe -- what was happening in the economic chain is cost of\nproduction of gasoline, including tax paid by the\ndistributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of\nbusiness to the retailer.\nNow, of course its cost -- it passed on, also,\nto the consumer. The question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, what does it\nmean when they say, in law, the \"incidence of the taxes on\nthe distributor\"? Does that mean anything other than that\nhe has to pay it?\nMR. OLSON: It is unclear from this court's\ndecisions precisely what \"legal incidence\" means. At\nleast it was unclear to me as I was looking through the\ncourt's decisions. But I think it's a combination of the\nliability for the tax, the responsibility to pay the tax,\nthe fact that -- in this case, the retailer has no\nliability for the tax. The only liability for the tax is\non the distributor. The relationship is between the State\nof Kansas and the distributor. And all of those factors\ntogether make it clear to me, from this court's previous\ndecisions, that \"legal incidence\" is a term of art,\nespecially in the field of taxation. And, as the court\npointed out in the Chickasaw Nation case, it's important\nto have a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the reason\nfor my question is, they look back at the court's\ndecisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of\nthe tax is. And so, there's some bright lawyer in Kansas\nwho said, \"All we have to do is pass a law saying the\nincidence is -- of the tax is on the distributor, and\nwe're going to win.\"\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it suggests that we\nshouldn't give too much weight to that.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the bright lawyer in Kansas\nwho may have done that was the Kansas Legislature,\nfollowing the unanimous decision of this court in\nChickasaw Nation, saying, \"If you want to avoid the\npotential problems that would exist, change\" -- and it's\nnot just the incidence of the tax, it's the legal\nincidence of the tax, it's -- of course, the economic\nburden of taxation is spread out throughout the chain of\ndistribution. The legal incidence of the tax, as I read\nthis court's opinions, are -- is, it is exactly what it is\nhere, the distributor must pay for the tax, the\ndistributor must account for the tax, the distributor is\nliable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid.\nNobody else is liable for it. The distributor has to pay\nthe tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline.\nHere, not only the language is as clear as it\ncould be -- I mean, the legislature specifically says it\n-- but the operation of the statute -- and the two -- the\n-- twice, the tenth circuit considered this -- the tenth\ncircuit decided the legal incidence of the tax was on the\ndistributor. The two district courts that decided it\nbefore those two tenth circuit decisions, decided that the\nlegal incidence was on the distributor. The facts support\nthat the legal incidence is on the distributor. And\nrespondents, on page 16 of the respondent's brief, it\nseems to me, acknowledge precisely that. They, in their\neffort to distinguish the Central Machinery case, which is\nthe Indian taxation statutes -- and we're not --\nspecifically said there, referring to Central Machinery,\n\"The State tax was imposed on the sale of merchandise.\nThe legal incidence of the tax there, as here, fell on the\nnon-Indian seller.\" So, the respondents have even said\nthat, on page 16 of their own brief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to one factual\nnuance on that? Apart from legal incidence, somebody\nmentioned earlier that the tax would not necessarily be\npayable until, in fact, the gasoline was distributed to\nthe retailer. Is that correct?\nMR. OLSON: That's not my understanding. I may\nbe wrong. But, as I read Section 3410, the distributor\nmust file monthly reports with the State describing the\namount of tax it's drawn down at the rack when it takes\nthe -- unloads fuel into its trucks. And it's responsible\nmonthly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that a surrogate for\nsale to the -- well, I guess what I'm getting at, the tax\napparently is not payable when the distributor receives\nthe fuel, but only when the distributor transfers the fuel\nto a retailer.\nMR. OLSON: No. I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No?\nMR. OLSON: That's not my understanding. The --\nit is not -- the incidence -- or the occasion for the\npayment of the tax isn't a sale to a retailer. You'd have\n-- I can imagine the practicalities of that would drive\neverybody crazy. The distributor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why would he be drawing\nit down, except to sell --\nMR. OLSON: Well, of course -- of course, the\ndistributor is drawing it down to sell fuel to gasoline\nstations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. OLSON: It may -- there may be some storage\ninvolved, there may be other occasions. But the fact is\nthat the distributor files a monthly report describing how\nmuch fuel is -- it receives.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, in terms of the\ntext of the statute that is -- the incidence is on the\ndistributor of the first receipt, but then there's this\nlanguage -- and it appears in a few places -- \"the tax is\nhereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery.\" What does\n-- what does that mean, that the tax is imposed on the\nuse, sale, or delivery?\"\nMR. OLSON: Well, this is -- this is an effort\nby the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be\nused in Kansas, by and large -- there's always going to be\nexceptions -- fuel that is used, by and large, in Kansas\non the roads of Kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that\nthose roads can be built and maintained. Now, how shall\nwe, mechanically, impose and collect that tax? We will do\nit on the first receipt by the distributor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean, Mr. Olson,\nthat the tax that the -- the fuel, rather, that's sold to\nthe United States Government, later, out-of-State, when is\nthe credit for the sales out-of-State made? Is that made\nat the time of the initial delivery, or is -- do they ask\nfor a refund a month later?\nMR. OLSON: I don't know the answer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I couldn't tell from the --\nMR. OLSON: I don't know the answer to that,\nJustice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that might be a\nway of identifying whether the term \"legal incidence\"\nreally has any significance.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I would say that the -- that\nif the -- this Court's prior decisions have any consistent\nmeaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the\ntax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like\nwe all do when we file our tax returns, the legal\nincidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers. The taxpayer\nhere is the distributor. The statute says so. The way\nthe statute works --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I, sort of, take \"legal\nincidence\" to mean the duty to pay the tax. And I'm just\nwondering whether -- when fuel is sold to a distributor\nthat the -- I mean, the distributor knows the fuel is\ngoing to be resold to the United States -- does he have an\nexemption from the tax, because he knows what's going to\nhappen to it, or does he have to pay the tax, or accept\nthe obligation to pay the tax, and then --\nMR. OLSON: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- subtract, later on?\nMR. OLSON: -- I think, but I can't represent to\nyou know that I know for sure, that that is an accounting\nprocess that takes place. Because these are transactions\n-- thousands of transactions that are taking place all of\nthe time. Kansas also has a practical reason for imposing\nthis tax on the distributors. There are X number of\ndistributors. You can imagine how many times X there\nmight be retailers and how many different disputes and so\nforth.\nThe point -- one of the points that this Court\nhas repeated made in connection with tax cases, and inter-\nsovereign immunity issues with respect to tax cases, is\nvitally important that there be certainty, predictability,\nand some understanding of fixed events with respect to\ntaxation. States can't be engaged in litigation\nconstantly, depending upon how many casino customers were\nhere, how many people bought this gasoline, how many\npeople bought that gasoline the next month, and how much\ndid the tribe charge for the gasoline on its reservation.\nThat kind of balancing process makes no sense whatsoever,\nand it -- and it sentences the States to litigation, and\nthis Court to repeated decisions, based upon specific\nfacts. That's why, we submit, that although the balancing\nis overwhelmingly in favor of the State, because it's a\ntax for gas that will enable someone to drive on roads\nthat the State has to pay for, that, in this situation,\none balancing test makes little sense. It simply invites\nlitigation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, you mentioned\nSection 3410. Where does that appear on --\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't find it in anybody's --\nMR. OLSON: -- I was not able to find it,\neither, in the briefs. It's -- the Kansas -- it's the --\nit's in the Kansas statutes, of course, but I couldn't\nfind it set out verbatim in the -- in the briefs. I\nsuspect it's in there someplace, but I couldn't find it\nwhen I was looking.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I couldn't either.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- could we go back --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- excuse me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to the question that\nJustice Souter raised at the outset? Because I'm really\npuzzled. This is the picture I have of the case. And\nplease tell me where it's wrong.\nTwo jurisdictions, both with authority to impose\na tax, the State and the tribe. So, if the other weren't\ntaxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can\ntax and the State can tax. But the two can't coexist,\nbecause the consumer's not going to pay the price. So,\nonly one can. And the issue is, which one dominates, and\nwhich is one is subordinate? But you have unquestionable\nauthority to tax in both. And I thought it was clear that\nthe two taxes did -- this is not a case where the tribe\ncan impose a tax, the State can im- -- oppose. I read the\nbriefs to accept that the tribe tax -- couldn't put its\ntax on top of the State tax.\nMR. OLSON: The -- it's a matter of economics,\nJustice Ginsburg, just as your question suggests. The\ntribe would not -- would like to be able to market tax-\nfree fuel at its non-regulated casino. It would --\nprobably would like -- and if this case is decided against\nthe State, it would probably not like to pay the tax on\nthe -- on the car that brings the patron --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not tax-free. I mean,\nthe -- a big thing that was made in this case was that,\nunlike the cigarette sales in the smoke shops, the tribe\nis not trying to market a tax exemption. It is putting on\nits own tax, which will cost the customer, in the end, the\nsame as if there had been a State tax.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it wouldn't have to use a tax\nto do that. It owns the station. It would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who is it taxing? Is it taxing\nitself?\nMR. OLSON: It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the tribe sells the gas\n--\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't it?\nMR. OLSON: -- precisely the point, that the\ntribe would probably not like to pay the taxes that are\npaid by the distributor or the refiner or the person that\nbrings the fuel -- the petroleum product out of the\nground. What it -- what it simply means is, the margin\nbetween the cost and the sale, that's what the tribe would\nlike. It's perfectly understandable. But it would like\nto have that and -- that tax -- and I'd like to save the\nbalance of my time for rebuttal -- but that tax is\noverwhelmingly used on the roads of Kansas -- overwhelming\nused on the roads of Kansas -- which are paid for, built,\nand maintained with the revenue produced by that taxation.\nThat's what it's for.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Olson.\nMr. Gershengorn.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN HEATH GERSHENGORN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the tribe's view, the State's defense of its\ntax today depends on a tax that does not exist. Two\ndistinct sovereigns have imposed fuel taxes here. The\nPrairie Band Potawatomi Nation has imposed a tribal tax on\na tribal station operating on tribal trust land.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it collecting that tax?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: It is, Your Honor. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what's its gripe? It\nwants a bigger profit? It wants to increase --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the taxation?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- the record is clear that\nthe two taxes cannot coexist in the long run, because it\nwould price the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- price the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- if the tribe is collecting\n-- it's assuming that -- if the tribe is collecting its\ntax, and it does not have a claim to greater taxation or\ngreater profit, then how is its sovereign right as a\ntaxing authority being interfered with?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the tribe is being\nforced right now to subsidize the sales at the station at\na loss, which it's doing for the balance of this\nlitigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Loss of profit --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: But the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- as an entrepreneur.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the tribe -- the\ntribe is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- I mean, isn't\nthat necessarily the case? If it's collecting all of its\ntax, then what it's complaining about is that it's getting\nless profit as the -- as the retailer.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, that's correct, at\nthe moment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then is that an\nissue that we should consider on a question of preemption\nwhich arises from the tribe's assertion of sovereignty?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I think it is, Your Honor,\nbecause the tribe should not be put to the choice, as a\nsovereign, where it's running a tribal business, of\nchoosing between -- of generating revenues by the tax\nversus generating revenues by the profit. There is no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in other words --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- suggestion, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- should we, in effect, say\nthere is no distinction between the tribe's position as\nsovereign and the tribe's position as retail gasoline-\nseller.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think, in that\nsituation, that the two are very similar, in the same way\nwhen a State sells at a State liquor store --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they're similar, because\nit -- ultimately, it's all going into the same pocket. We\nrealize that. But, unless there is a claim that its\ntaxing authority, as such, is being threatened or\ninterfered with, I don't quite see why a preemption theory\nthat rests upon tribal sovereignty has any place in the\nanalysis.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Because, Your Honor, the -- it\nis exactly the tribal taxing authority that interfered.\nIt's a -- it's quite a strange form of taxing authority\nthat says you can tax the -- you can tax the station, but\nthen -- but then essentially have to operate the station\nat a loss. That's not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not operating at a\nloss.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's strange about it? I\nmean, every upstream tax, as Mr. Olson said, raises the\nprice of goods and services. And it's harder to retail\nthem, because they cost more. So, that's true of every\nsingle good sold on the reservation. So I take it your\nclaim must -- and, of course, it may or may not be true\nthat the tribe can put a tax on that. It depends upon\nMR. GERSHENGORN: That is not a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose they can't?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: That is not a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, my question is, If we\nhold for you here, and we don't take an absolute\nprinciple, well, I guess States are forbidden to put any\nupstream taxes on.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't that so?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Because that does not describe\nthe tax that's at issue here. The tax at issue here is\nimposed on the sale or delivery of fuel to the tribe on\nthe reservation, and that is plain --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, isn't it -- but they\nsay no, that it's imposed on the delivery to the\ndistributor --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: And --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of fuel.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- and that, Your Honor, is\nnot correct. What they have done is conflate two\nconcepts, the incidence of the tax --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it's what the --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- and the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- statute says.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I -- with respect, Your Honor,\nI don't think it is what the statute says. The statute\nsays, in 3408, \"a tax per gallon is hereby imposed on the\nuse, sale, or delivery of fuel.\" It does not say \"the\nreceipt of fuel.\" \"The distributor\" is defined as\nsomebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers fuel.\nAll of the critical exemptions in the statutes are based\non the distributor's subsequent sale or delivery of fuel\nto the United States, out-of-State, the Federal contract\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's just a\nsubsequent deduction. I mean, if we get income, we're\ntaxed on it. If we make a charitable contribution, we get\na deduction. But that doesn't mean we don't have to pay\nand are subject to the income tax.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, this would be a\nvery different case if the State had -- if the legislature\nhad passed a tax that said, \"This is a tax on receipt,\"\nand we were trying to argue that these -- that somehow\nthese exemptions made it not a tax on receipt. But the\nlegislature has said it is a tax on the \"use, sale, or\ndelivery.\" And if I could point to two provisions that I\nthink make this crystal clear, that it is not a tax on\nreceipt, but on the subsequent use, sale, or delivery.\nThe first is 3417, which provides --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- and that is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- where is it?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- at 10(a) in the appendix,\nhas received the fuel, if he subsequently loses the fuel\n-- has it lost or burned -- gets a refund of the tax, if\nit's -- if that happens before he uses, sells, or\ndelivers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: The other thing that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- works with the income\ntax, too. You have casualty losses and things like that.\nIt turns out you were subject to the tax, but you don't\nhave to pay it, because you get a deduction. But that\ndoesn't mean you're not subject to it in the first place.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, there are -- there\nis literally nothing in the statute except for the\nincidence provision, which is what the State relies on,\nthat makes this a tax on receipt. And, if I could, in\nCentral --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, we ought to know, because\nthey've been -- haven't they had this for a while? So,\nthere must be a dealer somewhere who's not on the\nreservation -- he's a distributor -- somebody delivered to\nhim a thousand gallons, and it's sitting there in his\ntank. Doe he have to pay the tax, or doesn't he?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I don't -- I think\nthat you're -- that he would pay the tax in that instance\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if he would --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- but I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- pay the tax, then it is not\n--\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I don't think so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- on his --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- redistribution.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He is -- sorry -- if -- I'd\nlike to ask the question.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- and you can say why this\nis wrong -- if he gets a thousand gallons from whoever --\nExxon or somebody -- and he puts it in the tank, and he\nhasn't sold it, and he has to pay the tax, then it would\nseem to me to be a sale on the distribution to him, not\nthe sale on his distribution to somebody else. Now, why\nis that wrong?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Because -- two reasons, Your\nHonor -- in the real world, what happens is the\ndistributor picks up the fuel at the rack and delivers it\nto the retailer. If the -- if the distributor takes the\nfuel and holds it, he's not a distributor under the\nstatute. A distributor is somebody who receives and uses,\nsells, or delivers. That's in -- on page 2(a) of the red\nbrief, Your Honor. So that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, now you're telling me\nsomething different from what I understood. I thought you\nsaid it probably has happened in the history of this tax\n--\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that a distributor picked up\na gallon of fuel, held it, and has not yet redistributed\nit. So, you're saying that's never happened.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I'm not aware of\nthat happening. But what I would say -- the point that I\nwould like to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I'm certain about what the\ntax is on, what should we do? Dismiss the case or send it\nto the -- ask a question, or what?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think that this\nCourt can decide this question based on what the face of\nthe statute is -- itself says.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we can --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: No court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think we can decide it on\nthe basis that we know that when the distributor puts --\ndelivers gas to the gas station, it's not instantly sold.\nI mean, even we know that.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: No, Your Honor -- that's\ncorrect, Your Honor. But the statute provides that the\ntax is on the sale by the distributor to the tribe on its\nreservation. It is exactly like what happened in Central\nMachinery. In Central Machinery, the incidence of the tax\nwas indisputably on the off-reservation seller. This\nCourt, nevertheless, said, correctly, that the taxable\nevent, the thing that was being taxed, was the sale of\ntractors to the tribe on the reservation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the statute says\n--\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- that was, therefore,\npreempted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the statute says it's\na tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the\nfirst sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and\nthat's why the incidence of the tax is on him.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: With respect, Your Honor, what\npart (c) says, which is what you're reading from, it says,\n\"the incidence of the tax is imposed on the distributor of\nfirst receipt.\" That is the \"who.\" That is not the\n\"what.\" The \"what\" is in -- is in 79-3408(a), and it is\nclearly imposed on the use, sale, or delivery of the fuel.\nIf I could, another provision of the statute\nthat also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But nobody -- but it's\nnot sold -- it's not taxed twice. If it's sold to a\ndistributor, that distributor has to pay the tax. The\ndistributor then sells it to someone else. That someone\nelse doesn't have to pay the tax.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: That's right, Your Honor. But\nthe question is, What exactly is the State purporting to\ntax? This is a situation in which the State is not being\nunambiguous -- is being unambiguous about what it's\ntaxing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what -- perhaps the\nState expresses it that way just to cover some people who\nget their gas illegally, and they would say the tax is\nstill due, even if you haven't gotten your gas from a\ndistributor who has paid the State tax. Wouldn't that\nsuffice for why the court imposes the tax on the use,\nsale, or delivery? Use, sale, or delivery.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think the term\n\"use\" is the distributor's use. The scheme that Kansas\nhas set up is a sensible one. It is, the distributor gets\nthe tax and then has three choices. It can use it, sell\nit, or deliver it. And if the distributor -- if the\ndistributor is -- hasn't done one of those things, then\nit's -- then it -- then the distributor can be made liable\nfor any tax increases that have -- that happen while the\ndistributor is holding the tax. And so, in our view, and\nin every court that we're aware of's view -- tenth circuit\ndidn't decide this case on the assumption that this was a\ntax on receipt of fuel off the reservation. What the\ntenth circuit said was that Kansas is now attempting to\ncollect its tax for the first time, a tax on motor fuel\ndistributed to Indian lands. It is, again, the same thing\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose you're\nright. Can you answer my first question? Can you even\nremember it? I'll summarize. On your assumption. Look,\nthe Indians, if there is a tax -- they have a retail shop\nor they have things on the reservation, they go buy them\n-- Kansas can't impose a tax on what goes on, on the\nreservation. We go through the balance. But they\ncertainly could impose a tax on the department store in\nKansas City, couldn't they?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, the Indian then goes to\nthe department store and buys it. He has to pay the tax,\ndoesn't he?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now what he does, he\nsays, \"Call up and\" -- he says, \"Please deliver it.\" Now\nhe doesn't have to pay the tax?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the answer is:\nthat's correct, and that's exactly what happens in the\ncommerce clause when a person from Virginia buys something\nfrom Illinois and has it delivered to himself in Virginia.\nThey don't pay the sales tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the commerce\nconstitutionally --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: No, Your Honor, under\ninterstate sales tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: It's the same situation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- we're now talking Federal\nrules. Go ahead.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry. It was -- it's the\nsame situation there. The question is, Where does the\nrelevant sale take place? And it takes place -- in the\nVirginia/Illinois situation, the sale takes place in\nVirginia, which is why you don't pay Illinois sales tax,\nthough you may pay Virginia use tax. It would be the same\nthing in the tribal situation. The sale in that place,\njust like the sale in Central Machinery, takes place on\nthe reservation. And what this Court said, in Central\nMachinery, is that a sale to a tribe of goods on the\nreservation is -- cannot be taxed by the State. And,\nindeed, because this tax is on the sale on the\nreservation, the broader balancing principles apply. The\ntribe here has imposed the -- its tax on a tribal station,\non a tribal land, right where this Court has said its\ntribal taxing authority is strongest, and has dedicated\nthose revenues to improving the miles of dirt and gravel\nroad on the reservation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it relevant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you what the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the balancing test --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask you a question\nabout the Federal exemption? In your view, is that made\navailable at the time of the initial purchase by the\ndistributor, or does he have to, in effect, claim a credit\nlater on?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: It -- that way it works, in\npractice, Your Honor, is -- and their form is in the back\nof the red brief -- is that the distributor writes down\nthe number of gallons received, and writes down the number\nof gallons sold to the United States, nets that out, and\npays the tax on the net, so that it's -- it's essentially\ndone at the -- at the same time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that he -- his obligation\nto sell the gas is -- arises at the same time as his\npurchase.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I'm not sure his obligation to\ndo so, but the form is due on the 25th of the month -- of\nthe next month. And so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it shows both what they\nresell to the United States and what they acquired.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Correct, Your Honor. It shows\ngallons received, gallons exported, gallons sold to the\nUnited States.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And let me ask you this\nquestion, too, on that subject. Do you think that the\nexemption that the State allows for resales to the United\nStates is constitutionally compelled?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think the answer\nto that is yes, under our theory of the case, but no,\nunder their theory of the case. The exemption to the\nUnited States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's no under our --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- is constitutionally --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- our precedent, I think,\nisn't it?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's no, under our precedent.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Well, it depends, Your Honor,\non whether the legal incidence is on the United States or\nwhether the incidence is on the seller. Under this --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, on that --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- Court's precedence --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- on the legal incidence of\nthe tax, we suggested, in the Chickasaw Nation case, that\na tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence\nwould be dispositive. So, why don't we read the statute\nand say the incidence is on the distributor, and that's\nthe end of it?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Because, Your Honor, I don't\nthink that's what this Court's cases say. I think what\nthis Court's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I thought that's --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- cases say --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- what we suggested in\nChickasaw Nation.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Chickasaw said when the tax\nwas imposed on the tribe, we would take the State at its\nword. It said it's taxing the tribe. If the State put\nthe tax on a non-Indian, then there would be balancing.\nAnd that's what Chickasaw --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: That's my understanding, as\nwell. And this Court has always held it's a Federal\nquestion where legal incidence lies, and has not deferred\n-- has given --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if balancing --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: But if I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- then how do you come out?\nBecause what they're saying is, \"Okay, balance. Fine.\nYou want to balance? Here's how you balance.\"\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the one hand, the Indians\nhave to pay the tax. Okay, that's true. And it's harder\nfor them to impose their own tax. That's true of every\nupstream tax. And it goes for roads that they use all the\ntime. And they just have a one-and-a-half mile -- and why\nshouldn't they be treated every -- like everybody else,\nwhen they're going to use the roads the tax pays for? So,\nthe balancing works in their favor. Now, what's your\nresponse?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: That the -- Your Honor, we\ndisagree with that at every level. This -- the tribal tax\nis addressed to a specific road -- road problem that the\nFederal Government has identified and addressed in the\nReservation Road Program. The reservation roads are in\nabysmal shape, as the Federal Government has recognized.\nMore than 70 percent are in poor shape, poor condition.\nThe fatality rate is four times the national average. And\nthe tribe is using those revenues to fix -- advance that\nparticular Federal interest, which is reflected in Federal\nstatutes and in the Federal regulatory scheme.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should all of that make a\ndifference? You make a big point in the briefing, \"Well,\nyou're not marketing the exemption, you're taxing, you're\nusing\" -- if the -- if the tribe does have the sovereign\nright to tax or not to tax, why can't it use it not to tax\nat all and say, \"We're giving\" -- why is there a\npresumption in favor of imposing taxes? Why can't the\ntribe say, \"We're not going to tax you if you come to the\nreservation. Come on in and buy our gas. No tax\"?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: This --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't -- why isn't that\npart of the tribal sovereign right?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Because this Court has held,\nin Colville -- and we don't dispute here -- that when the\ntribe is marketing an exemption, it has no -- it has no --\nthere are no Federal and tribal interests implicated. And\nwe're not challenging that here. What this Court has said\nis that when a tribe is generating real value on the\nreservation so that it has created a market, as this tribe\nhas, to draw people onto the reservation and can sell its\nfuel at market value, it has a sovereign right and\ninterest in taxing that -- in imposing a tax that the\nState can't interfere with. And the State here has\naccommodated --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who is -- who is the tribe\ntaxing? Is the tribe taxing the purchaser of the gas? Is\nthat --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: No, it taxes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- the retailer. It taxes the\nretailer, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the retailer was the\ntribe.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: It is. It taxes the tribal\nstation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's taxing itself.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: It is, Your Honor, but that\ntax is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's real neat. I have never\nheard of that before.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, actually, it\nhappens all the time. Pennsylvania imposes a tax on\nState-sold liquor. North Carolina does it. All the\nState-run liquor stores are subject to a State-imposed\ntax. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, did I\nunderstand your earlier discussion, about the department\nstore, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck,\nand they picked up the fuel and then brought it back,\nthat, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, even\nthough the economic incidence and effect is going to be\nthe same?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, at that point,\nCentral Machinery wouldn't apply. I think that would be a\ncloser case for the balancing, in that situation. The --\nso, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't concede that. But, in this\ncase, it's much stronger, because the tax is on the\nreservation.\nIf I could also just point to one thing that\nJustice Breyer raised about the -- about the exemptions\nfor other States. What this -- what Kansas has done is\nprovide an exemption for every other sovereign that's\nimplicated -- for other States, for other countries, for\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it --\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- the United States --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- constitutionally compelled\nto do so?\nMR. GERSHENGORN: It's -- it is, Your Honor, in\nthis sense. It comes in, in two situations. First, it is\n-- the Constitution and the Federal preemption doctrine\nprohibit discrimination. And so, it is, in that sense.\nBut it also goes to the strength of the State interest\nhere. The State has not only -- has accommodated the out-\nof-State interest, it has also accommodated the in-State\nGovernment interests, other than the tribe. It gives 30\nto 40 percent of the fuel revenues to counties and to\ncities for roads. Every other sovereign is accommodated\nhere except for the tribe, and we think that's exactly\nwhat Federal law prohibits and why the strength of the\ntribal interest here, and the tribe's interest in imposing\nthe tax to fix reservation roads, to advance that Federal\ninterest, is exactly what deserves protection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Cities and counties --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- aren't sovereign.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- your claim wouldn't\ndisappear if they decided to tax all these other\nsovereigns.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your claim, as a tribe, would\nnot disappear if they decided to become nondiscriminatory\nand tax all of the sales.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, it wouldn't\ndisappear, but it might alter the -- it would alter the\nbalance. If the -- what is troubling here is that the\nState has asserted a right in predictability, but the\nState's right in predictability is only coming at the\nexpense of a refusal to accommodate the tribal interests\nin the say way it accommodates every other sovereign. And\nso, we do think that that goes to the strength of the\nState's interest here, and to the State -- the strength of\nthe -- of the State's assertion of its tax.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And your view generally was\nthat it was -- that it was indicative of discrimination.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: I think it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I thought that was the\nstronger argument, because the -- you're saying, \"Look,\nthe State has only the most trivial interest in the amount\nof taxation it would get here.\" That would be equally\ntrue whether it forgives taxes that -- on fuel that goes\nto the United States or not. But the discrimination\npoint, if it's a fair one, would be the same.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think -- that's\ncorrect, and we've made both arguments, that it's a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it would matter.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: -- that the discrimination is\na freestanding reason that, even under an express\npreemption test like the State has articulated, we would\nprevail and that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All the other sovereigns you\nmentioned do not consume the gas -- or the gas sold to\nthem is not consumed primarily on the roads of this State,\nexcept for cities and counties, which aren't sovereigns.\nI mean, they simply aren't sovereign. That's the State,\nitself. They're subdivisions of the State. So, it's\nmaking exemptions for its own -- its own State, plus\nexemptions for sovereigns, where the gas sold to those\nsovereigns probably will not be used primarily on the\nroads of this State.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, there is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It makes perfect sense. I\ndon't see there's any discrimination.\nMR. GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe tribe here has imposed a tribal tax on sales\nat a tribal business on the tribe's own reservation on\ntribal land. The exercise of that power of taxation is at\nthe core of tribal sovereignty, as this Court has long\nrecognized, and that power --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it being interfered with?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And, as to that question, I\nwould point the Court to page 142 of the joint appendix,\nor page 12 of the petition appendix, in which the Court\ndiscusses the expert opinion that the tribe introduced\ninto the record.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that expert opinion is\nthat, as an economic matter, you can't collect both.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, he says --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can't impose both. But the\ntribe is still imposing its tax, and it's getting every\npenny that it -- that it purports to impose.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it is operating at a loss.\nAs I understand it, the tribe has chosen to subsidize --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- out of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- is that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- revenues.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in the record?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That is my understanding of\nwhat's happening. That's not in the record. What is in\nthe record --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume -- let's assume\nthat is true. What difference does that make to an\nanalysis based on a preemption theory which is supposed to\ntake account of tribal sovereignty? The sovereign act is\nnot selling gas, it's taxing. They are taxing. They're\ngetting everything they want under their tax statute.\nWhere, then, is there a basis for a preemption --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think, for example, in this\nCourt's decision in Colville, where the Court stressed\nthere that the Court was marketing an exemption from State\ntaxation; that portion of the analysis of the Court there\ndid not turn on whether the tribe was imposing its own\ntax. It turned --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I mean, it was --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- it turned on economic --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- an entirely separate -- an\nentirely separate rationale. It was saying the tribe is\ngetting this tremendous advantage by -- or wants this\ntremendous advantage -- by marketing the exemption.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the flip side of that in\nColville was that if the -- if the tribe, in that case,\nhad been selling to people who would have been on the\nreservation anyway -- in other words had not come onto the\nreservation to take -- just to take advantage of an\nexemption from State taxation -- but would have been on\nthe reservation anyway, the Court specifically\ncontemplated, in that situation, that the tax might well\nbe preempted, because it would be interfering --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe -- maybe it\ncontemplated that, and maybe it simply contemplated that\nthat particular -- that particular argument against it --\ni.e., that it was simply selling a tax exemption -- would\nnot have been an argument against it. But it doesn't\nfollow, from that, that the tribe would necessarily have\nhad a winning argument on a preemption theory.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but we -- but we believe it\nis a winning argument. I think the fair reading of\nColville is that the Court would have seen that as quite\ndifferent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's a winning -- of\ncourse it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in\nfact, it's an interference -- look, every upstream tax\nraises the price of goods and services. Every upstream\ntax -- indeed, every tax in the world -- makes it harder\nto sell the product. So, every tax makes it harder for\nthe tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody\nelse. Now, if that's the basis for saying it's an\ninterference, then every tax is an interference. And I\ndon't see how that could be.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. This is -- this is not\njust any upstream tax, and it -- and the theory here is\nnot based on economic impact.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, so far, your theory is\nbased on economics, as I've heard it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if it isn't, I would like\nto know what it is.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Under the -- first of all,\nin our -- it is our position that, under the Kansas\nSupreme Court's decision in Kaul, which should get\ndeference in terms of understanding operative incidence of\nthe State tax. The incidence of the tax is, in fact, on\nthe retailer. And the court there found it critical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The incidence of the tax --\nMR. KNEEDLER: The legal incidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- was -- is on the retail --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's very surprising. When I\nread the statute, it doesn't have one word about the\nretailer being obliged to pay --\nMR. KNEEDLER: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- anything.\nMR. KNEEDLER: As we read the Kansas Supreme\nCourt's decision, it's not without ambiguity, but we\nbelieve the better reading of that -- of that decision is\nthat, as a matter of legislative intent, the incidence of\nthe tax, who is ultimately going to pay the tax --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- is on the retailer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the legal incidence of the\ntax, I would think their side would win, in my mind. Now\nsuppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not\non that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That would tell -- that would\ntell you -- I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, and if we get\ninto balancing, which I don't know, what is to be said in\nfavor of the Indian side? It sounded to me as if it's\nharder for them to tax. So, I'm thinking, well, that's\ntrue of every tax. And then, put it on something else.\nPut it on the tires. Put it on anything else, if you can.\nIt'll be harder for them to tax non-Indians. But I didn't\nknow they had a Federal right to tax the non-Indians.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, they do. And, again, this\nis the situation contemplated in Colville. It's analogous\nto what this Court said in Cabazon with respect to the\ngambling facility, where the tribe has introduced on-\nreservation value. And in Colville, the court\ncontemplated if the tribe puts a service station and sells\nto people who would be there anyway, that is on-\nreservation value; they are not simply marketing a tax\nexemption and drawing people in by virtue of a tax\nexemption.\nBut, beyond that, just because -- if the Court\nconcludes that the incidence of the tax is on the\ndistributor, notwithstanding the Kansas Supreme Court's\ndecision, the subject matter of the tax, the \"what is\nbeing taxed,\" is the sale or distribution, and that is a\nsale between the distributor and the retailer. That is\nclearly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't it the\nsale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and\nthe distributor?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- because if you look in -- it\nbecomes particularly clear if you look at the form that is\nat the back of the respondent's brief, but we also believe\nit's clear from the -- from the provisions of the statute\nthat are on page 8(a) of the brief. One that hasn't been\ndiscussed, for example, is exemption D5 -- excuse me --\nthe exception for deliveries to other distributors. In\nthat -- in that situation, there is no tax. And, in fact,\nthe form, on page 19(a), makes it clear that any sales by\none distributor to another are automatically exempted and\nnot counted in the computation at all.\nSo, distributor-to-distributor taxes are\nexempted. And this Court, in the Chickasaw case, said\nthat's very instructive, that the incidence of the tax is\non the retailer. Whether or not the incidence is there,\nthe transaction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me exempting\ndistributor-to-distributor taxes just means that only one\ndistributor has to pay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Only one distributor has to pay,\nbut it means that a sale between the first distributor and\nthe second distributor, for example, is not taxed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's because there\nwas a tax on the first sale to the first distributor. And\nmay I ask this? Supposing --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Actually, there is not. The tax\nis on the last distributor, with respect to his sale to\nthe -- to the retailer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but that's because when a\ndistributor sells to another distributor, he is not\nacting, for purposes of that sale, as a distributor.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you sell to another\ndistributor, you're not being --\nMR. KNEEDLER: That makes -- that makes my\npoint, that the -- that the statute, in applying to any\nuse, delivery, or sale, the sale at issue is the sale that\nultimately comes from a distributor to a retailer. And,\nunder this Court's decisions in Central Arizona Machinery\nand the Bracker case, a sale by a -- by someone residing\noff the reservation, but where the sale takes place on the\nreservation, as this one clearly does -- the gasoline\nthat's delivered there -- that is absolutely preempted\nunder Central Arizona Machinery and the Indian Trader\nStatutes, because you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But none of this -- none\nof this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it? I\nmean, they didn't care where the incidence was. They just\nwent right into the balancing, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, that's true. And if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think that was\nwrong.\nMR. KNEEDLER: We think the court was wrong to\nconclude that the incidence was on the -- was on the\ndistributor. And if the Court has a question about that,\nit could remand to certify that question to the Kansas\nSupreme Court to clear it up, any ambiguity after Kaul.\nBut, even on the tenth circuit's own way of approaching\nit, we believe that it was then correct, because it\nproperly applied this Court's approach of looking at the\nparticular context of the Federal, State, and tribal\ninterests. And here, there are very powerful tribal\ninterests in maintaining --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the one other -- the\ninterest other than the interest on being able to tax an\nitem that an upstream tax prevents you from doing because\nof the economics?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is the very same --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that the only one, or are\nthere other ones?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- it's the very same interest\nthat the State is asserting, which is the interest to\nimpose a fuel tax in order to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've got the -- --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- maintain the roads --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- on the reservation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I want to hear you and know\nif there's an additional one. I'm not disputing that one.\nI just want to be sure I get them all. One is -- one is\nthat one.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Is this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What else?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- is the general -- the general\nability to impose a tax. But here, the interest is\naugmented by the fact that the tax is dedicated by tribal\nlaw to maintaining tribal roads, not just this one-and-a-\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I just don't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- -half mile --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- understand. Why doesn't\nthe tribe have an incidence of not having any tax at all,\nhelping --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- helping its members?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why does the balancing only\nwork if it taxes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We don't think it does. Under\nthe Colville's decision, if the State is not just -- or\nthe tribe is not just marketing an exemption from State\ntaxation, we think that the tribe -- that the State tax is\npreempted there, as well. But here, where the tribe is\nasserting not simply a commercial interest, selling at\nmarket value and not marketing a tax exemption of States\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. You say that it\ncould --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- it's imposing a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- market the exemption?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say that a tribe can\nmarket its exemption?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, we do not. Under this --\nunder this Court's decision in Colville, it can't -- the\ntribe cannot market an exemption, at least to people who\nwould not otherwise be on the reservation. But here, the\ntribe is asserting both a commercial interest -- selling\nat profit; and also a sovereign interest -- in taxing.\nAnd where you have a tribe asserting both --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't that sovereign\ninterest in not taxing?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It could. But here, the tribe\nhas asserted a sovereign interest in its tax, and that is\nwhat is being substantially interfered with.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Olson, you have four and a half minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the Supreme Court's\ncharacterization of this as being --\nMR. OLSON: The Kaul --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- Kaul case? I read -- I don't\nthink the Kansas Supreme Court could have been any more\nclear. It said the legislature amended the legislation to\nclarify where the incidence of taxation falls. It\nprovided that the incidence of the tax falls on the\ndistributor. Then, in Victa, in connection with the\nstanding issue, because economic burden fell on the\nretailers, it found that the retailers and -- those other\nretailers had standing.\nKansas could not have been more clear. In\nSection 3401(f)(3), it defines a \"distributor\" as someone\nwho receives the product. In 3408(c), it's -- taxes the\ndistributor on the first receipt of the tax. In 3410, it\nagain says it's on the distributor. Two district courts\nand two courts of appeals found that the legal incidence\nof the tax was on the distributor. The Kansas Supreme\nCourt said the same thing, the distributor is liable for\nthe tax, pays the tax. The retailer has no liability for\nthe tax. What in the world can Kansas do to make it\nclearer?\nNow, the Central Machinery case that's -- that\nmy opponents have been speaking about is a case that was\ndecided under the Indian Trader Statutes with respect to\nthe trading with the Indians, with respect to Central\nMachinery case, was -- over tractors sold on the\nreservation for use on the reservation. It fell within\nthe scope of the Indian Trader Statute. But this Court\nhas made clear, in a number of cases, the Indian Trader\nStatutes would not remotely apply.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it Kansas has not\nindicted the distributor for failing to register under the\nIndian Trading Statute.\nMR. OLSON: No, they're -- it hasn't really been\nmentioned until the -- I mean, hardly mentioned at all,\nuntil the Government decided to -- the United States\nGovernment decided to discuss that point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there usually two\nincidents? You talk about the incident of the taxes on a\nperson, but it's also on an event. And what event is --\nin your -- in your judgment is --\nMR. OLSON: Well, the statute could not be more\nclear, Justice Scalia. It is the receipt by the\ndistributor of the fuel. That is what the statute says.\nIt is as plain --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if the fuel --\nMR. OLSON: -- as it could be.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- were destroyed by flood or\nlightning or something like -- before it was resold to the\nretailer, there would be no tax --\nMR. OLSON: There's an exemption for losses like\n-- one of the Court's questions with respect to a casualty\nloss or something that -- but it's limited. The\nliability, nonetheless, exists on the distributor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any incidents in\nwhich the distributor would pay the tax if he was not able\nto resell it to somebody else?\nMR. OLSON: I think that -- I think the reading\nof the statute is plain. If the distributor took the\nfuel, kept it, decided to warehouse it because the costs\nare going up or something like that, it would still have\nto pay the tax, because the tax is on the receipt by the\ndistributor.\nIn answer to your question, Justice Stevens,\nWould those other exemptions, the United States Government\nbe required by the Constitution, or the other States? No,\nnot under this Court's decision in the Blaze case, which,\nas I understood it, was unanimous. The Fresno case, U.S.\nvs. New Mexico, it's not a tax on the United States. It's\n-- or an agency of the United States. So they wouldn't be\nrequired. But they make sense, because the sales to other\nStates are for people that drive on other States'\nhighways. The sales to the United States Government is an\nexchange for almost the same amount of money that comes\nback. So, there's a rational purpose. It's not\ndiscrimination.\nThe tribe makes the point that it's generating\nreal value and reservation value. This is fuel that's\nused in cars that are -- drive all over the State of\nKansas. The casino is there, so people come to the\ncasino. And, under Cabazon, there might be some value\nadded by the casino, which, by the way, is an exempt value\ncreated by an exemption from regulation. But the value\nfor someone who puts fuel in their car is so that that car\nwill then drive. And that -- cars that drive, in this\ncase, drive on Kansas highways.\nThis, ultimately is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Olson.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you.\n"
