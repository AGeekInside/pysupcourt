The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.\nMr. Berger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BERGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are three important things that should be\nkept in mind while we're addressing the issue this\nmorning. First, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency\ntotally prohibited a select group of individual landowners\nscattered around Lake Tahoe from making any use whatever\nof their land. These prohibitions were never designed as\nthe kind of planning time-out touted by TRPA and its\namici. Rather, they were amendments --\nQUESTION: Well, what about a temporary order\nthat says, gee, we're required by State law to develop a\nplan and it's going to take us a few months and, pending\nthat, you can't develop? Now, does that invoke\nimmediately some per se taking rule?\nMR. BERGER: It does if it's a flat prohibition\nof use, Your Honor, and if there is --\nQUESTION: A flat prohibition that says, while\nwe're developing this plan, which we think won't take\nlong, you can't go ahead with your development?\nMR. BERGER: Justice O'Connor, I do believe that\nif it is a total prohibition on use, and there is no use\nbeing made of the property at the time, that it's part of\nthe public project to have this freeze on use, and it's\nthe public that ought to be paying for that project, not\nthe individual landowners who are frozen out.\nQUESTION: Suppose that -- we'll have to play\nwith the facts a little bit, it's a hypothetical case, but\nthat within a month from now the World Trade Center is\nready to be constructed and New York says -- and the owner\nwants to rebuild highrises for office only, and the city\nsays, wait a minute, this is so important to the whole\ncity, we need a year to think about it, a year in addition\nto the usual zoning process. A taking?\nMR. BERGER: I think if they forbid the entire\nuse of the property and don't allow any applications for\nuse to be made, don't allow the owner to do anything --\nQUESTION: Well, they could use it for a parking\nlot.\nMR. BERGER: If there is some reasonable,\neconomically viable, productive use that can be made of\nthe property at the time, then I don't believe we have a\nper se taking.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess my question -- and I\nknow you had a more general introduction before I\ninterrupted you, is the use of a moratorium a standard\ninstrument of zoning policy, or is it very rare? I\ncouldn't find anything in the briefs on this.\nMR. BERGER: It has, I believe, become much more\nrare these days. There's an awful lot more planning going\non. Agencies are doing a better job of planning, and they\nfind the need for this kind of a total prohibition on\ndevelopment to be made.\nQUESTION: My impression is that most of these\nmoratoriums, or moratoria, whatever they're called, would\nnot be total. I mean, if you're considering altering a\nrural zoning scheme that now doesn't have any limit on\nnumber of residencies per acre, and you're thinking of,\nsay, no more than one house on every 3 acres, the only --\nand that's what you're thinking about, the only moratorium\nyou would have to impose would be no more -- until we make\nup our mind, no more than one house on every 3 acres. It\nwouldn't say, nobody does anything while we're sucking our\nthumb on this question, right?\nMR. BERGER: That's correct, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: And --\nMR. BERGER: -- and I think that's the more\ntypical kind of moratorium, and the kind that most of the\namici on the agency's side have been talking about.\nQUESTION: There was one Minnesota moratorium\nthat was -- seemed somewhat like this that had been\nsustained by, I think the Minnesota appellate court.\nMR. BERGER: There was one, Your Honor, and I\nwould submit that that court erred. It happens. Lower\ncourts do that sometimes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BERGER: And we believe that --\nQUESTION: So we notice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BERGER: And we believe that that simply is\nnot an appropriate precedent for this Court to follow.\nQUESTION: Why, why is it -- I guess this is\ngoing to be your basic point. Why is it the case -- let's\ntake not this moratorium, but let's take a moratorium that\nlasts for a year, and after that time everyone believes\nthe board will allow certain kinds of development. Other\nthings being equal, that year of no use would probably\nhave reduced the value of the land by 5, 10 percent. Now,\nso why, since that's the effect of the moratorium I'm\nimagining, should the public have to give compensation for\nthat small diminution in value?\nMR. BERGER: Because it's not the diminution in\nvalue we're talking about here, Your Honor. It's the\ntotal elimination of the ability to make use of the\nproperty, and in all of this Court's cases you have talked\nabout denial of economically productive use of land, and\nwhat we're doing here, and what you're talking about in\nyour hypothetical, Justice Breyer, is taking away the\nright to use that land.\nIt's as if I took away your car for a year and I\nparked it in the garage and I kept good care of it, and I\nreturned it to you at the end of the year with no\ndiminution in value whatsoever, or perhaps the 5 percent\nthat Your Honor hypothesized. You still would have been\nwithout the use of that car for a year, and I think that\nyou would be entitled to compensation for the fact that I\ndeprived you of the use of that car.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly if the respondent\nhere had simply said, we're going to need your property\nfor 3 years, and so we're going to take a leasehold\ninterest for 3 years, the respondent would have had to\ncompensate for that.\nMR. BERGER: Chief Justice, I couldn't agree\nwith that more, and I believe that that is in fact what\nwe're dealing with here.\nQUESTION: No, but you're -- it seems to me\nyou're not dealing with that here, because in that\nhypothetical the person, the third party in fact takes the\nproperty in the sense of using it for that party's own\nbenefit. Here, no one, the Tahoe Regional Planning\nAuthority isn't using the property for its benefit. It's\nsaying that during this period of time there are some\nthings that you can't do.\nMR. BERGER: That's true, Justice Souter, but\nfrankly I don't see the difference between them, because\nthe Government --\nQUESTION: Well, one difference is that the\nperson taking in the one hypothetical gets a considerable\npersonal value, i.e., the use of a car, or the use of\nproperty for a period of time. There's no such fact in\nevidence here.\nMR. BERGER: Absolutely true, but this Court's\njurisprudence has always examined cases like this from the\nimpact on the property owner, not from what the Government\ngains by the taking. Justice Holmes said that in the\nBoston Chamber of Commerce case a century ago.\nQUESTION: Isn't your argument, and wasn't your\nanswer to Justice Breyer's question in effect to invoke\nthe kind of standard language which has come out of the\nLucas case? In other words, it is preventing all use of\nthe property, or all economically productive use of the\nproperty, and yet Lucas garaged that phrase in the\ncircumstance in which the denial of economic use was\nassumed to be permanent.\nHere, we're dealing with a situation -- Justice\nBreyer's question dealt with a situation in which the\ndeprivation is assumed to be temporary, so that it does\nmake sense in his hypothetical to say, well, it reduces\nthe value of the property during the interim period maybe\nby 10 percent. That is a very different economic fact\nfrom an indefinite, permanent deprivation which would\nreduce the economic value of the property down to\nsomething close to zero, and doesn't that distinction have\nto be recognized, and isn't that the reason why the Lucas\nformula simply cannot be used uncritically in this\ncircumstance?\nMR. BERGER: Justice Souter, I believe that that\ndistinction gets recognized at the valuation phase, not at\nthe liability phase. In other words, taking for a small\nperiod of time, or for less than the full life of the\nproperty, would be compensated less than taking the full\nfee interest.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what you're really saying\nis, if the -- I think, that if in Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical there is a diminution in the value for this\nperiod of 10 percent, that you've got to compensate for\nthe full 10 percent, and it seems to me that our cases are\npretty clear in saying, that's not how you measure the\ncompensation obligation. That's the -- that's an example\nof taking, you know, the one stick out of the bundle and\nsaying because you can't use that one, you've got to\ncompensate 100 percent for that one, but I think our cases\nrule that out, don't they?\nMR. BERGER: Actually, your cases in quite a\nnumber of different circumstances say that if you do take\none important stick out of the bundle, you may well have\ntaken the property --\nQUESTION: Permanently. Permanently.\nMR. BERGER: Well, except in First English, Your\nHonor, where this Court expressly said, and examined all\nthe cases, that temporary takings are constitutionally no\ndifferent than permanent takings.\nQUESTION: Well, except that that gets to the\nargument that the other side makes throughout here, that\nthe assumption of that statement was that we had a taking\nin the first place, whereas the issue in this case is\nwhether we do have a taking.\nMR. BERGER: Well, that's correct, and what\nwe're talking about here is a deprivation of all use.\nThat's why we have a pretty clean case for the Court to\ndeal with here.\nQUESTION: It's a deprivation of all use if you\nfit it into Lucas.\nLucas was a case that did not involve a\npermanent taking, so that it seems to me your first\nargument has got to be not that the Lucas formula can\napply here, but that the Lucas formula should apply here\nas opposed to this Penn Central formula. You've got to do\nthat in order to get into First English.\nMR. BERGER: I agree with that completely, but I\nthink that what we're dealing with, if you examine the\nfacts of the case, is that from the time that these\nordinances were enacted in 1981 until whatever end point\nyou want to look at, there was a total deprivation of use.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Berger, you may well have\nbeen able to prevail under the Penn Central approach, I\nassume, viewed in its entirety over this period of time,\nbut that was waived. Am I correct in that?\nMR. BERGER: We did not present a Penn Central\ncase, that's correct.\nQUESTION: And all you want is this pure and\nsimple per se taking, as applied to, as it comes to us,\nwhat is it, a 3-year period?\nMR. BERGER: Well, there was this 3-year period\nchopped out at the beginning of the time.\nQUESTION: And that's what we're focused on here\nas the case actually comes to us?\nMR. BERGER: That appears to be what the Court\nis interested in, as the Court reframed the question.\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question, Mr.\nBerger? Just looking at temporary takings, and just\nlooking at the liability stage as opposed to the valuation\nstage, is there a distinction in your view between a\nregulatory taking and a physical taking?\nMR. BERGER: I don't believe so, Justice\nStevens. I think that this Court did deal with that in\nthe First English case, and it explained that physical\ntakings and regulatory takings are judged by the same\nconstitutional standards.\nQUESTION: So that in your view -- of course,\nthe physical taking, even for 10 minutes, would be a\ntaking. There's no doubt about that. But your view is,\neven if the regulation prohibits all use of a piece of\nproperty, an automobile, whatever it may be, for 10 or 15\nminutes, there is a taking. The damages may be\ninfinitesimal, but there's always -- past the liability\nstage.\nMR. BERGER: If there is a total prohibition of\nuse --\nQUESTION: For 10 minutes.\nMR. BERGER: -- there is liability. Now --\nQUESTION: So --\nQUESTION: Mr. Berger, can you reconcile the\ndifferent approach that this Court has said goes for\nspatial separation, like the air space in Penn Central,\nand time segregation? It seems to me that if the one --\nif Penn Central is the regime for splitting off the air\nrights, it should also be the regime for splitting off a\ndiscrete period of time.\nMR. BERGER: Your Honor, this Court and other\ncourts have always dealt with the time value of property,\nif I may, differently than they have in these spatial\nterms. The fact is, leasehold interests, future interests\nhave always been recognized as independent items of\nproperty that are independently protected by the\nConstitution.\nIf you had a piece of property that had a\nlandlord and a tenant and a lender and some remainder\nperson --\nQUESTION: But these are all physical takings.\nMR. BERGER: -- with all interests, and it was\ncondemned, all of them would be entitled to compensation.\nQUESTION: But that's --\nQUESTION: These are all physical takings cases.\nMR. BERGER: And this Court has said in First\nEnglish that there is no difference constitutionally,\nJustice Stevens, between the physical takings and the\nregulatory takings.\nQUESTION: Suppose I --\nQUESTION: What do you do about the fact that\nthere is a regulatory taking of sorts whenever you have a\npermit system, let's say the normal zoning regime in which\nyou cannot construct any building on your acreage without\nfirst applying and getting the approval of the zoning\nagency?\nMR. BERGER: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: During that period, there's been a\ntotal taking. You cannot do anything with that property\nuntil you get the building approved.\nMR. BERGER: Clearly you cannot do anything\nuntil you've gotten the property approved, but it seems to\nme that there is a fundamental difference between a\nlandowner working through a system whose end product is,\nat least theoretically and probably very likely, the\nissuance of a permit to go ahead and develop something\nthat is economically productive on that land as opposed to\nbeing stuck in a system where you're forbidden --\nQUESTION: But that would have been during that\ninterval of time it meets your test. Nothing can be done\nuntil the permit issues, so a fortiori, under your theory,\ncompensation due.\nMR. BERGER: I don't believe so, Justice\nO'Connor, because --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what it sounds like.\nNow, what about your basic zoning law? I'm\ngoing to, as a city, limit the use of this property to one\nhouse per acre. You can't have unlimited apartments or\ncommercial property owner. Now, for the enactment of\nthat, is there a taking immediately?\nMR. BERGER: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, you're permanently deprived of\nthe use of it for commercial purposes.\nMR. BERGER: Yes, Your Honor, but you are not\ntotally deprived of the use of it.\nQUESTION: But can we get back to the basic\nquestion that Justice Scalia asked, and Justice O'Connor\nasked it as well. I want your answer. Why is it that a\ndelay for purposes of ordinary zoning, which, let's\nassume, prohibits you from any use of the property, is not\na taking?\nMR. BERGER: Because you are there in a process\nworking toward the actual development of the process, of\nthe property, pardon me, in contrast to being in a\nsituation like these people are, where there is no process\nfor development. There is instead the desire --\nQUESTION: Let's assume that the Tahoe Regional\nPlanning Agency thought, in good faith, that there would\nbe some development allowed, but they needed a year to\nthink about it. My -- that's the same as the World Trade\nCenter hypothetical. We know something very valuable is\ngoing to be built, but you say it's a taking, and I don't\nunderstand the difference between that and the regular\nzoning procedure.\nMR. BERGER: The difference is that in the\nsecond situation there is a conscious and total\nprohibition on use, and that's the purpose of the\nregulation, is to prohibit the use. In the former\nsituation, where you're applying for a permit, the purpose\nof the regulation is not to prohibit use but, in fact, to\nenable use.\nQUESTION: Well then, it seems to me you have to\nchange your answer about the World Trade Center\nhypothetical, where you say there's going to be a very\nvaluable use, we just don't know what it is, but we need a\nyear to think about it, in addition to the normal -- and\nyou told me that was taking, but now your rationale seems\nto me to back away from that.\nMR. BERGER: If they are in a process where\nthere will be development at the end, then I believe that\nthere is not an automatic per se taking, but it seems to\nme that what we're dealing with, if we've got a total use\nprohibition, we do have a taking. It's a question of\ntime.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Berger, your -- it seems to\nme your deciding whether the temporary taking is --\nwhether the temporary interference is a taking or not\ndepends on what's going to happen after the temporary\nperiod expires, because in one situation you think, well,\nthey know they're going to get something valuable out of\nit, in the other they don't, but that means that the test\nfor the temporary period turns entirely on an evaluation\nof the future.\nMR. BERGER: Well, if I made it sound that way,\nJustice Stevens, I apologize. I -- what I'm saying is\nthat you have two different schemes set up. One is a\nprocess leading toward development. The other is a\nprocess of total blockage, and where the intent of the\nGovernment is simply to block the use of property. We're\nnot looking at the future --\nQUESTION: Well, you're not suggesting they're\ndoing it just for the sole purpose of blocking the use.\nDon't they have some ultimate goal in sight here?\nMR. BERGER: Sometimes they may. Sometimes they\ndon't.\nQUESTION: But your -- you rest on the\nhypothesis that they are just interested in a total\nblockage for a temporary period of time, and they don't\ncare what happens later.\nMR. BERGER: But that is the fact that we're\ndealing with. We're dealing with --\nQUESTION: They don't have any interest in\nprotecting the lake?\nMR. BERGER: We have no question about their\nability to protect the lake. The question is how they do\nthat, and what they've decided to do in order to protect\nthe lake is to prohibit these people from making any use\nof their land.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me in effect -- maybe\nthis is a variant on Justice Stevens' question -- that\nyou're saying, what's really wrong here is that this is\nnot done in good faith, that this is not done, let's say,\nin the case of the period of time necessary to get\npermits, with an actual development in mind. This is\ncalled a moratorium, but they mean something more than\njust moratorium, they just mean stop, period, and it\nsounds to me as though you're making it turn on whether\nit's good faith or bad faith.\nMR. BERGER: Oh, I don't think it needs to. I\nthink, in fact, in this case, when they put this\nmoratorium in the context not of -- they don't even call\nit a moratorium. They did this as amendments to their\nWater Quality Act. What they said was, these properties\nneed to be kept frozen in order to protect the clarity of\nLake Tahoe.\nQUESTION: And your argument in effect contrasts\nthat with an existing permit system whereby if you comply\nwith certain requirements you will ultimately end up with\na permit, the purpose of which is to make sure you do\ncomply with the requirements.\nMR. BERGER: Exactly, Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: But you still have -- I mean, in the\none case the regulating agency has said, you can't do\nanything with your land while we're thinking about the\nscheme we're going to adopt, and in the other case the\nagency has said, just as categorically, you can't do\nanything with your land while we consider your\napplication. In both cases they're, for a later\nregulatory purpose they're both saying, you can't do\nanything with your land.\nMR. BERGER: Justice Scalia, in a sense that is\ncertainly true, but in the case of the processing of a\npermit application, we know that there is permitted use.\nIt's there. It's in the books.\nQUESTION: Not during the pendency. Not while\nthe application is pending.\nMR. BERGER: The regulations of the agency say\nthat for this property there is permitted use. The\nquestion is how you make that use, and under what\nconditions and circumstances, not whether there will be\nuse at all, where you have in the second situation a total\nprohibition on use and we don't know what's going to\nhappen at the end of that total prohibition on use.\nThe key to it may be this case itself, where the\nlight at the end of the tunnel that they keep touting as\nthe saving grace of this kind of a regulatory regime\nturned out to be no light at all. There was a complete\ncontinuation of the use prohibition when this temporary\nso-called period ended.\nQUESTION: Well, under your theory it would seem\nthat -- suppose that a building catches fire and is\nsubstantially destroyed by fire, and the fire department\ncomes, and the police department, and they block it off\nfor a period of time, no use while this is investigated,\nnone, property owner can do nothing, can't enter it,\nyou're out of there. I guess the city or the governing\njurisdiction would have to pay the property owner.\nMR. BERGER: I don't think at that point, Your\nHonor, that that would be a taking.\nQUESTION: But it fits squarely within your\nargument.\nMR. BERGER: No, I think that in that case, Your\nHonor, you would at least be entitled to perhaps some\nnuisance examination. You've got a wrecked building that\nis a hazard, and at least the Government would have the\nability to order the property cleaned up before anything\nelse could be done with it, and I think in those\ncircumstances --\nQUESTION: But that seems to make the question\nwhether there's a taking turn on the nature of the motive\nof the -- underlying the regulation or the prohibition,\nand I thought your position was, regardless of the good\nfaith and the great public interest in doing it, the State\nhas to pay when it does this.\nMR. BERGER: Your Honor, I think we all have to\nlive with what this Court called the nuisance exception\nwhen it decided the Lucas case, and that there are some\nthings that the Government can do that prohibit all use\nthat are not compensatory.\nQUESTION: Are you satisfied with the standard\nthat says, every Government regulation is a candidate for\na taking, just as every speech act is a First Amendment\ncandidate, but it's actually a taking in this area only\nwhen the impact of the Government regulation is not part\nof a reasonable process looking towards a reasonable form\nof regulated development?\nMR. BERGER: I think I could accept that,\nJustice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Well, if that's so, they're going to\nsay they win, because they're going to say, of course,\nthis was an effort, reasonably, to regulate Lake Tahoe\nover a period of time. It's very complicated, it didn't\nlast -- it lasted a long time, but no more than necessary.\nMR. BERGER: Oh, I would disagree with that\ncharacterization. This was not an effort to regulate Lake\nTahoe. This was an effort to prevent the use of these\nproperties. Certainly they --\nQUESTION: But that's a reasonableness\ncalculation, and that's the Penn Central aspect rather\nthan the more categorical approach that you're urging upon\nus, I should think.\nMR. BERGER: Your Honor, if they had come up\nwith a nuanced, subtle regulation that had something to it\nother than the meat ax approach that the agency took in\nthis case, I think you would have a Penn Central-type\nanalysis, but what we've got in this case is not anything\nsubtle at all. We've got a complete, easy, quick\nprohibition, and --\nQUESTION: What is the status today? What is\nit, 22 years later?\nMR. BERGER: We're 22 years later.\nQUESTION: What's the status today of the\nproperties affected by this suit?\nMR. BERGER: The clients that I represent are\nstill, for the most part, unable to do anything. There is\nthe new plan put in in 1987, which this Court looked at in\nthe Suitum case, and some of the people, those in the\nposition of Mrs. Suitum, in the stream environment zones,\nare still totally prohibited from using their land. Most\nof the people are still totally prohibited from using\ntheir land.\nA large number of them have sold their land to\nGovernment agencies that were buying them up at bargain\nbasement prices, at nothing approaching what would, an\nappraiser would call fair market value, but the value of\nland that couldn't be developed, in order to mitigate\ntheir losses, and as the court approved in the Del Monte\nDunes case, what they'd like to do is to make themselves\nwhole.\nQUESTION: Well, is it your position that all of\nthe properties involved in this petition are, today, still\ntotally deprived of any use whatever?\nMR. BERGER: I believe, Justice O'Connor, there\nmay be a handful of them that under the 1987 plan, and the\nregulations that came under that in 1989, were finally\nreleased and allowed to do something, but it's only a\nsmall number, and for the most part these properties are\nstill unused and unusable.\nQUESTION: Is it your position that the\napplication of the Penn Central approach would not result\nin appropriate compensation determinations at the end of\nthe day?\nMR. BERGER: I don't know that, Your Honor. As\na pragmatic matter, doing a Penn Central approach on a\ncase that involves hundreds and hundreds of individual\nproperties would have been a nightmarish litigation that\nonly the wealthiest of landowners would be able to afford\nand, particularly in light of the clear prohibition of use\nthat they decided that they needed, we thought that it\nmade more sense to do a Lucas-type approach than a Penn\nCentral approach in this case.\nQUESTION: May I just ask this one question?\nWith regard to those who have subsequently been permitted\nto develop their land, it's your view that you're\nnevertheless entitled to a takings compensation for the\nperiod which the moratorium was in effect?\nMR. BERGER: Yes --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BERGER: -- Justice Stevens, that's true.\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time, Mr.\nChief Justice, if I may.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Berger.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nPetitioners' only takings claim before the court\nof appeals and his only -- their only takings claim before\nthis Court is a facial per se claim. That means that\ntheir contention is that the mere enactment of the\ntemporary moratorium in this case effected a taking with\nrespect to every parcel to which it applied -- that's the\nfacial aspect -- without any consideration of the reasons\nfor the moratorium. That's the per se aspect. And what\nis more, that bold claim is limited at this point to the\ntemporary moratorium in effect from August '81 until April\n1984.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, you described it as a\nbold claim. Supposing it had gone on for 10 years.\nMR. ROBERTS: In 10 --\nQUESTION: Would it be still bold?\nMR. ROBERTS: On the facial aspect I think so,\nYour Honor. I think doing the Penn Central analysis and\nnot the Lucas analysis, so long as it's not a permanent\ndeprivation abuse.\nNow, certainly a 10-year claim would have a much\nharder row to hoe against a takings challenge, but I would\nlike to know the impact on the property's value, why the\n10 years was necessary, if it was, the sorts of things\nthat are factored under Penn Central.\nQUESTION: Well, you could do a Penn Central --\nyou could have done Penn Central in Lucas. I mean, Penn\nCentral is wonderful. We could apply it to everything,\nbut as Mr. Berger pointed out, that's a terribly\ncomplicated analysis, enormously expensive for property\nowners to have to go through, which is why you have cases\nlike Lucas.\nMR. ROBERTS: This Court said Lucas applied only\nin the rare circumstance, a total ban on economic\nreproductive use.\nQUESTION: Suppose I take a 3-year leasehold,\nright. The Government comes in and says, we're taking\nthis property for 3 years, not a permanent taking, just a\n3-year taking.\nMR. ROBERTS: That --\nQUESTION: We do a Penn Central analysis of\nthat?\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, no. If the Government\ncondemns a leasehold, that's a taking, and compensation is\ndue.\nQUESTION: All right, suppose in this case that\none of these barred owners leased the property to someone\nwho's going to put a mobile home on it for a year, the\nmoratorium comes in effect, assume the mobile home can't\nbe -- is that a taking of the leasehold, of the\nlessee's --\nMR. ROBERTS: No.\nQUESTION: -- interest?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. You don't sever up the\nproperty interest and -- so that it corresponds to the\nextent of the regulation and then say --\nQUESTION: You're taking from the lessee.\nThat's all he's got.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the right at issue here is\nthe right to build residences, to develop the property.\nQUESTION: No. My hypothetical is that it\napplies to a mobile home and the guy who leases for -- the\nlot for a year, and then TRPA says you can't put the\nmobile home on there for a year. They take this entire\nleasehold. Compensable?\nMR. ROBERTS: It would first of all be under the\nPenn Central analysis, and the economic impact --\nQUESTION: Why, if it's a total taking?\nQUESTION: General Motors certainly didn't do\nPenn Central.\nMR. ROBERTS: No, but the other -- the\ndistinction is the one this Court talked about in Loretto,\nbetween -- you mentioned the World War II condemnation\ncases. The Pee Wee Coal case, the Government came in and\noccupied the coal mine to prevent a strike. That was a\ntaking. In Central Eureka they said, you cannot use the\ngold mine, and this Court said, that's different, that's\nnot a taking.\nThat's the type of distinction that we're\ntalking about here between physical appropriation or,\nextended to Lucas, a ban on total economic use, and the\ntemporary regulation that's at issue here. Because the\nregulation is temporary, the land retains economic value.\nQUESTION: I'm still not sure of your answer.\nYour answer is that in my hypothetical about the 1-year\nlease that's taken from the lessee, it has to be a Penn\nCentral analysis because?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because you're starting out with a\nproperty -- presumably the regulation applies to the\nproperty generally, and it just so happens that this one\nparcel has been severed out into a leasehold, and in doing\nthat, that is a question that has to be addressed before\nyou get to the analysis, should you sever out the affected\nproperty interest to a leasehold.\nQUESTION: But you could have made that same\nargument in General Motors, and I think the Government\ndid, that you shouldn't just treat it as a leasehold,\nyou've got to value the whole property. The court says\nno, there was a leasehold in effect, that's what the\nGovernment took, that's what the Government has to pay\nfor.\nMR. ROBERTS: But if -- if this Court is -- in\nits past takings cases, when it's been presented with a\nregulation that applies to a discrete property interest,\nit hasn't said, well, let's redefine the effective\nproperty interests to that. It didn't do it in Penn\nCentral, it didn't do it in Keystone Bituminous, and it\ndidn't do it in the construction laborers case.\nThe way the property was held by the petitioners\nin this case is fee simple. This regulation applied to\nfee simple property. It did not affect the value anywhere\nnear the extent that the regulation in Lucas did.\nQUESTION: No, but just to make it clear, in my\nhypothetical -- I know it didn't happen, but in my\nhypothetical, no recovery because?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, I'm not sure it's no recovery,\nbut I am sure that it's still evaluated under Penn\nCentral, because --\nQUESTION: But Mr. Roberts, if you evaluate it\nunder Penn Central, would it be legitimate to evaluate it\nthis way. I've assumed it would be, but maybe I'm wrong.\nAssume that the leasehold is not physically taken, so that\nthe Government doesn't substitute itself for the trailer\nowner and use the property. It's strictly a prohibition\nof use. I assumed that under Penn Central the lessee\nwould have his claim against the lessor because the lessor\nwas not delivering. The lessor would not have a claim for\na permanent deprivation here because there, with respect\nto the lessor there would only be the temporary taking.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: So that the lessee would probably\ncome out okay against a different party. The lessor would\nbe in the same position that the lessor would be in if\nthere had never been a lease. Is that the way it would\nwork?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, presumably the impact of\nregulation would be something that would be addressed in\nthe lease agreement itself.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: I mean, if they were leasing it to\nbuild a mobile home and it turns out they can't, who bears\nthe responsibility for that, again a matter between the\nlessor and the lessee.\nThe important point is that the, what the\npetitioners are arguing for is an extension of the Lucas\nrule which applied in a, as the Court said, the rare\ncircumstance in which all economic use is prohibited, and\nthe Court emphasized in Lucas that that had the\nconsequence of rendering the property valueless. This is\nhow the Court phrased the question presented in Lucas,\nwhether the act's dramatic effect on the economic value of\nLucas' lot accomplished a taking.\nWell, here, there is no dramatic effect on the\neconomic value of the affected lots, because we're talking\nabout temporary regulation for a limited time.\nQUESTION: Well, but does --\nQUESTION: Well, in light of what's happened, we\nknow it's been 22 years, and presumably many of these\nproperties will never be allowed to be developed. Is\nthere no end in sight? Can we not look at that as a\ntaking?\nMR. ROBERTS: First, Your Honor, my\nunderstanding of the record is quite different from my\nbrother's. If you look at the pretrial order, Exhibit A,\npretrial order filed July 17, 1998, it describes the\nsituations with respect to each of the properties. Most\nof them have been sold long ago. Of those that are not\nsold, two-thirds have a score that makes them buildable\nunder the '87 plan, so two-thirds of the petitioners who\nstill own property can build on those lots according to\nthe record in this case, and that is just petitioners'\nallegations.\nQUESTION: When you say sold, do you mean at the\nbargain price that Mr. Berger referred to, sold to --\nMR. ROBERTS: Sold typically to the Government\nbuy-out agencies, I wouldn't say at a bargain price.\nQUESTION: Sold to the Government agencies who\nwill do with it just exactly what is achieved by the\nGovernment's not taking position of it, that is, nothing.\nI find this distinction between whether the Government\ntakes possession of the land versus whether the Government\ndoesn't take possession of the land quite unrealistic --\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- where you're talking about a\nGovernment that wants to assure that the land lies fallow.\nThe Government achieves entirely what it wants by simply\nsaying, nobody shall do anything with the land. That --\nwhy should the Government condemn the land? It doesn't\nhave to.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's not, of course, what we're\ntalking about here. What we're talking about here is a\ntime-out for a limited period while the agency carries out\nits responsibility to determine what can be done with the\nland.\nQUESTION: All right, so how does he prove that?\nWhat about the one-third who could never build?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: What happens to them? What is your\nview of the correct thing he should have done? Is a\nperson who never is allowed to build, and never can use\nthe property at all, simply out of luck, if what they say\nis we're having a 10-year, a 30-year procedure of 3-year\nmoratoriums, 10 at a time or something like that? How is\nit supposed to work, in your opinion?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the first thing I'd say is,\nyou bring an as-applied claim and not a facial claim. The\nfacial claim is the mere enactment of this temporary\nmoratorium effective taking. Well then, don't talk to me\nabout what happened 15 years later, if the mere enactment\nof the temporary moratorium is your complaint. That's a\ndifferent case, and he brought that case, and it was\nthrown out because it was too late.\nThere were challenges brought to the '84 plan,\nthere were challenges brought to the '87 plan. Those\nchallenges failed, and now the effort is to link those\nchallenges up to what's left, the little tail on the dog\nof this temporary moratorium that started the process.\nQUESTION: How does an as-applied challenge go?\nWhat if you make an as-applied challenge. What would you\nhave to prove? Would you have to prove that any\nintelligent agency could make up its mind and, you know,\neither fish or cut bait within a year? Suppose --\nMR. ROBERTS: If the as-applied challenge is to\nthe temporary moratorium?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, you go through the Penn\nCentral factors, and if it's taking too long, that's\ncertainly something pertinent on the character of the\nGovernment action. That's what other courts have looked\nto.\nQUESTION: No, no, but it goes beyond Penn\nCentral if you're no -- if it is no longer an honest\nmoratorium to decide what you're going to do with the\nland, then you're out of Penn Central. Then it's just a\ntaking. You're kidding us. You only need a year to\ndecide what you want to do. You've imposed a moratorium\nfor 5 years. Why should I have to go through Penn\nCentral? Four of those years is just prohibiting me from\nusing my land with no other governmental purpose in mind\nexcept the prohibition.\nMR. ROBERTS: And that's one of those things\nthat they would have to show. Here, of course, the\ndistrict court found that the planning effort was\nundertaken as speedily as possible.\nQUESTION: But you acknowledge that if, in an\nas-applied challenge, there's a showing that the agency\ndoes not need 3 years or 5 years or whatever, that the\nthing could reasonably have been done in 1 year,\neverything beyond the 1 year is then a taking?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. You have to go through the\nother factors. This is not a per se analysis.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. ROBERTS: The other factors include the\nimpact on the property. You're claiming a taking. What\nwas the effect on your property?\nQUESTION: Well, what if -- let's take a\nhypothesis where the moratorium is 10 years. Now, you\nstill go through this thing that you're talking about? It\ncannot be long enough ever to be a per se taking?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, even the court of appeals\nrecognized that the moratorium is long enough so that the\npresent value of the uses that might be allowed is de\nminimis, then perhaps the categorical rule would apply,\nand 10 years seems like it's going to be too long for the\nGovernment to figure out and carry out its\nresponsibilities and planning, but I wouldn't say that we\ntry to find a point in time at which suddenly we shift\nfrom the accepted Penn Central analysis to the Lucas per\nse analysis.\nQUESTION: Well, but yet you agree that shift\nhas to take place somewhere along the continuum of time.\nMR. ROBERTS: I guess what I'm saying is at some\npoint calling something a temporary moratorium is a misuse\nof the label. If it's 30 years, that's too long.\nNow, the best that Justice Holmes could do was\nsay that when it goes too far it becomes a taking, and I\nmay not be able to do much better, but the Penn Central\nfactors allow consideration of things like, what is the\nneed for it? The need may not be sufficiently compelling\nto justify a moratorium of 2 years, or the need may be\nsufficiently compelling to justify a longer moratorium.\nWhat was the impact on your -- the property?\nKeep in mind, the petitioners submitted no\nevidence of impact on value. We have no idea from the\nrecord what the impact of the temporary moratorium was,\nother than the evidence that we submitted which shows that\nproperties were sold for significant amounts of value\nduring the period of the temporary moratorium, which makes\nsense.\nA temporary ban on development doesn't render\nproperty valueless. If you have two parcels of property,\none subject to a permanent ban on use, and the other\nsubject to a temporary ban, it is true, as some of the\namici say, the permanent ban could be made temporary and\nthe temporary ban could be made permanent, but you're not\ngoing to pay the same price for both of those parcels of\nproperty. The one that's subject to the temporary ban is\ngoing to have a higher market value, reflecting the fact\nthat future uses are available, or will be available or\nnot, depending on the plan that's ultimately adopted.\nQUESTION: I suppose that depends on how much\nany prospective buyer would believe that the temporary ban\nis really temporary, or how much they believe that it's\ngoing to be strung out and extended, and if worst comes to\nworse, and the Government can't pick it up at bargain\nprices it will pay compensation to get rid of the land.\nI --\nMR. ROBERTS: And that's like the petitioners'\neffort to link their lost challenges to the permanent land\nuse plan to their challenge to the temporary moratorium.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nMR. ROBERTS: The district court --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Had you finished your\nanswer?\nMR. ROBERTS: I was just going to say that the\ndistrict court in this case specifically found that the\nagency acted in good faith throughout, so the idea that\nthe temporary moratorium to allow planning to take place\nwas some kind of a sham for a permanent --\nQUESTION: Well, but it also found there was a\ntotal deprivation of use for X amount of time.\nMR. ROBERTS: Only looked at from that period.\nOnly looked at for the 32-month period, and our submission\nis that that's the improper way to carve up the property\ninterest and say, oh, it's a total taking, because we're\ngoing to only look at the property that was taken.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, in answer to one of\nJustice O'Connor's questions about a hypothetical fire\ndamage case Mr. Berger referred to the nuisance exception\nas possibly taking the case out of the whole takings area.\nAt what point in what procedure would the possible\navailability of the nuisance defense arise or be\nconsidered with respect to polluting Lake Tahoe?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we raised the claim before\nthe court of appeals that one reason there was no taking,\neven if Lucas applied, was because of the nuisance, et\ncetera. The Court didn't find it necessary to reach that\nissue.\nQUESTION: I see.\nQUESTION: And so the district court said there\nwasn't -- that a nuisance hadn't been made out. The\ndistrict court said that, didn't it?\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right, and we appealed\nthat, and the court of appeals didn't find --\nQUESTION: And what was your argument to the\ncourt of appeals, that this was a nuisance exception?\nMR. ROBERTS: That given the impact on the lake\nof development, that it fell within the California and\nNevada nuisance requirements.\nQUESTION: That it all should be a park.\nMR. ROBERTS: Not that it should all be a park,\nbut that further development would threaten the serious\nand, in fact, irreparable harm to the lake. That's the\nbasis for the Government action in this case that the\npetitioners have never challenged.\nBut I want to emphasize in concluding that it's\nimportant to remember that the issue is not whether a\ntotal ban on use for this period effects a taking. The\nissue is whether a temporary moratorium from August of '81\nto April of '84 for the purpose of carrying out the\nresponsibility of undertaking planning with respect to\nthese lots is on its face with respect to every lot that\nit applied to a per se taking without regard to the\nreason.\nQUESTION: Phrased that way, it's quite clearly\nin your favor, but I think they're seeing this as a group\nof landowners thinking from the beginning, whatever the\njustification for this, and the justification is\nexcellent, saving Lake Tahoe, it's going to end up that we\nwon't be able to use our land for anything, and we've been\nable to tell you that from day one, so we brought a case\nright off the bat that we knew that was going to happen,\nand then year after year went by when people told us,\nmaybe you'll be able to build, maybe you won't, which\nreally wasn't so, we knew we wouldn't, and then it ended\nup that we couldn't, all right.\nNow, what are we supposed to say to them?\nAren't they supposed to have some remedy at law? And\nthat's I think why he wanted to hear all his questions,\nnot just one, and there is that lurking in this case, and\nI'm not totally sure how to deal with it.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, first of all they waited\nuntil the '84 plan took effect to file their lawsuit.\nThat suggests to me the gripe was with the permanent ban,\nnot so much the temporary moratorium.\nSecond of all, the supposition in your question\nmakes this not a facial challenge. In other words, it's\nnot the mere enactment. It's because we know what's\nreally going on here. That's an as-applied challenge,\nthat's not a facial challenge, so the landowners in your\ncase said, as, in fact, some have, bring an as-applied\nchallenge saying, as applied to me this is a taking.\nQUESTION: So do you agree that a temporary\nmoratorium that ripens into a permanent ban is a taking?\nI mean, you know, let's assume that I sold the\nproperty during the temporary moratorium which later\nripens into a total ban, and I claim that I should have\nbeen compensated for those 3 years that I owned the\nproperty without any ability to do -- does that constitute\na taking?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think the period in which the\nagency's justification is, we need a time-out to undertake\nplanning so that we're not locking the barn door after the\nhorse escapes, should be evaluated separately from the\nperiod in which the agency says, this is the land use\nplan, and if you've got a gripe with us you can challenge\nthat. Those are two separate periods. The character of\nthe Government action is different in those two periods.\nQUESTION: Okay, let's assume that they are\nanalyzed separately, and it is found that for the period\nJustice Scalia is talking about the Government really was\nnot acting in good faith. Its plan, its intent right from\nthat moment on, from the first day on, was to ban all\ndevelopment whatsoever. In that case, does he have a\nclaim for a complete taking during the 3-year period?\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, certainly, yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. I don't think it's a facial\nclaim, because it depends on more than looking\nspecifically at the face of the ordinance.\nQUESTION: So it's a question basically of good\nfaith and intent --\nMR. ROBERTS: And here the --\nQUESTION: -- and understanding what they're\ndoing.\nMR. ROBERTS: The district court at petition\nappendix at page 69 said the agency acted in complete good\nfaith, and completed its responsibilities as quickly as\ncould be expected.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If the court of appeals opinion is\njust simply affirmed just as is, weren't we wasting our\ntime in First English?\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, no. First English didn't\naddress the question of when a temporary regulation can\nbecome a taking. It said that if you have a temporary\ntaking, and it assumed arguendo that there was a taking\nfor a temporary period, compensation is required, and we\ndon't dispute that at all.\nQUESTION: Yes, but as -- assume the court of\nappeals opinion is the law. First English wasn't a\ntaking. That's your whole point.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that's what the California\nState courts determined on remand when they were addressed\nwith the question.\nQUESTION: No, no, just talk about Federal law.\nYou're saying that First English could not have been a\ntaking, so we were just waiting our time up here.\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, not at all. First\nEnglish could have been a taking. It would have required\nan evaluation under, again, Penn Central, not Lucas, to\ndetermine whether the regulation at issue there, both the\ntemporary and permanent, and both were at issue at\ndifferent points in First English, constituted a taking.\nBut once you assume that that was a taking, and\nyou assume the results of that analysis, then it is a\ntaking. Compensation is required.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: General Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe colloquy so far today seems to me to\nillustrate the wisdom of Justice O'Connor's comment in her\nconcurring opinion in the Palazzolo case last June that\nthe Court should avoid per se rules in the area of\nregulatory taking.\nPetitioners knew per se rule of takings\njurisprudence, taken to its logical end, would make every\nfreeze in the status quo, however brief, during a\npermitting, planning, or rezoning process equivalent to a\ncondemnation, to use their words --\nQUESTION: I don't understand it that way,\nGeneral Olson. I thought Mr. Berger separated out, or at\nleast certainly tried to separate out the normal zoning\nprocess where you're working towards a permit and a permit\nis realistically possible at the end of the road.\nGENERAL OLSON: It seems to me that's a very\ndifficult distinction for him to make, because it requires\nan analysis of the nature of the Government's interest in\neach particular permitting process. We know that they can\nbe short, we know that they can be long, we know that they\ncan be comprehensive.\nQUESTION: I don't think that's necessarily\ntrue. I think you can segregate, at least to my\nsatisfaction, the idea of a zoning requirement in\nexistence -- you have to file for a permit -- and\nbasically to show that you comply with the zoning\nrequirements. In other words, if you're going to have\nzoning at all, a permit process is almost necessary as\nopposed to a moratorium which doesn't say, you know, look,\nwe're going to look over your application and decide\nwhether you can build. It simply says no, you can't\nbuild.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, what we would submit is\nthat that zoning permitting process is part of the\nbackground principles of land use, land regulation, just\nas temporary moratoria have always been, that when there's\nrezoning process, a process referred to by this court in\nthe First English case, that process may have to come to a\nhalt.\nThe purpose for the temporary moratoria here was\nto allow the agency to develop a sensible plan and, as Mr.\nRoberts has already noted by reference to the record,\nthere's no indication that it was not in good faith. The\nlength of the period, 32 months, was held by the district\ncourt to be a reasonable time to accomplish the\nobjectives. The purpose of the plan, as acknowledged by\nthe petitioners themselves, is that the purpose for the\nplan was to prevent the degradation of the lake and they\nindicated that a slowdown -- in their brief, they\nmentioned in their brief that a slowdown in building\npermits was an appropriate governmental response to that\nmeasure.\nNow, in each instance the question is going to\nbe, how long did it take, was it in good faith, what was\nthe Government up to? Here, the Government was attempting\nto preserve the value that Mr. Berger's clients wanted.\nThey themselves purchased their property and planned to\nbuild a home on it because of the pristine quality of the\nlake. They make the argument in their brief that it was\nbeing degraded, that something had to be done about it. A\nlimit on development they say -- I think it's on page 3 of\ntheir brief -- was the logical objective to solve,\napproach to solve that particular problem.\nSo what Lake Tahoe, the regional board that\nwe're dealing with here today, was doing was saying, wait\na minute, before we destroy the lake let's stop, let's\nhave a process in which we evaluate how to solve the\nproblem that every landowner around the lake, including\nthe petitioners, want to have solved.\nQUESTION: Well, that's extraordinary. You\nrefer to it, General Olson, as just a traditional\nmoratorium. I don't think this is a traditional\nmoratorium at all. I think it's quite extraordinary to\njust say, you know, a time out, nobody does anything with\nthis land. I just don't think that that's the normal kind\nof moratorium. Nobody does anything beyond the limited\nuse that we anticipate we will ultimately impose. It's\nvery rare that you impose a complete prohibition of use,\nbecause that's a condemnation.\nGENERAL OLSON: It may be unusual, but it is not\nso rare. In fact, page 5 of the petitioners' brief refers\nto the two --\nQUESTION: Two cases, as I recall, that\ninvolve -- total, right, yes.\nGENERAL OLSON: Two instances, and the first one\nthat they refer to is to aid the preparation of a\ncomprehensive plan by precluding developers from obtaining\npermits that conflict with the plan being drafted. That\nis precisely almost the same words that were used by the\nlegislator in connection with the compact that suggested\nthat there ought to be a moratorium. This is the compact\nitself in the 1980 amendments. It specifically said that\nit was necessary temporarily to halt works of development\nin the region which might otherwise absorb the entire\ncapability of the region for further development or direct\nit out of harmony with the ultimate plan.\nNow, if there is some challenge to the good\nfaith of what was going on here, that is not this case.\nIf there's some challenge to what happened afterwards -- I\nthink the questions Justice Stevens asked point out that,\nwell, if there was something that was done improperly to\ntake these people's property with respect to what happened\nafterwards, or how far it went, or how it affected a\nparticular property owner, that is the Penn Central test.\nNow, for tactical reasons, the property owners\nin this case decided not to pursue a Penn Central case.\nWe heard here today that because it would be too expensive\nand too complicated for any individual property owner to\nbring that case. Well, that is going to be the case every\ntime anybody challenges Government action as a taking of a\npiece of property.\nThese property owners decided to pool their\ninterest and decide not to show what the Government's\ninterest was, the degree of invasion in individual\nproperty rights, how much it hurt, whether or not it was\nin good faith and so forth, so they eschewed tactically\nall of those considerations.\nNow, instead --\nQUESTION: With some reason, because they\ncouldn't use their property at all -- at all.\nGENERAL OLSON: They couldn't use their property\nat all as far as this case was concerned, and the question\npresented in this case, for a limited period of time while\na Government agency was acting to address the problem that\nthey acknowledge, because they acknowledge that continued\ndevelopment along the lines that was occurring at the time\nthis moratorium was adopted was degrading the lake and\ndestroying their property.\nQUESTION: That's fine, and that's a general\nsocial problem for which the entire society should pay.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: If, indeed, you do need that time to\nfigure out what to do with the lake, why should some\nindividuals bear the burden of that necessary pause to\nconsider what to do?\nGENERAL OLSON: I submit it's the teaching of\nthis Court that not every delay, not every intrusion on\nthe use of property, not every incursion on property\nrights constitutes a taking under the Fifth Amendment.\nQUESTION: I understand that, but these aren't\nthe only people who are using Lake Tahoe. They're\npreserving Lake Tahoe for all of the citizens of that\nState and for citizens of other States, for that matter.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, Justice --\nQUESTION: And yet they're saying, since we need\ntime to think about this, we are preventing total, total,\nall the use of your land for 3 years.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: I don't see that it seems to me fair\nthat these people should bear the whole brunt of the\nmoratorium.\nGENERAL OLSON: They haven't established that\nthey have bore the whole brunt. They haven't established\nthe degree to which their individual property rights were\nviolated, or the extent of their intrusion. They haven't\ndone all of the things that this Court --\nQUESTION: They've certainly established a\ncommon situation. That is, every one of them, presumably,\nwas prevented from using the property for 3 years.\nGENERAL OLSON: Because the use of that\nproperty, as they acknowledge, would have destroyed the\nvery property rights that they're here seeking to\nvindicate, and what we're saying is that in many different\nsituations the Government might have lots of reasons,\nlocal governments, State governments, Federal Governments,\nto cause a pause in the development.\nNow, what --\nQUESTION: I agree with that, and that's what\nworries me.\nGENERAL OLSON: That's right, and --\nQUESTION: That's exactly what worries me.\nGENERAL OLSON: And that's why this Court in the\nPenn Central case gave an opportunity to use a reasoned\ndecisionmaking to solve the problem, to find out how far\nis too far. To ask that very question that Justice Holmes\ndid is to entertain the answer. We need to know how -- in\norder to determine how far is too far, this Court has said\nrepeatedly we need to look at the circumstances.\nWhat -- the rule that petitioners are proposing\ninterdicts that judicial fact-finding, reasoned\ndecisionmaking process. What it also does is cause the\npermitting agency, the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Board,\nto try to do this on a permit-by-permit, quasi-\nadjudicative process, as opposed to what they did do, as\ninstructed by Congress, a legislative process in which\nthings would stop, reasoned decisionmaking would take\nplace --\nQUESTION: Well, no one is challenging their\nauthority in the sense of acting for the Government, but\nthe fact that they were instructed to do it by Congress\ndoesn't make it any more or any less of a taking.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I understand that,\nMr. Chief Justice, but what I'm saying is that the\nGovernment agencies that looked at this problem decided\nthat it had to be solved in a global way. This was\nGovernment acting in a way we want it to act, in a\nlegislative process with transparency to look at the whole\nproblem and, if there had been a taking because it was too\nlong, or too much of an intrusion, there is a remedy under\nthe Fifth Amendment and it's described, how you get to\nthat remedy is described in this Court's jurisprudence in\nthe Penn Central case. The petitioners here sought not to\npursue that remedy.\nQUESTION: May I ask, do you understand your\nopponent to be arguing that a curfew would be a taking?\nGENERAL OLSON: A taking -- well, a curfew --\nQUESTION: I remember in Honolulu during the war\nyou couldn't go out after certain hours of the night, and\nso the property was totally useless when the curfew --\nwould that be a taking under --\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I think that they're\narguing that any momentary suspension of the use of\nproperty would be a taking.\nQUESTION: So it would be.\nQUESTION: Thirteenth Amendment.\nMr. Berger, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL M. BERGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BERGER: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me\ntouch briefly on a couple of things, if I might.\nFirst, General Olson talked about this Court's\ncases that generally have built on the question of, we\ncan't tell how far the regulation goes until we know how\nfar they went. Well, that's true, and in this case we\nknow precisely how far they went. They totally prohibited\nthe use of all of the property owners who are here in\nfront of this Court, and it's that question that we're\nhere to answer. When we know how far they went, we don't\nneed to get into any detailed, factual investigation of\nother circumstances.\nJustice Kennedy asked about the First English\ncase, and whether the Court wasted its time there if the\nNinth Circuit's opinion in this case is simply affirmed,\nand I would have to conclude that that is indeed what\nhappened. The clear message of merely affirming what the\nNinth Circuit did in this case would be to tell all the\nlower courts that they need to pay no attention to First\nEnglish, because this Court laid out a lot of clear\nmessages in the First English decision that the Ninth\nCircuit paid no attention to, and --\nQUESTION: But it also said we merely hold --\nthis is from First English, stating the holding. We\nmerely hold that where the Government's activities have\nalready worked a taking of all use of property, no\nsubsequent action by the Government can relieve it of the\nduty to provide compensation for the period during which\nthe taking was effective.\nMR. BERGER: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, that\nis true, and -- but what the Court said in First English\nwas that we're limiting, you were limiting the case to\nwhat you called the facts presented in that case, and the\nfacts presented in that case were a temporary moratorium\nfor about the same length of time as the one that we're\ndealing with here, which froze all use of that property\nand, in fact, in my belief had a better justification for\nit, because it had a health and safety justification,\nwhich this one doesn't.\nAs you, justice Ginsburg, pointed out, the trial\ncourt examined at great length the question of whether\nthese people were creating a nuisance and concluded that\nthere was no nuisance created here. As much as he was\nconcerned about the fact that continued development around\nLake Tahoe might change the color of the lake, there was\nno health problem with changing the color of the lake.\nThere was no safety problem with changing the color of the\nlake. We would all be the poorer, I think --\nQUESTION: But that question was not resolved on\nappeal.\nMR. BERGER: That's correct, the court of\nappeals did not deal with that question, only the district\ncourt did, and its analysis is there for you to look at.\nThe 1980 compact amendments that the two\nlegislatures and Congress went through are interesting in\nthis case, because while they, in fact, said there was a\nneed for a moratorium, but the moratorium that the\nlegislators and Congress agreed to was not the one that\nTRPA enacted here. They said, what we need is a cap on\nthe number of building permits that are issued, and that's\nin the record here, too, and they said we're going to\nlimit the number of building permits that each city and\ncounty can issue to the number that they issued in 1978.\nThe first thing that TRPA did after that was\nenacted was to say, we need to rearrange that, and we're\ngoing to say, you can issue those permits, but you can't\nissue any of them to these people. These people are\ntotally frozen out, and they're being frozen out as part\nof a major public project so that we can clarify the\nwaters in Lake Tahoe, and it just seems to us that where\nyou have these people who are being asked to make this\nsacrifice on behalf of the greater public good, either of\nthe people who already own homes around Lake Tahoe, and\nwhose lands therefore gets more valuable, or on behalf of\nthe rest of us who don't own homes up there but who might\nlike to vacation there so that we can also enjoy the\nbeauties of Lake Tahoe, that those people shouldn't be\nleft flapping in the breeze with no compensation for the\nfact that they're the ones that have been asked to pay for\nthis project.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Berger.\n"
