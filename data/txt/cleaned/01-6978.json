DENVIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court: In March 2000, Gary Ewing walked into a Los\nAngeles pro shop, took three golf clubs, stuck them down the\npants legs, and walked out. He was quickly apprehended for\nthat crime. For that crime --\nQUESTION: What was the value of the golf clubs?\nMR. DENVIR: Because the value of the golf clubs was\napproximately $1200, it was grand theft under California law.\nFor grand theft, as a general matter, California\nprovides a maximum sentence of three years. It also --\nbecause Mr. Ewing had served a prior prison sentence, he would\nbe subject to a recidivism enhancement of one year, so the\nmaximum sentence that he would have faced under California\nlaw, but for the so-called \"three-strikes law,\" would have\nbeen four years in prison, which could have been reduced by\none-half by his conduct in prison and his work in prison.\nHowever, because Mr. Ewing had a prior conviction for first-\ndegree burglary, which has been classified as a serious felony\nby California, and for robbery, which has been classified as a\nviolent felony by California --\nQUESTION: Was it armed robbery?\nMR. DENVIR: He was armed with a knife at that time.\nAnd because of those two convictions, he came under\nthe California \"three strikes and you're out\" law. And as a\nresult of that, he received a sentence of life imprisonment\nand with a -- with an added bar that he could not even be\nconsidered for parole for 25 years.\nQUESTION: Would it be fair to add that another\nreason for the sentence was that the judge did not disregard\nthe priors, and that was because the judge had the record in\nfront of him and the record showed other --a history of other\noffenses? Would that be a fair statement?\nMR. DENVIR: It is correct, Your Honor. It -- the\njudge did have discretion to strike the priors or to reduce\nthis wobbler offense to a misdemeanor. She declined to do so,\npartly on the basis of his prior record. His prior record\nwere all misdemeanor convictions prior to that time. But --\nQUESTION: They were all misdemeanors?\nMR. DENVIR: Yes, Your Honor. All his -- he had --\nthe prior convictions that he had were felonies were four\nfelonies, all occurred within one year, in 19- -- in one\nmonth, in 1993. There were three first-degree burglary\nconvictions, and then there was one robbery conviction. He\nhad other --\nQUESTION: Well, now, those surely are not\nmisdemeanors.\nMR. DENVIR: No, Your Honor. I was -- I thought\nJustice Kennedy's question was directed not to the -- what\nthey call the \"strike priors,\" but to the fact that he did\nhave other --\nQUESTION: Oh, other than --\nMR. DENVIR: -- previous crimes that were\nmisdemeanors.\nQUESTION: -- other than the burglaries.\nMR. DENVIR: I think that's -- the sentencing judge\nrelied on that, to some degree, in denying him any\ndiscretionary --\nQUESTION: Now --\nMR. DENVIR: -- relief.\nQUESTION: -- it actually went back to 1984, didn't\nit, with grand theft in '84, grand theft in '88?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, the grand theft actually\nwas a misdemeanor, as we've shown in the appendix to our reply\nbrief. There was -- there was a misconception that that was a\nfelony. And in fact, it was a misdemeanor in Ohio, the\nfirst --\nQUESTION: That was the Ohio offense.\nMR. DENVIR: I --\nQUESTION: The --\nMR. DENVIR: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- the one that was alleged to be a\nfelony, I think, in the government's brief --\nMR. DENVIR: Is in --\nQUESTION: -- I think that it was only a\nmisdemeanor.\nMR. DENVIR: In fact, we've attached the governing\ncourt records as an appendix to our reply brief that shows it\nwas a misdemeanor.\nQUESTION: How many -- how many convictions in all,\nfelonies plus misdemeanors?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I believe that he had the\nfour -- the four prior convictions -- the strike convictions,\nthe felonies, and I think he had another nine misdemeanors,\nand then this present offense. I think that's the --\nQUESTION: And the purpose of the three-strikes law,\nas I understand it, is to take off of the streets that very\nsmall proportion of people who commit an enormously high\nproportion of crimes. I forget what the statistics are, but\nit's something like, you know, of those convicted, 20 percent\ncommit 85 percent of the crimes. It sounds to me like your\nclient is a very good candidate for that law.\nMR. DENVIR: We got -- we got --\nQUESTION: I mean, if that's a reasonable law. It\nseems to me this is precisely the kind of person you want to\nget off the streets. He's obviously going to do it again.\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, we believe that the law, in\nitself, is not unreasonable and it could result in a\nproportionate sentence. It did not in this case.\nUnder this Court's decision in Solem versus Helm,\nthe Court has said that you can look to the prior record as\nrelevant to the sentencing decision because it aggravates the\npresent crime, but the focus must remain on the present crime.\nQUESTION: Well, Solem stands with Rummel and with\nHarmelin. They're really three different points, and Solem is\nprobably the case that favors you most. But certainly Rummel\nis good law, and Harmelin is good law. And I think those\ncases don't favor you.\nMR. DENVIR:\nRummel -- the Court said in Solem -- the majority opinion said\nthat Rummel would be controlling only in a similar factual\nsituation. We do not believe we have that here. And as far\nas Harmelin was concerned, the basic principles of Solem were\nreaffirmed by seven justices in Harmelin and, we believe, when\napplied here, will show that this is a grossly\ndisproportionate sentence.\nQUESTION: Mr. Denvir, would you clarify whether\nyour challenge is strictly as applied? Because some of the --\nsome of the points that you make seem to be going to the\nstatute wholesale. So, for example, you talk about it -- the\nstatute's infirm, because it has no washout for aging\noffenses, but there was no such offense at stake here. The\nstrikes were all rather recent.\nMR. DENVIR: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: So --\nMR. DENVIR: -- and to answer your question, we are\nchallenging only the sentence that Mr. Ewing received for the\ncrime that he committed, that he was sentenced at. There's\nmuch discussion on both sides of -- as -- I -- as the\nbackground of the three-strikes law. We have no doubt the\nthree-strikes law could result in a -- in a constitutional\nsentence. It did not, in this case. So however the scheme is\nthat reached this sentence, this life sentence for stealing\nthree golf clubs, that sentence is -- falls under the Eighth\nAmendment, in our view.\nQUESTION: But we -- so we should leave out things\nlike no washout, that someone who never served any time would\nsubject to the three strikes --\nMR. DENVIR: I think that's correct, Your Honor,\nthat they don't play into this case. And I think that -- as I\nsaid, that the three-strikes law is merely -- it's the process\nthat produced an unconstitutional sentence. It could have\nbeen produced by a different sentencing scheme, also.\nQUESTION: Well, when we're examining the\nconstitutionality of the three-strikes law, as applied to this\nsentence, we should take into account, should we not, the\npurposes of the California law, which was to have a law which\nwas -- gave simple, clear notice of the three-strikes policy?\nAnd if you want us to take case-by-case, then that whole\npolicy is undercut, it seems to me.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I don't\nthink that's true. In Solem v. Helm, the Court made very\nclear that it was looking only to the sentence that was\nimposed on Mr. Helm.\nQUESTION: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that,\nbecause you had said that the principal focus has to be on\nthis sentence. I'm just not sure what your authority for that\nis when we have a recidivist scheme of this kind.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, the -- in\nSolem versus Helm, the Court, of course, had a recidivist\nscheme. The focus there was on number of prior offenses, as\nopposed to the nature of the prior offenses. The Court said\nthat the defendant, under double-jeopardy principles, cannot\nbe punished for those prior crimes; however, they are relevant\nto the -- to the sentence imposed for the present crime. And\nthe -- and the reason they are relative -- and the Court said\nthis best in Gryger versus Burke -- is what they -- what\nthey -- what they authorize is a, quote, \"stiffened penalty\nfor the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated\noffense because of repetitive one.\" That's at page 8 in our\nreply brief.\nBut what Solem v. Helm made very clear is, although\nthe prior crimes are relevant, the focus must remain, when\njudging proportionality or gross disproportionality, on what\nthis -- what this defendant did at this time, what he is being\nsentenced for at this time.\nQUESTION: I'm just not sure how that works. What\nam I supposed to do with recidivism as a factor in analyzing\nthis sentence?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Give it some weight, but not controlling\nweight, or something like that?\nMR. DENVIR:\nis that his prior crimes are relevant, in the sense that they\nmake this crime a more aggravated crime than a crime committed\nby a first offender --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. DENVIR: -- and that there can be a reasonable\nenhancement for that. But in this case, he has been sentenced\nto -- he has -- his sentence has gone from a maximum of three\nyears for a first offender to life, all based on the\nrecidivism.\nQUESTION: Well, why --\nMR. DENVIR: At that point --\nQUESTION: -- why can't the State say that -- where\na person has a string of convictions like this man has, that\nit's time to get him off the street, as Justice Scalia says,\nthat he simply cannot conform to the law?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, if he, in fact, committed a\ncrime at this point that was a serious or a violent crime,\nthey may have a basis, but what the Court has said very\nclearly is that --\nQUESTION: What --\nMR. DENVIR: -- is the focus remains on this,\nbecause otherwise --\nQUESTION: What --\nMR. DENVIR: -- he's being punished for the prior\ncrimes. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, what's the reason for saying that\nthough -- that you can only -- that the focus remains on this\ncrime, but others are relevant? I mean, that really is kind\nof meaningless, it seems to me.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause, as I say, what the Court has said over the years is\nthat the important part about the prior crimes is that it\nshows that this is a repeat offense. And the fact that he has\ncommitted offenses in a row makes this particular offense\nworse. The fact that he has committed worse offenses in the\npast does not aggravate this crime. I -- this is -- this\nstill remains shoplifting three golf clubs, regardless if he\nhad been a triple murderer or anything else, and that's what\nhe's being punished for. Because if he's being punished\nbecause of those prior crimes, their nature, there's really\nserious double jeopardy --\nQUESTION: What do you think would be enough?\nThirty years? Would you like 30 years for walking off with\nthree golf clubs?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I -- the -- if you -- if\nyou look at our --\nQUESTION: I mean, if you're going to look on it as\njust stealing three golf clubs, and cast a blind eye to his\nlong record of criminal activity, I don't know why you can\ngive him any more than, you know, a couple of years.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, if you look to our --\nto the comparison with other jurisdictions -- and I just don't\nthink this has been highlighted in our brief -- there are\nonly -- there are only five jurisdictions that would have\nallowed a life sentence. There's only one additional\njurisdiction, Montana, that would have allowed a term of years\nas great as the minimum sentence here, and that's -- Montana\nallows -- is five to a hundred years. And most states allow\nfor either grand theft or recidivist grand theft --\nQUESTION: But we said --\nMR. DENVIR: -- ten years at the most.\nQUESTION: -- we said in Rummel, there's always\ngoing to be some state that punishes more harshly than others.\nAnd certainly it was not intimated that that state, therefore,\nwould -- it was cruel and unusual.\nMR. DENVIR: No, that's correct, Your Honor. In\nSolem v. Helm, the Court noted that he could -- that Mr. Helm\ncould have received a comparable sentence in one other state,\nand nevertheless held that it fell under the Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Well, just help us one more time. The\nprior history is relevant, but then how relevant?\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your --\nQUESTION: You say the principal focus has to be on\nthe three golf clubs, like we're some judges out of Victor\nHugo or something and that's all we have to focus on. But\nthis -- there's a -- there's a long recidivism component here,\nand that's the whole purpose of the California law that you're\nasking us to ignore, it seems to me.\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, and -- what I'm saying\nis -- I'm going back to what the Court said in Solem v. Helm\nin its analysis, which I think is controlling here. It\nmade -- it made the point that the -- the prior convictions --\nhe cannot be punished for those, but they do aggravate this\npresent crime that he's being punished for. And the way they\naggravate it is that -- is that this shows that it's a\nrepetitive offense.\nNow, he can have a reasonable enhancement of the\nnormal penalty for grand theft based on the repetition aspect\nof it, but at some point it becomes unreasonable. And it\nbecomes unreasonable if you go from three years to life based\non his prior crimes. At that --\nQUESTION: Why isn't it reasonable to say if he\ncommits another felony -- he's committed, you know, three\nalready and nine other convictions -- \"One more felony,\"\nCalifornia tells him, \"and you go away for life.\" Why isn't\nthat reasonable? And this -- and this was a felony.\nMR. DENVIR: Because of the nature of the crime that\nhe committed, which is stealing three golf clubs, a crime that\nis not deemed either serious or violent under California law.\nQUESTION:\nMR. DENVIR: It is a felony. It's actually a\nwobbler and could be charged either way.\nQUESTION: Why --\nMR. DENVIR: But in this case, it's a felony.\nQUESTION: Why can't California decide that enough\nis enough, that someone with a long string like this simply\ndeserves to be put away?\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, if that were true,\nthen there would be no limiting principle on recidivist laws\nunder the Eighth Amendment. It would -- at that point, you\ncould say the mere fact that he broke any law -- if he broke a\ntraffic offense -- a petty offense would show that he couldn't\nfollow the law and could get a life sentence.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'd be with you there, if it was a\nmisdemeanor or, you know, some -- but this is a felony under\nCalifornia law.\nMR. DENVIR: It is a felony, and it's one of the\nleast grave felonies in California.\nQUESTION: But we have given -- we've said, at\nleast, here, that we are going to give great latitude to state\nlegislatures in determining how many years to give, and how to\ncategorize an offense.\nWhy don't -- why don't we look to the Harmelin case\nfor the standards, rather than Solem? Harmelin came later.\nMR. DENVIR:\nbecause, as I understand the Harmelin case, if you take the\ndissent and the plurality, they both agreed on the basic\nprinciple here, which is that there cannot be gross\ndisproportion between the offense and the sentence. And the\nreason I go back to Solem versus Helm is that it was a\nrecidivist case and there was some further information.\nI don't -- as I read the Court's opinion, at least\nthe plurality opinion, in Harmelin, the big change was that\nyou would -- you would not look automatically to intra\njurisdictional or inter-jurisdictional comparisons. You would\nfirst have to find an inference of gross disproportionality\nbefore you'd go to the second -- the other two steps. That's\nwhat I understood to be the major -- the major refinement of\nSolem v. Helm that was in the plurality opinion.\nQUESTION: I'm slightly stuck on this, because I --\nI'd like -- there is some relevant information that I can't\nget a hold of, and you may have some in your experience, but\nit isn't in the brief.\nImagine -- let's take the set of people who have\ncommitted at least two serious crimes or more, maybe 50\nserious crimes. They're very serious criminals. And they're\nwarned, \"If you do anything again, you've had it.\" So think\nof that set of people.\nNow, I would like to know, in light of that set of\npeople, now one of the members of that set commits a crime\nequal to stealing $1200 -- whether they steal $1200 or equal\nto that; that's a very subjective judgment -- what's the\nlongest sentence such a person has ever actually served?\nHere, they are going to 25 years, real years.\nAnd the second question I'd like to know is, What is\nthe least bad crime that such a person ever committed who did\nserve 25 real years?\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I'd like to know both of those things.\nAnd, obviously, they're find-outable.\nMR. DENVIR: I -- let me see if I can answer your\nquestion. As far as under the three-strikes law, there is --\nbecause it sets this absolute minimum of 25 years -- it's a\nlife sentence, but it adds a kicker to it which says, unlike\nother life sentences, you have to wait at least 25 years\nbefore you can even be considered. So we -- since this law\nwas passed in 1994, we have no experience with this law.\nQUESTION: Obviously, I don't want\nexperience --\nMR. DENVIR: Right.\nQUESTION: -- under this law. That would be\ncircular.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: What I'm looking for is, in the absence\nof this law --\nMR. DENVIR: Oh, I'm sorry. I understand --\nQUESTION: -- in the absence of this law, what is\nthe longest sentence a person like yours -- and I'm defining\n\"a person like yours\" to be a really bad criminal who now will\ncommit another crime equal to or the same as stealing $1200.\nAnd there's loads of records -- I mean, in the California\nAdult Authority before this law was passed, et cetera.\nAnd the second question is, what is the least bad\nthing such a person who really served 25 years did?\nMR. DENVIR: Your --\nQUESTION: That -- those are empirical questions,\nand you're talking about this being unusual. I don't know if\nit's unusual unless I know what happened to other people.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I --\nthere's nothing in the record that would answer that, but let\nme see if I can answer it in a different way. But for the\nthree-strike law, Mr. Ewing, with his record, could receive no\nmore than four years. Now, there are other recidivist laws in\nCalifornia besides the three-strike law.\nQUESTION: Under the California Adult Authority,\nwhich was only the law in California for 70 years, people\ncould receive very, very, very long sentences.\nMR. DENVIR: They could, Your Honor, and California\nis --\nQUESTION:\nbut -- but -- but --\nMR. DENVIR: I think that's right. I think the long\nsentence -- the -- California substituted determinate\nsentencing law for indeterminate in 1977, and -- but under the\nold indeterminate sentencing law, my clear recollection is\nthat those long, indeterminate sentences were always triggered\nby serious or violent felonies, and that is something that --\nQUESTION: No, they -- I've looked it up,\nactually --\nMR. DENVIR: No?\nQUESTION: -- and you're quite right that this is\nnot as -- you couldn't get this long a sentence, but you could\nget a pretty long one for being a third offender and\ncommitting a property crime.\nMR. DENVIR: And --\nQUESTION: But I -- that doesn't tell us how long\nthe people actually served.\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor, if you look for the\nquestion of parole in California, which the -- which the State\nsuggests is -- saves his life sentence, the Court looked at\nthis in 1995 in the case California Department of Corrections\nversus Moralez. And what the Court said at that time was that\n90 percent of all defendants who came up for their first\nparole hearing were found unsuitable for parole and that\n85 percent were found unsuitable at subsequent hearings. Now,\nthat has not improved any, because, as you'll see in the\namicus brief of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, at page\n18, as of 2000, the Board of Prison Terms, which is the --\nwhich is the parole authority -- their official records show\nthat they only recommended parole in 1 percent of the 2000\ncases that came before them with a life sentence.\nQUESTION: Mr. Denvir, can't the people of -- this\nthing, by the way, was not adopted by the legislature, was it?\nIt was adopted by plebiscite, of the people of California --\nMR. DENVIR: By both, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: By both.\nMR. DENVIR: Both by legislature and by --\nQUESTION: By plebiscite. So the people of\nCalifornia decided, \"We want to be tougher.\" Why do we have\nto be bound by whatever the more permissive scheme was\nearlier? The people of California knew that scheme, and they\ndecided, \"This is no good. We still have too much crime.\nWe're not punishing people enough, or we're not keeping\nthem -- keeping them incarcerated long enough.\" Why do we\nhave to be bound by whatever the previous record was?\nMR. DENVIR: Well --\nQUESTION: It seems to me the question before us is,\nis it unreasonable to put away somebody who has this record?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, first of all, as to the\nquestion of initiative versus legislation, it is my\nunderstanding that the Court, in other areas, has said that\nthere's no greater deference given to one than the other.\nBut the other question is, there's no doubt that\nsome deference has to be paid by this Court to legislative\njudgments or initiative judgments in the questions of\npunishment and in dealing with recidivists. The Court has\nmade that very clear. But it is that deference that has led\nto the Court setting a very forgiving standard. The Court\nsaid that it would not require, in this area, or as excessive\nfines, strict proportionality between the crime being punished\nand the sentence. It has said it was only when there was a\ngross disproportion, and that's a very deferential standard.\nThat is a standard that allows the legislature to make many\nreasonable judgments, but says that --\nQUESTION: So how do you decide --\nMR. DENVIR: -- some judgments are unreasonable.\nQUESTION: -- how much is too much?\nMR. DENVIR: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: What's the --\nMR. DENVIR: -- life imprisonment for -- for the\ncrime of stealing three golf clubs, we believe, is cruel and\nunusual punishment.\nQUESTION: It's not life imprisonment.\nQUESTION: But we're just doing --\nQUESTION: It's 25 years.\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It's 25 years that he'll really serve.\nWe know that. As far as -- what happens after those 25 years\nis a matter of parole or a decision by other people.\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, the sentence that he's been\ngiven is life in prison. He's been consigned to die in prison\nunless some administrative agency determines to let him out.\nAnd as I've just quoted you --\nQUESTION: But I mean, parole, in all the cases\nyou're citing, is relevant, so you can describe it as you\nwant. We both know what the facts are. The facts are he has\nto be in jail for at least 25 years, and then he might be\nparoled.\nMR. DENVIR: And he might be, but on -- there is\nno -- there is nothing in this record that would suggest he\nhas a reasonable expectation in that regard. In fact -- in\nfact, what's before the Court would suggest that there is not\na reasonable expectation, particularly if the animus that\ndrives -- that drove the passage of this law continues for 25\nyears and they still think, \"Well, gee, if they committed\nthese prior crimes, they ought to be locked up for life,\nbecause they may commit other crimes.\"\nQUESTION: In the statistics that you were quoting,\nthough, those were not three-strikes cases.\nMR. DENVIR:\nQUESTION: Those are cases where people might have\ngotten reduced time for good behavior --\nMR. DENVIR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- none of which is -- and one question I\nwanted to ask you, in view of the infirmities of Mr. Ewing --\nis he still alive?\nMR. DENVIR: He is alive, Your Honor. He is --\nQUESTION: Counselor --\nMR. DENVIR: -- he's lost -- he's aged and has lost\neyesight in one eye as a result, but he's still alive at this\npoint --\nQUESTION: How old was he at the time of sentence?\nMR. DENVIR: He was 38 years old. He's 40 years old\nnow. So --\nQUESTION: Counselor --\nMR. DENVIR: -- as a practical matter -- I mean,\nthis -- 25 years is probably a life sentence for him, unless\nthere's some major medical development that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Denvir, you conceded a moment ago\nthat the prior offenses can be considered for purposes of\ntreating this offense as an aggravated offense, given the\nprior record; and yet when you answer -- you've done this more\nthan once -- when you have answered the question of going to\ndisproportionality, you have said, \"It's 25 to life for\nstealing three golf clubs.\"\nI don't think you can have it both ways. Either\nyour argument is it's 25 -- the appropriate comparison is --\nor the appropriate characterization is \"25 to life for three\ngolf clubs,\" in which case you, in effect, are telling us,\n\"Ignore the priors; they don't aggravate,\" or you've got to\nsay, \"It's 25 to life for stealing three golf clubs when you\nhave a prior record\" -- whatever it was, nine prior offenses,\nincluding four felonies, in this case. Which is it? Because\nI assume it may well affect the result.\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I -- if -- I misspoke.\nWhat we say is the focus must be on the present offense. It\nis an aggravated offense. He is a repeat --\nQUESTION: But when you said that --\nMR. DENVIR: -- a repeat offender. He is a repeat\noffender. He is someone who committed this offense with a\nprior record of nine offenses?\"\nQUESTION: Is it inconsistent with your position --\nwhen you say, \"The focus must be on this offense,\" is it\ninconsistent with that to say, \"This offense -- is stealing\nthree golf clubs worth $1200 by somebody with a prior record\nof nine offenses\"? Is that consistent with putting the focus\non this offense, in the terms that you're using?\nMR. DENVIR: I think it is, in the sense that it\nshows that there has -- there has been some -- there has been\na series of repetition.\nis that regardless of the repetition, the fact that it's a\nrepetitive offense, if the focus remains on what he did now,\nthe triggering offense, which, under Solem v. Helm, is the\nfocus, then no matter what he has done in the past, no matter\nhow much repetition, it is --it is grossly disproportional to\nsentence him to a life sentence. At that point --\nQUESTION: A hundred prior instances of stealing\nthree golf clubs would not affect the analysis then on your\nview?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, if there -- if there were\na -- if there were a series of crimes of the same nature --\nfor instance, if there --\nQUESTION: Well, I've just -- I've just given you\none.\nMR. DENVIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: A hundred prior -- three golf clubs every\ntime, a hundred times -- would that justify the treatment that\nhe has gotten?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I think that that would --\nthat would show a propensity to steal golf clubs, but, again,\nI don't believe --\nQUESTION: I would concede that, but the --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DENVIR: -- I don't believe --\nQUESTION:\nimproved.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DENVIR: He shouldn't be penalized for that.\nThat may be beyond his control.\nQUESTION: Okay, but if we -- if we've got our crazy\nexample of a hundred priors exactly like this, and we follow\nyour verbal criterion at least of focusing on this offense as\naggravated, would this be disproportionate, grossly?\nMR. DENVIR: I believe that life is, because it is\nstill -- the crime that has to be punished -- I mean, and this\nis what the Court said in Solem v. Helm -- this is --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe we were trying --\nMR. DENVIR: -- you know, in Solem v. Helm --\nQUESTION: -- maybe we were trying to have it both\nways verbally because we were imprecise. But with respect, I\nthink that's what you're trying to do. Because on the one\nhand, you concede, yes, it may be regarded as an aggravated\noffense in light of the priors, and then in the next breath\nyou say, \"But the focus has got to be on this offense.\"\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I -- Your Honor, there's no\ndoubt that the prior record -- and the Court has said that is\nrelevant to the punishment for the present crime, and it does\naggravate it. But there are limits to how aggravated\nshoplifting three golf clubs can be, no matter what has\nhappened before --\nQUESTION: Even with the hundred prior instances?\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, it's still three -- it's\nstill stealing three golf clubs. It's not robbery, rape,\nmurder, or something of that nature. I mean, it is -- it is\nstill there. I mean, the -- to raise your question, what if\nsomeone had a long history of jay-walking and had seven or ten\nor a hundred convictions for jay-walking and jay-walked again?\nI think the Court would not say you could get a life sentence\nfor that just --\nQUESTION: I don't --\nMR. DENVIR: -- because it's repetitive.\nQUESTION: -- I don't think it would. And the\nreason it wouldn't is -- I assume you would concede -- is that\njay-walking does not hurt other people the way 100 instances\nof stealing golf clubs worth $1200 hurts other people.\nMR. DENVIR: It hurts in the sense that it's a\nproperty crime and causes --\nQUESTION: Well, you know, and --\nMR. DENVIR: -- a loss, that's correct.\nQUESTION: -- and may lead to something beyond\nproperty crime. Isn't grand larceny much more likely to\nresult in physical confrontation and --\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I --\nQUESTION: -- physical injury than jay-walking?\nMR. DENVIR:\nand I think --\nQUESTION: Which is why it's a felony.\nMR. DENVIR: -- and I think that if there had been\nsome -- some violence that had actually occurred out of this,\nthen he undoubtedly would have been punished under a different\nstatute with higher --\nQUESTION: It's a serious crime, in part because of\nthat -- in part because of the risk of physical confrontation\nthat it poses.\nMR. DENVIR: But Your Honor, California determined\nthat when it set the ranges for grand theft --\nQUESTION: Would you like -- would you like to reserve time,\nMr. Denvir?\nMR. DENVIR: If the Court has further questions, I'd\nrather answer the questions --\nQUESTION: Very well --\nMR. DENVIR: -- than reserve time.\nQUESTION: Very well. You asked for it, you --\nMR. DENVIR: California considered that when they\nset the penalties for grand theft. And they set the penalty\nas a maximum of three years in prison. If they set different\npenalties for grand theft from a person, and for robbery,\nthere is -- there is -- all those things are taken into\nconsideration here. And the fact that this could have\neventuated into something else, the fact of the matter is that\nit did not. And in fact, if anything, Mr. Ewing seemed to be\ndoing everything he can to be -- to get out of there\nundetected, if that -- if you look at the facts of this crime.\nQUESTION: I'm curious about one thing. Was he\nreally a very tall man, or were these irons rather than wood?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, to tell you the truth, I\nhave no idea how he could have done that. It seems to me a\nmiracle that he could have -- actually got out the door, but\nhe apparently did. He's not a very tall man, as I recall.\nQUESTION: It is a good thing that walking is not an\nessential part of golf, because otherwise walking with\nthose --\nMR. DENVIR: I think --\nQUESTION: -- golf clubs in his pants would have\nbeen very difficult.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DENVIR: I think he was planning on removing\nthem before he used them, I take it --\nQUESTION: He took a golf cart out to the car.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, I would reserve any\nadditional time, unless there's additional questions.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Denvir.\nMR. DENVIR: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. De Nicola, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DE NICOLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court: First, I think, in answer to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, I don't know what the statistics are under the old\nindeterminate sentencing law that was in effect in California\nuntil 1976. But in a way, I think the -- Your Honor's\nquestion triggers an issue that I think is central here.\nThe ISL, the old California law, was premised very\nexplicitly on a penological theory that emphasized\nrehabilitation of the offender. I think the question that's\nraised in this case, and it's a question that's particularly\napt in light of the Harmelin opinion, is, when can a state\ndecide that they're going to move away from a more lenient\npolicy of rehabilitation or extending leniency to a first-\ntime offender, and move toward a policy, a tougher policy, of\nincapacitation?\nQUESTION: So, tell me, am I fair to assume there\nnever, in the history of the United States, has been a person\nwho -- of the set -- I'm only -- I don't want to be\npejorative; I want to characterize it your way, and I'll\ncharacterize it as taking the set of very serious criminals\nwith very serious records, and a person in that set commits\nanother crime, and the other crime is approximately theft of\n$1200 -- and am I fair in saying there hasn't been, ever, a\nsentence in the history of the United States in the last\nhundred years anywhere close to this one? And I base that on\nmy knowledge -- which you could get; it's public -- of 35,000\nreal cases in the federal system where to get a sentence like\nthis one for a prior offender, you had to -- you have to now,\nyou know, hijack an airplane, commit murder, something really\nserious beyond belief compared to this, and that the worst\nsentence you could get for something like this is about four,\nfive years.\nAnd then I look to the California Adult Authority,\nand I see, under that sentencing, nobody could have gotten\nmore than ten real years, and, indeed, the average was\nsomewhere around five. And you have all those records, and\nyou have come up with nothing in your brief. And therefore,\ncan I say -- my assumption is, this is by an order or factor\nof two or three times higher than anyone ever was sentenced\nbefore in the United States for such a thing?\nYou see, I'm making a very extreme statement\nempirically, and I want to know what the response is to my\nstatement, and I want to know why I shouldn't hold you to my\nstatement since you have the information, and why I shouldn't\nsay that's just way too much.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, again, Your Honor, I -- the --\nmy answer is that I do not know what those records would have\nshown.\nQUESTION: I guess he shouldn't hold you to it,\nsince you don't have the burden of persuasion here, do you? I\nthought you're defending a -- a decision below.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, and I did interpret the issue\nto be a proportionality issue rather than an unusualness\nissue. But I do -- something in the recesses of my mind tells\nme that we had a three-time loser statute in California, and I\nthink that put people away for life without parole.\nQUESTION: Well, all right, how do we decide --how\ndo we decide if you say, of this serious set of criminals, you\ngo to jail for life if you jay-walk -- I mean, the next time.\nIs that -- is that disproportionate? How am I supposed to say\nwhat is or was -- is not if I don't look to the empirical\nfacts? And I'm not holding you to present empirical facts.\nI'm just saying, Why shouldn't I decide on the basis of\nempirical fact that is available?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, in our view, the most\nprominent, kind of, objective factor that this Court could\nlook to in weighing this sentence is what the legislature has\nsaid are felonies. What California has done in this case is,\nthey've narrowed their target to a subclass of felons who have\ncommitted what the legislature has deemed to be -- and I think\nwhat, on the face of it, can reasonably be interpreted as\nbeing -- serious or violent crimes.\nQUESTION: What's the limit for being -- what is the\ndividing line between grand theft and petty theft in\nCalifornia?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Four hundred dollars, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: When I went to law school, it was $100,\nexcept if it was citrus you stole, it was $50.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DE NICOLA: Now it's $100 if it's citrus.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DE NICOLA: But once there is that predicate of\nserious or violent felonies set in place, then what the three-\nstrikes law does is, I think, reasonably moves toward a policy\nof incapacitation upon the commission of, not just any new\ncrime, not a misdemeanor or an infraction, but a new crime\nthat the legislature has --\nQUESTION: One of the things that puzzles me about\nthe statute -- maybe you can enlighten me -- I thought that if\nthere were two priors that were violent but not related to\nproperty, such as murder and rape, that the third related to\nproperty wouldn't trigger the statute.\nMR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor. The way the statute\nis written is that if the prior felonies meet the statutory\ndefinition of being serious or violent -- if you have two of\nthose, then any new felony triggers the three-strike sentence.\nQUESTION:\nconviction and a rape conviction and then you committed a\nwobbler that was a property crime? Would the statute treat\nthat as a third strike?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, because wobblers are felonies,\nby definition, in California, and any felony qualifies.\nQUESTION: Regardless of the character of the first\ntwo strikes.\nMR. DE NICOLA: As long as the first two strikes\nmeet the level of being serious or violent, which --\nQUESTION: I see. So -- and there's no requirement\nthat it be related to property. I misunderstood.\nMR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nQUESTION: Also, I don't know how to work with\nfelony and misdemeanor, because, across the nation, my\nimpression is that those are classified in very different\nways, and they're classified sometimes according to the prison\nthat you serve in, as in Massachusetts, and sometimes you can\nfind a felony that, in ordinary common sense, is a lot less\nserious than certain misdemeanors. That's why I'm very pushed\nto know what to work with unless you work with empirical fact.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, we -- in California, the\nfelony is defined by the -- not just the locus of where the\nterm will be served, but also by the length. It's more than a\nyear.\ndemarcation between offenses that, over the course of time,\nsociety deems to be of elevated seriousness.\nQUESTION: I think some of our constitutional\njurisprudence makes it -- makes -- turns upon the distinction\nbetween felonies and misdemeanors, doesn't it?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, Your Honor, I think that is so,\nand there are political restraints on the legislature in\nenacting laws in general applicability. There are certainly\neconomic restraints on a legislature in deciding to set a\npunishment scheme that provides for long terms of\nimprisonment. That's costly. And that to -- for a court to\nsecond-guess that, comes, we think, perilously close to the\ncourt suggesting that the legislature can, in some instances,\nnot declare a certain crime to be a felony, but must declare\nit to be a misdemeanor, and we don't think there's anything in\nthe Court's jurisprudence that would -- that would support\nthat type of an intrusion.\nQUESTION: Mr. De Nicola, there's a lot of\ndiscretion built into this scheme. It comes across as three\nstrikes and you're out, and that's it; but it's not. There's\ndiscretion in the prosecutor and discretion in the judge. Are\nthere, in Los Angeles or in California, any guides to\nprosecutors in exercising their discretion, say, whether to\ntreat a wobbler as a misdemeanor or a felony?\nMR. DE NICOLA:\nEach elected district attorney in the various counties in\nCalifornia has the option of promulgating guidelines. Some of\nthem have. And the fact of the matter is some of them -- some\nof them differ. We think that's a rather unremarkable event\nin light of the fact that prosecutorial discretion is always\ngoing to lead to some sort of different approach depending on\nlocal conditions. But there is not, as far as I know, any\nstatewide guideline, and certainly nothing that would be\nbinding on the local prosecutors.\nQUESTION: The prosecutor can charge something as a\nmisdemeanor. As far as the striking a strike is concerned, is\nthat solely for the judge? Or, I suppose, it depends on\nwhat's charged. The prosecutor can decide not to charge two\nstrikes.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, the prosecutor, under the\nstatute, is required to allege the priors, but the prosecutor\nmay seek dismissal of the prior strikes either in the\nfurtherance of justice, or because of problems of proof. But\nthe judge also has authority to strike strikes, even without\nthe consent of the prosecutor, in California. And so --\nQUESTION: And similarly, to reduce a wobbler to a\nmisdemeanor.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, the prosecutor, in a way, has\nthat discretion, because he or she can charge a -- an\nalternative felony or misdemeanor as a misdemeanor in the\nfirst place, but even under the three-strikes law, the trial\njudge retains the discretion to sentence a -- an alternative\nfelony misdemeanor as a misdemeanor, and that would take the\ncase out of the three-strikes scope.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about your\ntheory of the limits of the constitutional protection here?\nSupposing the offense was speeding -- and it can be dangerous\nspeeding -- and you had a -- you said that -- 15 arrests for\nspeeding gives you this very sentence we got in this case.\nWould that be permissible, do you think? Just on the theory\nthat Justice Scalia has explained -- where this guy is just\ntoo dangerous, we just don't want him on the street anymore,\nso we'll put him in jail for life, 25 years without\npossibility of parole.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, we think that might possibly\nbe constitutional, Your Honor. I --\nQUESTION: Possibly be constitutional or\nunconstitutional?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Might possibly be constitutional. I\nthink it's more likely that it would\nbe --\nQUESTION: Well, why wouldn't it clearly be\nconstitutional if we're thinking about protecting the public\nfrom repetitive offenders?\nMR. DE NICOLA:\nprinciple that we're seeking here, Your Honor, is one that's\npremised on the felony classification. If\nthe --\nQUESTION: Do you think the statute would have been\nunconstitutional if they had said it's a misdemeanor when it's\n$1200 -- if the legislature just, say, called the three golf\nclubs for $1200 by a misdemeanor instead of by felony, would\nthat change the constitutional analysis?\nMR. DE NICOLA: It -- I think it would make the\nconstitutional -- it might change the constitutional analysis.\nIt might make the result different. I think, again, once you\nhave the predicate in place of the serious or violent\nfelonies, then I think the reason you're --\nQUESTION: But serious or violent -- it really\ndoesn't have to be violent; it has to serious. But you could\nhave had $1200 thefts, four or five of them, and he would\nstill qualify, wouldn't he?\nMR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor. If -- the prior\ncrimes have to qualify as serious or violent under the\ndefinitions of a separate statutory scheme, so they would\nnot --\nQUESTION: But are there not serious crimes that are\nnot violent?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, I think that's true. There are\nserious crimes where no injury is inflicted, but the crimes, I\nthink, by their nature, tend to be crimes where the prospect\nof violence is rather imminent.\nQUESTION: But they're -- I'm just trying to -- I'm\ntrying to understand the theory. Is violence an absolute\nrequirement, in your view, in one of the priors?\nMR. DE NICOLA: No, I think -- I think --\nQUESTION: Okay. So then we could have something\nequivalent -- maybe instead of $1200, $2000 or something. But\nif you just had five -- or three or four $2,000 burglaries,\nthat -- do you -- would that be permissible to put him in jail\non the same sentence that you have in this case?\nMR. DE NICOLA: I -- again, Your Honor, I -- it's\na -- it's a much tougher call. I think it might be\npermissible to do it, provided that the sentence allows for a\npossibility of parole, after the --\nQUESTION: After 25 years.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes. That would distinguish it from\nSolem, Your Honor. But nevertheless, here, the predicate,\neven though the prior crimes don't necessarily have to involve\nthe actual infliction of violence, they are crimes that by\ntheir nature --\nQUESTION: But in your view, violence is really more\nsignificant than the number of prior offenses, if I understand\nyou correctly.\nMR. DE NICOLA:\nscale, but I think violence does play a significant role and\ncan justify a scheme like this, even in the absence --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DE NICOLA: -- of a great number of priors.\nQUESTION: But you -- but I'm not quite sure what\nyour view would be if there were no violence, but just seven\nor eight high-speed offenses, say, speeding, or $1200 golf\nclubs.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, we think a lot would depend on\nwhether the legislature in the jurisdiction had determined\nfor -- for -- on an historical basis and for reasons\nindependent --\nQUESTION: Well, speeding is dangerous. People get\nhurt in automobile accidents. It seems to me it's exactly the\nsame risk to the public that you have with this kind of crime.\nMR. DE NICOLA: But we think -- if the legislature\ndeclares those to be a felony, then I think we become a lot --\nwe come a lot closer to --\nQUESTION: It depends on what the legislature calls\nthe offense.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, it does, Your Honor, in a very\nsignificant respect, because what the legislature calls the\noffense in connection with it being a misdemeanor or a felony\ndoes reflect, we think, a reliable longstanding consensus of\nthe -- of the community.\ndeference and reliance and objective factors, we think that's\na prominent objective factor.\nQUESTION: On Justice Stevens' hypo, taking it one\nstep further, I guess we would have to say that if there were\n15 prior speeding offenses, and they had been classified as\nfelonies in California, that there was no disproportion\nbetween 25-to-life for 15 -- with a predicate of 15 prior\nspeeding offenses, on the one hand, and the penalties for\ntorture and murder, on the other hand. Because I think it's\nundisputed that the only standalone penalties that are this\ngreat are the penalties for torture and homicide. That would\nbe rather a stretch, wouldn't it, regardless of whether the\nlegislature wants to put a felony label on them or not?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, again, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Speeding's important, but --\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I mean, torture and murder?\nMR. DE NICOLA: I do think that it is a much tougher\ncase for us, and I'm not at all certain that it would be\nconstitutional if all of the crimes, the predicate through the\nnew crime, were simply speeding. I think --\nQUESTION: Might it be an abuse of the judge's\ndiscretion not to reduce such a -- if it's a wobbler, in such\na case, or not to strike a strike?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, I don't -- in the California\ncontext, the question would only arise -- well, I don't think\nit would arise at all, because you wouldn't have a speeding --\neven as a predicate, any felony-triggering offense, and the\nspeeding wouldn't qualify as a serious or violent felony under\nthe statute anyway. So this hypothetical is very far removed\nfrom the three-strikes scheme that California has in place.\nQUESTION: I would have thought that your response\nto Justice Souter would have been that it might seem\ndisproportionate insofar as the penal goal of punishment or\nretribution is concerned, but it depends on what you want your\npenal goals to be. California has decided that disabling the\ncriminal is the most important thing, and in -- from that\npoint of view, it's not necessarily disproportionate. The one\nis disabled as the other.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, proportionality -- you\nnecessarily have to look upon what the principal objective of\nthe punishment is. If the objective of -- if the objective is\nretribution, then, sure, I guess it's disproportionate to\nexecute somebody for killing only one person, when you do no\nmore than execute somebody for killing 20 people. But if your\npurpose is disabling the criminal, I'm not sure that it --\nthat the example that Justice Souter gave is disproportionate.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, again, Your Honor, I don't --\nI don't think I would absolutely concede that it would be\nunconstitutional. I'm just saying that --\nQUESTION: Well, do you adopt Justice Scalia's\nanalysis? I mean, this came up in the briefs, and this was an\ninteresting point. Does the State, for purposes of\nproportionality analysis, have the option to adopt a different\ntheory of penalty? And he's given an example. Do you -- do\nyou adopt that argument here? And do you think that is a\njustification that you want to rely on in this case?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, we do adopt the theory of\nincapacitation, and we do rely on incapacitation as a theory\nthat justifies the sentence in this case.\nQUESTION: All right. Here's the problem that I\nhave with that, and this is -- this is -- this is what I wish\nyou would address. If we allow, for purposes of\nproportionality or gross disproportionality analysis, this\nkind of -- the consideration of varying intentions --\nretribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and so on -- and\nevery time the State gets to a very high offense, the State\nsays, \"Oh, we've changed the theory. We've gone from\ndeterrence to retribution,\" it seems to me that it makes this\nkind of analysis of comparables -- this proportionality\nanalysis -- impossible because we no longer have two\ncomparable entities on either side of our comparison. What we\nhave is a low sentence on the one hand for deterrence, and a\nhigh sentence for incapacitation or retribution. We have\napples and oranges instead of oranges and oranges.\nSo my question is, if we accept the State's option\nto say, \"We've changed the theory,\" don't we read\ncomparability analysis right out of the law? Doesn't it\nsimply become logically impossible?\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, I think it becomes much more\ndifficult, but I don't think it necessarily becomes logically\nimpossible, because I think there is still room for judicial\nscrutiny, within the context of the Harmelin narrow\nproportionality principle, to take a hard look --\nQUESTION: But my problem is, I don't know what\nwe're supposed to -- what we can compare for comparable\nexamples on proportionality analysis if it can be\nfundamentally affected by the State's change of intention from\none theory in one crime, or one set of penalties, to another\ntheory in another set of penalties. I don't see what we can\ncompare. We no longer have comparables.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Well, but I think the Court can\nstill look at whether the phenomenon of -- as in this case, of\nheightened recidivism based on prior violence, or serious\noffenses threatening violence and triggered by a new crime\nthat, say -- that's classified as a felony by the legislature\nand that offers a sentence of -- a lengthy sentence, but that\nstill offers a possibility of\nparole --\nQUESTION: I guess the conclusion that Justice\nSouter's questions would lead to is that a State cannot use\nany factor except retribution. Or if it uses any other\nfactor, it does so at the risk of our simply holding it to be\ndisproportionate.\nMR. DE NICOLA: Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And I don't know that our -- I'm sure\nthat our cases don't support that.\nMR. DE NICOLA: It -- and I acknowledge it -- to\nJustice Souter, it makes it a very difficult situation. But\nunder Harmelin, those, I think, are penological objectives\nthat the Judiciary ought to defer to the State.\nQUESTION: But maybe -- maybe, and I -- we've -- we\nhaven't said this -- maybe our assumption is that the State,\nin establishing a penal system, is going to establish it on a\nset of consistent and neutral principles from beginning to\nend. Would that be a legitimate basis for us to ground our\nconstitutional analysis?\nMR. DE NICOLA: No, Your Honor. It disables the\nstates from changing -- from dealing with changing conditions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. De Nicola.\nMr. Chertoff, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CHERTOFF:\nthe Court: I think the last series of questions which Justice\nSouter posed to Mr. De Nicola really framed the issue in light\nof this case's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin -- this\nCourt's most recent pronouncement in Harmelin.\nI would have read Harmelin as establishing two\nprinciples, at a minimum. One is, the analysis is not\nproportionality; it's gross disproportionality, an extremely\nrare basis to invalidate a statute. Second, we recognize that\nthe states are entitled to adopt different penological\ntheories, or a mix of theories. In fact, I would have thought\nthat a state's entitled to say, for example, that certain\ntypes of crimes ought to be addressed in terms of retribution;\nother types of crimes posing other kinds of issues can be\ndealt with in terms of deterrence and incapacitation.\nAnd if the consequence of that principle is that\nthis Court has very limited review on comparability of\nsentences, at least where you're dealing with sentences that\nallow for the possibility of parole, then I think the\nconclusion is that it is the extremely rare case in which a\nsentence gets --\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that this case? I mean,\nI don't know how to approach proportionality other than to\nsay, what sentences are given for the same crime, or what\ncrimes are treated with the same sentence?\nNow, suppose, looking at that, I find this is the\nrare case. If it isn't, why isn't it? I mean, all the\ninformation we have, as I've said before, seems to suggest\nthat this is higher by a factor of two or three times anything\nelse you can find.\nMR. CHERTOFF: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, if that isn't grossly\ndisproportionate, why isn't it?\nMR. CHERTOFF: It's not for several reasons, Your\nHonor. First of all, although there's nothing in the record\nto speak to what the pre-1977 proportions were in terms of\nsentencing, we do know, for example, that elsewhere in the\ncountry there have been comparable sentences. We've cited in\nthe United States --\nQUESTION: Cited a lot of instances in which the law\npermits such a sentence, but that's quite different from\nsaying there was such a sentence.\nMR. CHERTOFF: Actually, I think in footnote 13,\nwe've cited several cases in other states where you have very\ncomparable punishments, where you have larcenies between 4-\nand $700 as the third strike --\nQUESTION: And do you have instances where people\nwere sentenced to 25 real years in prison for having committed\nsuch an offense? Or were you citing that the law would permit\nsuch a sentence?\nMR. CHERTOFF:\ndisproportionality challenges in one case in Nevada to a life\nsentence without parole for a grand larceny of --\nQUESTION: Good, okay, thank you.\nMR. CHERTOFF: -- $476, and a similar one, I think,\nin South Dakota.\nAlso, of course, as we look at the current\nsentencing regime, this is not, as in Solem versus Helm, where\nyou have single judge who is apparently an outlier under the\nstate sentencing scheme. In this case, if one takes, in fact,\na petitioner's own figures, you have at least 2- to 300\nindividuals whose third strike, under the California scheme as\nit now exists, has, in fact, been a property-based crime.\nAnd I think the most compelling reason why this is\nnot that very, very rare case where we strike down a sentence\nis precisely what Justice Ginsburg has been repeatedly asking\nabout, the discretion that the courts have to tailor the\nparticular sentence in this case to the facts of the case. If\nwe look at the record in this case, in the joint appendix, the\nsentencing judge carefully considered the entirety of the file\nwith respect to the trigger -- or the predicate offenses,\nwhich involved, actually, three burglaries in the course of a\nsingle month, one of which involved pulling a knife and\nthreatening somebody, as well as at least nine prior offenses.\nAnd interestingly, in no case since 1988 had the\npetitioner ever successfully completed probation or parole.\nHe was always violating probation or parole by committing his\nnext offense. And that's precisely what the sentencing judge\nlooked at and explicitly referred to in rejecting the request\non the part of the petitioner either to downgrade the\ntriggering offense to a misdemeanor, or to eliminate some of\nthe strikes.\nAnd I would have thought that is precisely what we\nexpect and want judges to do in a rational sentencing system.\nQUESTION: In effect, you're -- going back to the\nbeginning of your argument, I think you're -- I think you're\nsaying that what the judge here did in rejecting the request\nto downgrade or to disregard, in effect, was saying, \"Yes, I\nam finding that this is a case in which it is appropriate to\nsentence on an entirely different theory, a theory of putting\nthem away, as opposed to a theory of deterrence,\" and I --\nthat seems to be the logic of what's going on.\nMR. CHERTOFF: That's correct; an entirely different\ntheory, though, that is embraced by the State in passing this\nlaw.\nQUESTION: And may I ask you one more question on\nthat? Because again, you started toward it in responding to\nme at the beginning. Like you, I came in here assuming that\nthe State could change its theories. If that is so, then I\nguess what that means for proportionate or gross\ndisproportionality analysis is this:\ncan pass our Eight Amendment test if it has a reasonable basis\nfor saying, \"We are going, under certain circumstances, to say\nthere is a changed theory of sentencing. The theory changes\nfrom deterrence or mere retribution to a theory or public\nprotection, putting away the person who simply will repeat and\nrepeat and repeat.\"\nSo, for purposes of our proportionality analysis,\nthe question would come down, do they have a reasonable basis\nfor doing that under their statute, in general? And in\nparticular, is there a reasonable basis for saying that this\nis a case for that? And if the answers to those two questions\nare yes, then it passes the test. Is that -- would you adopt\nthat analysis?\nMR. CHERTOFF: I would absolutely agree that if it\nsatisfies those two, it passes the test. That's not to say\nthat if it flunks those, it automatically fails the test. But\ncertainly if you meet those conditions, I think you pass the\ntest. And I think there's a common sense to that.\nOne could look, for example, at certain types of\nviolent crimes, like murders and rapes and say, irrespective\nof whether it was a crime of passion or something that will\nnever happen again, \"It is so heinous, our philosophy is we\nhave to punish it.\" But one can also look at comparatively\nsmall crimes, at least if they're felonies, and say, \"If\nsomeone is repetitiously unable to conform their conduct to\nthe requirements of the law, we don't have to wait until he\ncommits the next felony or the next two felonies before we put\nan end to it.\"\nAnd interestingly, if one goes back to Blackstone,\nwho talks a little bit about the issue of proportionality as\nit related back in his day, he discusses the fact that when\nyou deal with habitual offenders, it would be cruel to the\npublic to simply allow that person to get out again and commit\ntheir next crime.\nSo, I don't know that it's so much that the State\nchanges its theory, as that the State adapts its theory to the\nparticular type of crime and particular type of offender. And\nthat's, of course, what we want to have in sentencing.\nAnd, finally, I would say this. In a scheme like\nCalifornia, where the state judge has the power to tailor to\nthe particular offender and the particular offense what the\nright answer is, for the federal courts to come in under gross\ndisproportionality analysis and recalibrate that -- even if,\nsitting as state trial judges, the justices might feel we\nwould do it differently -- would be essentially converting the\ncourts into a constitutional sentencing commission. And if\none looks at the companion case --\nQUESTION: Excuse me, would be essentially\nto --\nMR. CHERTOFF:\nconstitutional sentencing commission. Doing the kind of\nanalysis that we now have, a sentencing commission --\nQUESTION: And that would be a very bad thing. I\nagree.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHERTOFF: It would be a -- certainly very\ncomplicated thing, Justice Breyer.\nSo -- and if one looks at the companion case,\nAndrade, and the subsequent cases in the Ninth Circuit that\nhave flowed from that case, one sees this phenomenon beginning\nto emerge, where every fact pattern is evaluated slightly\ndifferently. One court views burglary as being a violent\noffense; one court says it's not a violent offense.\nQUESTION: Could you argue that, because discretion\nis consistent with the goals of the statute before the\nsentencing, that some discretion is also permitted to a\nreviewing court after the sentencing, and they can still\nmaintain the symmetry and the purpose of the statute?\nMR. CHERTOFF: The state law could certainly provide\nfor some kind of review as a matter of state sentencing law in\nterms of abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge.\nQUESTION: But in this -- in California, does the\nappellate court ever set aside sentences on the ground there\nwas an abuse of discretion to invoke the three strikes law?\nMR. CHERTOFF:\naffirmed trial judges that have set aside strikes. I don't\nknow of a case --\nQUESTION: No, I -- has -- has a trial judge ever\nbeen set aside for imposing the third strike?\nMR. CHERTOFF: I'm not aware of it.\nQUESTION: I don't think --\nMR. CHERTOFF: I'm not aware --\nQUESTION: -- there are any --\nMR. CHERTOFF: -- of such a case. Certainly the\nstate law could allow that to happen.\nIf there are no further questions, I will return the\nrest of my time to the Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chertoff.\nMr. Denvir, you have one minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DENVIR: Your Honor, the point I -- I'd like to\nmake two points. One is, if the discretion in -- under the\nCalifornia law is very limited. One thing would be to treat a\nwobbler, if it is a wobbler, and reduce it to a misdemeanor;\nso you would go from 25 to life, or life, to one-year maximum\npenalty. That's not used very often. The other one is to\nstrike a prior conviction. But that's a -- the California\nSupreme Court in Romero said that's a very limited discretion,\nthat it is only when you can find that this offender is\noutside the \"spirit of the law,\" whatever that is. And\nthere's an amicus brief filed by the Los Angeles public\ndefender in Romero that shows that that discretion has been\nused very little in California. So the -- this limited\ndiscretion has no effect on it.\nThe only other point I'd make, as far as the\nrepetition -- as far as the labeling, if all the legislature\nhas to do is say, \"What we're doing here is incapacitation,\nand, therefore, the Court can't look at that,\" then it really\nwrites the Eighth Amendment protections against grossly\ndisproportional sentences out totally. If it's just a\nquestion of -- they say, \"Here's our reason,\" and you can't\neven question that, because they can always claim they want to\nincapacitate any criminal for any amount of time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Denvir. The\ncase is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
