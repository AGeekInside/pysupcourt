OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nParticipation in the political process is\nthe First Amendment's most fundamental guarantee. Yet\nthat freedom is being smothered by one of the most\ncomplicated, expensive, and incomprehensible regulatory\nregimes ever invented by the administrative state.\nIn the case that you consider today, it is a\nfelony for a small, nonprofit corporation to offer\ninterested viewers a 90-minute political documentary\nabout a candidate for the nation's highest office, that\nGeneral Electric, National Public Radio, or George Soros\nmay freely broadcast. Its film may be shown in\ntheaters, sold on DVDs, transmitted for downloading on\nthe Internet, and its message may be distributed in the\nform of a book. But its producers face 5 years in\nprison if they offer it in the home through the vehicle\nof Video On Demand.\nBecause the limitation on speech, political\nspeech, is at the core of the First Amendment, the\ngovernment has a heavy burden to establish each\napplication of a restriction on that form of speech is a\nnarrowly tailored response to a compelling governmental\ninterest. The government cannot prove and has not\nattempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary made\navailable to people who choose affirmatively to receive\nit, to opt in, by an ideologically oriented small\ncorporation poses any threat of quid pro quo corruption\nor its appearance. Indeed, this documentary is the very\ndefinition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject\nof intense political interest that the First Amendment\nis there to guarantee.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, if the film were\ndistributed by General Motors, would your argument be\nthe same?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it wouldn't -- definitely\nwould not be the same because there are several aspects\nof the argument that we present. However, in one\nrespect, it would. A 90-minute documentary was not the\nsort of thing that the -- the BCRA -- the Congress was\nintended to prohibit. In fact, as the -- as the\nReporters Committee for -- for Freedom of Speech points\nout, the documentary is indistinguishable from other\nnews media commentary --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the point, then,\nof similarity is you would, whether it was offered by\nGeneral Motors or offered by -- by this Petitioner, in\neffect call for some qualification of the -- the general\nrule allowing limitations on corporate political\nactivity of the speech variety?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, we would, although it is a\nvery important factor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So how would we draw the\nline?\nMR. OLSON: Well, one of the reasons that --\none of the bases upon which you would draw the line is\nto look at the documentary -- the voluminous documentary\nrecord that the government cites and this Court cited in\nthe McConnell case as a justification for the\nrestrictions themselves. As --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would every -- in\neffect, every limitation on corporate speech or on\ncorporate expenditure and the nature of speech be\nsubject, then, to in effect this all-factor balancing\ntest?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think what I'm trying to\nsay is that what the -- what the Congress was concerned\nwith -- and Judge Kollar-Kotelly in the district court\nopinion that you considered in McConnell discusses this\non page 646 of her opinion -- that this sort of\ncommunication was not something that Congress intended\nto prohibit. You would look at, if Congress intended to\nprohibit 90-minutes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so your -- your\nargument then is there's something distinct about the\nspeech, which could be considered regardless of the\ncorporate form?\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's part of our\nargument, yes. It's not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that is the case, what\nis -- what is the answer to this? That -- that still is\ngoing to involve a -- a fairly complicated set of\nanalyses, probably in a lot of cases. Why is that\nnecessary or worthwhile to preserve First Amendment\nvalues when you could have done this with a PAC?\nMR. OLSON: Well, as this Court said in the\nWisconsin Right to Life case just a couple years ago,\nthat the PAC vehicle is burdensome and difficult.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. You've got\nreporting. You've got limitations on -- on corporate\ncontributions and so on, but in this case, for example,\nmost of your contributions, as I understand from the\nrecord, were individual. They weren't corporate. There\nwas one perhaps. There was some corporate contributions\n--\nMR. OLSON: Yes, on page 252 of the appendix\nand 251, it points out -- you're absolutely correct --\nthat 1 percent of the contributions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. OLSON: -- were from corporations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- was that\nestablished? I thought that the record was hardly made\nof the contributors to this film. I think there was\nsomething like $200,000 accounted for, and the film cost\n-- to get the Channel '08, whatever it was, to put it on\ncost over a million dollars?\nMR. OLSON: The government sent an\ninterrogatory, Justice Ginsburg, asking for the major\ncontributions with respect to this project, and the ones\nthat they sought -- the government sought what they\nthought was important; the answer to that interrogatory\nis at page 251a and 252a -- that the government was\nseeking information with respect to contributions at a\n$1,000 or more; 198,000 came from individuals. And, by\nthe way, the three largest contributors that are listed\non page 252 of the Joint Appendix are given credit in\nthe film itself. So there's no effort to -- to conceal\nthose individuals.\nSo that it's possible -- it's possible that\ncorporations throughout America were giving small\namounts of money to this. That record doesn't establish\none way or the other. What it does establish is what\nthe government felt was necessary for its case that the\nmajor contributors were individuals and not\ncorporations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have answered Justice\nSouter. I took your answer to be the following: That\nif the corporation had paid -- paid for a program and\nthe program was 90 minutes which said vote for Smith,\nvote for Smith over and over -- that's the program --\nthat you concede that the government could ban this\nunder the Act.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is difficult --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't think they would.\nWe agree. It's an imaginary hypothetical. But, in\nfact, if they did have 90 minutes of vote for Smith or\nvote against Jones, you concede for purposes of this\nargument that the government can ban it. Is that bright\nor not?\nMR. OLSON: If -- not by this organization.\nWe think that if it's a small, nonprofit organization,\nwhich is very much like the Massachusetts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. So one of your\narguments is this is a special corporation. You can't.\nNow suppose it's General Motors. Can they?\nMR. OLSON: Well, General Motors may be\nsmaller than the client that we are representing.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would just like to get --\nI want to get an answer to the question.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I think that's a big step.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, in my question\nthat I'm driving towards is: Since General Motors can\nin your view be forbidden to have our film of 90 minutes\nvote for Smith, vote for Smith, vote for Smith, or vote\nagainst Jones, vote against Jones, vote against Jones,\nhow is this film, which I saw -- it is not a musical\ncomedy. What --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- how does this film\nvary from my example, and why does the variance make a\ndifference?\nMR. OLSON: The difference is: It's exactly\nwhat the Court was describing in Wisconsin Right To\nLife. It is a 90 -- it is -- it informs and educates,\nwhich is what the Court said, or the Chief Justice's\nopinion, the controlling opinion said, was the mark of\nan issue communication. And as this Court said --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I thought you\nconceded in the -- at least as I read your reply brief,\nthat you were no longer saying this is about an issue\nunrelated to any election. I thought you said that this\nwas a 90-minute movie \"concerning the qualifications,\ncharacter, and fitness of a candidate for the Nation's\nhighest office.\" And that's just what Wisconsin Right\nto Life was not. It was not about the character,\nqualifications, and fitness of either of the Senators.\nMR. OLSON: What the -- what the Court said\nin Wisconsin Right to Life was that the distinction\nbetween an issue -- issue advocacy and campaign advocacy\ndissolves upon practical application. This is exactly\nwhat the Court was talking about there. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't the Court\nthere say this is not about character, qualifications,\nand fitness?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it did, Justice Ginsburg,\nbut what my point is: That there isn't just two boxes\nin the world of communications about public issues, one\nbox for so-called issues and one box for campaign\nadvocacy. That's what I think the Court meant when it\nsaid, not just in Wisconsin Right to Life but in earlier\ncases, that the distinction dissolves upon application.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- how many boxes we have?\nDoesn't this one fall into campaign advocacy? I mean\nI've got the government's brief open at -- open at pages\n18 and 19 with the quotations: She will lie about\nanything. She is deceitful. She is ruthless, cunning,\ndishonest, do anything for power, will speak\ndishonestly, reckless, a congenital liar, sorely lacking\nin qualifications, not qualified as commander in chief.\nI mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy.\nMR. OLSON: It -- what -- what the court was\ntalking about and as Justice Kollar-Kotelly talked about\nis broadcast advertising, these 10-minute -- 10-second,\n30-second, 60-second bursts of communication that are --\nthat are the influence in elections.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to get the answer to\nwhat I was asking.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it seems to me,\nthe answer to Justice Breyer's question: This is a\ndon't vote for Jones.\nMR. OLSON: This is a long discussion of the\nrecord, qualifications, history, and conduct of someone\nwho is in the political arena, a person who already\nholds public office, who now holds a different public\noffice, who, yes, at that point, Justice Souter, was\nrunning for office. But the fact is that what could the\nindividual making a -- as I said, the Reporters\nCommittee for the Right to Life said this is\nindistinguishable from something that is on the public\nmedia every day, a long discussion. It might be -- what\nyou're suggesting is that unless it's somehow\nevenhanded, unless it somehow says -- which would be\nviewpoint discrimination or prevention of viewpoints,\nwhich is the safe harbor that the government has written\ninto its so-called safe harbor, if you don't have a\npoint of view, you can go ahead and express it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't -- that\nisn't the suggestion. The suggestion I was going to, or\ntrying to get to, is we know you can't just say vote\nagainst Smith, vote against Smith, vote against Smith.\nNow, I wanted to know the difference between that and a\nfilm that picks out bad things that people did -- no\ngood ones, just bad ones the candidate did. And then we\nhave another film that picks out just good things\ncandidates do. And so candidates run films that show\nthe good things they do, and then someone else shows the\nbad things they do.\nNow, why is that not the same as vote\nagainst Smith? Though I grant you, it's more\nintelligent. It's more informative. It's even better\nelectioneering. So we're after electioneering. Why\ndoesn't that fall within the forbidden category?\nMR. OLSON: The government has the burden to\nprove -- and there's a compelling governmental interest\nnarrowly tailored, Justice Breyer, because all kinds of\nthings of the type that you're talking about are\npermissible if your name is General Motors -- I, mean if\nyour name is General Electric rather than General\nMotors, if your name is Disney, if your name is George\nSoros, if your name is National Public Radio.\nWhat you're suggesting is that a long\ndiscussion of facts, record, history, interviews,\ndocumentation, and that sort of thing, if it's all\nnegative, it can be prohibited by -- and it's a felony.\nYou can go to jail for 5 years for sharing that\ninformation with the American public, or if it's all\nfavorable, you can go to jail. But if you did half and\nhalf, you couldn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I guess it's the same\nas if you were to say, you know, I think Smith is a\ngreat guy. That's all. I'm sharing information. And\nwhat I don't see is if you agree that we could ban the\ncommercial that says, I see Smith is a great guy, why is\nit any different to supplement that with the five best\nthings that Smith ever did?\nMR. OLSON: Because -- because of the First\nAmendment. Congress shall make no law abridging the\nfreedom of speech. When -- when the government had --\nwhen this Court has permitted that to happen, it has\nonly done it in the most narrow circumstances for a\ncompelling governmental interest.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I guess what --\nwhat Justice Breyer is asking is -- I have the same\nquestion. If we concede -- and at the end of the day\nyou might not concede this, but if we take this as a\nbeginning point, that a short, 30-second, 1-minute\ncampaign ad can be regulated, you want me to write an\nopinion and say, well, if it's 90 minutes, then that's\ndifferent. I -- it seems to me that you can make the\nargument that 90 -- that 90 minutes is much more\npowerful in support or in opposition to a candidate.\nThat's I -- that's the thrust of the questioning.\nMR. OLSON: I understand that, Justice\nKennedy, and it is difficult. But let me say that the\nrecord that you were considering in McConnell -- and I\nspecifically invite, as I did before, page -- the\nCourt's attention to 646 of this -- of the district\ncourt's opinion, which specifically said the government\nand Congress was concerned about these short, punchy ads\nthat you have no choice about seeing, and not concerned\nabout a thorough recitation of facts or things that you\nwould have to make an affirmative decision to opt into.\nAnd the reason why it's difficult is that we\nare talking about an infinite variety of ability of\npeople to speak about things that matter more to them\nthan anything else, who will be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think you\nhave kind of shifted your focus here from the difference\nbetween a 10-second ad and a 90-minute presentation and\nhow that presentation is received, whether it's over the\nnormal airwaves or on this Video On Demand. What --\nwhat is the distinction between the 10-second commercial\nand, say, the 90-minute infomercial?\nMR. OLSON: The thing that I think it's --\nit's pointed out specifically in your opinion,\ncontrolling opinion for Wisconsin Right To Life. That\nwhich informs and educates and may seek to persuade is\nsomething that is -- is on the line of being\npermissible. The government hasn't established -- never\ndid try to establish -- I did shift -- I didn't shift\nbut all of these are factors. It's who's doing the\nspeaking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can educate in 30\nseconds. I mean in -- in a 30-second ad you present\njust one of these criticisms of the candidate instead of\nlumping all of them together for 90 minutes.\nMR. OLSON: The point, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that education?\nMR. OLSON: The point, I think, Justice\nScalia, is, yes, you can educate in 10 seconds, you can\neducate in 30 seconds. But what -- what the Court was\ntrying to do -- what Congress was trying to do is get at\nthe things that were most potentially corruptive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, are you making a\nstatutory argument now or a constitutional argument?\nWhat Congress was trying to do has nothing to do, it\nseems to me, with the constitutional point you're\narguing.\nMR. OLSON: The government makes the point\nthat it established a voluminous record of evidence.\nBoth Congress had before it and this Court had before it\na voluminous volume of evidence because it had the\nburden of proving that something was really bad with\nthese -- these types of advertisements.\nAnd what the -- what the Court did is say,\nwell, okay -- in McConnell -- yes, there is a\nsubstantial burden that the government met that these\ntypes of communications -- not the Internet, not books,\nnot other types of things -- are really bad enough that\nthe government could pick those out, and it has narrowly\ntailored its solution to that problem by prohibiting\nthose things. And the government talks about today in\nits brief the things that Congress felt were the most\nacute problems. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're making a\nstatutory argument now?\nMR. OLSON: I'm making a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that this --\nthis isn't covered by it.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I am making a statutory\nargument in the sense that you will construe the statute\nin the ways that doesn't violate the Constitution. The\nConstitution, as -- as the Court said in Wisconsin Right\nto Life, gives ties to the speaker, errs on the side of\npermitting the speech, not prohibiting the speech. And\nso all those things may be statutory arguments, Justice\nScalia, but they are also constitutional arguments.\nAnd in response to every one of these\nquestions, the government has the burden of proving this\nsort of speech, which the Reporters say is\nindistinguishable, than the kind of information that\nnews media puts out all the time, not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this argument\ndoesn't depend upon whether this is properly\ncharacterized as express -- the functional equivalent of\nexpress advocacy? Your contention is that even if it\nis, that because it wasn't in the factual record in\nMcConnell or before Congress, it is a type of functional\n-- it is a type of express advocacy that's not covered\nby the Act?\nMR. OLSON: I don't think, Chief Justice\nRoberts, that it is remotely the functional equivalent\nof express advocacy, because what the Court and Congress\nwas thinking about with respect to express advocacy was\nshort, punchy things that you have no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nthat's why I'm trying to figure out, the distinction in\nyour argument. I mean, if we think that this is the\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy, are you\ncontending that it is nonetheless not covered in light\nof the record before the Court in McConnell and before\nCongress?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I think I would agree with\nthat, but I would also say that the -- the idea, the\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy is the very\nmagic word problem that this Court has struggled with in\nMcConnell and in -- in each of the cases.\nI would -- I said at the beginning that this\nis an incomprehensible prohibition, and I -- and my -- I\nthink that's demonstrated by the fact that since 2003\nthis Court has issued something close to 500 pages of\nopinions interpreting and trying to apply the First\nAmendment to Federal election law. And I counted 22\nseparate opinions from the Justices of this Court\nattempting to -- in just the last 6 years, attempting to\nfigure out what this statute means, how it can be\ninterpreted. In fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nit's mandatory appellate jurisdiction. I mean, you\ndon't have a choice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: There would be fewer -- there\nwould be fewer opinions. I guess my point is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And maybe those cases\npresented more difficult issues than this one.\nMR. OLSON: I think this presents a much\neasier issue, Justice Stevens, because this is the type\nof -- if there is anything that the First Amendment is\nintended to protect in the context of elections that are\noccurring -- which, by the way, occur 4 years running,\nbut the last election, presidential election occurred\nthroughout the entire 2008 -- if the American people\nneed to have that kind of information. And the statute\nis both overly broad because if it were a hotel ad, if\nit was a hotel saying Senator Clinton stayed here or\nSenator McCain stayed here, it would be prohibited\nbecause it was a hotel saying so, even though it really\nhad nothing to do with the election. If it is -- but\nit's -- if it's a corporation that put together an\nanalysis of the earmark positions of each of the\nsenatorial candidates -- most all of the candidates were\nrunning from the Senate, they all had this -- these\nissues where they may have voted or not against\nearmarks, that would --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Olson, this is\n-- I think you were right in conceding at the beginning,\nthis is not like the speech involved in Wisconsin Right\nto Life. This is targeted to a specific candidate for a\nspecific office to be shown on a channel that says\nElection '08, that tells the viewer over and over again\nwhat, just for example, it concludes with these are\nthings worth remembering before you go in potentially to\nvote for Hillary Clinton.\nNow, if that isn't an appeal to voters, I\ncan't imagine what is.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I\nunderstand your point. There is much in there that if\nyou saw it, you would form an opinion with respect to\nhow you might want to vote. You might -- it might form\na different -- you might form all kinds of different\nopinions.\nBut it was -- it was an analysis of the\nbackground record and history and qualifications of\nsomeone running for president, of course I concede that.\nBut what is the -- what is the maker of a movie to take\nout in order to prevent that from happening?\nI understand from some of the questions that\nif it was more evenhanded -- if it said, well, this\ncandidate did this, but this candidate did this or this\ncandidate was born in the Panama Canal Zone and this\ncandidate was born in Hawaii, and that affects whether\nor not they are natural-born citizens or not, and it was\nmore evenhanded, would that then not be a felony?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As you -- as you've said\nyourself, as you pointed out, there -- there is a point\nat which there is no nonporous border between issue\ndiscussion and candidate discussion. But I think the --\nthe problem that -- that Justice Ginsburg is having, I'm\nhaving, and others is that it does not seem to me that\nwith the quotations we're dealing with here, as Justice\nBreyer said, it's not a musical comedy. I think we --\nwe have no choice, really, but to say this is not issue\nadvocacy; this is express advocacy saying don't vote for\nthis person.\nAnd if that is a fair characterization, the\ndifference between 90 minutes and 1 minute, either for\nstatutory purposes or constitutional purposes, is a\ndistinction that I just cannot follow.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is a distinction that\nCongress was concerned about, and it's a distinction\nthat's all over the record --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You say that. Why --\nwhat -- what is your basis for saying that Congress is\n-- is less concerned with 90 minutes of don't vote for\nClinton than it was with 60 seconds of don't vote?\nMR. OLSON: Because -- because the record in\nCongress and the record in this Court is that those\ntypes of advertisements were more effective because they\ncame into your home --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They are the characteristic\nadvertisement. There is no question about that. That\nis the paradigm case. I agree with you. But I don't\nsee how you -- you then leap-frog from saying -- from\nsaying that is the paradigm case to saying that this\nnever covers anything but the paradigm case when the\nonly distinction is time.\nMR. OLSON: The -- the -- I think the --\nwhat -- what Congress was concerned about is the most\nsevere and the most acute problem, as Justice\nKollar-Kotelly said, which everyone acknowledges was the\nproblem Congress sought to address with BCRA. It's not\njust that, however.\nThe point that you just made about a\nnonporous border, it is the government's responsibility\nto the extent that you can't figure out how evenhanded\nyou must be or what you must take out of your\ncommunication in order not to go to jail for airing it,\nit is the functional equivalent -- if everything is the\nfunctional equivalent that mentions a candidate during\nan election, which is what the government says, it's the\nfunctional equivalent of a prior restraint, because you\ndon't dare --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, I -- I think\nwe've been led astray by -- by the constant reference to\nwhat Congress intended. As I understood your point, it\nwas not -- it was not that, well, one is covered by the\nstatute and the other isn't, but it is that one is\ncovered by the Constitution and the other isn't. And it\nmay well be that -- that the kind of speech that is\nreflected in a serious 90-minute documentary is entitled\nto greater constitutional protection. And it may well\nbe that the kind of speech that is not only offered but\ninvited by the listener is entitled to -- is entitled to\nheightened First Amendment scrutiny, which is -- which\nis what this is since you have pay for view --\nMR. OLSON: I agree with that completely,\nJustice Scalia.\nMr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life\ndidn't just use the term \"functional equivalent of\nexpress advocacy\"; it explained what that term meant,\nand on page 2667 of volume 127 of the Supreme Court\nReporter, the plurality or the lead opinion stated: \"In\nlight of these considerations, a Court should find that\nan ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy\nonly if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable\ninterpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or\nagainst a specific candidate.\"\nSo the functional equivalence test doesn't\ndepend on the length of the advertisement or the medium\nin which the advertisement --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the length of\nthe advertisements wasn't remotely at issue in either\nWashington Right to Life or McConnell or before Congress\nwhen they passed this law.\nMR. STEWART: Well, certainly Congress\nconsidered a variety of evidence bearing on campaign\npractices that had been undertaken in the past. They\nwere primarily -- most of the examples on which they\nfocused were 30-second and 60-second advertisements. It\nhad certainly been a recurring phenomenon in the past\nthat candidates would air, for instance, 30-minute\ninfomercials.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any discussion\neither in McConnell -- any citation either in McConnell\nor the Congressional Record to those types of\ndocumentaries?\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure about the\ncitation; I'm not aware of any citation in McConnell or\nthe Congressional Record, but it was certainly a known\nphenomenon. And I think the real --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, how do\nwe know it was a known phenomenon in terms of the\nevolution of the statute and the decision of this Court\nupholding it? There is no reference to it.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the real -- I think the\nreal key to ascertaining Congress's intent is to look to\nthe definition of electioneering communication that\nCongress enacted into the statute, and that definition\nrequires that the communication be a broadcast, cable or\nsatellite communication in order to qualify as an\nelectioneering communication, and that it be aired\nwithin a certain proximity to a Federal election, and\nthat in the case of an --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so if Wal-Mart\nairs an advertisement that says we have candidate action\nfigures for sale, come buy them, that counts as an\nelectioneering communication?\nMR. STEWART: If it's aired in the right\nplace at the right time, that would be covered. Now,\nunder this Court's decision in Wisconsin Right to Life\nit would be unconstitutional as applied to those\nadvertisements, because those advertisements certainly\nwould be susceptible of a reasonable construction of the\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the\nConstitution required Congress to draw the line where it\ndid, limiting this to broadcast and cable and so forth?\nWhat's your answer to Mr. Olson's point that there isn't\nany constitutional difference between the distribution\nof this movie on video demand and providing access on\nthe Internet, providing DVDs, either through a\ncommercial service or maybe in a public library,\nproviding the same thing in a book? Would the\nConstitution permit the restriction of all of those as\nwell?\nMR. STEWART: I think the -- the\nConstitution would have permitted Congress to apply the\nelectioneering communication restrictions to the extent\nthat they were otherwise constitutional under Wisconsin\nRight to Life. Those could have been applied to\nadditional media as well. And it's worth remembering\nthat the preexisting Federal Election Campaign Act\nrestrictions on corporate electioneering which have been\nlimited by this Court's decisions to express advocacy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's pretty incredible.\nYou think that if -- if a book was published, a campaign\nbiography that was the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy, that could be banned?\nMR. STEWART: I'm not saying it could be\nbanned. I'm saying that Congress could prohibit the use\nof corporate treasury funds and could require a\ncorporation to publish it using its --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, most publishers are\ncorporations. And a publisher that is a corporation\ncould be prohibited from selling a book?\nMR. STEWART: Well, of course the statute\ncontains its own media exemption or media --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm not asking what the\nstatute says. The government's position is that the\nFirst Amendment allows the banning of a book if it's\npublished by a corporation?\nMR. STEWART: Because the First Amendment\nrefers both to freedom of speech and of the press, there\nwould be a potential argument that media corporations,\nthe institutional press, would have a greater First\nAmendment right. That question is obviously not\npresented here. But the other two things --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it were an\nadvocacy organization that had a book. Your position is\nthat under the Constitution, the advertising for this\nbook or the sale for the book itself could be prohibited\nwithin the 60 -- 90-day period -- the 60 -- the 30-day\nperiod?\nMR. STEWART: If the book contained the\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy. That is, if\nit was subject to no reasonable interpretation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose it could\neven, is it the Kindle where you can read a book? I\ntake it that's from a satellite. So the existing\nstatute would probably prohibit that under your view?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the statute applies to\ncable, satellite, and broadcast communications. And the\nCourt in McConnell has addressed the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to make it clear,\nit's the government's position that under the statute,\nif this kindle device where you can read a book which is\ncampaign advocacy, within the 60-30 day period, if it\ncomes from a satellite, it's under -- it can be\nprohibited under the Constitution and perhaps under this\nstatute?\nMR. STEWART: It -- it can't be prohibited,\nbut a corporation could be barred from using its general\ntreasury funds to publish the book and could be required\nto use -- to raise funds to publish the book using its\nPAC.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it has one name,\none use of the candidate's name, it would be covered,\ncorrect?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a 500-page\nbook, and at the end it says, and so vote for X, the\ngovernment could ban that?\nMR. STEWART: Well, if it says vote for X,\nit would be express advocacy and it would be covered by\nthe pre-existing Federal Election Campaign Act\nprovision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout under the Constitution, what we've been\ndiscussing, if it's a book.\nMR. STEWART: If it's a book and it is\nproduced -- again, to leave -- to leave to one side the\nquestion of.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right.\nForget the --\nMR. STEWART: -- possible media exemption,\nif you had Citizens United or General Motors using\ngeneral treasury funds to publish a book that said at\nthe outset, for instance, Hillary Clinton's election\nwould be a disaster for this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take my\nhypothetical. It doesn't say at the outset. It funds\n-- here is -- whatever it is, this is a discussion of\nthe American political system, and at the end it says\nvote for X.\nMR. STEWART: Yes, our position would be\nthat the corporation could be required to use PAC funds\nrather than general treasury funds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they didn't,\nyou could ban it?\nMR. STEWART: If they didn't, we could\nprohibit the publication of the book using the corporate\ntreasury funds.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wonder if that's -- I\nmean, I take it the answer to the question, can the\ngovernment ban labor unions from saying we love this\nperson, the corporations, we love them, the\nenvironmentalists saying we love them, is of course the\ngovernment can't ban that. The only question is, who's\npaying for it. And they can make a determination of how\nmuch money the payors can pay, but you can't ban it.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's\ncorrect, then I take it the interesting question here\nwould be -- I don't know if it arises in this case --\nsuppose there were a kind of campaign literature or --\nor advocacy that either a corporation had to pay for it,\nit couldn't pay for it through the PAC, because for some\nreason -- I don't know, the PAC -- and there's no other\nway of getting it to the public -- that would raise a\nConstitutional question, wouldn't it?\nMR. STEWART: It would raise a\nConstitutional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that present in this\ncase?\nMR. STEWART: It's not present in this case.\nI don't think it would raise a difficult constitutional\nquestion because presumably if the reason the\ncorporation couldn't do it through the PAC -- the only\nreason I could think of is that it couldn't find\nPAC-eligible donors who were willing to contribute for\nthis speech. And if that's the case, the corporation\nwould -- could still be forbidden to use its general\ntreasury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know about that.\nBut I guess I would be worried if in fact there was some\nmaterial that couldn't get through to the public. I\nwould be very worried. But I don't think I have to\nworry about that in this case, do I?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct, both because\nthe question isn't presented here and because\nCongress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but if we accept\nyour constitutional argument, we're establishing a\nprecedent that you yourself say would extend to banning\nthe book, assuming a particular person pays for it.\nMR. STEWART: I think the Court has already\nheld in, both in Austin and in McConnell, that Congress\ncan or that Congress or State legislatures can prohibit\nthe use of corporate treasury funds for express\nadvocacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To write a book, to\npay for somebody to write a book?\nMR. STEWART: Well, in MCFL, for instance,\nthe communication was not a book, but it was a\nnewsletter, it was written material; and the Court held\nthis was express advocacy for which the use of corporate\ntreasury funds would ordinarily be banned. It held that\nbecause of the distinctive characteristics of the\nparticular corporation at issue in that case, MCFL was\nentitled to a constitutional exemption. But I think the\nclear thrust of MCFL is that the publication and\ndissemination of a newsletter containing express\nadvocacy could ordinarily be banned with respect to the\nuse of corporate treasury funds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just a -- I\nsuppose a sign held up in Lafayette Park saying vote for\nso and so. Under your theory of the Constitution, the\nprohibition of that would be constitutional?\nMR. STEWART: Again, I do want to make clear\nthat if by prohibition you mean ban on the use of\ncorporate treasury funds, then, yes, I think it's\nabsolutely clear under Austin, under McConnell that the\nuse of corporate treasury funds could be banned if\nGeneral Motors, for instance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you -- you get\naround the fact that this would extend to any publishing\ncorporation by saying that there is a media exemption\nbecause the Constitution guarantees not only freedom of\nspeech but also of the press?\nMR. STEWART: Well, there is always --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But does \"the press\" mean\nthe media in that Constitutional provision? You think\nin 1791 there were -- there were people running around\nwith fedoras that had press -- little press tickets in\nit, \"Press\"? Is that what \"press\" means in the\nConstitution? Doesn't it cover the Xerox machine?\nDoesn't it cover the right of any individual to -- to\nwrite, to publish?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think the difficult\nConstitutional question of whether the general\nrestrictions on use of corporate treasury funds for\nelectioneering can constitutionally be applied to media\ncorporations has never had to be addressed because the\nstatutes that this Court has reviewed have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see any\nreason why it wouldn't. I'm saying there's no basis in\nthe text of the Constitution for exempting press in the\nsense of, what, the Fifth Estate?\nMR. STEWART: In -- in any event, the only\nquestion this Court would potentially need to decide in\nthis case is whether the exemption for media companies\ncreates a disuniformity that itself renders the statute\nunconstitutional, and the Court has already addressed\nthat question in McConnell. The claim was made that\nbecause media corporations were exempt, there was\ninequality of treatment as between those and other\ncorporations. And Congress said no, Congress -- I mean,\nthis Court said no, Congress can protect the interests\nof the media and of the public in receiving information\nby drawing that line. With respect to your --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: To point out how far your\nargument would go, what if a labor union paid and\noffered to write a book advocating the election of A or\nthe defeat of B? And after the manuscript was prepared,\nthey then went to a commercial publisher, and they go to\nRandom House. Random House said, yes, we will publish\nthat. Can the distribution of that be in effect subject\nto the electioneering ban because of the initial labor\nunion investment?\nMR. STEWART: Well, exactly what the remedy\nwould be, whether there would be a basis for suppressing\nthe distribution of the book, I'm not sure. I think\nit's clear under --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, does it come within\nelectioneering because of the initial subvention to the\nauthor?\nMR. STEWART: It wouldn't be an\nelectioneering communication under BCRA because BCRA\nwouldn't apply to the print media. Now, it would\npotentially be covered by the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We're -- we're talking\nabout how far the constitutional ban could go, and we're\ntalking about books.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- we would certainly\ntake the position that if the labor union used its\ntreasury funds to pay an author to produce a book that\nwould constitute express advocacy, that that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the book was then taken\nover as a commercial venture by Random House?\nMR. STEWART: The labor union's conduct\nwould be prohibited. The question of whether the book\nthat had already been --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but prohibition only\ncomes when we get to the electioneering stage.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: The question whether the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So for the -- for the labor\nunion simply to -- to hire -- is there -- is there an\noutright violation when the labor union -- I guess this\nis a statutory question: Is there an outright violation\nwhen the labor union comes up with the original\nsubvention?\nMR. STEWART: I guess I would have to study\nthe Federal Election Campaign Act provisions more\nclosely to see whether they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume for the sake\nof argument that they would not be. The subvention is\nmade, the manuscript is prepared, Random House then\npublishes it, and there is a distribution within the --\nwhat is it -- the 60-day period. Is the -- is the\noriginal subvention (a) enough to bring it within the\nprohibition on the electioneering communication, and (b)\nis that constitutional?\nMR. STEWART: Well, again, it wouldn't\nqualify as an electioneering communication under BCRA\nbecause that statutory definition only applies --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're right. I\nstand corrected. If the statute covered that as well,\nif the statute covered the book as well.\nMR. STEWART: I think the use of labor union\nfunds, as part of the overall enterprise of writing and\nthen publishing the book, would be covered.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would be enough to\nbring it in, and --\nMR. STEWART: And I -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the Constitution?\nMR. STEWART: And I think it would be\nconstitutional to forbid the labor union to do that.\nWhether it would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, just to\nfollow up, even if there's one clause in one sentence in\nthe 600-page book that says, in light of the history of\nthe labor movement, you should be careful about\ncandidates like John Doe who aren't committed to it?\nMR. STEWART: Well, whether in the context\nof a 600-page book that would be sufficient to make the\nbook either an electioneering communication or express\nadvocacy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it does by its\nterms, doesn't it? Published within 60 days. It\nmentions a candidate for office. What other\nqualification is there?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think the Court has\nalready crossed that bridge in Wisconsin Right to Life\nby saying the statute could constitutionally be applied\nonly if it were the functional equivalent of express\nadvocacy, and -- so that would be the -- and we accept\nthat constitutional holding. That would be the relevant\nconstitutional question.\nI wanted to return for a second, Justice\nAlito, to a question you asked about the purported\ninterchangeability of the Internet and television. And\nit's certainly true that -- that a growing number of\npeople are coming to experience those media as\nessentially interchangeable, but there are still a lot\nof people either who don't have computers at all or who\nuse their televisions and their computers for\nfundamentally different purposes. And I think it's\nevident that Citizens United perceived the two media to\nbe distinct because it was willing to pay $1.2 million\nto a cable service in order to have the film made\navailable on -- by Video On Demand, when Citizens United\ncould have posted the film on its own Web site, posted\nthe film on YouTube and could have avoided both the need\nto make the payment and the potential applicability of\nthe electioneering communications provisions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they had done either of\nthe things you just mentioned, putting it on its Web\nsite or putting it on YouTube, your position would be\nthat the Constitution would permit the prohibition of\nthat during the period prior to the primary or the\nelection?\nMR. STEWART: Our position is not that the\nConstitution would permit it. Our position is that BCRA\nwouldn't prohibit it because those are not covered\nmedia. Now --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would the Constitution -- if\n-- if BCRA -- if Congress in the next act covered that\nin light of advances in the Internet, would the\nConstitution permit that?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, I mean, the Court in\nMcConnell upheld on the electioneering communications on\ntheir face, and this Court -- a majority of this Court\nin Wisconsin Right to Life said those provisions are\nconstitutional as applied --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm a little\ndisoriented here, Mr. Stewart. We are dealing with a\nconstitutional provision, are we not, the one that I\nremember which says Congress shall make no law abridging\nthe freedom of the press? That's what we're\ninterpreting here?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: But, again, this -- the Court\nobviously has grappled in the past with the question of\nhow to apply that provision to use of corporate treasury\nfunds either for express electoral advocacy or its\nfunctional equivalent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in this case, Mr.\nStewart, I take it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that\nyou think the distinction the Petitioner draws between\nthe 90-minute film and the -- and the short 30-second or\n1-minute ad is a baseless distinction?\nMR. STEWART: It is of no constitutional\nsignificance. Congress certainly could have drafted the\nelectioneering communication definition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if -- if we think that\nthe application of this to a 90-minute film is\nunconstitutional, then the whole statute should fall\nunder your view --\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because there's no\ndistinction between the two?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think the Court has\ntwice upheld the statute as applied to communications\nthat are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.\nSo --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm -- I'm saying if\nwe -- if we think that this is -- that this film is\nprotected, and you say there's no difference between the\nfilm and the ad, then the whole statute must be declared\n--\nMR. STEWART: It would depend on the ground\nunder which you reached the conclusion that the film was\nprotected. If you disagreed with our submission and\nsaid there is a constitutional difference between\n90-minute films and 60-second advertisements, then\nobviously you could draw that constitutional line. If\nyou concluded that they're all the same but they're all\nprotected, then obviously we would lose both cases.\nBut, again, you would have to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you want us to say\nthey're both the same? You want -- you argue that\nthey're both the same.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. Now, it may\nbe the case -- it may be rarer to find a 90-minute film\nthat is so unrelenting in its praise or criticism of a\nparticular candidate that it will be subject to no\nreasonable interpretation other than to vote for or\nagainst that person, but when you have that, as I think\nwe do here, there's no constitutional distinction\nbetween the 90-minute film and the 60-second\nadvertisement.\nAnd we would stress with respect to the film\nthat what makes this, in our view, an easy case is not\nsimply that the film repeatedly criticizes Hillary\nClinton's character and integrity. The clincher is that\nthe film repeatedly links Senator Clinton's purported\ncharacter flaws to her qualifications for president.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But just from the\nstandpoint of literature, that's very odd. Suppose you\nhave a film which is quite moving with scenery and music\nand magnificent acting, and the subtle message that may\nbe far more effective in advocating, and everyone knows\nthat. Everyone knows that.\nMR. STEWART: That's essentially the\nargument that a majority of this Court rejected in\nWisconsin Right to Life. That is, that was part of the\nbasis on which Congress enacted BCRA, part of the reason\nthat it wanted to establish a purely objective test\nbased on naming an identified candidate and airing in\nproximity to the election. Congress recognized that in\nmany situations the most effective advocacy is the\nsubtler advocacy.\nAnd the lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to\nLife said -- I think recognized -- that it will\nforeseeably be the case that corporations will craft\nadvertisements that are, in fact, intended to influence\nfederal elections, but that are sufficiently subtle and\nopaque that they won't constitute the functional\nequivalent of express advocacy. And -- and the lead\nopinion simply said that's the price that we have to pay\nin order to ensure that an unduly broad range of\ncorporate speech is not restricted.\nAnd we accept that holding, but in this case\nwhat we have, people may feel -- it is not subtle.\nPeople may feel that because it's not subtle, it's less\nlikely to be effective. But the Court's decisions have\nnever drawn a Constitutional line between advocacy that\nis likely to be effective and advocacy that is not.\nClearly, if this were express advocacy -- I\nthink clearly, if the -- the narrator had said in the\nfirst 30 seconds of the film: A Hillary Clinton\npresidency would pose a danger to the country, it's\nimportant for all citizens to vote against Hillary\nClinton, what follows are extended analyses of episodes\nin her past that reflect Hillary Clinton's unsuitability\nfor that office. And if then in the last 89 minutes of\nthe film the film-maker had made no overt reference to\nthe upcoming election but had simply given a negative\nportrayal of Hillary Clinton, the person, that would be\nexpress advocacy that would be proscribable even without\nregard to BCRA. So that if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though that\ntype of case was never presented to the Court in\nMcConnell and was never presented to Congress when it\nconsidered BCRA?\nMR. STEWART: Well, it's not clear whether\nit was presented to Congress or not. It is certainly\ntrue that it was not the focus of congressional\nattention. But we know from the definition of\n\"electioneering communication\" what attributes Congress\nwanted to make relevant to the coverage determination.\nThat is, it chose to restrict this to broadcast, cable,\nand satellite communications and to leave out the print\nmedia.\nIt chose to restrict it to advertisements or\nother communications that were aired within a specific\nproximity to the election. If it had been unconcerned\nwith communications over a certain length, it could\ncertainly have made that part of the statutory\ndefinition, but it chose not to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This film has been\ncompared to \"Fahrenheit 911,\" which had the pervasive\nmessage that President Bush was unsuited to be\nPresident. And so if that film had been financed out of\ncorporate -- corporations' general treasury funds and\nput on an election channel, that would similarly be\nbanned by the statute.\nMR. STEWART: I am afraid I am not familiar\nenough with that film to know whether it would have\nconstituted -- to -- to make an informed judgment about\nwhether that would have constituted the functional\nequivalent of express advocacy under Wisconsin Right to\nLife. And, of course, the \"electioneering\ncommunication\" definition would apply only if the film\nhad been broadcast within a specified proximity to a\nprimary or general election in -- in 2004. But I think\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, do you think\nthat there's a possibility that the First Amendment\ninterest is greater when what the government is trying\nto stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say\nsomething but also a hearer who wants to hear what the\nspeaker has to say?\nI mean what is somewhat different about this\ncase is that unlike over-the-air television you have a\nsituation where you only get this -- this message would\nonly air -- if somebody elects to hear it. So you\nreally have two interested people, the speaker and the\nlistener who wants to -- who wants to get this.\nIsn't that a somewhat heightened First\nAmendment interest than just over-the-air broadcasting\nof advertising which probably most listeners don't want\nto hear?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think -- I think the\n-- first of all, I think if we had tried to make the\nargument in McConnell that the BCRA provisions -- or --\nor in any other case that the BCRA provisions are\nconstitutional as applied to 30- or 60-second\nadvertisements because they are defensible means of\nprotecting listeners who, by hypothesis, don't want to\nhear the message in the form of a captive audience, I\ndon't think we would have gotten very far.\nI think it's certainly true that people have\na wide variation of attitudes towards campaign\nadvertisements. Some of them find them irritating, and,\nof course, they can hit the mute button or -- or leave\nthe room, or in the case of people who use TiVo or VCRs\ncan simply fast-forward through them.\nBut the whole premise of the congressional\nregulation and the whole premise of the corporations'\nwillingness to spend these massive amounts of money was\nthat enough people will be interested in the\nadvertisements that they will ultimately have an\nelectoral effect. And -- and so if you compare the--\nthe film to the advertisement, the advertisements in one\nsense you could say are a less effective mechanism\nbecause a lot of the people who reach them are unwilling\nlisteners or uninterested. But, on the other hand,\nthey're more effective because they reach more people.\nThe -- the flip side is that with a film you\nreach a smaller audience. It is certainly a more\nlimited group of people who will sign up to receive the\nmovie, but they are more interested in the message. I\ndon't think you can operate on the hypothesis that there\nis no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are talking about\neffectiveness. That wasn't my point. My point was the\n-- the seriousness of the First Amendment interest\nthat's being impinged where -- where you have both\nsomebody who wants to speak and someone who\naffirmatively wants to hear what he has to say, and the\ngovernment says, no, the two of you can't do this.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think it was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that's\nsomewhat worse than the government just saying to\nsomebody who wants to speak, no, you can't speak?\nMR. STEWART: I think it would be impossible\nto divide media up in that way based on the relative\nlikelihood that the recipient of the message will want\nto hear it. With respect to the -- the newsletters in\nMCFL, for instance, on the one -- in many instances they\nwere made available in public places. They were also\nmailed to a variety of people. You could say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am not saying will --\nwill want. I mean you have a situation here where you\ndon't get it unless you take the initiative to\nsubscribe. I'm not -- I'm not trying to figure out\nperson by person who wants to hear it and who doesn't.\nHere you have a medium in which somebody listens only if\nthat person wants to listen. So the -- the person\nspeaking wants to speak, and the person hearing wants to\nhear. It seems to me that's a stronger -- a stronger\nFirst Amendment interest.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the potential viewers in\nthis case had other alternatives if they wanted to see\nthe film. The film was available --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was -- was this issue\naired before the three-judge court, the distinction\nbetween, say, putting something on network TV and\nputting something on View On Demand that the listener\nhas to opt into?\nMR. STEWART: No. Indeed, the appellant in\nits complaint simply alleged affirmatively that his\ncommunication, if aired on DVD -- I mean if aired on VOD\nwould fall within the statutory definition of\n\"electioneering communication.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, before you\nrun out here, can I -- we haven't talked about the\ndisclosure requirements yet. You understand the test to\nbe that disclosure is not required if the names of those\ndisclosed -- if those people would be reasonably subject\nto reprisals?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. This Court\nhas recognized a constitutional exemption for two\ndisclosure requirements in cases where disclosure would\nhave a reasonable likelihood of leading to reprisal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we apply that\ntest? Is it inconceivable to you here that people\ncontributing to such a clearly anti-Clinton\nadvertisement are not going to be subject to reprisals?\nMR. STEWART: It seems unlikely that\nreprisals would occur because Citizens United -- this is\nobviously a new film, but it is of a piece with\ncommunications that Citizens United has engaged in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't work,\nbecause maybe they are going to change the nature of the\ndocumentaries that they fund, or somebody who gave a\ncontribution 5 years ago may decide, boy, I don't like\nwhat they're doing. I'm not going to give anymore. It\n--\nMR. STEWART: I guess the point I was going\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The fact that\nthey've disclosed in the past by compulsion of law\ndoesn't seem to answer the question of whether they are\ngoing to be subject to reprisals.\nMR. STEWART: Well, the point was that they\nhave disclosed in the past and have provided no evidence\nof reprisals. But I think the Court's decisions are\nclear that the burden is on the organization to show a\nreasonable likelihood, at least to -- to set the -- the\nball in motion. And the three-judge district court here\nsaid essentially what this Court said in McConnell with\nregard to a variety of plaintiffs who included Citizens\nUnited. That is, the Court said in McConnell and the\nthree-judge district court here that the plaintiffs had\nmade vague allegations of the general possibility of\nreprisals but had offered no concrete evidence that\ntheir own members --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to me\nyou are saying they've got to wait until the -- the\nhorse is out of the barn. You can only prove that you\nare reasonably subject to reprisals once you've been the\nvictim of reprisals.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think the alternatives\nwould be to say that disclosure requirements are\ncategorically unconstitutional, which would be an\nextreme departure from this Court's prior precedents or\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is saying --\nthat is saying that the test in McConnell is unworkable,\nif you say the alternative is to say they are\ncategorically --\nMR. STEWART: No. I mean I think the -- if\nthe -- we think the test in McConnell is workable; that\nis, leave it up to the organization to establish\nparticularized proof of a reasonable likelihood of\nreprisal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the Boy Scouts\nrun an ad and they're subject to disclosure, are the\ndonors who support that ad reasonably subject to\nreprisals.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, it would depend to\nsome extent on the characteristics of the ad. Probably\nnot, but I think if the alternative -- the two\nalternatives to the approach that the Court has taken\npreviously would be first to say these requirements are\nunconstitutional across the board; or the Court could\nsay as applied to organizations that engage in\nespecially intemperate or extreme speech of the sort\nthat might seem more likely to subject its proponents to\nreprisal, the disclosure requirements are categorically\nunconstitutional there.\nI think that would be itself an anomalous\nand counterproductive content-based distinction if the\nmere fact of the extremity of your speech insolated you\nfrom a constitutional -- from a requirement that would\notherwise be constitutional.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you sit down,\nany other? Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIt is unquestionably the case that the\ngovernment takes the position that any form of\nexpression, of expressive advocacy can be prohibited if\nit's done by a corporation. They say that on page 25\nand 26 of their brief, whether it be books, yard signs,\nnewspapers or -- or something printed -- in printed\nform, and it's only because Congress decided to address\nthe most acute problem that they haven't -- Congress\ndidn't go ahead and decide to do that, which we submit\nwould raise very, very serious constitutional questions,\nthe same type of constitutional questions that we are\ntalking about here, and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you about\nthat, but I thought what saves this -- many people\nthought it doesn't save it, it's -- whole thing's\nunconstitutional, whole Act. That isn't what I thought.\nSo what saves this is of course you can't prohibit all\nthose things. What you do is put limitations on the\npayment for them. See that there are other ways of\npaying through it, say as PACs, and then limit very\ncarefully the media that are affected and the times for\nwhich they are affected. Now, that's the statute\nreforms, and it's I think you need to address.\nMR. OLSON: Precisely, and the five justices\nin Wisconsin Right to Life made the fact that the PAC\nmechanism is burdensome and expensive. There are briefs\nin this case that demonstrate how much it is. And the\n-- and it's easier if you have lots of money, if you are\na big corporation, and you can afford a PAC or you\nalready have one. So it's a burden on the least capable\nof communicating.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, can I ask this\nquestion? Coming up with Wisconsin Right to Life, Judge\nRandolph thought the Chief Justice's opinion in that\ncase was controlling in that case. Do you think the\nChief Justice's opinion in that case correctly stated\nthe law?\nMR. OLSON: Of course.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: By definition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good answer.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure because\nyou're -- sometimes I don't think you're quite saying\nthat. But you agree that that opinion is correct?\nMR. OLSON: What I am saying is I -- we\naccept the Court's decision in Wisconsin Right to Life.\nTo the extent that the Court did not get to this type of\ndocumentary where the issue distinction, the false\ndichotomy between issues and candidates --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you accept the test\nthat was stated in his opinion?\nMR. OLSON: The -- the -- that no\nreasonable, not reasonably susceptible to any other\ninterpretation? Of course we do, Justice Stevens, but\nwe submit, a 90-minute discussion of various different\nissues are subject to all kinds of interpretation, and\nwhen you get a long exposition of issues that are\nimportant to the public and someone says -- the\ngovernment says, it's going to be -- well, we can\nprohibit it, and by the way, the government says, well,\nwhen we mean prohibit we mean, you just can't use your\nunion, or corporate treasury funds -- what they mean by\nprohibit is that they will put you in jail if you do it.\nThey will put you in jail for five years. That means\nprohibited.\nNow, what -- what we're getting at here,\nwhen -- when you're trying to make a 90-minute movie\nthat discusses things that are important to the public\nduring an election of the highest officer of the United\nStates, many people will interpret that as critical;\nmany people will interpret it as supportive; there are\nthings all over the lot. So it's subject to lots of\ndifferent interpretations.\nThe other thing is I heard Justice -- I mean\nMr. Stewart say that there's one minute at the\nbeginning, it doesn't happen -- it doesn't matter what\nthe other 89 minutes are; we can prohibit it. Well,\nwhere is the person making a movie who wants to address\nthe American public about something that's important to\nthe American public -- there isn't any question about\nthat -- where does he edit his movie? What cuts? What\ndoes he leave on the drawing -- on the cutting room\nfloor so that he won't have to go to bail -- jail? He\nwon't dare take a chance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
