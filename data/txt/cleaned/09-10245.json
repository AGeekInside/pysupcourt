HEFT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. HEFT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWilliam Freeman's plea agreement, his\npresentence report, and the sentencing record all show\nthat his term of imprisonment was based on a crack\ncocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the\nUnited States Sentencing Commission. This case asked\nthe Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing\ncourt accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule\n11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence\nreduction under section 3582(c)(2). We submit that\nMr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2)\nsentence reduction for several reasons.\nFirst, under the ordinary definition of\n\"based upon\" and in the context of this particular\nstatute, since the subsequently lowered guideline was\nused to determine Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment,\nthat term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently\nlowered guideline.\nSecond, the categorical ban on eligibility\nadopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the\nGovernment frustrates the purpose underlying section\n(c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the\nstatute, of the rule, and under the terms of\nMr. Freeman's plea agreement.\nThird, a record-based analysis that reviews\nthe plea agreement, the presentence report, and the\nsentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence\nis -- is best suited to correctly implement section\n(c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports\nthe conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed\nbased on a retroactively lowered guideline. The -- the\nSixth Circuit -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we issue an\nopinion and we analyze the statute's language, the\nstatute's purpose, and the statute's legislative\nhistory, would the opinion, the judgment be based on\neach of those or -- or not? In other words, does\neverything that goes into the final determination, would\nyou say that determination is based on each of those\nfactors individually?\nMR. HEFT: Yes. Certainly, it is based -\nthe determination certainly would be based on the\nstatute, Your Honor, but, as we've -- we've argued in\nour brief, we've asked the Court to take what we believe\nto be a record-based analysis and look at -- look at the\nrecord in this case, look at the terms of the plea\nagreement, look at the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. My -\nMR. HEFT: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think my question\ngoes in a different direction. This plea agreement, I\nthink, could be said to be based on the sentencing\nguidelines, but it is also based on the agreement. In\nother words, the combination of the two of them is what\ngives you the -- the sentence. So how can you say it's\nbased on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not\nhave been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement?\nProbably wouldn't have been.\nMR. HEFT: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't\nbelieve that that's mutually exclusive. A sentence can\nbe a guideline -- a sentence based on the guidelines,\nand it can be a sentence based on a C plea agreement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You quote one definition\nof -- the noun \"base\" in your brief uses a point from\nwhich something can develop, but you omit another\nstandard definition of the term, the principal element\nor -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its\nfundamental part. Why do you do that?\nMR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think\nthe dictionary definition that we've given encompasses\nthe definition that Your Honor has just -- just\ndescribed. The -- and our position -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's two -- there\nare two different definitions. One is something that\nprovides a starting point for analysis. The other is\nthe fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests.\nMR. HEFT: Well -- well, our contention\nis -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, if you use the latter\ndefinition, you have to decide which is more fundamental\nhere, the agreement between the parties or the\nsentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the\nstarting point for the analysis of the sentence by\nthe -- by the district court.\nMR. HEFT: Justice Alito, that's correct.\nThe guidelines certainly were the starting point, but\nthey were also the principal foundation of this\nagreement because what the agreement is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it enough for you\nto say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based\non, something could be based on several things, and one\nof them is the guidelines that then existed?\nMR. HEFT: Certainly. Certainly. And this\n-- this plea agreement reflects that it was based on the\nguidelines. If you -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then are you\nsaying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he\nwas caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns?\nWould you be willing to say that? In other words,\neverything -- your position, it seems to me, could be\ncriticized for saying everything that contributes to the\nfinal 106 months, that that sentence is based on every\none of those things -\nMR. HEFT: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which makes the\n-- which makes the statutory language largely mute on\nthis.\nMR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nsentence is based on a number of guidelines. Each -- no\nsentence is based on just one guideline, as this plea\nagreement reflects. It's based on a compilation of\nguidelines. It's -- it's based on the crack guideline,\nand as prior -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also\nbased on things that are not reflected in the\nguidelines. You've got a particular U.S. attorney who\nis more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes\nthan another one. The fact that you got the minimum\nunder the guidelines might be based on that. It's based\non the fact that this person felt he could handle 106\nmonths in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever\nthe top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline\ncalculation?\nMR. HEFT: It would have been 117 months.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he figures it's\nbetter for me to get -- it's based on his decision that\nI -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117.\nMR. HEFT: Well, certainly there are a\nnumber of factors that go into plea bargaining and\nnegotiation, but what -- I think what the court has to\nlook at is what is said in that plea agreement. And I\nthink, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out a minute ago, the\ndefinition of \"based on\" -- if a guideline sentence\nis -- if a sentence is based in part on the guidelines,\nthat would be adequate under the -- under section -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What sentence would\nhe have gotten if he were just sentenced under the\nguidelines, no plea agreement?\nMR. HEFT: He would have got the -- he would\nhave received the same sentence, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, how do\nwe know that?\nMR. HEFT: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The guidelines give\nyou a range. The judge might have given him 117 months.\nMR. HEFT: But -- but the plea agreement\nhere was for the bottom of the guidelines. The parties\ncalculated -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. I'm\nputting aside the plea agreement. What would he have\ngotten under the sentencing guidelines? We --we don't\nknow, right?\nMR. HEFT: It would have been left -\nleft -- well, assume it depends upon the nature of the\nplea, Your Honor. You're talking -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no plea. He\nis convicted at trial.\nMR. HEFT: It would be somewhere within that\nguideline range. That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how can you say\nthat this is based on the guideline range when the\nguideline range would not have been determinative?\nMR. HEFT: Well -- well, we're looking -\nwe're looking at the content of the plea agreement, Your\nHonor. The -- the plea agreement says -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I know, but my\nhypothetical is in a different context.\nMR. HEFT: But even -- even at that, Your\nHonor, if -- that sentence ultimately is going to be\nbased on a guideline range, and if that guideline range\nis subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\nthen the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could you -\nmaybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the\nsituations you don't think would be based on the\nguidelines.\nThe Solicitor General claims that since\nevery plea negotiation has to start with the guideline\ncalculation as a starting point for departure and/or\nconsideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea\nagreement would be considered based on. Are you taking\nthat position?\nMR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So I'll give\nyou a couple of examples, but you give me more. Would a\nplea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at\nall but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -\nis that based on the guideline?\nMR. HEFT: Possibly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And how\nabout one that departs or varies from the guideline, the\nrange, whichever word you want to use?\nMR. HEFT: Your Honor, the -- the Sentencing\nCommission, in 1B1.10 note 3, says that a\nbelow-guideline sentence can be based on the guidelines.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there -- the\nSolicitor General is right; there really isn't any\nsituation that you're claiming is not based on?\nMR. HEFT: Oh -- oh, no, Your Honor. There\nare -- there are C pleas.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me the examples.\nMR. HEFT: All right. Well, first of all,\nwe've cited cases in our brief where circuit courts have\ndetermined that a C plea was not based on the\nguidelines. But let me give you another example.\nLet's just assume the guideline range is\nsomething like 151 to 188 months, and then -- but the\nparties agree to a sentence of 60 months, and they do\nthat for several reasons. First of all, maybe the\ndefendant is elderly. Maybe the defendant has serious\nmedical conditions. Maybe the defendant has -- was\nsexually abused as a child. If those are the factors,\nif that's the reason why the defendant got that -\nreceived that 60-month sentence, that sentence is not\nbased on the guideline range.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, wouldn't the\nguidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting\npoint for analysis? Isn't the district court obligated,\nand isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to\ngo through the guidelines calculation before the\nsentence is imposed? So you start out with the -- the\nguideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you\nmentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you\ndepart downward.\nMR. HEFT: That -- that's true. The -- the\nguidelines would be the starting point of any\nnegotiation, but -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So why wouldn't that be\nbased on the guidelines? Just because there's such a\nbig downward departure?\nMR. HEFT: It -- Your Honor, it would not be\nbased on the guidelines if those other factors were the\nmotivating reason for the imposition of the sentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, I don't understand\nthat. Don't the guidelines provide for departures?\nMR. HEFT: They do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- and aren't you\ngiving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as\nis required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and\nyou say -- the judge says, I think this is a special\ncase and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence? Just\nas he's required to do under the guidelines in order to\naccept a C type agreement.\nMR. HEFT: If the parties can show that the\nsentence is tied to the guidelines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could it not be?\nWouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the\nguidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to\napply the guideline? If he doesn't say that, isn't he\napplying the guideline?\nMR. HEFT: In that instance, he would be -\nhe would be applying it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Whether he gives the\nspecific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or\nwhether he says, I have a special case and I depart\nunder section 5 of the guidelines. Both of those are\nguideline sentences, aren't they?\nMR. HEFT: If the -- if the judge were to\ntake -- were to actually apply those guidelines and say,\nbased on that guideline, I am going to depart, that\nsentence is based on the guidelines.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So from what base does a\njudge depart downward? From the crack cocaine range or\nfrom the downward departure range?\nMR. HEFT: I think it would depend on the\nnature of the agreement, Your Honor. It may very well\ndepend on -- the judge may depart from the crack\ncocaine.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So aren't you just\nasking us to permit district court judges to make up\ntheir own C agreement, to decide what the parties would\nhave done in the absence of a higher range? And don't\nwe fall prey to sort of just asking district court\njudges to create their own agreements?\nMR. HEFT: No -- no, Your Honor. I don't\nbelieve that's -- that's not what we are asking the\nCourt to do at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heft, are you relying\non -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said,\nspecifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence\ndetermined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the\njudge says that he was adopting the probation report and\nthe application of the guidelines as set out therein, so\nboth the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a\ndetermination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge\nsays, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you\nyour sentence.\nSo the hypotheticals we're talking about are\nquite far afield from where you have a specific\nstatement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that\nthe guidelines are being applied.\nMR. HEFT: That is correct, Your Honor, and\nthat's why we've asked the Court not to take a\ncategorical approach to this issue, but to take either a\ncase-by-case approach or a record-based analysis, to\nallow the district judge to determine, as Justice\nGinsburg pointed out, what our -- you know, what is the\n--\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Heft, would you require\nthose kinds of statements in the agreement or in the\ncolloquy in order to satisfy the standard? Suppose\nthose statements just didn't exist.\nMR. HEFT: That's certainly problematic,\nJustice Kagan. If those -- if there was nothing in that\nplea agreement to tie the sentence to the -- the\nsentence -- the agreed sentence to the guidelines, that\ncertainly would be problematic.\nBut that doesn't resolve the issue one way\nor the other, because the judge would have to consider\nthe presentence report to see if there's a connection or\ncorrelation between the agreed sentence and the\nguidelines, and also the judge could look at the guilty\nplea colloquy and sentencing transcript to see if the\nattorneys actually expressed their intent about where\nthis sentence came from.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Heft, that seems very\ncomplicated. You have to look at everything and you're\nnot giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when\nyou -- when you see these things. I mean, this sort of\ncase-by-case, all-things-considered approach just seems\nas though you're going to get a lot of inconsistent\ndecisions.\nMR. HEFT: Respectfully, Your Honor, I\ndisagree. I think this is what district judges do all\nthe time, not just in the context of a C plea, but a B\nplea as well. They have to look at the nature of the\nplea agreement. They have to look at the PSR. They\nhave to look at the sentencing transcript to -- to\ndetermine whether or not the defendant is -- is eligible\nfor that sentence reduction.\nSo judges are doing this routinely. They're\ndoing this -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in every case, they\nhave to go through the guidelines calculation, and the\nparties have the opportunity to object to the\ncalculation, right?\nMR. HEFT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what does paragraph 12 of\nthe plea agreement contribute here, other than with\nrespect to the fine and things besides the sentence that\nwe're talking about? It doesn't seem to me to add\nanything substantively.\nMR. HEFT: I -- well, Your Honor, I think it\ndoes, Justice Alito. I think it does add -- it adds\nsubstance, and it adds meaning to that plea agreement\nbecause in paragraph 11 where the parties very\nmeticulously go through the offense level, tie that to\nthe guidelines, and then -- then they state in paragraph\n12, the -- the defendant agrees to be sentenced pursuant\nto the -- to the guidelines. That's very clear that the\nreview in the guideline calculation is what the sentence\nis based on. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can a -- can a sentencing\njudge be found to have abused his or her discretion in\napproving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides\nfor less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives\nno -- no particular reason for that? Would that be\nappealed as an invalid sentence?\nMR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor, under -- under\nsection 3742, the government could -- could appeal an\nincorrect application of the guidelines if that's what\nYour Honor is referring to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now you're talking\nabout a plea agreement, which the government has\nconsented to whatever this agreement is and whether -\nwhether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if\nyou take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll\ncharge a small amount -- value of the drug. Was there\nany of that in -- in this plea?\nMR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. Mr. Freeman\npleaded guilty to all charges in the indictment. The\nparties stipulated the amount of -- of drugs that were\nfound on his person when he was arrested. So there were\nno dismissed charges, no amended charges in this plea\nagreement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let -- let me ask my\nquestion a different way. In deciding whether to\napprove the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to\nconsider whether it is an application of the guidelines,\nwhether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines,\nwhether it does not take into account valid reasons for\ndeparture from the guidelines?\nMR. HEFT: Yes. The judge would have to\nconsider the guidelines. Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then, if that's the case,\nthen every plea agreement is based on the guidelines,\nevery single one, because the judge always has to\nconsider how do the guidelines apply to this plea\nagreement.\nMR. HEFT: Well, Justice Scalia,\nconsideration of the guidelines alone is not enough to\ndetermine whether or not that sentence is actually based\non them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand why you\nresist that. I mean, that's precisely what the\nguidelines say. The only ones that aren't guideline\nsentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an\nagreement to dismiss. But a type B, type C -- the\nguidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what\nyou do. Judge, you look and see if the guidelines\nsentence is there. Is it a guideline sentence? If it\nis, you can approve it. If it isn't, you can't.\nI mean, that's my reading of what it says.\nSo -- so why do you resist that conclusion?\nMR. HEFT: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, the judge\nnow could depart from the guidelines -- I mean, \"vary,\"\nwhatever that word -- technical word, is -- \"vary.\" He\ncan say, I'm not going to apply the guidelines at all.\nBut if he is going to apply the guidelines, isn't that\nwhat they tell him to do? I've always thought that.\nYou may tell me I'm mistaken.\nMR. HEFT: They -- they do; obviously they\ndo consider the guidelines, but then the other question\nis whether or not the sentence is based on those\nguidelines -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could it not be,\nsince the judge has no power if he is to apply the\nguideline -\nMR. HEFT: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to accept any agreement\nother than agreement that corresponds with the\nguideline? That's what it says. It says the court\nshould accept a recommended sentence or a C -- the\nspecific sentence -- only if the court is satisfied\neither that it is within the applicable guideline range\nor if it's based on a departure under the guidelines.\nThat seems to me what it says. Isn't that what it says?\nMR. HEFT: That is what it says, Your Honor,\nbut -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then if that's so,\nevery sentence is -- you're going to say no?\nMR. HEFT: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I thought that was\nhelping you, but if you want to say no, go say no and\nexplain why that is.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HEFT: Your Honor, to go back to the\npoint that Justice Sotomayor made -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HEFT: -- with the hypotheticals, there\nstill can be C pleas that are not based on the\nguidelines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How?\nMR. HEFT: Well, the example -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Give me an example.\nMR. HEFT: Well, the example that I gave --\nI gave previously.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. HEFT: There's a guideline range.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HEFT: But the judge bases his decision,\nhis or her decision, solely on other -- factors other\nthan the guidelines. As I mentioned earlier -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are we supposed to\npsychoanalyze the judge? The judge says on his writing,\nchecks the box: This is a guideline sentence. It is\nrobbery. It is precisely within the robbery range. But\nI -- I am going to give it the low end of the range\nbecause I believe that the -- he has a lovely mother and\nfamily and so forth.\nOkay? You're saying that isn't based on the\nguideline. No? Okay. Is that the point?\nMR. HEFT: Well, it depends what the judge\ndoes at sentencing, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What he does is he applies\nthe guideline sentence. He has to do that. Now, within\nthat range, he has applied the guideline sentence, he\ngot the information. He says, I am satisfied it\napplies -- done.\nNow are we supposed to look further and say\nwhat his true reason is? Is that what you're saying?\nMR. HEFT: It would -- Your Honor, I would\nsubmit it would depend on the nature of the -- the plea\nagreement, whether or not that sentence is -- is\nactually based -- going to be based on the guidelines.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Incidentally, and it sort\nof bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines\nmandatory when they are applied in approving a plea\nagreement? In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply\nto the application of the guidelines when a judge is -\nis approving a plea agreement? Do you think the\nguidelines are mandatory in that situation?\nMR. HEFT: No, Your Honor. They're -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You were -- you were just\nat the very point when we decided Booker, is that right?\nIt was -- your -- your sentencing took place in July\n2005 and we came out with Booker in -\nMR. HEFT: I believe it was March of 2005.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's quite\npossible the judge wasn't totally -- but I mean -- I\nagree; it's much more complicated after Booker. I don't\nknow how to treat yours.\nMR. HEFT: That's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's on the cusp.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if there had been\nevidence here of that? What if the government in\nconnection with this plea agreement had dropped counts\nor had decided not to seek a superseding indictment\nadding counts? Would -- would the situation be the\nsame?\nMR. HEFT: Yes. Your Honor, I think it\nwould; it would be the same. Because the court would\nhave to look at, again, what the terms of the plea -\nplea agreement was and what the parties determined.\nNow, the -- I think what I should emphasize is that\nwe're only talking about eligibility here; and if -- if\nthose -- if those concessions that the government has\nmade would -- would perhaps result or at least in the\ngovernment's view, result in an unjustified windfall,\nthat -- that's -- that is not a critical factor in\ndetermining eligibility. That's not factor at all in\ndetermining eligibility.\nThat could come into play after eligibility\nis determined and the judge -- district judge determines\nwhether or how much.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How would that possibly\nwork? Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to\na plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65\nmonths; drops count 2, which would have increased the\nguideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and\nsays this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65\nmonths and we're going to drop count 2. All right?\nMR. HEFT: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And then the guideline for\nthat is lowered, and you say in determining whether the\ndefendant is eligible, what -- the government would then\nhave to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove\ncount 2?\nMR. HEFT: No. No. No. No. It would -\nJUSTICE ALITO: How would it work?\nMR. HEFT: It would work -- assuming that\nthe defendant is eligible, the case is remanded to\ndistrict court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMR. HEFT: As in this case, there would be a\nrecalculation of the guidelines to determine if the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right.\nMR. HEFT -- guideline range would be\nreduced, and then, as the judge said in this case said,\nif you have objections, let me know; file your\nobjections. That's where the government could file -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. The government files\nits objections and says, well, we dropped count 2. And\nthe defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2.\nMR. HEFT: That's -- that's up to the\ndistrict judge's discretion, whether or not to -- to\nreduce that -- that amended guideline sentence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How is the judge going to\ndecide that?\nMR. HEFT: Well, the -- I think that's\nsomething that district judges decide every day, whether\nor not -- because the judge presumably has -- has\nbeen -- is familiar with the case, with the presentence\nreport, with the terms of the original plea agreement,\nwith the facts of the case; and the -- and the judge can\nmake an assessment based on those factors whether or not\nthe sentence reduction should be granted and, if so, how\nmuch of a reduction should be granted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But Justice Alito's\nhypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even\nthough the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may\ndo that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the\njudge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's\nno reason to believe that the government is interested\nin the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in\nputting this person away for a certain amount of time,\nespecially when another count is dropped and the\ngovernment says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it\nif -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years. But if\nthe government had known he's not going for 2 years, he\nis only going for a year and a half or a year, the\nagreement might not have been concluded. So it\nreally -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both\nparties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed,\nthe agreement changes.\nMR. HEFT: Well -- well, the agreement\ncertainly has been -- was modified by the amended\nguideline, and that's where the district judge has to\nexercise his or her discretion whether or not to grant\nthat reduction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in that event, the\nsweet part would be open to reconsideration too. I\nmean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered\nguideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts\nare dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was\nagreed upon. You would have to reopen the whole thing.\nMR. HEFT: No, Your -- no, Justice Ginsburg.\nI don't think you'd have to reopen the case. Again, I\nthink the judge could look at the presentence report,\nthe government could make its objections saying here's\nwhy we gave that particular sentence, and the judge\ncould exercise his or her discretion to say whether or\nnot the defendant is going to get that sentence\nreduction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. HEFT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a criminal defendant and the government\nagree to a specific sentence and that agreement is\nbinding on the sentencing judge by virtue of Rule\n11(c)(1)(C), the resulting sentence is based on the\nparties' agreement. It is not based on the advisory\nguideline range that would otherwise have been used at\nsentencing, even if the sentence corresponds to that\nrange.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, here the agreement\nat various points says that the parties agree on the\ncalculation of the guideline. I think it's paragraph 11\nand 12. They say that the sentence is according to the\nguidelines. So there's reference to the guidelines\nthroughout, and the court made the guidelines\ncalculation.\nMR. GANNON: The court certainly made the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me fair\nunder the statute to say that it is based on the\nguidelines.\nMR. GANNON: Well, the question -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And there are other\nprovisions in the agreement you might argue about.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think the statutory\nquestion here isn't just whether the sentence is based\non the guidelines. The language under 3582(c)(2) is\nwhether the defendant was sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment based on a sentencing range that has\nsubsequently been lowered by the Commission. So it's\nnot just whether the guidelines played a role; it's\nwhether this particular sentencing range was what was\ndriving the sentence.\nAnd, Justice Kennedy, you point out pages\n25, 26 of the plea agreement in the Joint Appendix. And\nI think it's instructive that the agreement deals\ndifferently with the fine component, as Justice Alito\nreferred to earlier, than it does with the term of\nimprisonment. At the bottom of page 25, the agreement\nsays that a fine will be at the lowest end of the\napplicable guideline range. And then if you go over to\npages 27 and 28 in paragraph 11, that's where the\nguideline calculation occurs. And notice it is an\nincomplete calculation. The parties don't actually come\nup with a final calculation because they don't come up\nwith a criminal history. They don't -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they do come up with\na recommendation, which is three levels below the\notherwise applicable guideline.\nMR. GANNON: They -- they come up with a\nrecommendation for purposes of determining the offense\nlevel, the base offense level of 22 and then reduced to\n19.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but that's all based\non the guidelines.\nMR. GANNON: Well, that aspect is based on\nthe guidelines, but then the guideline application\ncomputation is incomplete because the next paragraph,\nparagraph B, says we aren't agreed on what the criminal\nhistory is going to be. And to the next paragraph,\nparagraph C specifically says that the foregoing\nstatements of applicability of sections of the\nsentencing guidelines are not binding upon the court.\nThe defendant understands the court will independently\ncalculate the guidelines at sentencing; that is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that doesn't mean that\nthe court can't base its conclusion on his\nindependent -- on its independent judgment on the\nguideline.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think what I'm trying\nto say, Justice Kennedy, is the agreement expressly\ncontemplates that the judge needs to determine the\napplicable guideline range for purposes of determining\nwhat the fine will be. And that's different from the\nway the plea agreement deals with the term of\nimprisonment because if we go back to page 26, it does\nnot tie the -- the term of imprisonment to a guideline\nrange. That's completely different from the way it\ndeals with a fine. It specifically says there's an\nagreement that the sentence of 106 months of\nincarceration is the appropriate amount. And so that\nhappens to have been at the bottom end of the guideline\nrange that would have been applicable if the parties'\nagreement -- if the parties' prediction about the likely\ncriminal history calculation turned out to be the right\none.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're talking about\nwhat \"based on\" means, and that's an important part of\nyour argument. If I could just, while I've got you,\njump to this question of what happens on remand if you\nlose the case. On remand, I take it, you're not bound\nby the agreement because of the last -\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the last of section 24\nsays the defendant argues for any sentence other than\nthe one to which he has agreed to and breached the\nagreement.\nMR. GANNON: Well, at that point the remedy\nfor the breach would be that the United States is\nrelieved of its obligations under the agreement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- what would\nthat mean?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that's -- that's\npart of the problem in a case like this where there was\na specific sentence agreement, that it's impossible for\ngovernment to get back the things that it gave up at the\ntime, that were agreed to under -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's got guilty\npleas on all of the counts. We know that.\nMR. GANNON: Well, but it also -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your position, in your\nview, would the government be able to take the position\nthat the guilty pleas stay in place, but it now wants\nmaximum?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that -- that\nwould -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maximum guidelines.\nMR. GANNON: I don't think that the\n3582(c)(2) contemplates that the sentence will be\nincreased. The only thing, as the court -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, except that the\nagreement does. The agreement relieves you.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that's if -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of any obligation. I see\nwhat you mean.\nMR. GANNON: Now that the sentence has\nbecome final, I think 3582(c)(2) has opened a narrow\nwindow for ways in which the otherwise final sentence\ncould be modified. It only contemplates that the judge\nwill have the discretion to reduce the sentence if it\nis, first, a sentence that was based on the relevant\nguideline range that's subsequently been amended and\nmade retroactively applicable. But also, second, then\nthe judge would need to comply with a policy statement\nthat appears in 1B1.10 of the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say the judgment's\nfinal, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a\nbreach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this\npoint?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that the remedy\nthat the agreement contemplates of the government being\nreleased from its other obligations in the plea doesn't\nreally leave us much of an option at this point. We're\nnot going to be able to go back and argue that he should\nhave been sentenced at the upper end of the range that\nwe're talking about. We're not going to be arguing that\nthe criminal history should have been a higher or that\nthe criminal history substantially underrepresented the\nseriousness of his history where he had 10 years of\noffenses preceding this one. There may have even been a\npotential career adjustment that -- that went by the\nboards. That's mentioned on page 162 of the Joint\nAppendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gannon, you assert that\nthe -- within the language of the statutory provision,\nthe sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but\nit's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably\nis based on the guidelines.\nMR. GANNON: I think the agreement is\narguably -- I mean, I don't think the face of this\nagreement proves that it's based on the guidelines, but\nI -- it is obvious that the parties negotiated in the\nshadow of the guidelines.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you take that\nposition, that \"based on\" means determined by\nabsolutely, then I don't think any sentence would ever\nbe based on the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan.\nMR. GANNON: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines form part of\nthe consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision\nis not based on the guidelines. Just as here, the -\nthe agreement -- the guidelines form part of what\nproduces the agreement, so also they form part of what\nproduces the judge's decision. And it seems to me, if\nthat's going to be enough for the judge's determination,\nit ought to be the same for the agreement.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think it's not clear\nthat the judge needed to be considering the guidelines\nin the course of deciding whether to accept the plea\nagreement. And Justice Breyer earlier had a colloquy\nwith Mr. Heft about guideline 6B1.2, which, even before\nBooker, was a nonbinding policy statement. And so, to\nbe sure, when 3582 was enacted, the guidelines were\nbinding, and, therefore, it -- they would have been\nexpected to have played a larger role in most sentences.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but let's -- let's\nassume there is no plea agreement.\nMR. GANNON: Yes. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have a judge who\nsentences post-Booker/Fanfan. Now, his sentence is not\nbased on the guidelines any more -\nMR. GANNON: I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- any more than this\nagreement is based on the guidelines. The guidelines\nare one of the things that he must take into account and\ndoes take into account in determining the sentence.\nNow, if that is enough for purposes of\ndetermining whether this statute -- statutory provision\napplies to a sentence imposed directly by a judge, it\nseems to me the same analysis ought to apply to a\nsentence imposed through a plea agreement.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that there's a\ndifferent purpose that's being served by asking the\n3582(c)(2) inquiry, which is asking the judge to -- to\ngo back and redo the aspects of his analysis that would\nhave been different had the -- the relevant guideline\nrange been changed at the time he engaged in his\nanalysis, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you acknowledge\nthat \"based on\" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by\nthe judge?\nMR. GANNON: Outside of the context of a\nspecific C -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes. Yes.\nMR. GANNON -- a specific sentence rendered\nunder type C that -- on page 28 of our brief, we\nacknowledge that in most contexts, it's -- it's open to\n-- to contend that the sentence was based on the\nrelevant guidelines -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though -- even though\nthe guidelines are just one of the things that have to\nbe taken into account?\nMR. GANNON: It is -- the test that we state\nin the subheading of that section of our brief is\nwhether they're of legal consequence in the\ndetermination.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Defining \"legal consequence\"\nis your test, Mr. Gannon -\nMR. GANNON: Well, our -- the.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's not a binding legal\nconsequence post-Booker.\nMR. GANNON: The test that we have for -\nthe overarching test is whether it is of legal\nconsequence, and the phrase that you're talking about on\npage 27 of our brief, Justice Kagan, is when we know\nthat there is something that was of binding legal\nconsequence and was controlling, we know that that is\nthe thing that the sentence was based on.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So that's not your test.\nWhat is your test instead?\nMR. GANNON: Well, that is -- in -- when\nsomething literally is controlling the analysis -- the\nparties' agreement here binds the district judge -- we\nknow that that is what the sentence is based on. There\nisn't any -- any -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but is -- is there some\nother instances in which you would say that something is\nbased on, even though it's not of binding legal\nconsequence?\nMR. GANNON: Well, it would be of legal\nconsequence even if it weren't controlling. This Court\nhas -- has made clear even after Booker that under\n3553(a), courts still need to go through the relevant\nguidelines analysis. They apply the guidelines. It may\nturn out that the sentence turns out not to be based on\nthe relevant guideline range because the judge -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then I'm back with\nJustice Scalia, because if it's only of legal\nconsequence, not of binding legal consequence, if it's\nsomething that somebody considers rather than something\nthat is determinative, it seems to me the same in the\nnon-plea context and in the plea context.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I don't think that's true\nin the context of a specific sentence agreement under a\ntype C plea because of -- and this is reinforced by the\nlanguage in the policy statement, 1B1.10, which the\nCourt last term in Dillon held is binding and controls\nwhat needs to be done during the sentence reduction\nproceeding. And it specifically refers to the guideline\nprovisions that were applied when the defendant was\nsentenced. And that's something that happens in the\nprocess of the 3553(a) factors applicability.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't this line of\nquestioning lead logically to the conclusion that no\nsentence after Booker and Fanfan is based on the\nguidelines? Because, today, a sentencing judge can\nengage in the same analysis that the Sentencing\nCommission may engage in when it decides that a\nguideline range should be lowered and that that should\nbe retroactive. The judge can do that at the time when\nthe sentence is imposed.\nWe roll the clock back on the crack -- on\nthe crack cocaine guidelines. Under the authority that\njudges now have under Booker and Fanfan, a judge could\nsay, well, I see that this is the crack cocaine\nguideline right now, but I think it is too harsh for all\nthe reasons that were later persuasive in lowering the\nrange, and therefore, I am sentencing below the range.\nSo it seems to lead logically to the\nconclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the\nSentencing Reform Act that was tied to the old\npre-Booker mandatory sentencing regime, and now that\nthat is out the window with Booker and Fanfan, the\nwhole -- the whole mechanism is -- is superfluous.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I understand the\npoint that the analysis has certainly changed since\nBooker, but it is still the case that the defendant can\nappeal an error in application of the guidelines after\nBooker.\nIf the judge were to -- to misapply the\nguidelines before he engages in the analysis that you're\ntalking about, Justice Alito, that would be grounds for\nan appeal. In retrospect, if the judge is asked whether\nthe sentence was based on the guidelines, he -- he may\nsay that particular sentence wasn't, because I ended up\ndisregarding the guidelines under 3553(a). I did the\nanalysis. I was exercising my sentencing discretion the\nfirst time around under 3553(a), and the guidelines\nended up not being the basis of the sentence.\nAnd that is not something that is an option\nin a type C plea agreement, because there, the defendant\ncannot appeal when the judge agrees to the sentences in\nthe agreement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I find it hard to -- I\nfind it hard to understand the analysis that would\nrequire courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea\nagreements are based on the guidelines and some are not\nbased on the guidelines. Maybe they are all based on\nthe guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the\ngovernment to put a provision in a standard plea\nagreement requiring the defendant to give up the\nopportunity to move for a sentence reduction if the\nguideline range is subsequently lowered.\nOr maybe none of them are based on the\nguidelines because -- for the reasons I just mentioned:\nThis whole mechanism is now needed no longer as a result\nof Booker and Fanfan.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think in the context of\nan actual specific sentence plea agreement, that is the\none that we think is off the table, because that is what\nis going to control the sentence. And some type C plea\nagreements affirmatively contemplate application of the\nguidelines, as this one does with respect to the fine.\nAnd so when you have a plea agreement that\ntells the district judge, you are bound to apply a\nguideline provision once you've accepted this agreement,\nwe haven't taken the position that the resulting\nsentence there is not based on the relevant guideline\nrange, but that is not what is going on here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You want us to\ndecide this case. I completely agree with what Justice\nAlito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world\nafter Booker is different. And I have not thought that\none through.\nI am thinking this case is a pre-Booker\ncase. It is not real. I am thinking it is on the cusp,\nso how am I to treat this case? If it is a case where\nthe guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I\nthink maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it\nwas. Am I right about that? Were you saying this is a\ncase where the guidelines do not apply, where they are\nnot binding? I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you want us to take\nthis, pre-Booker or post-Booker?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that the answer\nis, it's different. But this is a -- this is a\npost-Booker case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, you think the -- I\nthink it is completely different regardless. So let's\navoid that controversy at the moment, and you tell me\nwhether you want me to take it pre-Booker or\npost-Booker.\nMR. GANNON: The sentencing proceeding\noccurred six months -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want you -\nMR. GANNON: -- after the Booker opinion\ncame out.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you want to\n-- you want to set aside this post-Booker?\nMR. GANNON: Yes, but.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then perhaps we should have\nthe pre-argument. If we are taking this pre-Booker, I\nwould have throughout it is QED.\nMR. GANNON: I disagree, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, imagine that the\nthat the Sentencing Commission -- imagine. It is not\ntrue, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had\nwritten the following words: \"Plea bargaining over\nsentences is above,\" as many argued they should. They\nwrite those words. Then they write the next word,\n\"exception.\" There is an exception, however; you are\npermitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as\nyou argue about the range, where, within the range, it\napplies. And of course when you apply the guidelines,\nas when you always apply the guidelines, here or\nelsewhere, departure is an unusual case.\nNow, suppose those were the words that the\nCommission had written. Could -- how -- is it possible\nunder those circumstances you would still be arguing\nthis sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished\nexcept over where within the range -- is it possible you\nwould be arguing that this is not based on the\nguidelines?\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think that had the\nSentencing Commission adopted such a position, and if it\nwere binding on the sentencing judge -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it is, because of\n(a)(4). It used to be -\nMR. GANNON: Which is -- well, because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because it says in the\nsentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the\nguideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission\ndid not adequately take into account and in respect to\nthat, you may and must consult policy statements, but\nguidelines and other materials. That is what it says.\nOkay?\nSo take I am right on that. Assume I am\nright. You can disagree with me, and I will look into\nit.\nMR. GANNON: Before Booker was decided,\nit -- several of the circuits had already concluded that\na judge could accept a type C plea agreement that had a\nsentence outside the range, and that that wasn't a\nguidelines-based sentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want an answer to my\nhypothetical, because I am trying to figure out how to\nthink about it, and you will help me if you answer my\nhypothetical.\nMR. GANNON: I think in those circumstances,\nthe Commission effectively would have repealed type C\nplea agreements, because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right. That's\nwhat they wanted to do. Okay? Now, that is correct.\nBut you can still have them.\nMR. GANNON: In your hypothetical, that is\nwhat they wanted to do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You could still have them,\nbut they allow them only for the purpose of where within\nthe range the sentence will lie. Okay?\nMR. GANNON: In those circumstances I think\nthat it would be fair to say that the sentence was based\non the guideline range -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine.\nMR. GANNON: -- because the agreement hadn't\ngiven any reason for the judge to -- to leave the\nguidelines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Now I would like\n-- because if they wrote those words, C agreements are\nabolished, but for where within the range -- okay? You\nagree it would be based on the guidelines. Now what I'd\nlike you to do is to look at section 6B, whatever that\nis.\nMR. GANNON: 6B1.2 -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly.\nMR. GANNON: -- is on the last page of\nthe -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You tell me how this\ndiffers from what I just said.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I think it differs in two\nkey ways. First of all -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You were about to tell us\nwhere it is?\nMR. GANNON: It is on the last page of the\ngovernment's appendix which is the 16A of our brief.\nAnd I think that it differs in two regards. First of\nall, it -- it was a policy statement that even before\nBooker was not binding on the sentencing judge. The\nCommission determined that -- that this particular\nguideline was not binding on judges the same way other\nprovisions in the guidelines where.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought you just told\nme that -- binding -- was not a part of the test\nanymore.\nMR. GANNON: Well, I -- but the question is\nwhether the judge even had to apply it at all, and the\njudge did not need to. And -- the second point that I\nwas going to get to is that, unlike the colloquy that\nJustice Breyer had with Mr. Heft earlier on, it doesn't\nsay the court may accept the agreement only if the court\nis satisfied that it is within the guideline range. It\ngives the court permission to accept the agreement.\nThis is a policy statement that gives the court\npermission to accept the agreement when it is within the\nguideline range or when there is a justifiable\ndeparture, but it does not then say that everything else\nis prohibited.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's only if. The words\nthere are \"only if.\" It said should accept the\nrecommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring\nimposition of a specific sentence only if the court is\nsatisfied either that such sentence is appropriate\nwithin the guidelines, or departure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're reading a different\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am? I'm reading 6B1.3, I\nam reading commentary on the policy statement.\nMR. GANNON: This is for 6B1.3?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I am reading the\ncommentary on the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is reading the\ncommentary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GANNON: I've been looking at a text of\n6B1.2 itself, which leaves out the word only. But I\nthink that here, even if you go back to the pre-Booker\npractice, I think it was clear that judges were able to\ndepart from the guidelines to accept type C plea\nagreements that imposed the sentence that was outside\nthe guideline range, and they -- and it wasn't\nconsidered an abuse of discretion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think you're right. You\nsee that is why I am having such a hard time. I am\nhaving a hard time because first I put myself back in\nthe Commission days, and there the Commission did want\nto abolish C.\nMR. GANNON: Well-\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then that is what it\nintended to do and that is what it said it did, but for\nwhat we are talking about. Now, you first raised the\nquestion of did they have the authority to do that and I\nagree with you that that is a legitimate question. I\nmade you assume it away, but I think it is a legitimate\nquestion.\nNow we have the additional question of how\nBooker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when. Do\nyou see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather\nharshly to start with my hypothetical?\nMR. GANNON: I -- I do think that -- that\nthis gets puzzling as -- as you get further down, but I\nthink that this is the simplest case. It is a narrow\ncategory of cases. We are dealing with a subset of one\nparticular type of plea agreement. It is distinct from\nevery other aspect of Federal sentencing. It's unlike\nwhat happens when somebody goes to trial; in those\ncircumstances the judge clearly has the discretion to\napply the sentencing guidelines at the time of\nsentencing.\nIt is different from regular type B plea\nagreements where the parties have come up with an\nagreement and the judge notwithstanding the agreement is\nstill free to determine the sentence that he or she\nwants to determine.\nThis is a unique -- this uniquely gives a\nhigh level of certainty to the parties about the\nspecific sentence that they negotiated.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't -- I am not in\ndisagreement with the point you're making, but I think\nthat going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and\nJustice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not\nmandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on\nthe agreement? Because even a C agreement has to be\napproved by the judge.\nThe legal consequence is not the agreement.\nThat doesn't sentence the defendant. It is the judge's\ndecision as to what the sentence should be which he\ndenotes in accepting the agreement that binds.\nAnd I think -- I may be making Justice\nBreyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement\nand it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge\nfeels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a\nsentence in the guidelines and impose one in the\nguidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not\nthe guideline sentence?\nMR. GANNON: Well, because I think that the\nrelevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and\nthe policy statements that the court said in Dillon\ncontrols the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2),\nis what did the judge do at the time of imposing the\nsentence? And so although it is true that the judge\ngenerally will consider how the type C specific sentence\nthat the parties have agreed upon corresponds to a\nguidelines analysis at the time of deciding whether to\naccept the plea agreement, the relevant phrase in\n1B1.10(b)1 which is -- which is on page 8A of the\ngovernment's appendix is that the judge is supposed to\ngo back and look at what -- to only make substitutions\nfor the corresponding guideline provisions that were\napplied when the defendant was sentenced.\nAnd so when you have a type C plea agreement\nthat has a specific sentence even under the terms of\nthis agreement, the only thing that the judge considered\nwhen he decided the sentence was going to be 106 months\nwith respect to the term of imprisonment was the binding\nplea agreement. That is what rule 11(c)(1)(C) required.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- no. Because you're\nassuming that the agreement was automatically binding on\nthe judge.\nMR. GANNON: It was -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The judge was always\ncapable of saying at the time of sentence I won't accept\nthe 106. If he had calculated the guidelines and if it\nturned out that the guidelines called for 240 to 360, he\ncould have said easily no, that is so far outside of the\nguideline range with no justification that I am not\ngoing to accept -- impose the sentence. You could\nwithdraw your agreement and do whatever you're going to\ndo.\nMR. GANNON: And had he not done that the\nproceeding would have occurred differently and it may\nnot even have right occurred then, and -- and I think\nbecause under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea\nagreement and -- and the 106 months that the parties had\nagreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right\nto withdraw the plea at that point. So the government\nwould have been released from its obligations; the\nparties -- the defendant could have gone to trial. He\ncould have -- he could have continued to plead guilty.\nThe parties could have come up with a type plea -- B\nplea agreement. The parties may have asked for time to\nrenegotiate a different type C agreement. We do not\nknow what would have happened in those circumstances.\nAnd as you pointed out before, Justice\nSotomayor, this is not about asking the judge to step\ninto the shoes of the parties and renegotiate what the\nagreement would have been had the judge decided to\nreject it the first time around. Instead 3582(c)(2)\ncontemplates a limited process by which the judge will\nreapply those provisions of the guidelines that he\napplied the first time around and -- and make the\nsubstitution that is now called for by the retroactively\napplicable change. But here because the judge didn't\nactually make that application at the time of\nsentencing, the judge did not actually have to apply the\ndrug quantity table.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I am not following that\nargument for this reason. It seems to me if you ask\nwhat did the judge apply at the time he imposed the\noriginal sentence, well, it has got to be the\nguidelines, because first the agreement provides for it;\nthen he says I am going to wait for the probation report\nso I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree\nwith it; and then he gives him a sentence that is\nprecisely within the guidelines.\nSo if you asked me to describe what that\nsentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say\nthat was a guideline sentence. It was right there\nwithin the brackets that -- the guidelines. So why\nwasn't it a guideline sentence?\nMR. GANNON: Because for purposes of the\nterm of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying\nthe guidelines at that point. He did so for purposes of\nthe fine. He ended up actually waiving the relevant\nfine, but those type C plea agreement here called for\nthe judge to apply the guidelines with respect to the\nfine and did not call for the judge to apply the\nguidelines with respect to the term of imprisonment. He\nknew that it was within what the PSR had calculated as\nthe guideline range and he concluded that that was the\napplicable guideline range which he needed to do for\npurposes of calculating the fine and other things, but\nit wasn't actually the basis for the sentence.\nThe basis for the sentence was the plea\nagreement that he accepted, and there it was the\nparties' agreement. And there are all sorts of things\nthat went into the parties' agreement that the judge\ndoes not have the wherewithal to reconsider in\nretrospect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought one of the\nthings in the plea agreement was that the -- that the\njudge would have the right to himself calculate the\nguideline range.\nMR. GANNON: Yes. And that specifically\ncontemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that\nthe judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement\nuntil after the presentence report is prepared. And the\njudge did do that here. So he was aware of what the PSR\nrecommended, but once, and had he decided that he did\nnot like the 106 month sentence and he wanted to\npreserve his sentencing discretion, the option at that\npoint was to have rejected the plea agreement, at which\npoint the parties would have been free to do different\nthings. And among other things, the Government could\nthen have then argued for a higher sentence within the\nrange. Could have argued that the criminal history\nfailed to represent the seriousness of the defendant's\ncriminal past. Could have argued for an upward\ndeparture even, but the Defendant got the benefit of the\n106 month agreement of not having the Government raise\nany of those other arguments at that time. And now he\nis asking for essentially another bite of the apple and\nwe think that because the basis for the sentence was\nindeed the negotiation and the agreement between the\nparties, that the court of appeals decision was correct.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Gannon.\nMr. Heft, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. HEFT: Thank you, Your Honor. Just a\ncouple of points. First of all, the record here leaves\nno doubt that the judge based his sentence on the\nguidelines. The sentencing transcript specifically\nstates that the judge and I'd like to quote this, this\nis at page 47 of the joint appendix and I quote, \"the\ncourt will adopt the findings of the probation officer\ndisclosed in the probation report and application of the\nguidelines as set out therein.\" On page 48 of the joint\nappendix the judge says, having considered the advisory\nguidelines, he went on to impose that sentence. So it\nis quite clear that the judge and even in his statements\nof reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again\nreaffirmed that this sentence was based on the\nguidelines.\nNow, the other point that I'd like to make\nis that the Government acknowledges that it has carved\nout a very small exception to its argument that C pleas\nregarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are\nnot eligible for (c)(2) relief. But it seems to me that\nreading, taking the Government position into account, if\nthis plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then\nMr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in\nthe Government's view and under the Government's\nargument of what exception exists under the C pleas for\npurposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the\nrelief that was granted. And we would simply urge the\nCourt in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude\nspecific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
