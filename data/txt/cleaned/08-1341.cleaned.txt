Mr. Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in holding that
reversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate on
plain error review if there was any possibility, no
matter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was based
entirely on conduct predating the enactment of the
statute.
Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a
forfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at
a minimum a reasonable possibility that the error
actually affected the outcome of the case. In
particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error
test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on
the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial
proceedings. That test calls for a case-specific,
fact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy
it if there is no reasonable possibility that the error
affected the outcome.
The decision of the court of appeals is
inconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four
of the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most
recently Puckett from just last term. Puckett
established that the prong four inquiry is case-specific
and fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four
is inappropriate. And that's exactly what the court of
appeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if
there's any possibility of prejudice, reversal is
required.
In addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear
that when the error is one that affects an issue on
which the evidence is overwhelming or essentially
uncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious
effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation
of judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that
context on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't
affect the outcome would undermine public confidence in
the judicial system.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there errors that
are -- that are so basic that they would call for an
automatic new trial? You say this -- this is not such
a -- such an error.
MR. MILLER: This Court has reserved the
question of whether, for example, a structural error
would automatically satisfy the "affects substantial
rights" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano
test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by
"structural"?
MR. MILLER: Well, the sort of error that,
if properly preserved, would result in automatic
reversal without an assessment of harmlessness.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but if you can be
concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what
else would be structural?
MR. MILLER: Well, I mean in Johnson, for
example, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in
Johnson it was unclear whether the omission of one
element, the failure to instruct the jury on one element
of the offense, was a structural error. And in Johnson,
the Court said, even assuming that that's a structural
error and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has
satisfied prong three, showing an effect on the
substantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has
to apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of
the record and the facts in that particular case whether
there was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and
public reputation of judicial proceedings.
And in that case, the Court said that there
wasn't, because the evidence on the point that was the
subject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and
essentially uncontroverted. And that's, in our view, the
sort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment
of the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken
in this case.
The effect of the decision below is
essentially to carve out a special rule of plain error
review that's applicable only to a particular kind of
error; namely --
JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this? Prong
three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right? And
then it's your position that prong four also looks to
prejudice? Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one
is more searching than the other, perhaps?
How do they fit together in that relation --
in that regard?
MR. MILLER: Well, that's -- that's right.
We think that prong three in the case of a
constitutional error requires at least a reasonable
possibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demands
at least that much and, in some cases, may demand more.
One example of a case where a defendant
could satisfy prong three but not prong four would be,
for example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error. If you had
a drug possession case where the only evidence that the
substance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a
laboratory certificate admitted without confrontation,
that would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and
that would -- the defendant would be able to show an
effect on his substantial rights, because if that was
the only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled
to a directed verdict without it. Nonetheless --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under three.
MR. MILLER: Under prong three. But looking
at prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, for
example, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoena
the chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of the
report, there would be no basis for concluding on those
facts that there was a serious effect on the fairness or
integrity or reputation of the proceedings.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You answered Justice Alito
by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more
searching, more demanding, under four. It might also be
the other way around. I mean, if you satisfy -- if,
under three, you find that it hasn't affected the
outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.
MR. MILLER: If, under three, the defendant
fails, then you don't need to apply prong four, because
prong four -- prong four is essentially an
implementation of the discretion conferred by the word --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MR. MILLER: -- "may" in Rule 52(b). In
order for the court to have any authority to correct
a plain error, it must be one that affects substantial
rights. So --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. There -- there is an
overlap.
MR. MILLER: There is some overlap in the
inquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court
made clear in Puckett, rule four requires a
fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry.
JUSTICE ALITO: So under -- under three, the
court could conclude that the defendant has shown that
it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a
constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the
outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but
in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's
fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that --
is that -- that how it would work?
MR. MILLER: Or if, you know, as in the --
my Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence
in the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect
on the defendant's rights of that particular error, that
error, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine
public confidence in the outcome.
What the court of appeals did here was to
create a special rule applicable only to those errors
involving the failure to instruct the jury that they may
not convict solely on pre-enactment evidence. The court
didn't give any reason why those errors should be
treated differently from other kinds of errors.
Instead, it was simply applying a line of circuit
precedent that went back to cases predating Olano.
And there is no reason for creating a
special rule in that context. To the contrary, Johnson
emphatically rejected the proposition that there are
errors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis. And
the Court said that even errors implicating fundamental
constitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth
Amendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth
Amendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also
subject to the application --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want us to do it,
right? You want us to remand it so that they can do it,
right? Is that --
MR. MILLER: This Court's usual practice
when there's an issue that wasn't passed upon below is
to leave it to be considered on remand. We think that's
particularly appropriate because of the fact- and
record-intensive nature of the argument in this case.
So, if the Court does reach that issue, we
would urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the
concurring judges below, who said that, with respect to
the forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the
pre-enactment and post-enactment periods were
essentially identical, such that there is no basis in
the record on which a rational jury could have concluded
that he violated the statute in the pre-enactment
period --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The point may be
tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date
problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and
the jury was later properly instructed, do you think
that the government would find it important to introduce
the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set
forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury
the story?
MR. MILLER: Indeed, it would. In order to
establish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the
government had to show that Respondent had obtained
labor services by threats of serious harm or by a
scheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to
believe that she would suffer serious harm.
And so, in this case, there was essentially a
uniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaining
labor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed,
brutally carrying out those threats. And so the
pre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying
out the threats would certainly be relevant to show that
the post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats
and that the victim could take them seriously as
threats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide
the labor or services.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument
that was made that in the pre-enactment period the
Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the
really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to
date?
MR. MILLER: Well, there -- I mean, the
statute refers to "labor or services." And creating a
Web site is a kind of labor or service, and maintaining a
Web site is also a kind of labor or service. And
there's -- as the concurring judges in the court of
appeals noted, there's no basis on which the jury could
have concluded that one satisfies the statute but the
other does not. They're both -- they both fall
comfortably within the ordinary meaning --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Miller, can I ask you
this question? We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not --
as construed in Olano, which has developed the four
factors.
In your view, does the character of the
violation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does
that ever make a difference? Could a court ever think
that one kind of constitutional violation is a little
bit more serious than another, or are they all fungible?
MR. MILLER: I think in Johnson the Court
quite clearly said that even very serious constitutional
errors are subject to the same analysis under
Rule 52(b). And certainly there's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, but the same
constitutional analysis includes step four, which is
whether it undermines confidence in the result. And
don't you think that some constitutional violations more
undermine confidence than others?
MR. MILLER: Absolutely. And the test that
would be applied would be the same, but the result of
that test might be different. For example, if the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it not also be
possible that some constitutional violations undermine
confidence a little more than others?
MR. MILLER: Yes. I mean, if the error were,
for example, a biased judge -- I mean, that would be one
that would almost invariably undermine confidence in
the integrity of the proceedings.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Then why is the Second
Circuit so wrong to say: We think ex post facto
violations are perhaps a little more serious than some
others.
MR. MILLER: Well, because the error, the
essential error in this case, was the failure to give
the jury an instruction telling them that they could not
convict on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. And that
is essentially analogous to the error that you had in
Johnson, where there was a failure to give the jury an
instruction telling them that they had to find
materiality. And there --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Are all omissions in jury
instructions fungible, then? I'm -- here we have an
omission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post
Facto Clause. Does -- the fact that it relates to the
Ex Post Facto Clause doesn't give it any extra weight or
any lesser weight in the analysis?
MR. MILLER: I think in the context of an
error like this, there isn't any reason to attach extra
weight --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if the
instruction told the jury in a criminal case that you
can find the defendant guilty if you think it more
likely than not that he committed the crime, that might
be different, don't you think?
MR. MILLER: Yes. That very well might be
different. That's right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this is
ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process
violation?
MR. MILLER: No. I mean -- that's right.
The Ex Post Facto Clause regulates the content of the
laws that Congress can pass, and there would be an ex
post facto issue in the case if Congress had tried to
make section 1589 retroactive, but it didn't. And
everyone agrees that section 1589 applies only
prospectively.
So the constitutional violation, if there is
one, comes from the possibility that the defendant could
have been convicted on the basis of Congress -- of
conduct that did not violate the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you -- you agree
that there is a violation?
MR. MILLER: There is a violation in the
failure to instruct. And we think it's the
Due Process Clause that is the source of the requirement
that the defendant not be convicted on the basis of the
conduct that doesn't violate a statute.
If there are no further questions, I'd
like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fahringer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD PRICE FAHRINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FAHRINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and if it
please the Court:
We do believe there are errors that are so
basic that they require a reversal automatically. And
certainly one of them is trying a person for conduct for
2 years that violated no law. It's almost
unimaginable and it's unheard of. There are very few
cases that even come close to resembling --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that I think
most trial judges would have admitted this evidence with
the proper instruction to the jury, that it's background
evidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and
just begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to
them.
MR. FAHRINGER: That's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I agree there was not
a proper instruction here, there should have been an
objection, and so forth. But in an ordinary trial, this
evidence would have come in with the proper limiting
instruction.
MR. FAHRINGER: What's so important about
that, if it please Your Honor, is that he couldn't have
been convicted on that evidence. The court would have
instructed that this evidence was received --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of -- of -- of course, the
jury would have to be instructed very carefully.
MR. FAHRINGER: But here, Your Honor, all
this evidence came in, and he could be convicted and was
convicted on the -- what we lend -- we think lends an
awful lot of force to our argument here is that the
government has conceded that he could have been
convicted exclusively on the pre-enactment conduct
alone. That that was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Convicted, but not --
there was a possibility, but not a reasonable
possibility. That is, it's conceivable, but the
government also is urging the reasonable
possibility that it is not likely, given the character of
the evidence in the post-enactment period.
MR. FAHRINGER: Well, Your Honor, I
understand that, but I certainly -- I'd like to say
first, in terms of the concession that was made here, you
are talking about 2 years of conduct that came into a
trial that is really quite extraordinary and terribly
dynamic.
The one -- last third of that, Your Honor, I
think cannot -- even though it came post-statute, it
cannot be used to legitimatize that first 2 years.
And -- and the jury heard all of it, and -- and as a
matter of fact, what we attach a great deal of importance
to, the last question the jury asked of the judge: We
want to know what constitutes labor.
And they put in their note the -- the
largest task of all, the building and the designing of
the Web site and then maintaining it. And that was all
pre-enactment; the threats were all pre-enactment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this was a long -- a
long jury deliberation.
MR. FAHRINGER: It was out for 7 days,
Your Honor. Seven days the jury deliberated over this
case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Kennedy suggested
that, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, it
would have come in to show pattern, scheme. So it's one
-- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not
have seen that evidence, would not have heard the
evidence, and another to say the judge should have
charged them: Now, you cannot use this evidence that
you've heard for another purpose. You cannot use it to
determine his guilt or innocence.
MR. FAHRINGER: But -- but, Your Honor, I
wanted to mention to the Court, of course, Rule 403 that
says that if the prejudice of the evidence outweighs the
probative value. I think if we could take ourselves
back to that trial court and a lawyer stood up and said,
Your Honor, we want to put in 2 years of background
evidence, I -- I think there's a good likelihood that
it would have been excluded. I don't think you can
say --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you can be pleased
that I was not the trial judge.
(Laughter.)
MR. FAHRINGER: Sorry to hear that, Your
Honor.
But in the -- in the course of taking in
some evidence as background, I don't think it's ever
been of this magnitude in a unique case where the
evidence that's coming in bears directly on the
liability. And I think the -- the question is terribly
important because, obviously, it shows the jury was
focused on the pre-enactment conduct, even with the
forced labor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Does the --
JUSTICE BREYER: I assume you could make all
that argument on remand, if we remand it. But what's
your argument -- apparently from what I've read in this
case, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error
that nobody else uses.
MR. FAHRINGER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: And it says that all the other
circuits say: This is our set of standards, and we've
set them forth. And the Second Circuit says: No, it's
-- you have to have a new trial if there's any
possibility, no matter how unlikely.
MR. FAHRINGER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, nobody else uses that.
It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any
justification for their using it?
MR. FAHRINGER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Because unless I can hear a
justification, I would guess I would vote to say send it
back and let them use the same standard anybody else
does.
MR. FAHRINGER: Well, one point you make,
Your Honor, that I --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to
that?
MR. FAHRINGER: It's certainly welcome, and
that is that we are seeking a retrial here. You know,
you speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the
gentleman can be tried on that conduct that was
post-enactment.
But in response to Your Honor's question, I
think, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in
this whole case is, it all ran together in front of the
jury, and they saw all of this proof with no
instruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the --
the mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in
front of that had to have a --
JUSTICE BREYER: So why don't you make
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Address the test used by
the Second Circuit. That's what we're concerned about.
MR. FAHRINGER: Oh, I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what the
question pertained to. They're using a test nobody
else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior
opinions. Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them,
you know, use the right test?
MR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, I think -- and I
choose my words carefully -- I think that this test
under this circumstance was justified. When the court
saw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say if
there was any possibility that the jury
relied exclusively --
JUSTICE BREYER: The very magnitude of
the error would argue for -- you'd win on any test.
I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test
that is specially designed to find when there is hardly
any error? Here there's such a bigger error,
according -- that you think that you would have won
under any test.
So that -- so why -- why do you do have to
have this special favorable test? That's -- that's the
question that I'm thinking of. I'm not thinking of
whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the --
how much evidence there was and how awful it was.
MR. FAHRINGER: I think -- to answer Your
Honor's question, which is a -- an incisive one, and
that is because, Your Honor, it's only -- the court made
it very clear, we're only applying this test to ex post
facto, and I think in this instance you are right, the
magnitude of the error prompted them to say that if
there was any possibility that this 2 years of conduct
-- the jury could have based their verdict
exclusively on that, we think we had to be granted a new
trial.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- may I ask this
question about the -- I -- I should know this, but I
don't. To what extent has the regular test that my
colleagues referred to applied in ex post facto cases in
other circuits?
MR. FAHRINGER: The -- the Olano test, Your
Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. FAHRINGER: Well, the possibility test has
been used in the Third Circuit in the Tykarsky case. It
has also been used in several States --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Were those ex post --
MR. FAHRINGER: -- Georgia being one.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- ex post facto cases?
MR. FAHRINGER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.
And --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So that it isn't
necessarily a conflict between this case and all other
plain error cases; it's a narrow category of cases
involving ex post facto violations?
MR. FAHRINGER: In the -- in this very
narrow category, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you call it an ex
post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with
the government; it's a due process violation.
MR. FAHRINGER: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what happened is
improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre-
-- pre-statute conduct. But it might have been evidence
that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason.
That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation.
What is special about the fact that the
reason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was
that it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the
statute?
MR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, as I know, you
are aware of the Marks case. They held that the ex post
facto concept applied to judicial precedent as well, and
that was repeated in the Harris case in -- as well. But
I think, Your Honor, certainly the whole strength and --
and weight of the ex post facto law is present here.
The Second Circuit said that it certainly involves ex
post facto implications. What you are doing is, you're
taking conduct that violates no law before the law is
passed, and you're taking --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And when a State court
allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an
ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State
court judgment. But that's not what occurred here.
What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury
consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction,
which it should not have let the jury consider.
And there's a lot of evidence that a court
should not have let the jury consider. I don't see
anything particularly special about fact that the reason
this evidence shouldn't have been before the jury was
that it occurred before the statute.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But it not only allowed
the evidence before the jury, but it also told the jury
it was sufficient to convict.
MR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, that's right.
It -- it -- what is special about it is -- I think it's an
extremely rare and irregular case that would allow 2
years of conduct to come into a case --
JUSTICE ALITO: What if the -- what if the
period -- the -- the period that was charged started 1
day before the statute took effect?
MR. FAHRINGER: Well, if it was -- Your
Honor, my stand --
JUSTICE ALITO: Would -- would the test
be different? Now, if you have 1 day of pre-enactment
conduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based
on that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't
it? And so, therefore, if the test is any possibility,
the result is automatic new trial in that situation.
Is -- is that where your argument leads?
MR. FAHRINGER: My argument is, Your Honor,
that no person in this country under our Constitution
should be tried for 1 day on conduct that did not
violate a law. I -- I --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. And also no
person should be convicted with a confession that was
coerced. And no person should be convicted with
evidence given under torture. And no person should be
convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police.
Now, for all those latter things, every
court apparently uses the normal standard. So why would
we in this case use a special standard?
MR. FAHRINGER: Well, it's different, Your
Honor. In all of those cases, there was a law, at least
giving the court jurisdiction, that was violated. There's
a very serious question here whether there was
jurisdiction when they came in. Jurisdiction is derived
solely through statutes that are violated in the
criminal field.
There were no statutes. So there's a
serious question of whether there was even jurisdiction.
But -- but what's different is it seems to me if you
have a law, a mail fraud law, and then there is some sort
of a violation and a -- a suppression of evidence or
whatever other arguments you're going to make,
that's -- that's light years away from a situation where
there's absolutely no law to -- to violate. And the
conduct --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and,
therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.
MR. FAHRINGER: I beg your pardon.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There's also no violation
of the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of
the Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law
shall be passed.
MR. FAHRINGER: But, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have -- you don't
have an ex post facto law that was passed here.
You have an incorrect jury charge. You have
the judge telling the jury that you could convict on the
basis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't.
That is not an ex post facto law.
MR. FAHRINGER: But, Your Honor, I -- I --
in all due respect, I invite your attention to your
case in Marks and -- and the Harris case where they have
said that we have extended ex post facto to obviously
a -- a whole host of cases now that involve judicial
precedent and -- and the actions of prosecutors
and what not.
This, I can't imagine in a way in terms of
the concept of ex post facto to put in 2 years of
conduct that is not in violation of any law, that
certainly fits within the presiding spirit of the ex
post facto concept that people shouldn't -- you know, if
you want to go back to our very basics, and that's what
unique about this case, the entitlement to notice of
what conduct is to be avoided, a statute that tells you
what conduct you have to avoid, and all those --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking for Marks, where
is that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?
MR. FAHRINGER: Beg your pardon, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You have mentioned several
times the Marks case. What case is --
MR. FAHRINGER: M-A-R-K-S.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?
MR. FAHRINGER: That's in -- in our --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it in your brief?
MR. FAHRINGER: I -- I believe it was cited
in our brief, Your Honor. I will give you that in just
a moment, if I may. But -- but I'm under the
impression, Your Honor, from our research that there
were a number of cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, see, I don't know
what that case is. If it was a case in which we
reversed a State supreme court because the State supreme
court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that
made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could
say that was an ex post facto violation through the
Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. FAHRINGER: I think this comment is
relevant to what you just said. Our forefathers in --
in imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the
few that they imposed on the States as well as the
Federal Government, and I think that lends it force in a
sense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as
does the Federal Government.
But we feel, under all those circumstances
here, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very
critical fact, and that is the enormity of the error
here at being a -- a constitutional error, and we
certainly think a structural error, structural error in
the sense that it ran from the beginning of the case. The
grand jury should not have indicted on conduct that
violated no law. He should not have been arraigned. He
should not have been tried. He should not have
convicted. He should not have been considered. All of
this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your position
that two concurring judges said that evidence should not
have been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the
jury should have been told you can convict only on
post -- whatever the date was? But they also pointed
out that one of the most severe incidents fell in the
post-enactment period. It was in April of 2001. It
was -- and that was vivid evidence properly --
properly used by the jury to determine guilt or
innocence.
MR. FAHRINGER: I -- I understand that, and
I think I know what you are referring to, Your Honor.
I find much of the evidence in this case extremely
distasteful, but we are operating under a land of laws
and Constitution. And it seems to me his rights are as
important -- I know this Court appreciates that -- as
any other person's.
And the truth of the matter is that much of
this very unattractive evidence came in before the law
was ever enacted. And I think what happens is -- and this
is a reality psychologically -- it all blends together, it
all comes together. And without any kind of
instruction. I -- my view would be, under ex post facto
principles, it would have ordinarily been excluded. It
wouldn't have been brought in.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. This -- this
evidence was improper because if the legislature had
made that action punishable when it occurred before the
statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of
the Ex Post Facto Clause. Now, in fact, the legislature
didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation
of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But we do have the
admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted,
which is no different from evidence that should have not
been admitted for some other reason.
For example, where the -- where the court
gives an instruction that permits evidence to be
considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is
irrelevant to the crime. And the jury says you can
find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up
in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with
the crime.
Why is this any different from that? It's
just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed
to use for conviction. I don't see why there is
anything special about the fact that the reason it
shouldn't be used for conviction --
MR. FAHRINGER: In all due --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is because it occurred
pre-statute.
MR. FAHRINGER: In all due respect, Your
Honor, I believe the cases and Supreme Court cases have
held that the ex post facto law has been extended to
judicial precedent. And we cite those cases, Your
Honor, in our brief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I thought
what we have said that it's just a violation of due
process to convict someone for conduct that was not
criminal when the conduct was -- was made. It's --
it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process
violation. It just -- it's a serious due process
violation.
MR. FAHRINGER: I think you're right, Your
Honor, in the sense that it's an ex post facto law being
applied through the Due Process Clause. But the impact and
the force of that, I think, is still just as great and
just as powerful. And -- and -- and the error here
factually is -- is absolutely enormous.
And -- and what I think the very least a
defendant in his position is entitled to is -- he's
suffering under a 9-year sentence. I think he is
entitled to have another trial where he is only confronted
with the evidence that came after the statute. And if
they're going to put in evidence that goes before that,
they would have to justify that under one of a number of
different concepts, Rule 404(b) or one of the others.
And we would argue in that context -- none of
this was ever done in court -- under 403, if it was too
extensive, the prejudice outweighs the probative value.
And I think that many judges would be sympathetic to
that, for putting in a whole 2 years of conduct. Some
might come in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Courtesy -- courtesy of
Justice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks
case. And the -- the summary of the case at the
beginning says: "Petitioners were convicted of
transporting obscene materials in violation of the
Federal statute." "Held: The Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to
petitioners of the Miller standards."
It was a due process case.
MR. FAHRINGER: And the only thing that I would
think of immediately of that is, is the statute here. He
was -- there's no question the -- the -- the conduct
was forbidden by statutes in -- in time, but was applied
in advance of those statutes, before --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, the Due
Process Clause was violated when the court let that in.
MR. FAHRINGER: I don't have a quarrel with
you on that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you have to
persuade us that there is something special about a
violation of the Due Process Clause that lets in
evidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations
that let in other evidence that should not properly be
used to convict the defendant. And I frankly don't --
don't see why it's so special.
MR. FAHRINGER: Your Honor, I'm endeavoring
to pursue it, but somewhat unsuccessfully.
This is not an evidentiary error. It is in
every sense a due -- an ex post facto error, but it is
through the Due Process Clause. I think that there we
meet on common ground. It's through the Due Process
Clause that the Ex Post Facto Clause is made -- made
effective in trial. But the truth of the matter is -- I
mean, the indictment here, which you start with, charged
these crimes going all the way back to January of 1999,
when the Act didn't come -- didn't become effective
until October of 2000.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the conduct
that -- we didn't have -- what if we did not
have pre-enactment conduct? What if we -- if this
statute applies only within the United States, as I
assume that it does, and all of the conduct that's now
pre-enactment was conduct that took place outside the
United States? Would that -- would the case be
different for these purposes?
MR. FAHRINGER: If all the conduct that was
proven at the --
JUSTICE ALITO: Instead of having
pre-enactment conduct, you have conduct in Canada,
Mexico, someplace else.
MR. FAHRINGER: I -- I think it would --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And the jury was
instructed that he could be convicted on the basis of
what had happened in Canada. That would be the same?
MR. FAHRINGER: Yes, that's right. And I --
all I'm suggesting is, wherever the evidence comes from,
it shouldn't be admitted except under one of the very
narrow exceptions, such as Rule 404(b). And we would
argue, under 403, it should be excluded, wherever the
evidence came from. And a judge would -- as I
understand it, a judge would instruct the jury: You
cannot convict Mr. Marcus on any of this evidence
whatsoever that is pre-enactment.
JUSTICE ALITO: No, of course, but the
question is whether the mere possibility standard would
apply in that case as well, or whether you think this
mere possibility standard applies only in the case of
pre-enactment conduct?
MR. FAHRINGER: I think the possibility
standard only applies to ex post facto statute
cases and pre-enactment conduct. That's my view, Your
Honor. I think it's a very narrow holding. And I'm
not urging that this would be the standard for other --
other than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this
would be the standard in ex post facto cases where --
what this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about
it, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule.
What has gone on in the past is we have to
measure. We have to take, on the one hand, the post-
enactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the
pre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I
-- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before
Gideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in
that context whether a person got able representation
until you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright.
Aren't we in the same position here?
Wouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where
clearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment
conduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct
and there is any possibility that the jury convicted on
that, there will be a new trial? It seems that's going
to avoid all of that balancing and weighing and
perennial -- perennial appellate review. That's what I
think is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's
decision. I think that's where there is a great deal of
sense behind it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is,
essentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area;
it's just error because it involved evidence
pre-enactment? That error is enough; it doesn't have to
meet --
MR. FAHRINGER: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have to meet
the standard for plain error?
MR. FAHRINGER: Yes, absolutely. And this
doesn't affect that whatsoever. I mean, I think there's
a misconception among some people. We -- the Second
Circuit took the four Olano factors and applied
them, one, two, three, four. They didn't touch them.
They didn't in any way alter them.
What they did is, on the concept and the
rule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was
purely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't
apply to plain error. Those four prongs have been left
intact. And so they haven't disturbed that in any way
whatsoever. They set those four prongs out in the
preamble of their opinion. Obviously, what they found
was, when you have a case of this magnitude of
pre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that
certainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the
trial and the judicial reputation.
I say it myself. It appeared on the front
page of The New York Times: Man convicted for 2 years
of conduct where there was no law. That, I would guess,
would have an adverse effect on the reputation of our
judicial process, whereas a ruling where a court held
this man should go back and get a new trial on the
conduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct
that violated no law, would enhance the reputation of
the courts.
So applying that factor, we feel strongly
and powerfully that the correct disposition here is to
affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. And
we will go back and we will have a retrial on the conduct
that violated the statute.
If you have no other questions, I -- I thank
you for your attention.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Fahringer.
Mr. Miller, you have 16 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER: Just very brief -- excuse me --
very briefly, I'd like to make two points.
The first is that, essentially, the error in
this case was the failure to give a limiting instruction
relating to the use of pre-enactment evidence, and
that's the same sort of instructional or evidentiary
error that can be considered in a case-specific analysis
under prong four and should have been considered
through that analysis.
The second is that Respondent suggested
there was a lack of jurisdiction in this case. That
argument rests on an understanding of jurisdiction that
this Court rejected in Cotton, and we discussed that at
pages 9 to 11 of our reply brief.
If the Court has no further questions, we
ask that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
