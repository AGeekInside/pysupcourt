Washington State Republican\nParty et al.\nGeneral McKenna.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. McKENNA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn adopting Initiative 872, Washington's\nvoters followed this Court's guidance in California\nDemocratic Party v. Jones. They adopted a top-two\nelection system. By so doing the voters eliminated the\ncrucial constitutional defect of a partisan blanket\nprimary because in the top-two system the voters are no\nlonger selecting the party's nominees for the November\nelection. The Ninth Circuit nonetheless ruled that\nInitiative 872 is unconstitutional, holding that\nallowing each candidate to state his or her personal\nparty preference on the ballot would create the\nappearance of association between a political party and\ncandidate.\nThe Ninth Circuit is wrong for at least two\nreasons. First, the Ninth Circuit's appearance-\nof-association conclusion assumes that top-two ballots\nwill look the same as ballots under a party nominating\nelection system. They will not. The top-two ballot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you give us\nassurance that they will not? I take it we don't -- we\nhaven't had an election under this system, so we don't\nknow what the ballots are going to look like.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. That's\ncorrect. We have not had an election, and the secretary\nof state was enjoined by the district court before\nhaving the opportunity to promulgate the regulations\ngoverning the ballot after 872's adoption.\nHowever, Your Honor, we may look to the\ndeclaration of candidacy form, which the secretary of\nstate did have the opportunity to promulgate, which\nappears in the corrected joint appendix at pages\n592-593. And what we see there, Your Honor, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is that, unlike the old declaration of\ncandidacy form, we have the candidates declaring\nthemselves as a candidate for the office of blank, and\ninstead of saying that they're a candidate of a party,\nthey say -- that you have an opportunity to check off\nthe box that my party preference is blank or I'm -- I am\nan independent candidate; or, under Initiative 872, if\nthey check neither box, that will be left blank on the\nballot.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you say that the purpose\nof allowing a candidate to declare a preference is\nsimply to convey useful information to voters, but once\nyou decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was\nnot going to indicate party affiliation, why do you\nlimit candidates to the names of parties? Why don't you\nallow them to pick some other phrase that better\nexpresses their point of view? Somebody may want to\nsay, I'm the pro-environment candidate, or I'm the\nno-new-taxes candidate. Why do you limit them to saying\nDemocrat, Republican, Libertarian, et cetera?\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, the voters could\nhave chosen to allow candidates to include other\ninformation. In fact, in the State's earliest days\ncandidates were given five words they could use for\nwhatever expression they wished. But the voters chose\nto allow an expression of party preference, which the\nState is allowed to do. The State is not required to\nallow the ballot to be a form -- forum for political\nexpression, but the State is allowed to do so and has\nchosen to do in this way.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is that and wasn't the\npurpose that was offered by the proponent of the\ninitiative to try to get around the decision in Jones,\nto change the system as little as possible?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor, because there\nis an immense difference between the top-two system and\nthe system that replaces the old blanket nominating\nprimary. The immense difference is of course that the\nfirst stage of this two-stage general election process\nis no longer being used to select the nominees of the\nparties, which was identified as the one characteristic\nin Jones --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Justice Alito can defend\nhis own question, but he asked whether or not the Grange\nstated that this was the purpose.\nMR. McKENNA: Well, the Grange was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then you -- you didn't\nquite answer that question. You said, oh no, and you\ngave an explanation. But just as a matter of the\nhistorical record --\nMR. McKENNA: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Justice Alito's\nquestion was accurate with respect to the proponent's\nposition, was it not?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, but the\nGrange also said in the voters' pamphlet statement,\nquote, \"This system has all the characteristics of a\npartisan blanket primary save the constitutionally\ncrucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a\nprimary's nominee.\" That's Joint Appendix 79.\nSo, yes, they were campaigning for it, but I\nbelieve that the relevant State purpose or regulatory\ninterest in allowing an expression of party preference\nis the same as we see referenced in Tashjian and in\nAnderson v. Celebrezze.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's your\nposition that the parties are not really injured or\naffected by this, and the parties' position is that they\nare, who should we believe? I mean, it's hard for you\nto tell the parties that they don't know what's in their\nbest interest.\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, this is a facial\nchallenge. All the major cases underlying this one were\nas-applied challenges. The parties were able to bring\nin, in all those cases, evidence. There is no evidence\nin the record that the parties will be harmed by the\nexpression of party preference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We know what -- what it's\ngoing to be like. We don't know the exact phrasing on\nthe ballot, but we do know that a candidate is allowed\nto associate himself with a party, but a party is not\nallowed to disociate itself from the candidate.\nI am less concerned about the fact that the\ncandidate can't say I'm the -- I'm the no-taxes\ncandidate, than I am about the fact that he can\nassociate himself with the Republican Party or the\nDemocratic Party on the ballot and that party has no\nopportunity on the ballot to say, we have nothing to do\nwith this person. That it seems to me is a great\ndisadvantage to the parties.\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Scalia, there may be\nan association in the dictionary sense, in the same way\nthat a candidate who expressed a preference for one\npublic policy versus another may be associated. But in\nthe constitutional sense, this Court has found that\nthere is a forced association only when the objecting\nparty is compelled to speak it or when the objecting\nparty is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about a\nFirst Amendment forced association. I'm talking about\nan association for purposes of making this a fair\nelection at which the parties have an opportunity to\nnominate and support their own candidates. And what\nthis system creates is a ballot in which an individual\ncan associate himself with the Republican Party, but on\nthe ballot the Republican Party is unable to dissociate\nitself from that candidate.\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, I would refer the\nJustices to pages 2 and 3 of the Grange yellow brief\nwhere two sample ballots are laid out that incorporate\nthe language from the declaration of candidacy\nregulations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you telling us\nthat that's what the ballots are going to look like?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. I believe\nthis is what the ballots will look like. And -- and\nuntil the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have two choices and\nI think there's another one on page 12, is there not?\nSo are you representing, General McKenna, that one of\nthese will be what the State of Washington ballot will\nlook like?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Ginsburg, these are\ntwo examples of what the ballot is likely to look like,\nalthough it's frankly also likely to have even more\ninformation stating the difference between expressing a\npreference and expressing a formal association.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Will, will it say whether\nthe party that is preferred likes this candidate?\nMR. McKENNA: It will say, Your Honor, if\nyou would look to the sample --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you can say yes or\nno to that. Will it say whether the party for which he\nexpresses a preference claims or disclaims him?\nMR. McKENNA: It will stay that it is not a\nstatement by the political party identifying that\ncandidate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Please answer yes or no.\nWill it say whether the party for which he has expressed\na preference claims or disavows him?\nMR. McKENNA: It will not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: General, as I understand it\nthe parties are now free to come up with any scheme they\nwant to for selecting an official candidate.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume the Democratic\nParty decides to have a State convention. If the law in\nWashington provided that the nominee selected by that\nconvention could state on the ballot not merely a\npreference for Democrats, but a statement that, I am the\nnominee of the Democratic Party, your position in this\ncase I take it would be exactly the same.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, it would.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question.\nIs there anything in the State law that would prevent\nyou from requiring a candidate to be a member of the\nparty whose preference he states?\nMR. McKENNA: There would not be, Justice\nStevens, no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And under the -- under the\ncourt's, holding it would be equally unconstitutional if\nhe did that, I suppose.\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, it would be\nequally constitutional if we prevented someone, yes,\nsir, from expressing a party preference or affiliation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Indeed, there's -- I'm\nsorry. Go ahead.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Will the ballots necessarily\nbe the same in every county?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, because they\nwill be promulgated under regulations established by the\nState secretary of state.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Some of the counties have\npaper ballots, some of the counties have -- is that\ncorrect?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. But in\nWashington State nearly all voters vote by mail now. So\nthey -- over 90 percent of voters and eventually nearly\n100 percent of voters will be voting by mail and will\nreceive the same ballot form, with the same ballot\ninstructions and explanations as in the samples that\nI've showed you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- Iis there any, what\nshould I say, truth investigation by the State of\nWashington? Suppose a candidate who has been a Democrat\nall his life, has run for office as a Democrat, agrees\nwith all the positions of the Democratic Party, chooses\nto state on the ballot: I prefer the Republican Party.\nThat's okay?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. I would\nrefer you, Justice Scalia to JA-415. Section 9.5(5) of\nInitiative 872 requires the candidate to sign a\nnotarized declaration, quote, \"stating that the\ninformation provided on the form is true.\" So they are\nsigning declarations -- a declaration which is notarized\nsaying that everything that they have put on the form is\ntrue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess -- how can you say\nit's false?\nMR. McKENNA: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If he thinks he prefers it,\nI guess he prefers it, even though it's contrary to his\nentire life.\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Justice Scalia, it is\nexpression of preference. It is a subjective\nexpression. It would be difficult to disprove.\nHowever, if a candidate were to -- let's say the\nchairman of the State Republican Party filed a\ndeclaration of candidacy and said, I prefer the\nDemocratic Party. The Democratic Party would have many\nopportunities to object. And you know, the ballot is\nnot even the most important source of information that\nvoters have, as this Court has recognized in Tashjian\nand Celebrezze. So there would be many opportunities.\nIf there is a concern about false\nstatements, Your Honor, it seems to me the correct\napproach is to provide for more speech, not to limit the\nspeech of all the candidates by refusing to permit them\nto express their preferences.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence, any\nhistorical evidence, that any candidate has ever done\nwhat Justice Scalia suggests?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor. I'm not\naware of any specific instance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There just hasn't\nbeen an election under this, under this law, right?\nMR. McKENNA: Correct Mr. Chief Justice. We\nhave not had a chance to even hold an election.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is evidence\nthat, in other States, those who preached racial hatred\nhave tried to associate themselves with a particular\nparty, much to the concern of that party, and I see\nnothing in your position that would prevent that.\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, the\ncandidates will be expressing a preference, this is true\nif they wish to. But there will be many -- first of\nall, that is not compelled speech by the party; and\nsecondly, it is not compelling the party to accept that\nperson as a member, as a member. As the emergency rules\nfor the declaration and as a sample ballot show, we'll\nbe very explicit in explaining to the voters that\nsomeone claiming a preference, it's not a statement by\nthe party that they're claiming the person as a member\nor a formal association.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is the remedy for the\nparty, you said, to have more speech for the party, to\nsay that this is not their candidate, etcetera?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, that is\nexactly what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But this Court has said\nthat parties could be strictly limited in the amount of\nmoneys they spend to endorse a particular candidate.\nMR. McKENNA: But there will be many\nopportunities --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't think the law can\nhave it both ways.\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, if I can use an\nexample that might help illustrate our point. Imagine\nthat Mr. Dale from the Boy Scouts v. Dale case moved to\nWashington State and wanted to run for office, and\nimagine that, instead of saying party preference, the\nvoters had said, well, you can choose to list any\norganization for which you have a preference, a\npolitical organization or another; and that Mr. Dale\ndecided to express a preference for the Boy Scouts.\nMr. Dale would be exercising his own speech, but that\nwould not be the same thing as compelling speech by the\nBoy Scouts. Nor would he be compelling --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nobody is voting for\nMr. Dale perhaps on the misimpression that he is\naffiliated with the Boy Scouts, and that's what\nundermines the Boy Scouts' associational rights. People\nare going to think he's associated with the Boy Scouts\neven though they may want to disassociate themselves\nwith him.\nMR. McKENNA: Allowing -- Mr. Chief Justice,\nallowing Mr. Dale to say he has a preference for the Boy\nScouts I don't think can reasonably be confused with him\nclaiming that he is a member, particularly when as\napplied --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that if\nit were that way, in other words if the ballot looked\nlike the ballot on page 1 of the Grange reply brief,\nthat that would be unconstitutional?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, it would be\nharder to argue from our side. But Your Honor, the\nNinth Circuit only assumed that the ballot would look\nlike the ballot on page 1 of the Grange yellow brief.\nThey assumed that the ballot would look exactly like the\nballot in a nominating primary, and our point here is\nthat it will not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do these preference\nstatements continue under the general election?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, they do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you change\nbetween the primary and the general election? Can you\nsay my preferred party is the Republican Party, so you\nget more Republican votes to get you over the hump so\nyou are one of the two, and then in the general election\nsay, my preference is the Democratic Party, because\nthere are more Democratic voters?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Mr. Chief Justice. State\nlaw would not permit that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why can't you do that,\nif the purpose is to provide accurate information about\na candidate's position. Suppose the candidate prefers\none party at the time of the primary and then something\nhappens. The issues change. The person -- the\ncandidate says: Well, now my preference is really for\nthe other party. I was close before and I've swung over\nto the other side. If that's accurate information about\nwhere the candidate stands at the time of the general\nelection, why can't that be put on the ballot, unless\nyou're trying to indicate affiliation rather than really\npreference?\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, the State could\nhave chosen to allow people to change their preference\nexpression. But the State did not and the State is not\nrequired to do so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying --\nyour argument is that they have a First Amendment right\nto put their preference on the ballot, but somehow when\nthe general election comes along that First Amendment\nright evaporates.\nMR. McKENNA: There is also -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, there is also an important practical\nconsideration here. And the Court has recognized the\nState has regulatory practical interests --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General McKenna, may I\nask you at that point --\nMR. McKENNA: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if that's a correct\nstatement of your position.\nI didn't understand you to take the position\nthat a candidate has a constitutional right to state on\nthe ballot. The State of Washington has chosen to give\nthe candidate that option, but is -- I have not read\nanything in your brief that suggests that a candidate\nhas a right to do so.\nMR. McKENNA: You're correct, Justice\nGinsburg. I did not mean to suggest that candidates\nhave a constitutional right to have any information on\nthe ballot like an expression of party preference. And\nI was about to say, there is a very important practical\nreason to require candidates to decide what their\npreference will be listed as and to keep it the same.\nThe reason is that we have to have time to print the\nballots and produce the ballots in time to send out 3\nweeks before the election, when over 90 percent of\nvoters begin voting by mail.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did say that it\nis unlikely voters will be mistaken, that they will\nmistakenly consider a statement of party preference to\nbe the equivalent of a party endorsement. You did say\nthat, and on what basis are you predicting that the\nstatement of preference will not be confused with a\nstatement of endorsement?\nMR. McKENNA: On two bases, Justice\nGinsburg. The first basis is that, as we've shown with\nthe sample ballots from the Grange brief, the State will\nbe extremely explicit in stating that the candidate's\nclaim of preference or statement of preference is not\nthe party's statement that the candidate is a member,\nendorsee, nominee, or what have you.\nThe second basis is I think just the general\nbasis this Court has recognized in Tasjian and in\nAnderson v. Cellebreze, where the Court expressed a\ngreater faith in the ability of individual voters to\ninform themselves beyond just the balance. There are so\nmany other sources of information.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's enough\nthat -- that there's no claim of party endorsement.\nThere is a claim of associating himself with the party,\nand if he associates himself with the party it seems to\nme the party should be able to disassociate itself from\nhim. And I think it harms the party not to permit that.\nMR. McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia, I\nrespectfully disagree. This is not an association in\nthe constitutional sense. It is merely an expression of\npreference, which we -- which Initiative 872 in its open\nlanguage and which the ballot will carefully distinguish\nfrom claiming a formal association.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know any Democrats\nwho go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who\ndo not regard themselves and register themselves as\nDemocrats? I mean, in the real world I don't know\nthat -- I don't know whether this is fatal to your case,\nbut in the real world, it seems to me the distinction\nyou're drawing is simply not drawn.\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, I think it's\nhelpful to think of the expression of party preference\nas a subset of party affiliation. In other words,\nsomeone might be a party affiliate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's helpful to your case,\nbut, going back to my question, do you know any people\nwho go around saying, well, you know, I really prefer\nthe Democrats; I'm a Republican myself? I mean that,\nthat doesn't happen.\nMR. McKENNA: Well, the example of Senator\nLieberman comes to mind, where he said I really prefer\nthe Democrats and I'm running as an independent.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's always one.\nBut seriously, as a systemic matter, do you\nreally think that's -- that's a distinction that anyone\nwould recognize?\nMR. McKENNA: I think that we are permitted\nto allow people to express their preference. Many of\nthese people who do so would be independents, I think.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that isn't\nresponsive to my question. Do you really think that\nthat distinction is a distinction which is accepted as a\nworking way of thinking in this world?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes. Yes, I do, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You really do?\nMR. McKENNA: In Washington State over 40\npercent of the voters, for example, identify themselves\nby -- as independents. Keeping in mind we have no party\nregistration in Washington State, over 40 percent of\nvoters when asked say I'm an independent; I may -- and\nthat does not mean they may not prefer one party over\nthe other, they may not generally vote for one party or\nthe other, but they think of themselves as independent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it means that they --\nthey will prefer the candidate of one party or another,\nassuming they vote and there's no independent candidate\nrunning. But it seems to me that the very declaration,\nthe very assumption of status as an independent says, I\ndon't as a systemic matter prefer one party to the\nother; a pox on both their houses.\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Souter, it may also\nmean that I choose not to formally affiliate with the\nparty, even though I prefer that party's policies,\ngoals. You look at the independent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It could. But do you\nreally think, again, in the real world, that that's why\npeople register themselves as independents?\nMR. McKENNA: We have no registration in\nWashington State, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, however the statement\nis made.\nMR. McKENNA: There have been a number of\ncases where individuals have run -- have run for office\nas independents and then have chosen to, you know,\nattend the caucus meetings of the Democratic Party, for\nexample. So, yes, it does happen. And the point is\nthat people are allowed to do this, but they're not\nrequired to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General McKenna, I'm\ninterested in how this new system meshes with the\notherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election\nlaws. For example, the major political parties have a\ncertain -- certain benefits that are not given to minor\nparties, and the major parties are determined on the\nbasis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I\nthink it's 5 percent, in a statewide election. How are\nyou going to figure out whether the Republican Party\nhas, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is\nsomebody who expresses a preference for the Republican\nParty, although he's not really a Republican?\nMR. McKENNA: Your Honor, as legal counsel\nfor the State we've analyzed that question, and have\nconcluded that unless and until the legislature chooses\nto alter the statute to harmonize at a practical level,\nthe way that we will apply that statute is to count the\nvotes of the party cast for the party's official\nnominee. The person who has been identified the party\nthrough their separate nominating process, for example,\nthrough a convention, that person will be identified.\nAnd they will campaign as \"the nominee.\" They will\nexplain that to the voters in every way possible, and we\nwill count the votes cast for that person in calculating\nwhether the 5 percent threshold has been met.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask the\ncounsel for the Respondents, and you can answer as well,\ncan you explain to me briefly the existing structure for\nthe Republican Party, the Democratic Party, to say\nMr. Smith is our nominee?\nMR. McKENNA: Well, the Initiative 872,\nJustice Kennedy, repealed the old State law which\nrequired the parties to use the State primary to select\ntheir nominees. And Initiative 872, in fact, is silent\non the procedures the parties will follow. So they are\nleft as they were back in the early days of statehood to\ndecide for themselves how to designate their nominees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they have not devised a\nstructure that we know of?\nMR. McKENNA: No. Actually, Your Honor,\nthey have. In fact, the Republican Party after\nInitiative 872 was adopted and before it was enjoined\nadopted rules and procedures for holding nominating\nconventions.\nAnd they also, for example, adopted a rule,\nwhich is Rule 5, that they said that if an incumbent\nruns and receives 66 percent of the support at the\nnominating convention, no other Republican can go onto\nthe ballot. This is their claim. No other Republican\ncan go onto the first stage ballot and claim to be a\nRepublican. That is their assertion. Only that one\nperson can go on with the \"R\" after his name -- an idea\nthat we basically reject if it means that no one else\ncan even express a preference for the Republican Party.\nBut we agree that only one candidate will be\nallowed to truthfully claim that he or she is the\nnominee of the party if the party has gone through a\nnominating process of its own.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But may not claim that on\nthe ballot itself?\nMR. McKENNA: Correct, Justice Souter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not allowed\nto split the ballot in their preference, are they, say I\nprefer one party on domestic issues, I prefer the other\nparty's position on foreign affairs?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Mr. Chief Justice, they\nare not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One of the briefs says that\nthe Republicans -- I think the Republicans or the\nDemocrats checked with the, with the State election\nofficials who said that there's no provision for\nconvention, for nomination by convention.\nMR. McKENNA: Justice Scalia, they did not\ncheck with the State officials. They cite in the record\nletters from a couple of county auditors. But the\ncounty auditors have no independent authority. They\noperate under the secretary of state's rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So they can-- they can\nconduct conventions if they wish?\nMR. McKENNA: Yes, sir, Justice Scalia, they\nmay.\nI would just like to close this part of my\nargument, if I may, by pointing out that in our view the\nvoters have adopted a top-two election system which\nvindicates both the rights of the parties and the\npeople. The parties can select their standardbearers\nwithout any State interference, adopting their own\nnomination process.\nAnd the people are not limited to candidates\nselected by the parties. They have more choice, which\nis a value that was validated in the Jones decision,\nalbeit holding that you can't do that with nonmembers\nselecting the party's nominees.\nThe parties, though, argue that no candidate\ncan even state an expression of party preference, cannot\nmake an expression of party preference on the ballot\nwithout the party's consent. Taken to its logical\nconclusion, the parties are really claiming they have a\nFirst Amendment right to require the State to place a\nsingle candidate of their choosing on the ballot.\nIf you look at the joint appendix, page\n13 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But clearly, it's\njust like a trademark case. I mean, they're claiming\ntheir people are going to be confused. They are going\nto think this person is affiliated with the Democratic\nor Republican Party when they may, in fact, not be at\nall.\nMR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, they make\nthat claim without the benefit of any evidence. The\nNinth Circuit and the district court and the parties\nsimply assume this will happen, and they assume, for\nexample, that ballot looks just like the old nominating\nprimary ballot, when, in fact, as we've shown, it\nclearly will not. And, of course, we don't believe\ntrademark law applies here in this case, although I can\naddress that if you wish.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't suggest it\nwould be a trademark violation. I think I said it was\njust like the same analysis. And I don't know why you\nwould give greater protection to the makers of products\nthan you give to people in the political process.\nMR. McKENNA: They deserve protection, of\ncourse, Mr. Chief Justice. The question is whether or\nnot merely allowing someone to express their party\npreference somehow will mislead the voters. This Court\nhas shown more faith in the voters than that.\nI'll reserve the balance of my time. Thank\nyou, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. White.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. WHITE, JR.\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. WHITE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nCandidates are the party's messengers to win\nover the public on the important issues of the day.\nInitiative 872 converts the established right of\npolitical parties to select their messengers into a mere\nright to endorse.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you\nsay about the fact that you have a right to select and\ndesignate an official candidate and it's independent of\nthis ballot procedures?\nMR. WHITE: As the secretary of state\npointed out -- and this is at JA-363 -- the secretary of\nstate indicated the State would pay no attention to the\nparty's nominating conventions and instead would\ncontinue to allow candidates to use party labels just as\nthey had in the primary before.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. If the rationale in\nJones was that the defect was that the association,\npolitical association, was being adulterated by the\nmethod of, of the use of ballots, to select what was an\nofficial nominee, that problem does not exist here.\nMR. WHITE: It does, it does, Your Honor.\nAnd it does in the manner that this -- the candidates\nwho were selected at the Initiative 872, the modified\nblanket primary, are going to be carrying the party's\nstandard in the general election.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying in practical\nterms, this is a nomination, even though there may be a\nseparate official nomination that nobody pays attention\nto?\nMR. WHITE: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why is one party going\nto the trouble of establishing a convention system to\nmake nominations?\nMR. WHITE: We adopted -- the Republican\nParty, the Democratic Party and the Libertarian Party\nall adopted rules governing nomination of our candidates\nby convention. We corresponded with all of the county\nauditors who would be conducting partisan elections in\n2005, and we received identical letters from all four of\nthem indicating that they had consulted with the\nSecretary of State and that the initiative contemplated\nno partisan nomination process separate and apart from\nthe primary. The Secretary of State received copies of\nthose letters; the Secretary of State's public\nstatements with respect to those letters was that they\nwould pay no attention to the nominating process.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they will pay no\nattention, I take it, in the sense that there will be\nnothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot\nitself. But as I -- I am also assuming that the parties\nthrough a convention, or whatever other scheme they can\ncome up with, can -- can designate an official nominee\nquite independently of this ballot. And if they do so\ndesignate, they can campaign on that person's behalf.\nThe person in campaigning can say, I am the official\nnominee of the X party. And those facts are true,\naren't they?\nMR. WHITE: They are, Your Honor, but that\nconverts the right to nominate to a mere right to\nendorse, and this Court has recognized that the ability\nto endorse a candidate is no substitute --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying that a right\nto nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from\nthe ballot except the nominee -- everyone from the\nballot under that banner, from the nominee.\nMR. WHITE: To be -- to be a meaningful\nright to nominate, yes, Your Honor. It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does that right\ncome from? I thought in Jones, the Court had said if\nyou had just a blanket primary, with no indication of\nparty affiliation, that that would be constitutional.\nAnd if that's so, then parties don't have any right to\nhave a candidate.\nMR. WHITE: I'm not suggesting that the\nparties have a constitutional right to place their party\nname on a truly nonpartisan ballot, and I think what the\nJones Court was hypothesizing was the true nonpartisan\nprimary where there are no party identifications. Our\nobjection is not to a -- necessarily to a nonpartisan\nballot. It's to a partisan ballot where the State is\ngoing to put someone else on that ballot using our\nparty's name and competing against our nominee under --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would have no\nobjection if this - everything was the same, except no\nparty affiliation were shown.\nMR. WHITE: That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be\nconstitutional?\nMR. WHITE: That would not violate our First\nAmendment rights, Your Honor. Washington --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nIt's hypothetical, I suppose, but supposing the statute\nfurther provided that a candidate may not designate a\npreference unless he has been a registered member of\nthat party for at least a year, and otherwise the\nstatute is exactly how it is now. Would that be\nconstitutional?\nMR. WHITE: No, Your Honor, because the\nState is still then resolving what is an internal\nfactional fight between real Republicans using a blanket\nballot where voters from rival parties are able to\ndetermine --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In my hypothesis the\nperson is a real Republican. He is just not the one\nselected as the candidate.\nMR. WHITE: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthen the blanket is still selecting which Republican\nadvances to the general election.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, it's not just a\nrhetorical flourish. It's true; when the State says\nthat you take the position that you are entitled to say\non the ballot who your nominee is, that has to be a\ncorrect statement of your position given this statute\nand given the issues presented to us here.\nMR. WHITE: I'm -- I'm not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or is that just somewhat\nhyperbolic? It seems to me he is right based on your --\non the position you're now stating.\nMR. WHITE: The political parties have the\nright to nominate their candidate and restrict the use\nof the party name to candidates who have been authorized\nto use that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand you to\nsay that you have a right to a partisan process in which\nyour -- only your nominee is shown. I thought you're\nsaying that if it is a process in which party\naffiliation is shown, then your endorsed candidate\nshould be set aside somehow.\nMR. WHITE: That, that -- that is our -- is\nour position, Justice Scalia. We are not suggesting we\nhave a right to a partisan process. Washington's\nconstitution makes its legislative elections a partisan\nprocess, but once the State has decided to use partisan\nidentification as the sole information that's presented\non the ballot, it is telling the voters that this is the\nmost important thing for you to be considering when you\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the information is\nby statute true, in my hypothetical he must be a member,\nbut still you make the same objections.\nMR. WHITE: Yes, Your Honor. As this Court\npointed out in Jones with the comparison of the Mario\nCuomo/Edward Koch race, it is for the political parties\nto be able to resolve that internal party competition.\nInitiative 872 still uses blank --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're stating to suppress\ninformation. So the plaintiff says there is nothing to\nprevent the nominee or the convention from publicizing\nwidely the fact that the convention picked me as their\nstandard bearer. The fact that some other member of the\nparty gets his name on the ballot doesn't prevent the\npublic from being informed about the truth, does it?\nMR. WHITE: Perhaps I misunderstood your\nquestion, Justice Stevens. The Republican Party would\nnot prevent the unsuccessful candidate from running in\nthe election. He could run --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would prevent him from\nrunning and saying he is a Republican.\nMR. WHITE: On -- having him listed on the\nballot where the State is indicating that that is the\nmost important information to consider, the partisan\naffiliation, and the State has hypothesized through the\nGrange reply brief that there are all these other\npossible formulations to ballot. However, before the\nNinth Circuit, in the State's petition appendix at page\n24a, the Ninth Circuit squarely put to the State's\nattorney the question: How would candidates be\ndesignated on the ballot where you had two Republicans\nwho had competed against each other in the party's\nnominating process, and one had been selected; and a\nthird candidate who had absolutely no affiliation with\nthe party also entered the race. And the State told the\nNinth Circuit yes, they would be identified identically\non the ballot.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there were an\nempirical study that Washington voters know about this\nsystem, and that 80 percent of the Washington voters\nknow that the party has not endorsed any one of these --\nall of these candidates. That it's just say a statement\nof preference, that that's all it means; the voters know\nthis. Is your position the same?\nMR. WHITE: Yes, Your Honor. The notion\nthat disclaimers are necessary, and the State indicates\nthat they will spend a million dollars to try to clear\nthis up, is evidence of the confusion that's likely to\noccur. But even if the State does come forward and put\nall these disclaimers and preferences on, what the State\nis essentially doing on the ballot is masking who the\nRepublican Party's nominee is by the presence of other\ncandidates --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but my submission,\nor my hypothetical and it's just a hypothetical, is that\nno one is misled by this.\nMR. WHITE: Do we know --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Accept the hypothetical as\ntrue. Then what's the injury?\nMR. WHITE: The interest then is that you\nstill have two Republican-identified candidates who are\npurporting to carry the party's message to the voters,\nand the voters are resolving that intra-party\ncompetition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have, for\nexample, a disclaimer, it seems to me that undermines\nyour argument that they are successfully, anyway,\npurporting to carry the party's message.\nMR. WHITE: Well, if you have the\ndisclaimer, Your Honor, and the statements that this\ndoesn't really mean anything, then you would come to the\nquestion of what legitimate State interest is being\nadvanced by having someone put Republican on the ballot\nas their party preference, when it in fact means\nnothing; it does not mean they are associated with the\nparty. It does not mean --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does one associate --\nthis one -- I think General McKenna told us that in the\nState of Washington people do not register membership in\none party or the other, so how does the Republican Party\ndetermine who is a Republican?\nMR. WHITE: At -- do you mean a legitimate\nRepublican candidate? Or --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, who do you consider a\nmember of the party? If you say I am a Republican in\nthe State of Washington, what does that mean? It\ndoesn't mean I registered Republican because Washington\ndoesn't register people by party.\nMR. WHITE: The three political parties each\nhave different definitions and ways to become -- ways to\nbecome affiliated with the party. Under the Republican\nParty rules if you identify yourself to the Republican\nParty that yes, I am a Republican, you attend our caucus\nand convention system, you contribute funds to the\nparty, you can be a member of the Republican Party. The\nLibertarians --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Any one of those,\ncontributing funds is enough? You don't have to go to\nthe convention if you are --\nMR. WHITE: You don't have to go to the\nconvention, but there is also a difference there between\nbeing a rank-and-file member and being a spokesman of\nthe party. I'd like to turn to the Libertarians,\nthough, for instance. The Libertarians require you to\nsign a membership application and all members of the\nLibertarian Party in Washington must sign a pledge that\nthey oppose the use of force in the resolution of\npolitical disputes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Libertarians have a\nlot more rules than the other parties.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you have identified\n-- in the course of your argument, you've identified two\nseparate problems with the -- with the scheme as you see\nit. One is, as you put it, that it masks the identity\nof an official nominee, and the other is that it in\neffect allows competition on the ballot by a person\nunder the same party banner with the official nominee.\nMR. WHITE: Yes. After the party has\nalready resolved its internal disputes and determined\nwho its spokesman will be, the State allows --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. WHITE: -- any candidate to appropriate\nthe name and compete against our nominee.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I -- no, I understand\nthat to be your position, but my question is, and I\nrealize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we\n-- we've got to face it: If the masking of the identity\nof the candidate is the real flaw, then the -- the\nhypothetical that was included in the -- in Jones, in\nthe dictum, of the -- of the party that -- of the ballot\nthat has no party identification whatsoever, that would\nequally be bad, wouldn't it?\nMR. WHITE: No, Your Honor, because what it\nis, in this instance, Initiative 872 is a partisan\nprimary that would mask the identity of the party\nnominee.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if it's the masking\nthat's the problem, the -- the nominee is going to be\njust as well masked on the ballot or better masked on\nthe ballot that allows no statement of preference at\nall.\nMR. WHITE: No, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and I'm not saying\nthat that's fatally your case, but I mean it's -- it's\nsomething we need to be careful about when we're doing\nour thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it.\nMR. WHITE: Well -- and I think it's -- it's\nthe masking in the context of a partisan system. The\nState may elect to have nonpartisan offices, and many\nlocal offices throughout the West are nonpartisan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- but if it's just\nmasking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're\nmaking the same argument that you make when you say, by\nallowing statements of preference, we obscure the\ncharacter of the official nominee and in effect allow\nsomebody to have a -- a second shot at -- at getting\nRepublican support as a Republican.\nIt seems to me that if it's masking in a\npartisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only\none objection and the objection is not so much the\nmasking as it is the submergence of the official\nnomination by allowing competition under the party's\nname by another candidate. Isn't that fair to say?\nMR. WHITE: I -- I think, Justice Souter,\nthat it -- that it is two separate inquiries. First you\nhave the difficulty that as a practical matter these\ncandidates will be identified as Republican nominees or\nRepublican candidates, but even if the State were able\nto posit sufficient disclaimers and caveats, that the\nState has shown no valid interest in allowing a\ncandidate to use the name --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but don't you think\nit's relevant information? Wouldn't a voter like to\nknow whether a person preferred the Democrats or the\nRepublicans?\nMR. WHITE: Well, it's -- it's relevant\ninformation, Justice Stevens, only to the extent that it\nconnects the candidate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Only if true.\nMR. WHITE: To -- to the extent it connects\nthe candidate to the political party and its positions\non the issues. And as the State points out in its reply\nbrief --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question:\nThis is a facial challenge, is it not?\nMR. WHITE: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what exactly -- what\nrelief did the district court grant? Did he enjoin the\nentire blanket primary or just the designation of\nparties?\nMR. WHITE: The district court enjoined the\nentirety of Initiative 872 because it determined that\nthe party preference provisions of Initiative 872 were\nnot severable under Washington State's test for\nseverability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think that was the\nnarrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the\nconstitutional difficulty that you see?\nMR. WHITE: I -- I think that was the -- I\nthink that was the appropriate, and it is a narrow\nrelief. The court looked at the structure of the\ninitiative, the connection of the party preference, and\nthe party preference provisions permeate Initiative 872,\nand determined that severability was not appropriate.\nYes, I do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it would be\nadministerable if it was severed, if the preference\nprovision was just deleted?\nMR. WHITE: I'm not -- I'm not sure that it\nwould, Your Honor. I'm not sure that it would because\n-- and what the State and the Grange argued below is\nthat -- they actually argued for severance because that\nwould then convert Initiative 872 into a truly\nnonpartisan primary, but that's not what was on the\nballot. If you take a look at -- it's JA 400.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm confused about the\ndifference between a facial challenge and an as-applied\nchallenge. On the one hand, it's very helpful to you.\nThere's no evidence out there that this has ever -- this\nhas ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it\nright away, but then you have this relief that basically\nenjoins the whole -- whole procedure.\nMR. WHITE: Well, the Court asked General\nMcKenna a question during his argument about whether the\nproblem had ever occurred with a false-flag candidate\ncapturing a party's name on the ballot. It has not\nunder Initiative 872 because it was enjoined before\nbeing effective. But at page JA 239 there's testimony\nthat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it also seems\nhighly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a\nconvention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know\nwho the Republican nominee is, that there's going to be\nsuch confusion that everybody thinks it's one or two of\nthe other people who also put an R after their name.\nThe likelihood of massive confusion seems highly\nimprobable to me. I mean you -- you have your own\nconvention where you nominate the Republican nominee,\nyour preferred candidate, and that's publicized\ngenerally throughout the State, and you're concerned\nthat somebody going into the ballot box won't -- won't\nunderstand what's been going on.\nMR. WHITE: Your Honor, it's -- the State\nhas indicated that our nominee, the unsuccessful nominee\nand the false-flag candidate would all be listed on the\nballot identically. The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, again, the ballot's\nnot the only information available to voters when they\ngo into the polls.\nMR. WHITE: No, but it's the only\ninformation presented to the -- the voters at the\ncritical moment when they're casting their ballot, and\nas this Court has noted in -- with respect to term\nlimits or provision of truthful information regarding\nrace on a ballot, a State cannot put its thumbs on the\nelectoral scales by favoring one group of candidates\nover another.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say the\nsame thing about the candidates' party preferences.\nThey can make that known to the voters in the newspapers\nwhen they run.\nMR. WHITE: That's -- that's exactly the\ncase, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't have the Republican\nParty endorsement, but I prefer the Republican Party.\nMR. WHITE: And with respect to the\nimportance of party designations and party information\non the ballot, last term the Chief Justice, in Wisconsin\nRight to Life, ordered a study that showed that 85\npercent of voters couldn't name a single candidate for\nthe United States House of Representatives in their own\ndistrict, but the -- the voters know the political\nparties. The political parties spent, in our case, a\ncentury and a half and, in the Democratic Party's case,\n200 years developing a message and developing a set of\nprinciples with which the parties are associated, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would be the validity\nor the invalidity, in your view, of a scheme which said\nthat the ballot has one candidate who says, Smith,\nRepublican nominee, and the other candidates -- other\ncandidates say, Republican preference?\nMR. WHITE: I think the question there, Your\nHonor, is what is the legitimate interest of the State\nin putting that information on the ballot? At -- their\nreply brief at page 6, the State says an independent who\ndoes share the views of either the Republican or\nDemocratic Party may prefer the Republican Party. That\npreference may be because that independent is running in\na district that's 70 percent Republican. And the\nquestion is, what is the legitimate interest of the\nState in providing that information that says, I prefer\nthe Republican Party, where it connotes no connotation,\nno --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you can't answer my\nquestion? You can't hypothesize any legitimate State\ninterest for doing that?\nMR. WHITE: I -- I cannot, Your Honor,\nbecause either -- if there is legitimate State interest,\nthe interest is in providing information about that\ncandidate's positions and linkages to the Republican\nParty by saying, my preference is Republican because I\nbelieve what the Republicans are, whether that candidate\nis David Duke, in the Republican case, or in the case of\nthe Democrats, a Lyndon LaRouche candidate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when the Court\nwrites this opinion, what's the fairest statement of the\nState's interest in this requirement? What do you think\nis the fairest statement of the State's interest?\nMR. WHITE: I think the fairest -- the\nfairest statement of the State interest would be that\nthe State has no interest in creating the impression of\nfalse associations or allowing opportunistic candidates\nto appropriate the political party --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think there's no\nlegitimate interest? It's -- it's an unfair question, I\nsuppose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said the\nState's interest was to -- to do what we disapproved in\nJones without seeming to do what we disapproved in\nJones.\nMR. WHITE: That -- that would be an\nacceptable phrasing of the State's interest as well,\nJustice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm going to ask the\nState the same question.\nMR. WHITE: If there are no further\nquestions, Initiative 872 is unconstitutional and the\njudgment of the lower court should be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. White.\nGeneral McKenna, you have 4 minutes\nrelating.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT McKENNA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.\nMR. McKENNA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst of all, Justice Kennedy, the State's\ninterest is what we have said it is all along. It is to\nconvey some information on the ballot in the same way\nthat the party label does. I have noticed that the\npolitical parties have never objected to having their\nnominees listed on the ballot as -- you know, as such.\nIn this case it's an expression of party\npreference, to be sure, and nothing more than that; and\nthere is useful information which is conveyed. We are\nnot required to allow it, but the voters have chosen to\nallow it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you to clarify\nsomething you said during your initial argument? I\nunderstood you to say that the sample ballot on page 1\nof the Grange reply would be unconstitutional.\nMR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor. I did not say\nthat it would be unconstitutional. I said that that\nwould be a different argument. It might be a more\ndifficult argument. The Ninth Circuit assumed that that\nis what the ballot would look like, even though there\nwas not basis for the Ninth Circuit reaching that\nconclusion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I'm wrong. I\nthought you did say it would be unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I did, too.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And could you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have said that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean how would you\ndefend that? I mean --\nMR. McKENNA: Well, I would defend it, Your\nHonor, by saying that this is a facial challenge. Let's\napply it. And if there is evidence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we are\nassuming it is applied in the way that is shown on the\nGrange reply brief at page 1. If it were applied in\nthat way, would that be unconstitutional? It just says\nR or D.\nMR. McKENNA: It would -- it could be\nunconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice, if there were\nevidence that the voters were misled or confused.\nMr. Chief Justice, this is an excellent\nopportunity to point out that the letter after the name,\nwhether it's the letter as on page one of the Grange\nballot or an expression of party preference on pages two\nand three, is not the only information on the ballot.\nAs we've shown in the samples, there will be\nlots of other information on the ballot which clearly\ndistinguishes the expression of party preference.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it also true that,\nby hypothesis, there will be other candidates beside the\none R and the one D? If there aren't at least two R's\nand two D's, there is no problem.\nMR. McKENNA: In the scenario or the ballot\non page 1, Justice Stevens, I believe that what would\nhappen is the Secretary of State would still provide the\nadditional language. If that additional language is not\nprovided, if it were just that bare ballot with no\nexplanatory language, then, yes, it would be much harder\nto defend as being constitutional. But that, in fact,\nis not the way it's going to work.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But my point is there\ncould never be a ballot just like this, what your\nopponents are talking about, because there are always\ngoing to be at least two or three R's and two or three\nD's. And the sample shows there is only one, which must\nthen be the party chosen -- I mean the nominee chosen at\nthe convention.\nMR. McKENNA: But the key here, Your Honor,\nis that even under the ballot on page one, what is not\nhappening under top- two is that the nominee of the\nparty is not being selected. That's not happening any\nmore. And in Jones the Court said that the top-two is\nthe same in all characteristics save one, which is the\nresult of the nominee not being selected.\nAnd that is exactly what is happening under\ntop-two: The nominee is not being selected; and, as\napplied, we are going to be providing lots of other\ninformation on the ballot to make it very clear what the\nexpression \"party preference\" means.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the State have a\nlegitimate interest in weakening the influence of\npolitical parties?\nMR. McKENNA: No, Your Honor, it does not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we found that that was\nthe necessary effect of this ballot measure, then would\nit be invalid?\nMR. McKENNA: I think Your Honor you would\nhave to find there is a severe burden on the parties and\nsubject the provision to party presence to strict\nscrutiny. It would be receiver -- Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the state has no\nlegitimate interest it's going to fail any level of\nscrutiny.\nMR. McKENNA: It has legitimate interest\nindicating something about party on the ballot. This,\nthe same legitimate interest that occurs in a nominating\nprimary where the, where the party, where all the\ncandidates who have filed under that office are going to\nmiss the party in terms of conveying our -- on the\nquestion of receiveribility I think Washington law\napplies here the McGowan three-part test which is\nparalleled under Federal severability and booker simply\nstates that an act or statute is not unconstitutional no\nits entirety unless it's believed the voters would not\nhave passed one without the other or unless the\nvalidation party to accomplish the legislative purposes\nclearly understands in this case the main purpose was to\npreserve choice. It was called the People's Choice\nInitiative. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general.\n"
