BIBAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the Government concedes, INA subsection\n101(a)(13)(C)(v), added by IIRIRA, does not expressly\nmandate retroactivity. Under Landgraf, applying that\nnew provision would attach new legal consequences to\npre-IIRIRA offenses, penalizing both those who travel\nand those who don't.\nCovered lawful permanent residents could not\nvisit their parents abroad without being forced to\nabandon their children here. They would be removed from\nthe country or else confined here. Either way, they\nwould lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law\nbased on pre-IIRIRA offenses. Thus, applying the\nsubsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive.\nThe settled expectations at issue here are\nthose of round trips by lawful permanent residents, not,\nas the Government would put it, one-way tickets or\nfirst-time entrants.\nThese are people who have structured their\nlives here. They have homes, spouses, children, and\ncareers here and, yet, have a settled expectation that\nthey will be able to maintain ties to visit aged and\nailing parents abroad, to go to funerals and wakes and\nvisit them in the hospital and surgeries. Our amici,\nthe NACDL brief and the Asian American --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as going forward\nis concerned, that's -- that's just the way it is,\nright?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, because Congress has\nexpressly changed the law post-IIRIRA. The question is,\nfor those before IIRIRA, whether those settled\nexpectations are being disrupted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they -- could\nthey -- the person who -- who is here and then the new\nlaw is passed -- could that person have petitioned for\ndiscretionary relief before traveling?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, that is a\npossibility. That is not the same as the automatic\nability to travel, and, in fact, in this case the\ndiscretionary relief was denied. It depends on a\ndifferent set of factors from the automatic pre-IIRIRA\nability to travel. But it is a theoretical possibility\nin some cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your\nexpectations argument is that somebody trying to figure\nout whether to go ahead and rob the bank is going to\nsay, well, if I do and I'm caught and I'm found guilty,\nI won't be able to take temporary trips abroad; so, I'm\nnot going to rob the bank.\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. First of all,\nyou phrased it specifically as a reliance argument,\nwhich is an alternative. Even the Government concedes\nit's not a prerequisite.\nSecond, the right time to look at\nexpectations is the moment before the law is enacted:\nDoes one have an expectation at that point that one will\nbe able to continue --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're\nconcerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not\nit disrupts settled expectations. And it just doesn't\nseem to me that this issue enters into the expectations\nat all when the pertinent act, which is the commission\nof the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place.\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor, I believe the\npractical impact is a new travel disability or penalty,\njust as in Landgraf. The discrimination there had been\nillegal for decades; yet, adding a new form of damages\nto it was impermissibly retroactive. In Hughes\nAircraft, filing false claims with the government had\nbeen illegal for years; yet, broadening the class of\npeople who could file suit and removing a defense -- no\nreliance possible at all, but there was a settled\nexpectation that there would be no additional\nconsequences attached to that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween someone who commits the crime just before the\nAct is passed and someone who commits the crime just\nafter the Act is passed? The person who commits the\ncrime just after the Act is passed had the expectation\nprior to the passage of the Act that if he did certain\nthings, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't have this consequence\nfrom his conduct.\nMR. BIBAS: Congress, of course, has the\npower to change things, but the expectation until an Act\nis passed is that the consequences are fixed in time.\nAnd if Congress decides that the potential unfairness is\noutweighed by the benefits of making the Act\nretroactive --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the person who -- who\ncommits the crime just after the Act is passed had the\nexpectation prior to that time, that had -- if he did\ncertain things in the future, he wouldn't suffer certain\nconsequences.\nMR. BIBAS: And yet, Congress has -- has\naffirmatively warned and put everybody on notice that\nnow there is this new consequence. You may be deterred\nby this new consequence. We may be punishing you by\nthis new consequence. But the consequence has been\nannounced.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bibas, I have -- this\nis almost a question of personal privilege. You -- you\nmake your whole argument on the basis of Landgraf. So\ndoes the Government. You do not cite -- the Government\ncites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a --\nof a later case which involved the same question,\nRepublic of Austria v. Altmann.\nI concurred separately in Landgraf because I\nthought that the test that the Court was using,\nupsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper\ntest for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post\nfacto laws, which is where the Court derived it from,\nJustice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire\nconstitutional case.\nBut I said in my concurrence that the proper\ntest for -- for the other issue of retroactivity,\nnamely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean\nto be applied only in the future or in the past? And\nfor that, I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said\nin Altmann:\n\"Our approach\" -- which postdates Landgraf.\n\"Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus\nparallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the\nconcurrence in Landgraf.\" Quote, and it's quoting the\nconcurrence: \"'The critical issue ... is not whether\nthe rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance\nor procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity\nthat the rule regulates. Absent clear statement\notherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs\nafter the effective date of the statute is covered.\nMost statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and\nhence will not be applied in trials involving conduct\nthat occurred before their effective date. But other\nstatutes have a different purpose and therefore a\ndifferent relative retroactivity event'\" -- \"'relevant\nretroactivity event.'\"\nAnd that is what we have here. The -- the\nevent that is sought to be regulated is entry into the\nUnited States, and it is clear that this statute applies\nonly to prospective entry into the United States. It\ndoesn't apply to past entry so that those people who\ncame in, in violation of this statute, can be deported.\nNow, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as\nwe did in the Republic of Austria case?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. As a -- first\nof all, our reply brief discussed Altmann, and the\nmajority of the Court has viewed that as limited to the\nforeign sovereign immunities context. But taking your\ntest on its own terms --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would it be limited\njust to the foreign sovereign immunities context?\nMR. BIBAS: That's the majority's approach.\nBut taking your test on its own terms, what you're\npointing out is there is a future --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that's the\nmajority's approach?\nMR. BIBAS: I'm sorry. The majority in\nFernandez-Vargas expressly said that Republic of Austria\nwas in a sui generis context and that its holding\nshouldn't be extended to -- to Fernandez-Vargas.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Its -- its holding.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes.\nBut to take -- to look at your test, you\nwere pointing out that there is a future event which the\nGovernment -- practically its entire theory turns on\nthat. But even if there is a future event, there is a\npast event being regulated here, and the activity at\nissue under your test would be the pre-IIRIRA offense,\nnot just the innocent post-IIRIRA travel. What we have\nis future lawful travel, concededly lawful, nothing\nnefarious needs to be shown of it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it\ndifferent then from a felon in possession statute, where\nyou look at the past offense --\nMR. BIBAS: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- and then you say, well,\nthis man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun\nin the future? How is it different at all?\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, there are five\npertinent distinctions. Permit me to unpack.\nThe first and most important is that the\nLandgraf test should have a broader scope than the ex\npost facto context in these criminal cases because\nCongress can override it expressly.\nSince the ex post facto clauses disable both\nState and Federal legislatures from acting at all, the\ndeprivation of power must be narrow and careful so State\nand Federal legislatures can continue to regulate felon\nin possession or racketeering or the other crimes the\nGovernment advances.\nBut Landgraf just tells Congress how to\nlegislate. It's a background rule. So, it's legitimate\nto have a presumption against retroactivity sweep more\nbroadly, as Congress is free to override it and, as I\nwill explain, does override it regularly.\nSecondly, felon in possession is inherently\ndangerous conduct. This is a protective law. It's not\njust a punitive or deterrent law.\nThe third and related point is that felon in\npossession laws are tailored. There's a nexus to a\ndanger, a threat to people suffering firearm -- it's\nnarrowly tailored. Fourth --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why isn't the -- the\ngovernment, Congress, making the exact same judgment\nhere? If the activity to be regulated is entry, and\nCongress is making a judgment that we do not want\ndangerous people to enter, and we're using the\nconviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who is\ndangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in\nthe felon in possession statute.\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I believe the two\nare quite different. Felon in possession is limited to\nfirearms in the hands of proven dangerous people. Here\nwe have a law that says you can stay in the country\nindefinitely; we're going to discourage you from going\nabroad and leaving the country because we'll make it\nharder for you to come back. That's not tailored at all\nto protecting the people inside the United States.\nI'd also point out that the felon in\npossession statute, as this Court noted in Heller, is\npart of a long tradition of forbidding such activity as\na crime. So, it's hard to say there are settled\nexpectations being upset by felon in possession laws.\nAnd the final one is Congress can do that\nsimply by being explicit, and it has done so repeatedly\nin laws such as IIRIRA. Elsewhere in IIRIRA, section\n321(b) says the aggravated felony definition applies to\nconvictions entered before, on, or after the statute's\neffective date. It knew how to do it; it did it more\nthan a dozen other times in IIRIRA, as this Court noted\nin St. Cyr. It didn't spell it out here. The point of\nthis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about the career\ncriminal enhancements, instead of the felon in\npossession? And assuming your arguments, what limits\ncan Congress put on anyone with respect to future\nconduct if it's going to be a burden? Under your view,\nit stops people from traveling. Career criminal\nstatutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer\nsentence.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, and as we\nnoted, in the criminal context, this Court in Witte and\nGryger notes it's a heavier punishment on the new crime\nbecause it's aggravated, because it's repeated. And\nbecause Congress has more leeway in the ex post facto\ncontext and because recidivism enhancements have a long\ntradition, it's entirely legitimate. There's no need to\nsay that that's punishing the past offense because the\nfuture offense -- it --- it's permissible to increase it\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nAnd that's an inquiry that's different from\nthe Landgraf test here because all Congress has to do is\nspell out expressly we want to apply this to convictions\nentered before, on, or after the statute's effective\ndate, which it did in 321(b), which it didn't do here.\nSo, if we were looking at the function of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that argument that\nyou've just made go more to whether or not the BIA's\nconclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti\ndecision -- but you assume that's what its intent was?\nMR. BIBAS: We've assumed arguendo because\nthat's the premise of the question presented. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if we assume that,\nif we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that\nstart -- give you the conclusion? If Congress intended\nto undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to\neffect it retroactively?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor, it doesn't. All\nthe case law, the legislative history, the other\ndiscussion was about certain other aspects of entry\ndoctrine that needed to be changed. The discussion was\nexpress about saying we're changing the definition from\nentry to admission because we don't want people who have\nsnuck into the country outside of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I -- those go\nto the basic premise.\nMR. BIBAS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you assume Congress\nintended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof\nitself that it intended to apply the statute\nretroactively?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To this conduct?\nMR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. Congress can\nintend to rescind -- to -- to abrogate a statute such\nthat it will have no effect going forward, but as this\nCourt noted in Landgraf, the -- the background default\nrule that the public and Congress expect is that new\nlaws will apply prospectively. That has the virtue not\nonly of giving a clear background rule which -- against\nwhich Congress legislates, against which it did\nlegislate in IIRIRA; but it also forces Congress to\nadvert to the potential unfairness of retroactivity and\ndecide that the benefits outweigh it.\nThat's what this Court said in Landgraf. It\nmakes perfect sense, and that clear statement rule\nserves the function of having them smoke out into the\nopen. If you think it's beneficial to make this\naffect convictions in the past, just say so. But it\ndidn't.\nSo, to go back to our primary point, with\nthe practical impact or effect being a new travel\ndisability, the Government's argument seems to boil down\nto that, because there is one event that must happen\nafter the statute's effective date, therefore there can\nbe no retroactive effect.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that event is the\nevent that the government cares about, which is the\nentry into the country. It's not as though the -- you\nknow, the government says -- just picks an event at\nrandom and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism. The\ngovernment has picked the event that it wants to\nregulate, which is entry.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, but this is an\neffect test, and under Martin v. Hadix and Landgraf, we\nhave to take a commonsense functional view of what the\neffects are, the new legal consequences. As --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nyour answer to my colleague would be: No, what they\nwant to regulate is the staying in the country, and\nthey're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible\nin order to encourage the individual to leave. If he\ncan't go to the, you know, parent's party, the cousin's\nwedding or whatever, he's just going to leave, and then\nonce he does, he can't come back.\nWhy would -- why would the Government\ncare -- it's a question for them, I'm sure. Why would\nthey care whether somebody that they don't want to be\nhere stays here? It seems to me the exact opposite.\nSo, I would have thought your argument -- your answer\nwould be, no, what they're trying to regulate is not the\ncoming and going, but simply the staying.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, you're right\nthat, particularly given the strange way in which it's\nwritten, it's hard to understand it as something other\nthan a penalty and possibly a deterrent, but certainly a\npenalty based on past crimes, to make life\nuncomfortable. And that does not speak of a protective,\nforward-looking exclusive function, if that's the test.\nBut to go back to the earlier point, if that\nwere -- if we were to follow the approach Justice Scalia\noutlined, that would be the right response. But we\ndon't even need to get there because the primary test\nunder Landgraf is not the point or function or purpose,\nbut an effects test. The effect, as the Government\nconcedes, is to force him to choose between his parents\nin Greece and his wife, children, career, and home here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there are a lot of --\nbut there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be\nvalid, and not retroactive, which have a substantial\neffect. You can pass a statute altering the rules of\nevidence which have the effect of making someone who\ncommitted a prior murder convictable; whereas, before,\nhe was not convictable.\nAnd we don't just look to the effect and\nsay, well, it has that substantial effect; so, it's\noperating retroactively. We say, no, it's a rule of\nevidence. It applies in the future, and that evidence\ncan come in.\nAnd that's my problem with this other\napproach. There are often adverse effects upon\nactivities that occurred before the statute was enacted,\nbut we still regard the statute as prospective only and,\ntherefore, not subject to special rules for people who\nare affected.\nMR. BIBAS: Well, setting aside the\ndifference between the ex post facto context and the\ncivil context, and I -- there is the procedural\ndistinction which I know Your Honor didn't sign on to.\nIt's also relevant that here it is directly expressly\ntied to a past conduct. It's a precondition. It's not\neven a piece of evidence or something one can draw an\ninference from. It is a precondition for ineligibility\nunder 101(a)(13)(C)(v). And, therefore, it looks like\nthe disability that Justice Story said; a disability has\nto involve future conduct. But if it's expressly\ndisabling future conduct, that's a penalty on past\nconduct.\nThe disability in St. Cyr of not being able\nto apply for future discretionary relief. The\ndisability in some other cases of this Court that we\nfound after briefing and alerted opposing counsel to,\nCummings v. Missouri and Ex parte Garland in volume 71\nof the U.S. Reports. Even though the law there forbade\nteaching in the future or holding office or preaching or\nbeing a member of the bar, the Government's theory would\nsay those are post-enactment things; just refrain from\nteaching; you don't have a vested right to teach.\nThis Court said, no, we recognize those are\nexpressly targeted to punish the past membership in the\nConfederacy that triggers that disability. And so, the\nGovernment's approach would render the Justice Story's\ndisability category a nullity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter in\nthe examples that you just gave that admission to the\nUnited States is purely a matter of legislative grace,\nwhile we might conclude that teaching, being a member of\nthe bar, whatever, is not?\nMR. BIBAS: I don't believe that that is\nimportant. That only matters for the vested rights\nargument, and this Court in Cummings said expressly it\nwas dealing with a privilege. So -- moreover --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What --\nan which privilege was that?\nMR. BIBAS: The privilege of teaching or the\nprivilege of holding office. So, you can't rest on a\nright/privilege disposition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose that might\nhave been regarded as such then but not under current\nlaw.\nMR. BIBAS: Okay. Well, another answer --\nin St. Cyr, the government made the same argument, and\nthis Court said: Well, sure, Congress has the plenary\npower to change the rules any time it wants; just do it\nexpressly.\nThe question is not whether Congress can,\nbut whether it has, in fact, changed the rules\nexpressly, to make that express tradeoff that the\npotential unfairness of retroactivity is worth it.\nNow, the final point here, I believe there\nwas some reference earlier to reliance in the offense.\nAnd as the Government concedes, reliance is not a\nprerequisite. This Court can rule for Petitioner and\nnot even bother with reliance. But the presence of\nreliance here is an extra factor that -- that shows the\nretroactivity to be obvious and severe. So, the court\nof appeals' whole premise that reliance is necessary\ngoes away. The Government concedes the court of appeals\nimplicitly was wrong on that.\nAs a practical matter, our point is that\ndefendants rely on the known consequences of offenses\nwhen they decide to plead guilty. As this Court\nrecognized in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When they decide to\nplead guilty?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The operative issue\nhere is when they commit the crime.\nMR. BIBAS: We don't claim that there's a\nreliance interest in committing the crime, but in the\ndecision to plead guilty, as a practical matter, the\ndefendants weigh a number of consequences. And one of\nthose is whether they might have a 4-month discount off\ntheir sentencing guidelines, which was the inducement\nhere, and another one is, will they ever be able to see\ntheir parents again?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this -- so,\nthis --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you draw the line --\nyour position is that only those who have entered a\nguilty plea are entitled to the presumption against\nnon-retroactivity, but not those who've been found\nguilty?\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, our primary position\nis that because reliance isn't necessary, all of them\nbenefit from it because they all have settled\nexpectations.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: How do you explain St. Cyr\nif reliance isn't necessary? St. Cyr is all about\nreliance.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes. And at the end of this\nCourt's opinion, the Court said that the presence of\nthis reliance made the retroactive effect especially\nobvious and sincere -- especially obvious and severe in\nSt. Cyr. That did not purport to overrule holdings in\nLandgraf and Hughes Aircraft, where there had been no\nlegally cognizable reliance.\nSo, St. Cyr is an easy case because of the\nguilty plea because of the reliance. But Landgraf and\nHughes Aircraft didn't involve any reliance, and there\nwas still retroactivity because the settled expectations\nwere disrupted because there were new consequences\nattached to pre-enactment conduct.\nSo, regardless of whether there is reliance,\nthere are settled expectations that are upset by a law\nwhose function or point is to punish and deter\nmisconduct based on past wrongs. My client --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're trying to figure out\nwhat Congress intended, right? We're not talking about\nconstitutionality. We're talking about a rule that it's\npresumed that statutes are only prospective. All right?\nAnd your argument is the reasonable expectation of\nCongress when they passed this was that it would only\napply to -- to people who, what, committed the crime or\nwere convicted after the statute passed --\nMR. BIBAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- just as a matter of\nstatutory interpretation?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. BIBAS: This -- that is the background\ndefault rule against which Congress legislates. And in\nlaws such as IIRIRA and SORNA and elsewhere, Congress\nspells out when it wants to apply to pre-enactment\noffenses, to pre-enactment conduct. That's a defeasible\ncivil retroactivity rule that can reach more broadly\nthan the ex post facto jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you have any case\nin which a court has deemed a statute retroactive even\nthough it wasn't triggered until the party took some\nfurther action? Is there any case out there either from\nthis Court or from another court where we've said, you\nknow, it's retroactive even though it depends upon a\nfuture event?\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. St. Cyr\ndepended on applying for discretionary relief in the\nfuture. He didn't have to. Cummings depended on trying\nto teach or preach or hold office. Ex parte Garland\ndepended on trying to practice law in the future.\nThose are all disabilities taking away a\nfuture ability based on a past wrong. That's what the\ndisability category has to mean if it's to remain\nmeaningful. And the Government's approach would gut\nJustice Story's fourth category. If there are no\nfurther questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the discussion so far this morning\nreveals, the Court's retroactivity analysis takes\naccount of a number of different factors, but the one\nthat is most significant and, indeed in this case,\nvirtually dispositive is that the application of section\n1101(a)(13) to Petitioner was triggered only because he\nengaged in voluntary conduct that postdated the\nenactment of the statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What do you take the trigger\nto be? Because in your brief you kept on talking about\nthe trigger being the trip. And I would have thought\nthat you would have talked more about the activity being\nthe attempt to enter the country.\nMR. MILLER: That's -- I mean they're\nclosely connected together in time, and they both -- but\nthey both postdate the enactment of the statute. But\nwhat -- the thing that is being regulated by section\n1101(a)(13) is the entry of aliens into the United\nStates. The statute sets out a comprehensive scheme for\ndetermining when an alien arriving at the border seeking\nto come into the United States should be regarded as\nseeking an admission. So, that's conduct that takes\nplace in the future.\nPart (A) of 1101(a)(13) sets out the general\ndefinition of admission, and then (C) sets out a number\nof exceptions. And so, taken together, they are part of\na comprehensive effort to codify Fleuti in some\nrespects. And, in particular, Romanette (ii), the\n180-day provision, is actually a fairly generous\ncodification of Fleuti, probably extending beyond what\nwould have been regarded as a brief trip under Fleuti.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I have\nto -- I just don't understand this statute. This is\nsomebody we would not allow into the country. And yet,\nthe only thing we say is you can't leave. I just don't\nunderstand how that -- how that works.\nMR. MILLER: I think there are -- there are\ntwo points to be made about that. And the first is that\nthat is a feature of the statute writ large. I mean,\nthat exists even with respect to post-enactment criminal\nconvictions. So, it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Right.\nMR. MILLER: And the second, I think to\nunderstand it, it's helpful to look at the history. The\ndistinction between grounds of inadmissibility and\ngrounds of deportability goes back all the way to the\n1917 Act. In that statute, a single crime of moral\nturpitude was a basis for inadmissibility but was\ngenerally not a basis for deportability unless it had a\n1-year sentence and was committed within 5 years --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, and I\nunderstand that there is a limitation on actually\ndeporting the person. But here I would think the one\nthing you want the person to do is leave. Maybe for a\nparticular event, but maybe he'll decide to stay in\nGreece if once he's there for the -- but it seems very\nodd to say we're going to show you how much we don't\nwant you here; we're not going to let you leave.\nMR. MILLER: I think what the -- what the\nhistory shows that it's the crossing the border that has\nalways been regarded as a legally significant event.\nThis Court's cases recognizing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't before.\nWe -- I think we have held that an immigration lawyer is\nobliged to tell a defendant faced with a criminal charge\nwhat the legal -- what the immigration consequences will\nbe. And here, suppose before the -- at the time of the\nplea in this case, the attorney had said, once you've\nserved your time, you will be able to take brief casual\ntrips. That would have been accurate advice, right?\nBefore IIRIRA.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think -- I think the\nmost important point about the consequence of the plea\nis that, as an immediate result of the plea under\npre-IIRIRA law, so at the time he pleaded guilty in\n1994, he made himself inadmissible. So, that's not\nanything that has changed. So, he knew that he was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm asking you, the\nlawyer talking to the client -- and the client wants to\nknow before I enter this plea, what will be the\nconsequence for me? And the question that's asked is,\nwill I still be able to visit my mother in Greece? What\nshould the lawyer -- what should the lawyer at that time\nhave answered?\nMR. MILLER: I think the lawyer should have\nsaid, by pleading guilty, you are making yourself\ninadmissible to the United States. Under --\nJUSTICE BREYER: When Rosenberg would have\nbeen the law -- Fleuti -- and the answer to the question\nwould have been, yes, you can make trips abroad,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. MILLER: That's -- that's right. And I\nthink you might also have said that under a current law,\nyou will not be regarded as seeking an admission if you\ntake a brief, casual, and innocent trip. But the change\nin the law --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All right. Well, that's\nwhat's going to be important to the person, right? It's\nnot inadmissible and all the legal terms. Am I going to\nbe able to make short trips to visit my mother? Yes,\nyou are going to be able to make short trips to visit\nyour mother.\nAnd then you wake up the next morning, and\nCongress has passed a statute, and now you're not able\nto take short trips to visit your mother. So, something\nvery real has happened to the life of this person.\nMR. MILLER: That's -- that's right, I mean,\nand there is no question but that there is a serious\nconsequence as a result of the change in the law. But\nthe Court has made clear in Landgraf and in a number of\nother cases that even uncontroversially prospective\nstatutes can impose burdens.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but in -- in\nSt. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court\nfocused directly, not on the crime point of time, but\nthe time of the guilty plea. And what the Court says\nthere is that a person who is thinking of pleading\nguilty might well have taken into account the fact that\nhe could ask the Attorney General later when he's about\nto be deported to exercise discretion in his favor.\nSo, that's as I read those pages. You can\nsay why I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I\nread them. And then, having read it that way, I thought\nthe question in this case is whether the person who's\nsitting at the table and deciding whether to plead\nguilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead\nguilty, I can always ask for discretion. That's St.\nCyr.\nWell, if I plead guilty, I can still visit\nmy aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could\nbe of importance to some people, as opposed to whether I\nwill never see them again. Now, that seems to be the\nquestion.\nIs the second as likely to be in the\nperson's mind as the first? And to tell you the truth,\nI don't know the answer. I mean, maybe it would be.\nThere isn't that much chance of getting discretion. It\nmight be important to some people to visit their aging\nparents and grandparents. So, go ahead. Answer the\nquestion. Is the one more important than the other?\nAnd if not, why not?\nMR. MILLER: I think you've correctly\ndescribed the reasoning of the Court in St. Cyr, and I\nthink that that reasoning highlights two ways in which\nthis case is significantly different. And the first is\nthat, in St. Cyr, it was the guilty plea, the\nconviction, that was legally significant under the\nprovision of IIRIRA at issue there. And the Court\nemphasized that a guilty plea is a quid pro quo. It has\nto be knowing and voluntary. The Court cited\nSantobello v. New York, a due process case about guilty\npleas. And then -- so, one difference in this case is\nthat the legally significant event here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but I'm really asking\nyou --\nMR. MILLER: -- is not the guilty plea.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- isn't my question the\nkey question? Now, you can answer that \"no.\" But -- I\nmean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that\nmattered to -- to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing\nthat mattered, was visiting their parents and\ngrandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even\non that situation, it would make no difference, or you\ncould say I think the one is as important as the other,\nor you could say they're not. I just want to get your\nfull answer, all -- your whole answer to my question.\nMR. MILLER: The conclusion to the first\npart of the answer is that it wouldn't make a difference\nbecause what matters here is not the guilty plea; what\ntriggers the application of 1101(a)(13)(C) is the\nunderlying criminal conduct and is --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You're quite right,\nMr. Miller, as a formal matter that that's true, that\nthat's the words of the statute. But how many times has\nthe Department of Homeland Security tried to declare a\nperson inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a\ncrime without putting into evidence either a conviction\nor a guilty plea?\nMR. MILLER: I don't have any --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I can't imagine that it's\nlike more than on one -- you know, five fingers of your\nhand. I mean, that's the way people prove crimes in\nthis area, isn't it, by convictions or guilty pleas?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I would say that -- this\nis a statue --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Or convictions after trial\nor convictions by guilty pleas.\nMR. MILLER: The statute is being applied\nby -- in the first instance, by customs officers at the\nairport or at the land border crossing. They have\naccess to a number of databases which include not only\nrecords of convictions but also things like arrest\nwarrants. And an arrest warrant by itself would not be\nenough to show that a person had, in fact, committed an\noffense, but it might well trigger some further inquiry\nfrom the customs officer that would lead to them finding\nout more information or perhaps getting an admission\nfrom the person.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: If, as a fact of the matter,\nthe way the commission of crime is proved in this area\nis through showing a conviction, does your distinction\nstand up at all?\nMR. MILLER: I mean, there is still, I\nthink, a significant formal distinction, and then\nthere's also another important distinction from St. Cyr,\nwhich is that that was a case where, as a result of the\nguilty plea plus the change in law, the person there\nfaced immediate deportability with no prospect of\ndiscretionary relief. And the Court said that there is\na clear difference, for purposes of the retroactivity\nanalysis, between a possibility of deportability and a\ncertainty of deportation.\nHere, not only is he not deportable, but\nthere's no immediate consequence for him at all. The\nstatute only has any effect on him when he engages in\nthe post-enactment travel. And I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ncharacterization? Which seemed to me to make common\nsense. Yes, the trigger is that he has gone abroad and\nis returning. But the target, they say, was the crime.\nThat's why the law -- the law really doesn't care about\nthe travel back and forth; what it cares about is that\nthis person was convicted of a crime.\nMR. MILLER: I -- I don't think that's\ncorrect, Your Honor, and I think that highlights one of\nthe distinctions between this case and Cummings v.\nMissouri and Ex parte Garland.\nIn those cases, you had statutes that were\nnominally prospective in application, but the Court\nactually said that we think that what's really happening\nhere is that the statutes are imposing punishment for\nthe completed acts. To the extent there was any doubt\nin those cases themselves, this Court discussed them\nboth in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy and said that it\nviewed them as cases about punishment. This is not a\nstatute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that the case\nhere, meaning -- it goes back to the Chief Justice's\nquestion, which is what they're trying to do is punish\nthose individuals, those LPRs, who have committed this\nkind of crime, by not letting them travel or come back\nin. That's really what their argument is, is -- you\nknow, you are imposing a punishment, a disability, for\nhaving committed the crime. You're not imposing a\ndisability merely for the act of traveling.\nMR. MILLER: I mean, I think when you look\nat the statute as a whole, you see that it's a -- it's a\ncomprehensive regulation of crossing the border, which\nhas always been regarded as a legally significant event.\nThere are six subparts to 1101(a)(13)(C). Five of them\nhave nothing to do with past conduct. They're about the\nnature of the trip and what the alien is doing as he's\ncoming in.\nAnd then you have -- have this one, which is\nof a piece with the long history of drawing a\ndistinction between inadmissibility and deportability.\nAnd I think it recognizes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- what\nis the policy underlying the rule that doesn't allow\nsomebody who has a lawful status here to go to his\ngrandmother's funeral --\nMR. MILLER: I -- I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and come back?\nIt's going to take 4 days. He goes; he comes back.\nWhat policy supports prohibiting that travel?\nMR. MILLER: I mean, I -- I think it\nreflects a -- a judgment over -- on the part of Congress\nover many, many years that it is one thing to say to an\nalien, all right, we're not going to go and try and find\nyou and take you and kick you out of the country. It is\nquite another to say you may freely cross our borders;\neven after having left, you may come back, and we're --\nwithout any inquiry into your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. They're two\ndifferent things, but I don't know that you've\narticulated what the policy is to prevent -- prohibit\nsomebody from doing that.\nMR. MILLER: I mean, other than referring\nyou to -- to the history and to the idea that's been\nreflected -- you know, this Court has recognized that\ncontrol over the border is a core sovereign prerogative\nthat lies at the heart of Congress's immigration power.\nAnd I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose you could\nsay that there's a likelihood of quite inequitable\nenforcement if indeed you adopt a position we're going\nto pick up all of these people and send them away.\nThat's not going to happen. It'll -- it'll be hit and\nmiss.\nAnd, on the other hand, you can enforce it\nrigorously and equitably upon everyone if you only\nforbid reentry to those people who want to come back in\nand who have to, you know, give their names to\nImmigration, and you can check on -- on this status.\nThat seems to me a sensible reason.\nMR. MILLER: That's right. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But why do you\n-- look, as I read the statute, it isn't even clear\nwhether it overrules Rosenberg v. Fleuti. I mean, they\ntalk about admission, but admission, after all,\ncould have an exception for the 4-day trip. That's what\nthe Court said effectively in Rosenberg v. Fleuti.\nSo, Congress certainly wasn't clear on what\npolicy they're following. I would have thought that.\nYou can disagree with that. But I -- because -- but the\npart that's still gnawing at me 95 percent of the people\nplead guilty. All right. You know. Everybody pleads\nguilty. All -- about. About. And now, the consequence\nthat this ex post enacts is he can't take the 4-day\ntrip.\nAnd you keep saying, well, a 4-day trip\nrequires action on a person's part. Right. Of course,\nit does. So, why does that matter? I mean, the fact is\nhe can't take the 4-day trip. A 4-day trip requires\naction. You have to buy a trip -- ticket. You have to\nget on a plane. So --\nMR. MILLER: Well, i think -- if I could\njust first address the -- the question of whether the\nstatute, in fact, abrogates Fleuti, and just to be clear\non that -- the question presented assumes that it does.\nPetitioner isn't challenging that. And the Board, in\nthe Collado-Munoz decision, has explained why the -- the\nstatute, in fact, does have that effect.\nAnd I think that the significance of this\npost-enactment conduct, the significance of the trip, is\nillustrated by this Court's decision in\nFernandez-Vargas, which made clear that when you have --\nwhen the application of the statute is within the\ncontrol of the person to whom it's being applied,\nbecause he has to do something after it comes into\neffect -- there, it was choosing to remain in the United\nStates and becoming subject to the reinstatement of a\nprior order of removal -- here, it's taking the travel.\nBut that goes a long way towards establishing that it\ndoesn't have a retroactive effect, that it's regulating\nfuture conduct.\nAnother --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Prior to the Fernandez\ncase, the illegal act was remaining. And so, that was\nwithin your control. But the -- you can't undo an\nillegal act that you've done to be able to travel. The\nact is now part of your background. And so, there's\nnothing in your control to change that act once the\nstatute has passed.\nMR. MILLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, you're -- you're\ncarrying that around as a disability.\nMR. MILLER: In Fernandez-Vargas, the\nconduct that subjected the alien to the application of\nthis -- this procedural -- this disadvantageous removal\nprocedure was remaining in the United States.\nAnd it's true that that conduct was\nunlawful, but for purposes of the retroactivity\nanalysis, the Court didn't focus on whether it was\nlawful or unlawful. What matters is that it was conduct\nthat was in the future, that was after the statute was\nenacted.\nAnd so, here, although the -- the trip is\nnot unlawful in that sense, it is future conduct. And\nhere, as in Fernandez-Vargas, there is ample warning --\nwhich was another point that the Court emphasized in\nthat case -- ample warning that the statute would be\napplied to people who engaged in that conduct.\nI do want to address your --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It -- it can't be right that\nit's any future conduct. If -- if there's a trigger\nmechanism that is entirely random, you know, it's -- you\ncan be deported if you've committed a crime of moral\nturpitude in the past, but not until you go to the\nmovies on a Saturday.\nSurely, that would not change the analysis.\nMR. MILLER: I think that's right, Your\nHonor, and I think the reason it wouldn't is reflected\nin some of this Court's -- in the ex post facto\nanalysis.\nIf you have a statute that, for example,\nmakes it a crime to have engaged in certain conduct in\nthe past and then, you know, something -- some\ncommonplace, utterly trivial activity in the future, I\nthink a court looking at that would say this is not --\nalthough it is nominally prospective, this is really a\nstatute aimed at punishing the prior conduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't know.\nI think it would be prospective and unconstitutional\nbecause it's irrational. I mean, not everything that's\nunconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything\nthat is unconstitutional is not prospective, it seems to\n-- or do you think that's so?\nIf it's -- if it is unconstitutional in\nviolation of the ex post facto law, the statute has to\nbe -- has to be prospective. I'm sorry. Has to be\nassumed not to cover that prior conduct. Is that right?\nMR. MILLER: I mean, I think -- the\nhypothetical statute I was describing I think would\nviolate the Ex Post Facto Clause under the sort of\nanalysis that this Court used in Smith v. Doe, in a\nholding that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And if it does, it\nautomatically has to be interpreted not to cover that?\nMR. MILLER: I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By reason of the\npresumption of expectation --\nMR. MILLER: Oh, you mean -- if you mean a\nparallel statute in the civil context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.\nMR. MILLER: I -- I think that's the best\nreading of Landgraf, and I think under -- under the\nanalysis suggested in your concurring opinion in\nLandgraf --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes.\nMR. MILLER: -- I think one would look at\nthat statute and say this is really a statute that's\naimed at regulating the past conduct, and that -- that\nhas a retroactive effect.\nSo, I mean, to finish that thought, I think\nI would just say that there is a narrow category of\ncases where you have what is in form a prospective\nregulation that's really aimed at -- aimed at burdening\nor punishing a past act. But this is not that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And how do we separate those\ntwo? How do we decide that this is not that, and that\nit's instead something else, that it's a regulation of\nfuture conduct?\nMR. MILLER: I -- in the criminal context,\nthe Court has used the analysis of Kennedy v.\nMendoza-Martinez to figure out whether a statute is --\nis imposing additional punishment for past conduct. And\nthat looks at a number of factors, and the most\nimportant factor under that test, the Court has said, is\nwhether the statute appears to be related to a\nlegitimate prospective regulatory purpose.\nAnd so, that's why, for example, statutes\nlike 922(g), the felon in possession statute, which was,\nI would point out, amended just back in 1996 to add\nmisdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, which had not\npreviously been something that would subject one to a\nfirearms disability -- that was added.\nEvery court of appeals that has considered\nthe question has held that it doesn't violate the Ex\nPost Facto Clause and, I think, implicitly has held that\nit does in fact reach that conduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you had\npleaded guilty to spousal abuse?\nMR. MILLER: I'm not aware of any cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MILLER: -- specifically addressing that\nquestion, but -- but, yes, because there you have a\nstatute that is regulating future conduct. It only\napplies to somebody who engages in the future conduct.\nThe sex offender registration laws are another example\nthat this Court has upheld. That kind of law obviously\nimposes a very significant burden on people on the basis\nof prior conduct, but the fact that there is some burden\nby itself does not mean that the statute is retroactive.\nNor does it mean that it's appropriately\nviewed as imposing a disability. I mean, I think that\nthe Court in Landgraf quoted Justice Story's formulation\nof a disability as referring to statutes that impose a\ndisability in respect to transactions that are already\npassed. So, it is not enough that there used to be\nsomething that you could do, and now, in the future,\nyou're not going to be able to do that. That's not a\ndisability in the relevant sense, and if it were, I\nthink the Court would have a very difficult line-drawing\nproblem to figure out why it is that statutes like\n922(g) are okay, or sex offender registration laws, or\nany number of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's why I\nthink the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of\nthe statute are relevant. Like with SORNA you would\napply it backwards, because that's a pretty clear\nintent.\nI don't know about, you know, like, \"three\ntimes and you're out\" statutes, et cetera. But -- but\nhere you have the disability on the one -- the\ndisadvantage to the person pleading guilty, that\nproblem, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, you\nhave the policy that with a -- fill in the blank --\nwith a statute that doesn't talk about it but simply\nuses a new definition of admission or admissibility.\nThat's -- do you want to say something about that?\nMR. MILLER: I think, if you're -- if you're\nasking whether Congress has specifically addressed the\ntemporal scope of the statute, we -- we acknowledge\nunder St. Cyr that it hasn't. And so, that's why we're\nat step two of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: More than that, what is --\nI'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the\npolicy on the other side? The policy that favors the\nretroactivity despite the fact that the person might not\nhave pleaded guilty? And that's why I was interested in\nthe Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of\nthe language in the statute that they used.\nMR. MILLER: I think that the -- the policy\nis Congress was trying to redefine -- I mean, they were\nreplacing the old term of \"entry\" and -- with a new\nconcept of admission. They're trying to redefine a\ncomprehensive scheme for regulating the treatment of\naliens arriving at the border. And I think that you\nhave to look at all the parts of it together as a scheme\nthat was to be applied going forward, when people\narrived at the border in the future, after the enactment\nof the statute.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you go over\nagain for me your distinction of St. Cyr?\nMR. MILLER: I think it's twofold, Your\nHonor. The first is that, in St. Cyr, the legally\nsignificant event was the conviction. It was the guilty\nplea. Here, the guilty plea is significant because it\nmakes Petitioner inadmissible, but that was true under\ncurrent law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't argue that\n-- that the significance of what the individual is\ngiving up makes a difference?\nMR. MILLER: That's our second point, is\nthat St. Cyr said there is a big difference between\nimmediate deportability and the potential --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there -- is there\na difference in terms of what they face if they don't\nplead guilty? I've always had difficulty with St. Cyr\nand the notion that, say, someone pleads -- is facing,\nyou know, 10 years, and they plead -- plead guilty to 2\nyears, that the -- the reason they did that is to, you\nknow, avoid one of these immigration provisions. It\nseems to me it is to avoid 8 years.\nMR. MILLER: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I just wonder if\nthe relative significance of what is at issue under the\nimmigration law is something that we can take into\naccount, or if St. Cyr prohibits that?\nMR. MILLER: No, I think it is certainly\nappropriate to take into account, that however --\nhowever significant the application of Fleuti might be\nto aliens, it's on a different order of significance\nfrom --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Miller, the\nSolicitor General actually represented to us -- in the\nJudulang argument, used that as an example, the Fleuti\ncase, as something that people doing pleas did think\nabout and did rely upon.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think -- I mean, we\ndon't question that that's something that people might\nhave -- have been aware of and have been thinking about,\nbut it's not something that was bargained for in the\nplea agreement because it's not something that's\naffected by the plea agreement.\nThe statute here is triggered by the\npost-enactment conduct of entering the country but also\nby the -- the pre-enactment conduct of committing the\ncrime. And, as Petitioner has acknowledged, there isn't\nany reliance in the state of immigration law when you\nchoose to commit the crime. And so, I think that's --\nthat's a difference from the scenario that was addressed\nin Judulang.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Miller.\nMR. MILLER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bibas, you have\n6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BIBAS: Thank you, Your Honor. I'd like\nto make five points.\nThe first one is the statute is poorly\ntailored to any protective or forward-looking effect.\nAs the Court has noted, its perverse effect is to\ndiscourage people from leaving the country, to keep them\nin. So, any idea that the purpose is to get them out\njust doesn't square with the way the statute is written.\nAs Justice Ginsburg noted, while the\npost-IIRIRA innocent travel may be the trigger here, the\nobvious target is the pre-IIRIRA offense. The statute\nis tied to misconduct. The natural inference of making\nmisconduct not just a piece of evidence but a\nprerequisite is that it is the misconduct that is being\npenalized.\nSecond, the impact, we suggest, is the\nrelevant test. The impact is a penalty. It is a\ndisability based on a past act that Mr. Vartelas is now\nhelpless to undo. That is all that is required under\nLandgraf. If Congress thinks it important, it can\nexpressly require retroactivity, but it hasn't done so.\nThird, let me make clear that we have\nalternative theories here. Reliance is something that\nmakes the case worse. It is something that exacerbates\nthe problem, makes it obvious and severe. And our\namici, the NACDL brief, points out very movingly how\nimportant these kinds of considerations are in\nimmigrants' decisions to plead guilty. Here, for\nexample, my client received a 4-month discount off his\nsentencing range. It's entirely plausible to believe\nthat immigrants in his situation might value the ability\nto stay in the same country with their 4-year-old and\n2-year-old child as much as 4 months in jail.\nBut our broader theory is that the violation\nof settled expectations is sufficient, whether or not\nthere's reliance. The settled expectation that one has\nof planning one's life in this country and yet having\nrelatives abroad one will tend to or care for their\nbusiness, et cetera -- that is sufficient. Just as in\nLandgraf and Hughes Aircraft, there were no legally\ncognizable reliance interests in discriminating or in\nsubmitting false claims, but changing the penalties is\nenough.\nFourth, this Court's decision in St. Cyr, I\nbelieve, strongly helps our case. The first reason is\nthat it imposed a disability, a disability on filing in\nthe future for discretionary relief, but as a practical\nmatter, it's burdening past conduct.\nSecondly, St. Cyr didn't purport to change\nthe holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft that those\nare other ways of showing impermissible retroactivity.\nThe logic in St. Cyr is ineluctable that because you are\nburdening a decision, a decision that, as the -- the\nCourt and the amici in St. Cyr noted, matters greatly\nand factors into things like the plea bargaining\ncalculus, that the retroactivity is especially obvious\nand -- and severe.\nAnd let me note that St. Cyr was decided under\nthis same statute, a privilege, not a right, a privilege\nthat Congress can abrogate at any time. That did not\ninfluence this Court's holding at all. The\nright/privilege distinction is dead in this area of law.\nIf there is a privilege under IIRIRA to apply for\ndiscretionary relief, there is a privilege to not be\nsubject to the disability on one's traveling and\nreturning.\nFinally, let me talk about the\ncriminal/civil line. I believe my brother here\nintroduced Smith v. Doe and mentioned some of the sex\noffender cases. I've explained why the criminal cases\nin ex post facto are different, but let me go into some\nmore detail as the Court is well familiar with\nSmith v. Doe. That was a civil case that Doe attempted\nto turn into a criminal case under the very demanding\nstandard in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez. But that's a\nvery uphill fight. As the Court's opinion recognized,\nthe court must be very deferential before turning\nsomething facially civil into criminal because then it's\ncategorically forbidden and it comes with the criminal\nprocedure protections in the Bill of Rights.\nThat's not what we're doing now. We're not\ntrying to say this law is forbidden. Smith v. Doe\ninvolved a law where the Court's opinion said on its\nface the legislature made it retroactive; it says it's\nretroactive. The Federal law SORNA is expressly\nretroactive in section 113(d). IIRIRA is expressly\nretroactive. That's a different inquiry, where you're\nasking, does the Ex Post Facto Clause forbid something\nthat's expressly retroactive? Does Mendoza-Martinez\nturn it into a criminal case?\nVersus here, where it's not retroactive.\nAll Congress has to do is spell it out. If this Court\nadheres to its previous jurisprudence, the guidance to\nthe drafters across the street is clear: Just draft the\nstatutes the way you've always been doing it; say\nbefore, on, or after effective date.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think we have the\nauthority to tell Congress how to draft its laws? I\nthought what we were doing was trying to infer what they\nintended.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do we send them a drafting\nmanual? Now, you can do this, but you can only do it if\nyou do it -- if you follow the steps that we've\nprescribed. And you've said this over and over. It\nseems to be completely unfounded.\nMR. BIBAS: Your Honor, this Court has said\nthat it's important to adhere to its traditional tools\nof statutory construction because it's a settled\nbackground rule against which Congress legislates, which\nit is aware of.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think Landgraf is\nclear and settled, and you're -- you're over there in\nCongress, and you say, boy, I know how this statute is\ngoing to come out under Landgraf --\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- better than I am.\nMR. BIBAS: Let me explain. This Court\ndecided Landgraf two decades ago. A few years after\nLandgraf, Congress passed IIRIRA in 1996. IIRIRA\ncontains express retroactivity provisions that go\nhand-in-glove with the Landgraf presumption.\nAnd then Congress passed SORNA, to which my\nbrother alludes. SORNA in 2005 likewise in section\n113(d) says, yes, this sex offender registration shall\napply; the Attorney General can apply it to people with\npre-SORNA convictions. Congress understands the\nLandgraf presumption. In those statutes and others, it\nhas legislated against it. It can continue to do it\nbecause this Court should continue to use its\ntraditional tools of statutory construction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that can be explained\nbecause Congress understands that who knows whether it's\ngoing to be held to be retroactive or not. If you -- if\nyou surely want it to apply, you'd better say so. If\nthat's the rule you want us to adopt, that's okay.\nMR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, and a clear\nstatement rule has that virtue, as I believe Your Honor\nis well aware.\nFor all of these reasons, we ask this Court\nto reverse the judgment below and remand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
