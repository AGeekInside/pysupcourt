CAMPBELL, IV\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn this case, it is undisputed that petitioner\nBuck Doe suffered an adverse effect, the emotional\ndistress typical of a privacy invasion caused by the\nDepartment of Labor's intentional and willful violation of\nthe Privacy Act.\ncircumstances, petitioner is entitled to recover the\nPrivacy Act's modest $1,000 statutory damages remedy.\nQUESTION: Before we go further, could you help\nme out on one thing? You spoke of the modest $1,000\nrecovery. The argument is made on the other side that, in\nfact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this\ncase, for example, for every caption of a - of - of an\norder that went out, to everyone to whom that order was\nsent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many,\nmany thousands. Is that the proper construction of the\nstatute?\nMR. CAMPBELL: The answer to that is no, Justice\nSouter, and let me answer that in at least two ways.\nFirst of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already\nheld that the number of - that the $1,000 is key to each\nindividual and not to the number of disclosures. For\nexample, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there\nwas a simultaneous disclosure of information about a\nsingle individual to some 4,000 recipients. That court\nheld -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CAMPBELL: - and I think correctly, that that\nwould be considered one disclosure under the act and,\nthus, the individual would be entitled to only a single\n$1,000 recovery.\nQUESTION: What if - what if there had been an\ninitial disclosure and he had protested it? He said,\nyou're violating the statute when you do this and they did\nit again. Would that be a separate offense?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's a closer question - it -\nbecause then you - you've got the - the temporal\nseparation that did not exist in the Tomasello case.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but you'd have temporal\nseparation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10\nmonths.\nMR. CAMPBELL: But -\nQUESTION: And I take it in that case you're\nsaying, no, there would still just be a - a - a one\nviolation and - and the maximum recovery, at least under\nthis provision, would be 1,000.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I think that's right,\nJustice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each\nof those disclosures you're describing, there would have\nto be an adverse effect described and - and a causation\nelement met in each of those in any case before you even\ngot to the question.\nQUESTION: But suppose the IRS -\nQUESTION: But that's so easy to establish, as\nshown here. I mean, it bothers me that somebody else\nknows my Social Security number. You don't think that's a\nrealistic reason for not assuming application of the\nstatute, do you?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I - if I understand your question,\nJustice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm\nsuffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless\nstandard. And in this case, you don't just have a\nsituation in which Buck Doe - it's obviously a pseudonym -\njust alleges, I was harmed. This is a case in which he\nsubmitted an affidavit, and more importantly, testified in\nopen court as to the severity and veracity of his\nemotional -\nQUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -\nMR. CAMPBELL: - and was cross-examined.\nQUESTION: - wouldn't every person who wanted to\nmake such a claim make similar allegations? Is a class\naction a reasonable possibility in a case like this?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Let me answer both parts of your\nquestion. As to the first part, I - I don't think we can\npresume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse\neffect. They are certainly under the obligations to\ntestify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had\nevery opportunity that - to - and did cross-examine Mr.\nDoe as to the veracity of his adverse effect. The\nmagistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an\nadverse effect, the district court adopted it and the\nGovernment never appealed that finding, so whatever\narguments they have at this point are gone.\nSecond part of your question, class actions.\nThat's certainly the parade of horribles that the\nGovernment is trotting out here, and I think perhaps,\nJustice Souter, may go more - more directly to your\nquestion as well. The answer is no. Even if an\nindividual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an\nintentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to\na statutory damages award without being required to\nquantify actual damages.\nThere are still at least two individualized\nissues that will exist in every case. One is the pleading\nand proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may\nvary among different plaintiffs. Second is the causation,\nand particularly in the causation question, Justice\nO'Connor, this is not a - a standard that - that\nplaintiffs lightly leap over.\nIn fact, there are a number of cases, one of\nwhich is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which\nwas handed down while this petition was pending, noted\nthat in cases where the - the adverse effect alleged is a\n- an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run\ninto causation problems. There could be any number of\nother stressors in this person's life.\nQUESTION: Let's assume that somebody wrongfully\nand intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you\nknow, just - just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers\nof their - their entire list. They sell their - their\nlist to somebody. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly valid\nclass action? Every one of them has had the adverse\neffect of having his Social Security number out there, and\nevery one of them has this same adverse effect, which is\nthe, I don't know, the trauma of knowing that - that your\n- your Social Security number is floating out there where\nanybody can use it. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly good\nclass action?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I think that the example\nyou give, the problem remains, particularly one of\ncausation. Some folks may not have an adverse effect,\nthey may not be concerned, I think, particularly if you're\ndescribing a case in which it's only the number that's\nreleased but the number's not linked to a name. I think\nin those cases you might have difficulty.\nQUESTION: Those numbers are - are linked to\nnames.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I'd still go back to the - there's\na causation problem. If - if you're going to talk - that\nis an individualized issue. Now, I -\nQUESTION: May I ask, with respect to that, you\nbrought this case. I mean, you tried to get it certified\nas a class action and you were unsuccessful. So I - I\nhear you telling this Court, we were way off-base in\nattempting to bring this as a class action because the\nadverse effect is different for each person. So you're\ngiving up on your first loss. I mean, there are other\ncircuits that might say, yeah, why not class action?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I don't - I don't - I don't\ncontend that there aren't arguments to be made. What I am\nstating here is that there are some very strong -\nQUESTION: But you say you lost fair and square,\nand now you've seen the error of your ways?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, we lost fair and square and\nI - and I want to point out too, I want to give another\nexample of a case, and it's one of the cases that the\nGovernment cites in its brief as the example of - of this\n- this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is\npending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which\ninvolves a putative class action against the Veterans\nAdministration. In that case, the Western District of\nWisconsin held, and this has been since cert was granted\nin this case, held that, if you prove an adverse effect\ncaused by an intentional, willful violation of the act,\nyou are entitled to statutory damages of $1,000.\nNonetheless, that district court refused to certify a\nclass on precisely the grounds that I am describing to you\ntoday.\nSo is it conceivable there could be a class\naction in a case? Yes, it's conceivable, and I do -\nQUESTION: But even if they're not class actions,\nI have, I think, the same problem people have expressed.\nIn Massachusetts, we put our Social Security number on our\ndriver's license. I have it right in my pocket. I show\nit 10 million times a day, or however many. So suppose\nthat, you know, the IRS releases - California wants to do\nthe same thing. They have 35 million drivers, and the IRS\nsends them a list so they can check it out, or the Social\nSecurity Administration does that and, my God, there's 35\nmillion lawsuits, $1,000 each, that's only 35 billion.\nSuppose they do it nationwide. There's 200 billion, and\nthat's only Social Security numbers. All you have to do\nis read through these 14 pages of fine print of the\nrequirements of the Privacy Act, certain days have to be\nmet, certain deadlines, and it's very easy to imagine\nbankruptcy in the Federal Treasury.\nAll right. So, I mean, you know, trillions,\nit's easy to see that. I can make up hypotheticals, which\nI'll spare you, but you see where I'm going, because what\nI want is that is the horrible. And when I read the\nhorrible, I think, my God, they're right.\nNow, you tell me why they're not.\nMR. CAMPBELL: In the hypothetical that you're\nproposing, Justice Breyer, I think there are several\nanswers.\nQUESTION: And just make up, you know, it's easy\nfor both of us to make up a lot.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Sure.\nQUESTION: I want to know what are the\nprotections if you win against generating millions and\nmillions of lawsuits with billions of dollars.\nMR. CAMPBELL: In - in the hypotheticals that\nyou've described, if I could take those on their terms\nfirst. It's very likely that one of the exceptions to the\nPrivacy Act disclosure is going to apply usual - if it's\nthe case that - that this is a working relationship\nbetween the Federal Government and various state\ngovernments and the like, that may well fall within the\nusual use.\nThere are a number of these exceptions listed,\nso certainly you have to look to those first. Have to go\n- go back to - this would have to be intentionally\nwrongful conduct by the Government -\nQUESTION: Well, yeah, I can't imagine any\ngovernment agency that takes place that isn't intentional.\nYou always have people intending to do what they do in the\nGovernment.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well -\nQUESTION: Nobody released these - nobody -\nnobody puts anything on a piece of paper, releases it,\nisn't intentional.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Certainly the - the intent to\nrelease the - the information would be correct, but that's\nnot the same as to say there was an intent to violate the\nPrivacy Act.\nQUESTION: Ah, in other words, in order to\nrecover - now, that's an important point to me - in order\nto recover, the plaintiff has to show that the government\nindividuals or the agency not only intended to do what did\nviolate the act, but they intended that what they did\nwould violate the Act. They knew about the - that's\nwillful, it's like they knew about the legal obligation\nand they intentionally violated it.\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's correct, Justice -\nQUESTION: Well, then, how did you ever win this\none?\nQUESTION: That's - that's - that's a very\nstrong -\nQUESTION: Yeah, very strong.\nQUESTION: - instruction. Ordinary - ignorance\nof the law is - is no defense, and there are all sorts of\nstatutes that use the word willful, which simply means\nthat you intended to do the act that you did, not that you\nknew it violated the law.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, in - in this case - I - the\nconsistent constructions of - of the Privacy Act is it's -\nit's greater than gross negligence. It - it necessarily\nencompasses more than just I intended to do something.\nIt's that I - I willfully blind to my obligations in the -\nQUESTION: Well, how about this case? How - how\nwas that shown in this case?\nMR. CAMPBELL: In pages - if I could point the\nCourt to pages - bear with me for one moment - pages 90 -\n96 -\nQUESTION: This was a - this was a distribution\nby administrative law judges -\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: - of hearing notices and decisions?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That - among other things. The\nanswer is yes, Justice O'Connor. On pages 96A to 97A of\nthe petitioner's appendix, there is the description of the\nmagistrate judge's finding that there was a willful\nviolation of the Privacy Act here and that there was a -\nthere was no attempt even - no even attempt to comply with\nthe act's requirements, and I - I would point -\nQUESTION: But to say there's no intent to comply\nisn't the same thing as saying that you knew you were\nviolating the act when you acted.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, let me amend my answer in\nthis way, Mr. Chief Justice. A willful ignorance - a\nwillful ignoring of the act's requirements would qualify\nas a willful - and I - I want to -\nQUESTION: Well, how can you - how can you\nwillfully ignore an act's requirements?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, the Department of Labor was\nwell aware of what the Privacy Act's requirements were and\nmade no attempt to get the administrative law judges to\ncomply, and - and I want to go back here this - to one of\nthe answers I gave with respect to your adverse effect\nquestions. This issue was decided by the magistrate\njudge, adopted by the district court, and this was never\nappealed by the Federal Government.\nQUESTION: Well, but our concern -\nQUESTION: We're concerned here, Justice Breyer\nand I guess - what is going to happen if we rule in your\nfavor? That will probably not result in any benefit for\nthe Government on this ground, but are we just opening a\ncan of worms or is - by ruling in your favor?\nMR. CAMPBELL: The answer is no, and - and\ncertainly I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, and Justice\nSouter and Justice Breyer, that in future cases there\nmight well be a lot more time spent litigating the issues\nof whether there was an adverse - truly an adverse effect\nand whether - and - and whether the - the violation was\ntruly intentional and willful. But I want to -\nQUESTION: Okay, but can - can we just go back to\nthat for a second?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Sure.\nQUESTION: Because we've been concentrating on\nwillful, and you say, well, willful requires a very high\nstandard. As - as you just indicated in your answers, the\nstatute doesn't require willful. It requires intentional\nor willful.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Or willful.\nQUESTION: And it would be even more remarkable\nto construe the - the term intentional as requiring\nconscious disregard of - of a known statutory obligation.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Let - let me answer this way in\nresponse, and maybe it will - will help ease the concerns.\nFor 22 years, the interpretation of the Privacy Act that\npetitioner offers today has been the law of the land, and\nin that -\nQUESTION: Do you have a case that says\nintentional standing alone must be construed to include\nthis conscious disregard of a - of a known legal\nprovision?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I can't cite a specific case for\nthat proposition, Justice Souter, but I again go back to\nwe were talking about intentional or willful, it's a high\nburden under any concept of what intentional or willful\nwill be, and for years, for 22 years, from 1975 to, at the\nearliest 1997, when the Sixth Circuit decided the Reno\ncase, the interpretation that I am offering this Court is\nthe one that the courts of appeals had unanimously\nadopted, and never in those 22 years had the kind of\nparade of horribles that the Government posits in this\ncase materialize.\nIndeed, if anything, if you look - there is a -\na reporter that lists every single case decided under the\nPrivacy Act since 1975.\nQUESTION: But have any of those cases involved\ndisclosure of Social Security numbers?\nMR. CAMPBELL: None that I recall. That seems to\nbe a relatively new -\nQUESTION: See, this seems to me a particular\nkind of disclosure that might happen over and over again\nin a very casual way.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I - I submit, Justice Stevens, if\nit happens in a casual way, that's not going to provide\nanyone with a cause of action.\nQUESTION: Well, pursuant to a policy such as\nthey had here of that's the way they use to identify -\ndriver's license they use it on, the Holiday Inn uses it\nfor their social - all sorts of people use Social Security\nnumber for another purpose.\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's true. It's certainly true\nthat Social Security numbers are used for other purposes.\nBut what is clear from this statute is that Congress was\nspecifically focused on concerns about Social Security\nnumbers being disclosed and the adverse effects that can\nresult from that.\nQUESTION: That - that may be true. What's\nbothering me, which may be the same thing, as Justice\nStevens says, is that I might have thought that a Labor\nDepartment official could reasonably think, I have a list\nof 50,000 people here, several are named John Smith, I\nwant to be sure we get the right ones so I'll put the\nSocial Security number as identifier. That doesn't on its\n- on its face seem like such an unreasonable thing to\nthink, even if it's wrong.\nAnd - and yet we have here a finding that not\nonly is it wrong, but that it's intentional and willful,\nand that's what brings up the problem you come to argue,\nand I don't know how to deal with it, because I think,\nwell, if this statute, intentional, willful really means\nthe tough thing that you say, well, then it'll work, then\nyou're right, there won't be a horrible. But then I see\nthis case, which seems to me to stand for the proposition\nthat that tough standard isn't being applied. And then I\nthink, my goodness, you're opening the door to the\nhorribles and - and I don't know how to do it because the\nother part isn't being argued. That's my honest dilemma.\nI put it to you.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I under - I well\nunderstand your dilemma, Justice Breyer, and I again go\nback to, I don't doubt if this - if the statute is given\nits natural reading, that the $1,000 statutory damages is\navailable to those to whom the United States shall be\nliable, there will be an awful lot more traction, a lot\nmore fighting over the adverse effect and the particular\ncircumstances that would rise to the level of an\nintentional or willful violation in the future.\nQUESTION: Mr. Campbell -\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's simply not an issue here.\nQUESTION: Really what - what Justice Breyer is\nsaying is - is that this issue of willfulness or not is\nnot in the case and we wish it were, because the answer to\nthat is important. Could we talk a little bit about what\nis in the case?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes, Justice Scalia, thank\nyou.\nQUESTION: Can - can you tell me what - I - I\nreally have trouble understanding how there can be an\nadverse effect without actual damage. That's a very\nstrange line. I mean, in - in the Administrative\nProcedure Act, you talk about any person adversely\naffected or aggrieved, and that's a person who suffered\ndamage. It seems very strange for Congress to use\nlanguage that - that sets up two different categories,\nadverse effect on the one hand, and actual damage on the\nother. When - when is there an adverse effect without\nactual damage?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think there frequently can be an\n- an emotional harm that is not quantifiable in dollar\nterms -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. CAMPBELL: - and that's very common in the\nlaw.\nQUESTION: That doesn't mean that it's not\nactual. It just means that it's hard to quantify, but\nyou've had the emotional harm. Why isn't that an - why\nisn't that actual - actual harm?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I - I want - I - I agree with you\nthat that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the\nthings that the Government is - is trying to cloud the\nissue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual\ndamages and actual harm. I submit they are different,\nthat the - in - in interpreting the statute, the\ndeliberate use of a term adverse effect and the deliberate\nuse of a term actual damages, those must be given\ndifferent meanings.\nQUESTION: Well, do you agree that, or do you\ncontend that adverse effect include - includes emotional\ndistress and that you have to show something like\nemotional distress before there is an adverse effect?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy,\nand that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal\ncourts on that question.\nQUESTION: What - what do you say about the\nposition of the - which I understood the circuit to be\ntaking that, on the assumption that there - there was some\nemotional damage, at least in the sense that the - the man\nsaid, I was very upset when I heard that the number was\nout. Assuming that, I thought the Fourth Circuit was\nsaying, there is a category of harm that is generally non\ncompensable in the law, and we assume it ought to be non\ncompensable here, and that category is emotional damage,\nwhich has no physical manifestation. And the general\npolicy behind that is, we don't allow generally, tort law\ndoesn't allow recovery there because it's too easy to\nfake.\nAnd the Fourth Circuit, I thought, was saying,\nyou know, whether you're talking about damage or whether\nyou're talking about effect, this is an effect that the\nlaw simply doesn't generally recognize and it shouldn't be\nrecognized here. That's a different issue from whether it\ncan be quantified or not. What the circuit was saying is,\nyou don't even get to the point of proving quantification.\nWhat - what is your response to that?\nMR. CAMPBELL: If that is indeed what the Fourth\nCircuit's position is, it's squarely wrong. At common law\nand intentional torts generally, and in privacy torts\nspecifically, this type of harm is compensable in some at\nleast minimal way, even if it cannot be quantified, and I\nthink that's why -\nQUESTION: What about - even if there is no\nphysical manifestation?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Even if there is no physical\nmanifestation. Indeed, I submit, Justice Souter, it's -\nthere's nothing surprising about the overall remedial\nscheme here, because it does track what happened at common\nlaw and intentional torts and with respect to intentional\nprivacy torts. In fact, the Privacy Act is more strict\neven than what was required at common law. At common law,\neven no damage at all, no - I'm sorry - I don't - I don't\nwant to get back into the confusion over the terms. Even\nif there was no harm at all, there would be still be some\nat least minimal award, recognizing the invasion.\nQUESTION: Sure, because privacy -\nMR. CAMPBELL: Here you have to put -\nQUESTION: - I mean, in your - I understand your\nprivacy argument, but that's because the invasion of\nprivacy or the infringement of privacy is regarded simply\nas - as injury per se, and - and I thought the circuit was\nsaying, that's not what we're dealing with here. But\nyou're saying, what, privacy is privacy and - and -\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I want to -\nQUESTION: But it's - but if that is so, then let\nme just get to my question. If that is so, why did the\nstatute go into speaking of actual damage at all? Why\ndidn't the statute simply say, if they invade the privacy\nby publishing something they shouldn't publish, you get at\nleast $1,000 regardless. But that's not what it said.\nIt's keyed it to actual damage, and it said, if there's\nactual damage, the person entitled to recovery for actual\ndamage gets at least 1,000, which is something quite\ndifferent. It does not take the position that it's a per\nse compensable harm.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I, of course, disagree\nwith your characterization of what subsection (A) in fact\nsays, but let me go back to first part of the answer. We\nare talking about an adverse effect, so we are talking\nabout having to prove a harm. We're not just talking\nabout the ability to vindicate a privacy interest in the\nabstract. You can certainly do that at common law, and\nCongress could have written a statute that allowed you to\ndo that under the Privacy Act. It didn't. It did at\nleast require that you demonstrate an adverse effect and\nreal harm.\nQUESTION: And what - can - can you - and this\ngoes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is\nthe difference in adverse effect and actual damage?\nMR. CAMPBELL: The difference is the ability to\nquantify the harm in some dollar amount.\nQUESTION: Yes, but if that's - if that's the\ncase, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to\nidentity theft would be increased by the disclosure of\nyour Social Security number, and if that's true, and I\nthink some people could prove the risk is increased, that\nwould be true of every release of every Social Security\nnumber.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I would certainly agree\nthat there is a real risk of identity theft any time\nthere's a disclosure of a Social Security number,\nparticularly as here when it's linked directly with the\nname.\nQUESTION: So does it not necessarily follow that\nevery one of those releases causes an adverse effect?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I don't think it is. There could\nbe - there could be people who aren't bothered by that or\nwho don't share that fear.\nQUESTION: Whether they're bothered about it or\nnot, they're - they have an increased risk, just if you\nincrease your risk of death, maybe they're not aware of\nit, but it's still an adverse effect.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, I do not contend that the\nPrivacy Act is a statute that - that compensates in some\nway for merely increased risk. I think that does go back\nto the adverse effect here. You do have to have some sort\nof harm that actualizes, and here it did actualize in his\nreal emotional distress about the disclosure.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it.\nThe harm does actualize, as you say it, once the Social\nSecurity number is released, the harm actualizes. You're\nat greater risk than you were before. That's - that's\nactual as can be.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I can't support that\ninterpretation of the act, although candidly, it - it\nprobably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the - in\nthe run-of-the-mine case. And the reason is this: If the\n- if the disclosure itself is the adverse effect, what\nhappens is that the causation language in subsection\n(g)(1)(D) becomes superfluous, and I am being careful to\nthe - the text here -\nQUESTION: Well, it's superfluous with respect to\nSocial Security numbers, but the statute covers a whole\nrange of activities other than this particular case.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I\n- I - but I'm not sure - I - I don't think the answer is\nthat it would be just superfluous with respect to Social\nSecurity numbers. In every case, if the release of any\ninformation, let's say it's a medical record, not a Social\nSecurity number. If the release itself is the adverse\neffect, the problem is that does not - that does not hew\nto the - the causation language contained in subsection\n(g)(1)(D).\nQUESTION: Well, the release of medical\ninformation doesn't necessarily increase the risk of any\nparticular harm. But this particular information does\nincrease the risk of an identity theft for everybody.\nMR. CAMPBELL: It does increase that - it does\nincrease the risk -\nQUESTION: It is not true if you say, well,\nyou're taking aspirin three times a day or something like\nthat. So what? But this is not a so-what situation.\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, it's a - I agree, Justice\nStevens. It does increase the risk, but - but for some\npeople, that increased risk may not cause them an adverse\neffect, the personal adverse effect.\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal, if I may.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Campbell.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin by discussing the distinction\nas we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual\ndamages. And as one of Justice Scalia's questions\nindicate, the term adverse effect is not one that\noriginated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art.\nThe general judicial review provision of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to\npersons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think\nit's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show\nthat he has suffered the type of harm that would\nordinarily be compensable in damages.\nBecause the APA excludes money damages as an\navailable item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under\nthe APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is\nwhether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not\nwhether he has been harmed in the past. And if we had a\nhypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an\nongoing or imminent program by which the Government\nintended to release Social Security numbers, and a\nparticular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that\nmy own Social Security number will be released in the near\nfuture, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself\nto establish that that person was adversely affected or\naggrieved within the meaning of the act.\nHe would be suffering a - a violation of his\nlegal right to have information about him maintained\nwithin the Government's files and he would also suffer at\nleast an increased risk of identity theft. That would be\nenough to get him into the - into court to seek\nprospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief. But those\ncertainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would\nordinarily be compensable in damages.\nQUESTION: Well, but that - but that's not the\nquestion. It - it - the point is it's - it's not only\nenough to get him into court, which is what it is said\nadverse effect does here, it is enough under the APA to\ngive him judgment. He wins.\nMR. STEWART: He wins -\nQUESTION: It - it is enough to give - to make\nhis claim a valid - a valid claim.\nMR. STEWART: He - he wins but -\nQUESTION: And the reason he can't get money\ndamages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely\naffected. It has to do with simply the fact that money\ndamages are not available under the APA.\nMR. STEWART: But -\nQUESTION: But he wins under the APA.\nMR. STEWART: But the fact that a plaintiff can\nwin under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the\ndamages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what\nis implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an\navailable item of relief, namely the view that agency\naction should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and\nplaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by\nunlawful government conduct in the future should\nordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that\nthat not take place. But plaintiffs are not ordinarily\nentitled to receive money damages from the Government for\nwrongs committed against them.\nQUESTION: And I take it you're - you're saying\nhere - and they're not here because there's a further\nrequirement of actual damage before they get money.\nMR. STEWART: That - that's right.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. STEWART: That the damages provisions\nrestricts the availability of monetary relief to a person\nentitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to\nrecovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who\nhas not only established a violation of law, but who has\nestablished the prerequisites to an award of compensatory\nrelief.\nQUESTION: Why - why did they put that phrase,\nentitled to recovery, in there in addition to actual\ndamages? I'll be candid with you that I - I was thinking\nthat maybe they put it in there because they anticipated\nthis - this category of cases like emotional damage\nwithout physical manifestations is non-compensable, and\nthat - and that they were trying to leave open that kind\nof a condition.\nMR. STEWART: One - one hypothesis as to why the\nphrase may appear as it does. The phrase originated in\nthe Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate\nversion said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an\nintentional or willful violation can collect actual or\ngeneral damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall\nreceive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of\nthat provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery,\ncould be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either\nactual or general damages.\nQUESTION: Well, he is entitled to recover actual\ndamages if he has any.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. STEWART: But that -\nQUESTION: And he's entitled to recover it if he\ndoesn't have any. He's entitled to recover it, whether he\nhas some or whether he doesn't have some. So I will - I\ndon't understand, you say the most natural meaning of a\nperson entitled to recovery is a person entitled to\nrecovery who actually has actual damages. That isn't how\nI'd normally read it. I'd - I'd read it somebody who's -\nwho's entitled to get it if he has it.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess that's the issue.\nQUESTION: Yeah, that is the issue. So I just\nwant you to explain a little bit more -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think -\nQUESTION: - about why that's the most natural\nreading.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, the more - I think the more\nnatural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is\nsomeone who not only has established some of the\nprerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory\naward, but who has established all of them. And if the\nonly compensatory relief available is actual damages, then\na person who hasn't established actual damages is not\nentitled to recovery.\nBut even if a plausible argument could be made\nthe other way, then the canon of construction that waivers\nof sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would\ncompel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way.\nQUESTION: Well, plus - plus the canon that -\nthat you don't give words a meaning that renders them\ntotally superfluous.\nMR. STEWART: That - that's -\nQUESTION: And if it means what Justice Breyer\nsuggests, you can just leave out the words, a person\nentitled to recovery.\nMR. STEWART: Or - or -\nQUESTION: Just read it, but in no case shall he\nreceive less than the sum of 10,000, of $1,000.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. If - if Congress\nhad intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse\neffect from a willful or intentional violation would\nautomatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used\nthe word person or individual or complainant, which was -\nwhich were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the\nPrivacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had\narguably been violated.\nQUESTION: Or just - just drop entitled to\nrecovery.\nMR. STEWART: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Shall a person receive less than the\nsum of -\nMR. STEWART: And the other point I would - we\nwould make in following up on one of Justice -\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, if - and before going to\nthe words of the statute, this - there are any number of\nstatutes that have actual damages and it can say, or the\nstatutory damages, and some of them have this formula,\nactual damages and person entitled to recover, and then\nthere's shades in between. Do you - do you really think\nthat Congress, by using those different formulas, meant a\ndifferent result in what would seem to be cases that don't\n- are not sensibly distinguished?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think we have\nto infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant\nsomething by the choice of words that it used. And the\nphrase entitled to recovery is -\nQUESTION: A benign fiction, right?\nMR. STEWART: A benign fiction, that's right.\nAnd I think it is also the case that the phrase, person\nentitled to recovery, is used very rarely in the United\nStates Code.\nlines of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater,\nreferences to statutory damages or liquidated damages.\nBut the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is very rare\nand we would presume that Congress intended something\nspecific -\nQUESTION: All right. I - I would - rather than\ndo the presumption of what they intended deduced from\ncanons, et cetera. You assume that it is ambiguous. You\ncertainly got me there. I'm - I see it's ambiguous. And\nI also believe that Congress did not want to bankrupt the\nTreasury, destroying Medicare, Social Security, and every\nother programs we give $1 trillion in damages to people\nwho have the social - I - I - you've got me there.\nNow, how do - what they - what your opponents\nsay is that is a made-up problem. It doesn't - it isn't\ngoing to happen, and the reason it isn't going to happen\nis because these words, intentional or willful, are not\nused, the word intentional, as it normally is. It's used\nin a very special way so that they have to almost - well,\nyou've - now, you've - I'm cross-referencing our earlier\nargument and I'm at a dilemma here because it's not\nargued, I don't know how to deal with it, but it seems\nrelevant to the underlying question that is moving me\nabout what Congress intended.\nMR. STEWART: The petitioner is correct that the\nphrase intentional or willful has been construed by the\nlower courts essentially as a term of art, and the\nprevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency\nexhibited flagrant disregard for -\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry. The lower court thing\nthat we've looked up uses an or about that, and one of the\nparts of the or is without grounds for believing the\naction to be lawful, which means that part of the test,\nthat if we have an ALJ, or we have people in the agency,\njust never think about it, as they might not in this case,\nthat that cover - is covered by intentional or lawful.\nAnd that's one of the problems I'm having, because it\nmakes me think that that word intentional is a pretty\ncomplicated issue, which isn't argued. It seems to be\nvery important, and I don't know what to do.\nMR. STEWART: I - I think, with respect to the -\nthe language from the court of appeals' opinion that you\nquoted, the without grounds to believe that -\nQUESTION: I have three of them like that.\nMR. STEWART: Right. I - I think what the courts\nare getting at is something at least akin to the standard\nthat would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual\nFederal officer was sued, where the question would be,\ncould a reasonable officer in this person's position have\nbelieved that what he was doing was legal?\ncourts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly\nmore deferential to the Government.\nIn - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the\nGovernment has to have been shown either to have\nintentionally violated the law or to have intentionally\nsought to bring about harm to the plaintiff.\nQUESTION: Do we have to decide that in this\ncase?\nMR. STEWART: No, no, I don't think you need to\ndecide that.\nQUESTION: I'd like a lot more argument on it\nbefore I decide that question.\nMR. STEWART: That - that's correct.\nQUESTION: Why -\nQUESTION: And some briefing on it.\nMR. STEWART: As the case comes to this Court,\nboth parties are in agreement, or neither party contests\nthe proposition that an intentional or willful violation\nwas established.\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, what has happened in the\n28-some years that this has been in effect concerning the\namount of recoveries against the Government?\nMR. STEWART: I - I would candidly acknowledge we\nhave not had a problem with enormous recoveries against\nthe Government up to this point.\nQUESTION: What happened in the 1990 lawsuit you\nrefer to on mailing of IRS farm - form 1040s, that had a\nSocial Security number and the name.\nMR. STEWART: That - that was -\nQUESTION: What happened to that case?\nMR. STEWART: That was ultimately dismissed on\nthe ground that the Social Security numbers were not\nrecords, which is contrary to the general course of the\nlaw, which is that Social Security numbers would be - be\nrecords. I - I want to be careful about this because we\nare not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably\nfollow from a loss in this case. What we are saying is,\nif we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is\ngiven the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in\nthe APA, the Government would be subject to enormous\npotential liability.\nTo take an example, following up on one of\nJustice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the\nPrivacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful\ndisclosures. It contains a range of other provisions that\ncould be best be described as technical or even\nbureaucratic. One, for instance, is that when the\nGovernment collects information from private individuals,\nit has to identify, among other things, the source of\nauthority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive\norder that authorizes the information to be collected.\nAnd if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and\nleft off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA\nstandards, any person who returned information on that\nform would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he\nwould have been deprived of -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but that won't hurt you if - if,\nin fact, to show liability here, you have to show that the\nagency officials who made up that form knew - let's make\nit really tough - knew that leaving it off was command -\nputting it on was commanded by the act and they say, ha ha\nha, I know it's commanded by the act, but I'm not going to\ndo it.\nMR. STEWART: I mean -\nQUESTION: Now, that'll be pretty rare and the -\nMR. STEWART: It would be rare.\nQUESTION: So the -\nMR. STEWART: Well, you could - you could imagine\na situation, and we wouldn't condone this - this conduct,\nbut you can imagine a situation in which an agency\nofficial gets back the 100,000 forms from the printer and\nsays, oh my gosh, the U.S. Code cite was left off, but\nthen decides, I know we're supposed to do this, but I'm\nnot going to reprint 100,000 forms for something like\nthat, let's circulate them. We don't condone that\nbehavior. It would be a violation of law, but it's hard\nto imagine that Congress would have intended that\neverybody who fills out information on those forms would\nthen be entitled to $1,000.\nQUESTION: Just to try to get this issue out of\nthe case, are you content to have us decide this case on -\non the assumption, just for the sake of argument but\nwithout ruling, that - that the act requires willfulness\nin the - in the most extreme sense that Justice Breyer\ndescribes? Are you willing to have us decide the case on\nthat assumption?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nQUESTION: You're willing to have us decide what\nwas not - what it was over, that there is an adverse\neffect? In fact, the - the Government didn't dispute\nthat, didn't dispute adverse effect, did it?\nMR. STEWART: Not - not as to Buck Doe. The -\nthe magistrate judge held that each of the plaintiffs had\nestablished an adverse effect simply by release of the\nSocial Security numbers, and the district court didn't\nexpressly endorse that view, but didn't reject it either.\nQUESTION: Is it your - is it your argument - and\nI'm glad we're back to the statute - that in order to\ndetermine in this case, in this case, whether there was a\ncause of action, you had to read beyond the adverse effect\nclause and go down to for - or before - and decide also\nwhether there was actual damages, before there was a cause\nof action?\nMR. STEWART: You - you wouldn't have to decide\nwhether there was proof of actual damages, but yes, I\nthink if it was apparent on the complaint that there was\nan adverse effect but no possibility of proving actual\ndamages, then the suit shouldn't be - shouldn't go\nforward, but -\nQUESTION: That - that's an - that's an unusual\nway to write the statute. It's unusual to - to write the\nstatute in a way where I don't know if I have a cause of\naction until I get down to where the damages are defined.\nMR. STEWART: I - I agree, but I think it would\nbe -\nQUESTION: Usually I would say that any person\ninjured is the way we would expect this statute to have\nbeen written.\nMR. STEWART: I agree, and it may be that to -\nCongress anticipated that questions concerning damages\nwould be resolved at the end of the day, and there would\nobviously be a lot of cases in which a plaintiff would\nallege damages at the outset, and therefore, would have a\ncause of action, but if he failed to prove damages in the\n- the course of the trial, he wouldn't be entitled to the\n$1,000, even if he proved that he suffered an adverse\neffect from a willful or intentional violation.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Stewart, I - I take it that\neven - even if there was no indication of actual damage,\nthe - by - by pleading the violation of the statute, he\nwould at least have pleaded enough to entitle him to - to\nask for a - to ask for equitable relief.\nMR. STEWART: We would say that equitable relief\nis not, in this context, is not specifically authorized by\nthe Privacy Act. But we would say that equitable relief\nwould be available under the APA, and the allegation would\nbe that the -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: - agency's action was not in\naccordance with law -\nQUESTION: I - I see.\nMR. STEWART: - because it violated the Privacy\nAct.\nQUESTION: May -\nMR. STEWART: So - so - and indeed, this suit at\nthe outset included a request for injunctive relief\nagainst further disclosures, and the Government settled\nthat part of the case with lightning speed. There was -\nthe - the plaintiff did obtain a judicial order directing\nthe Government not to continue with its practice.\nQUESTION: So indeed there's - there - there's\nnothing bizarre about letting him get into court just on\nthe basis of - of an adverse effect, because he can win in\ncourt on the basis of an adverse effect, not by reason of\nthis act alone, but by reason of the obligations under\nthis Act plus the APA.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: May I - may I go to another issue? I\nmean, one of things that's bothering us is several issues\nthat seem crucial, which we're just having to make\nassumptions about here, and depending on the assumptions,\nthe scope of liability may - may be enormous.\nHere's the one that is bothering me. The - the\nGovernment is not contesting here that in fact there -\nthere was some kind of actual damage, even though it was\nnot quantified.\nMR. STEWART: No, I think we are contesting that.\nQUESTION: Well, I - but - but you're not\ncontesting the fact - let me put it - I - I misspoke -\nyou're not contesting the fact that if he showed emotional\ndamage and emotional damage alone, no physical effects,\nthat that would be enough for recovery if - if a fact-\nfinder said, well, I think the emotional damage is worth\n$250 -\nMR. STEWART: No, no. We - we are contesting\nthat and -\nQUESTION: You are contesting that?\nMR. STEWART: It hasn't really been -\nQUESTION: Are - may - may I ask you just a\nfurther question, then you can tell me which - whatever\nyou want. Are you contesting as a matter of law the\nsufficiency of this plaintiff's testimony to at least get\nto the fact-finder on whether there was actual damage? He\ntestified - I forget his exact words - but he testified,\nyou know, I was so upset when I heard that they had\nreleased my Social Security number, I just didn't know\nwhat to do or what to say, something like that. Are you\ncontesting the sufficiency of that evidence to put an\nissue of actual damage to the fact-finder?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, and let me backtrack for a\nsecond to say that the Fourth Circuit decided that Mr. Doe\nhad not proved actual damages, and the petitioner did not\nseek this Court's review of that holding, so -\nQUESTION: But they said he didn't prove actual\ndamages because there was no physical effect.\nMR. STEWART: That - that's right. There was -\nQUESTION: They didn't say that, as a matter of\nlaw, if you don't have the emotional physical effect rule,\nhe wouldn't have had enough to - to get to the fact-finder\nan actual damage.\nMR. STEWART: That - that's correct. My - my\nonly point was, the reason we haven't briefed the question\nof whether there were in fact actual damages is that our\nunderstanding is that, because petitioner didn't seek this\nCourt's review of that aspect of the - the court of\nappeals' holding, as the case comes to the Court, we're\nassuming that there were no actual damages.\nQUESTION: And you didn't - you didn't cross?\nMR. STEWART: But - but to answer your - your\nquestion about what the Government's position on the law\nis, our - our first argument is that in the context of\nthis specific statute, the phrase actual damages refers\nonly to pecuniary harm, and we've cited in a footnote a\nconflict among the circuits with respect to that question,\nand that - that isn't presented by this case.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: But we would -\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a question\nwith respect to that? Suppose this Doe said, I'm very\nconcerned about the impact of this on my credit rating, so\nI'm going to spend $10 to a credit - credit reporting\ncompany to find out whether there's been any theft of my\nidentity, $10. Would there then be a claim under this\nstatute for actual damages?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, there - there would be a\nquestion of whether that was - whether there was\ncausation, whether that was a reasonable response to the\nthreat, but in theory, an expense like that could qualify\nas pecuniary harm and, thus, is actual damages.\nQUESTION: But it made - it made me think that if\nthere's ambiguity in this statute, that wouldn't have made\nmuch sense for Congress to write a statute like this\nwhere, to meet the actual damage requirement, all you have\nto do is make a $10 expense.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I agree that it's a\nsomewhat anomalous result that the availability of the\nthousand can turn on a relatively small pecuniary loss.\nIt's - it's somewhat analogous at least to the common law\nrule that punitive damages are available only to a\nplaintiff who's shown some level of compensatory damages,\nand there also a plaintiff might be able to contrive a\nsmall loss that is compensable, and thereby make himself\neligible for punitive damages that far exceed the amount\nof -\nQUESTION: But it's not just not contrived,\nbecause now it's a formula for - for all the people who\nhave this kind of complaint, so I think if that's what -\nwhat the line is, then Mr. Doe, is it, all the future Mr.\nDoes will ask to have their credit checked.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, we would still want to - we\nwould still have to know whether that was in fact a\nreasonable response to what the Government had did - done\n- and what the - the threat that it posed to the - the\nplaintiff. And even if that kind of machination might be\npossible in in one category of cases, it would still not\nbe possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of\nPrivacy Act violations.\nTo continue with my answer to Justice Souter's\nquestion, the - the second thing we would say about the\nemotional injury is that, even if some emotional harms\nwere compensable as actual damages under the statute, we\ndon't think that the particular emotional harm alleged\nhere would be, because a Social Security number, unlike,\nfor instance, intimate details about a person's family\nlife, is not inherently private or secret or confidential.\nIt's not the sort of information that would cause a person\nto say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else\nknew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't\ngoing to misuse it against me.\nThe - the reason that people are worried about\nrelease of Social Security numbers is that that release\nmay lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify\ntheft or -\nQUESTION: So you're saying as a matter of law,\nthis is just what he testified to is simply too de minimis\nto be considered evidence -\nMR. STEWART: That -\nQUESTION: - sufficient evidence.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And we've cited\nthe Metro-North case in our brief, and I think that the\nharm - the emotional harm that he's alleged is really -\nreally very similar to the fear of cancer as a result of\nasbestos exposure that was held not to be compensable in\nthe absence of some current physical impairment.\nSo to - to - follow up on this and make our\nposition absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term\nadverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every\nplaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful\nor intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the\npotential financial consequences would be enormous. Now,\nI would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's\nquite possible that the Government would argue in the\nlower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the\nphrase adverse effect should be given a narrower\nconstruction under this statute than under the APA. But\nour basic point is -\nQUESTION: May I ask, with respect to the parade\nof horribles that we're confronted with, is I - it's my\nunderstanding that there are several other statutes under\nentirely different statutes, they have the similar\nprovision but they're clearly worded in a way that says,\nif you get anything, you'll get the minimum, and - but\nit's the position that your opponent contends is the\nproper reading of that statute. There are several such\nstatutes, am I -\nMR. STEWART: There are a lot of statutes with\nwording, for instance, to the effect of a plaintiff who\nestablishes a violation will receive actual damages or\n$1,000, whichever is greater. Most of those don't apply\nto suits against the United States -\nQUESTION: And - and -\nMR. STEWART: - but there are many such laws.\nQUESTION: And most of those would not require\nproof of actual damages?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. Under the plain\nterms of the statute, the plaintiff would get the 1,000 -\nQUESTION: Why in your view did Congress come up\nwith a different formula in this case than it has in that\n- in the pattern of statutes that those represent?\nMR. STEWART: I'm - part of it may be that most\nof those statutes are not dealing with suits against the\nUnited States, and Congress may be more protective of the\npublic fisc, and part of it is the - the legislative\ndebates reveal that Congress considered a variety of\npotential damages provisions, some of which were more\ngenerous than the one that was ultimately enacted, some of\nthem less generous. For instance, the more generous\nprovisions -\nQUESTION: But this statute is unique, is it not?\nMR. STEWART: It's not quite unique. I believe\nthere are a couple of other provisions that use the\nphrase, person entitled to recovery, and that phrase has\nnot been authoritatively construed by this Court, so those\n- interpretation of those statutes would raise the same\nquestion this one does.\nQUESTION: But there's a number of them that\nstart out with actual damages.\nMR. STEWART: And - and sometimes, again, the\nwords are to the effect of actual damages or $1,000,\nwhichever is greater. And because the availability of the\n$1,000 is not limited to a, quote, person entitled to\nrecovery, unquote, the plain language of many of those\nstatutes compels the conclusion that $1,000 will be\nawardable regardless of actual damages.\nQUESTION: Now, there was an interpretation -\nCongress told OMB to do interpretive guides, and it did,\nand it - and it gave it the meaning that this plaintiff\ngives it. It's - it read the statute - didn't - wasn't\nthat what OMB said?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think the more - I think\nyou're right that the more natural reading - the OMB\nguideline didn't address in terms the situation where a\nplaintiff shows no actual damages but nevertheless claims\nthe thousand, but the OMB guideline did say, a person who\nsuffers an adverse effect from a willful or an intention\nviolation shall receive a 1,000 - actual damages or\n$1,000, whichever is greater.\nQUESTION: It said actual damages or 1,000. As I\nunderstood the - that original interpretation, it was the\nreading that the plaintiff is putting forward here and\nyour response to it in your brief seemed to be that was a\nwrong interpretation because it didn't take account of\nsovereign immunity or saving the sovereign fisc and an\nofficial at OMB said it was wrong and it's not - no longer\neffective.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think if - if plaintiffs\nare using the OMB interpretation to establish the point\nthat intelligent people can read the statute the way that\nthey did, I - I think it's validly used for that purpose.\nBut the OMB guideline is not entitled to deference, as the\nCourt held in Adams Fruit, a statutory provision that is\nto administered solely by the courts is not one as to\nwhich the Court will defer to administrative\ninterpretations. The - the OMB -\nQUESTION: But didn't - didn't Congress designate\nOMB to - to these guides?\nMR. STEWART: Congress designated OMB, but it's -\nthe particular provision that is at - specifically at\nissue is reprinted at page 13a to the appendix to the\nGovernment's brief. And it says, the director of the\nOffice of Management and Budget shall develop and, after\nnotice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe\nguidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in\nimplementing the provisions of this section.\nSo the only specific directive that OMB had was\nto instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive\nobligations under the act. Now, in the course of doing\nthat, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further\nand offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences\nwould follow if they breached their substantive\nobligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically\nentrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any\nbasis for inferring that Congress -\nQUESTION: I see. You're - you're saying that -\nthat it - it was meant just to tell the agencies what you\nhave to do to comply with the act.\nMR. STEWART: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Yeah, that - that's probably the best\nreading of it.\nMR. STEWART: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. STEWART: So the - the last - the last point\nI wanted to make is, it might be possible, if - if we lost\nthis case, it might be possible to mitigate the financial\nconsequences to the Government by giving the term adverse\neffect a narrow construction, but our - our view is, if\nthe consequence of adopting plaintiff's reading of the\nphrase person entitled to recovery is that an established\nterm of art like adverse effect has to be construed in\nother than its normal manner in order to make the statute\nmake sense, there's something wrong with plaintiff's\nreading.\nQUESTION: But why - why do you say that?\nBecause, see, the adverse effect part governs people who\ndon't even want damages. I mean, it - it's to get into\ncourt, it's just to get into court, bring the suit, isn't\nit?\nMR. STEWART: Right.\nQUESTION: So - so I would have thought that your\n- your reaction - I just want you to clarify this - would\nbe, if they win this case, then the reaction would be to\ngo back and say, all right, if we're going to give $1,000\nto people who really are just feeling bad about what\nhappened, we've got to give them all $1,000, well, it's\nonly in circumstances where the agency really did\nsomething quite wrong. And so you'll read that\nintentional or willful requirement toughly, not - not the\nadverse effect part tough. I mean, why - why wouldn't\nthat be the reaction?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I guess if - if this - if\nthis Court held that the phrase intentional or willful was\nlimited to situations -\nQUESTION: I don't see - yeah?\nMR. STEWART: If it - if it was limited to\nsituations in which the Government set out to violate an\nindividual's rights under the Privacy Act, that - that\nwould be another way at least of -\nQUESTION: Yeah, yeah, and then you'd say, well,\nwe should assume that's what happened here, though. It\ncertainly didn't -\nMR. STEWART: I - I mean -\nQUESTION: - but we should assume that. Now,\nsuppose I assume that, and then I decide that they're\nright on the basis of that assumption, and then in the\nnext case it turns out my assumption happened to be quite\nwrong because Congress had a broad intent there. Now what\nhappens?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, even under the narrowest\npossible interpretation of what intentional or willful\nmeans, you could have hypotheticals like the one with the\nform that left off the U.S.C. cite, and again, we - we\nhope those things would happen very rarely, but it seems\nhighly unlikely that Congress would have wanted each of\nthe hundred thousand people who put on - information on\nthe form to get $1,000. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Campbell, you have five minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CAMPBELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first\npoint to you, because I - I think you put your finger on\none of the number of - of absurd results, or difficult-\nto-swallow results that flow from accepting the\nGovernment's interpretation. The Government's essential\ncontention here is that quantification of actual damages\nis an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy,\nwhat a strange way to write the statute if that's what\nCongress intended.\nThe - the relative language is reproduced at\npages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that\nwhenever an agency fails to comply with any other\nprovision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in\nsuch a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,\nthe individual may bring a civil action against the\nagency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there. You then\ngo to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse\neffect was the result of an intentional or willful\nviolation, then the Government, the United States shall be\nliable, in the sum - in an amount equal to the sum of.\nLiability is established once those three\nprerequisites are met. All that is left at that point is\nan exercise of arithmetic. It would be a very strange\nstatute that says the United States shall be liable in the\nsum of the following amounts you are to add up, and that\namount would be zero. And, in fact, that would never be\nthe case. Costs are always available to a Privacy Act\nplaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an\nintentional or willful violation of the act.\nSo there are certainly going to be at least some\nrecovery. There's no qualification of the costs award\nwith reasonableness of precondition of actual damages. So\nsome - there is going to be a recovery in those cases.\nNow, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a\nvery - it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two,\na statute that arguably is unconstitutional. But you\ndon't need to read it that way, because the natural\nreading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes,\nCongress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy\ninvasions very typically result in emotional harms that\ninherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't\nintend, I can't imagine, to - to make the line of recovery\nturn on whether you can prove that you put 37 - a 37-cent\nstamp on an - on an envelope to get your credit report or\npay the $10 fee. That's a very arbitrary line. Why would\nCongress be solicitous of people who suffer the same harm\n- be solicitous of the one who put a stamp on an envelope?\nThat's a nonsensical.\nMoreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that\nare realized under the act as Congress intended by saying,\nlook, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof\nissues. If you have an emotional distress and it's\ntypical, it's caused by the intentional violation, we\ndon't go through that. You get your damages of $1,000 and\nlet's not go through the proof. That's a very natural\nreading of the act.\nBut the Government - the Government is asking\nyou to adopt a - an interpretation that has a number of\nadditional problems. It renders the adverse effect\nrequirement superfluous. Proof of actual damages will\nnecessarily in every case require proof of an actual harm\nand causation. So even the attempt by the Government to\nplace a - a meaning on the adverse effect requirement must\nfail.\nbest, renders shall illusory, because the sum would be\nzero in much cases.\nQUESTION: As to your point about the - the\ncosts. You don't get costs unless, it says the court may\nassess reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation\ncosts reasonably incurred in any case in which the\ncomplainant has substantially prevailed. And I assume\nthat when later on they - they say the costs of the action\ntogether with reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by\nthe court, they're referring back to the court has allowed\nthose - those costs and fees, because he has substantially\nprevailed?\nMR. STEWART: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I - are\nyou referring to the language that's in (g)(2) and (g)(3)\nof the statute?\nQUESTION: Yes, I am.\nMR. STEWART: (g)(2) and (g)(3) are entirely\ndifferent causes of actions. Those deal with requests for\ninjunctive relief, and this is the only type of injunctive\nrelief under the Privacy Act, injunctive relief for access\nto files or correction of files. Those are separate\ncauses of action. In fact, I submit, Justice Scalia -\nQUESTION: I see. I see what you're saying.\nMR. STEWART: - that the contrast in the language\nbetween (g)(2) and (g)(3) -\nQUESTION: I see what you're saying.\nMR. STEWART: - and (g)(4) proves my point.\nHere, Congress anticipated that there is a substantial -\nsubstantially prevailing party. That party -\nQUESTION: Well, what assumption would you like\nus to make -\nQUESTION: Right, right.\nQUESTION: - in respect to the meaning of\nintentional or willful?\nMR. STEWART: I - I submit that a perfectly\nproper interpretation of intentional or willful can\ninclude conscious disregard of - of the - of the legal\nobligations. That's a well-established standard.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
