        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in 04-1506, Arkansas Department of\nHealth and Human Services v. Ahlborn.\nMs. Freno.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI FRENO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. FRENO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe parties agree that Medicaid paid over\n$215,000 to cover the costs of medical care provided to\nMs. Ahlborn that resulted from an auto accident that\nshe was involved in. The parties also agree that the\nPetitioner, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human\nServices, may place a lien on some portion of the third\nparty settlement proceeds that are at issue in this\ncase. They disagree, however, as to what extent that\nlien may reach into the third party settlement proceeds\nin this case.\nThe Respondent, without notifying the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, finalized a\nsettlement with the remaining tortfeasor accepting\n$550,000 as a compromised settlement for a claim that\nshe had originally valued at over $3 million.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me? It's my\n-- excuse me. My understanding was that Arkansas had\nintervened in the suit.\nMS. FRENO: That is correct, Your Honor.\nArkansas did intervene in the lawsuit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So after the settlement, I\ntake it Arkansas would -- still would have had the\nright to -- to pursue its claim in the litigation, or\nam I wrong about that?\nMS. FRENO: Well, Your Honor, after -- at the\npoint that Arkansas learned about the settlement, the\ncase had already been dismissed out of State court with\nprejudice, and the Respondent notified the department\nthat if it would not accept -- it would not compromise\nits Medicaid claim, that they would be filing a\ndeclaratory judgment action in Federal court to resolve\nthe anti-lien question. And that is how we ended up in\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if Arkansas was a party\nto the case, it didn't get notice of the dismissal?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what I don't\nunderstand.\nMS. FRENO: They -- it did not get notice of\nthe dismissal. No, it did not, Your Honor. We do not\nknow what happened, but we did not get notice of the\ndismissal until after the case was dismissed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't understand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How can they do that with\n-- with a party? I mean, the -- and the reason -- the\nreason I ask is it seems to me that you still have the\ncause of action left. Maybe that would be my next\nquestion.\nSuppose there's a settlement and you don't\nget, in the settlement, even earmarks, medical\nspecialists, plus general damages, and you're -- you're\nunsatisfied. Don't you still have the right under\nArkansas law -- or do you -- to pursue the tortfeasor\nfor the balance that's owed to you?\nMS. FRENO: Arguably Arkansas could have\nattempted to get the case reopened in State court, but\nthe Petitioner -- I'm sorry -- the Respondent in this\ncase selected the Federal forum to resolve the issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but that's not that issue.\nThat is, I think the question is, why is it that this\nstatute doesn't simply provide the following route?\nParty A and party B enter into a settlement, and they\nsay $10,000 is for medical and $90,000 is for pain and\nsuffering. You, Arkansas, are out $50,000. Well,\nfine. You're in the case anyway. Sue the defendant\nfor the remaining $40,000.\nMS. FRENO: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's the end of it.\nMS. FRENO: I'm not familiar with the terms\nof the settlement agreement, but I would assume that if\nArkansas would have sued the defendant for the\nremainder, that there would have been an\nindemnification clause in the settlement agreement,\nwhich means that the money would have ended up coming\nright out of Ms. Ahlborn's pocket in any event.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have no idea about\nthat. I'm interested in this nest of statutes, and the\nquestion I think that I would have is why doesn't the\nstatute propose the route for a State in your -- in\nyour position that I just said. If they have a good\nfaith settlement and they think that $10,000 of this\ngood faith settlement is attributable to the medical\nexpense and you are out $40,000 -- $50,000, you can sue\nthe other party. And if you're in the case, you just\nproceed with the suit.\nMS. FRENO: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They can't settle your claim\nout from under you.\nMS. FRENO: That is exactly what happened.\nThey did settle the claim out from under the\ndepartment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we're asking how that\ncan be.\nMS. FRENO: We don't -- well, we don't know\nhow that can be. We don't know why the -- we do not\nknow why the State court dismissed the action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're asking you as a\nmatter of Arkansas law.\nMS. FRENO: As a matter of Arkansas law, a\nclaim should not be dismissed until all parties are --\nthe rights of all parties are determined.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why didn't Arkansas --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I wonder if you have a\nclaim for incompetent counsel representing you.\nMS. FRENO: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm wondering you -- if you\nhave a claim against counsel for being incompetent in\nletting a settlement be made without notice to the --\nto you. It seems to me hard to -- hard to understand\nhow this could happen.\nMS. FRENO: Well, if -- in fact, there is an\nArkansas statute that if monies that belong to the\ndepartment are distributed in a -- in a manner that is\ninconsistent, you know, with the interests of the\ndepartment, that it can pursue either the Medicaid\nrecipient, her guardian, her attorney, or anyone else\nfor that money.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't we just send\nyou back to do that?\nMS. FRENO: Because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, why are we going\nthrough this -- this proceeding here?\nMS. FRENO: The reason we're going through\nthe proceeding here, Your Honor, is because the issue\nof the anti-lien provision was raised. That was not\nraised in State court. It was brought in Federal court\nas a part of the declaratory judgment action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I realize that.\nBut at -- at the end of the day, you want your money,\nand -- and I don't see why you can't get your money\nsimply by going back into the State court. Maybe --\nmaybe lapse of time bars you at this point. But\npresumably you could have avoided all of this by simply\nsaying, we didn't agree to the settlement. We're still\nhere. We want our -- the -- the remainder of our\nmoney.\nMS. FRENO: Your Honor, we could have\nproceeded in State court if we wished. The State, of\ncourse, has limited resources, and we learned that the\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, wouldn't it have been\neasier to do that than come to the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States?\nMS. FRENO: We never expected to get,\nfrankly, to the Supreme Court of the United States.\nBut we did understand that we would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were the\nPetitioner.\nMS. FRENO: -- before the Federal district --\nI'm sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were -- you were\nthe Petitioner.\nMS. FRENO: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you're\nfiling a petition, you have to have some expectation\nthat you might end up here.\nMS. FRENO: Oh, I thought you meant at the\ntime that the State court case was dismissed. I'm\nsorry. I misunderstood the question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to go back to the\nFederal statutes and the State statute.\nMS. FRENO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't this discussion\njust suggest what the answer is to the legal question\nraised? The answer is, of course, you cannot get a\nhold of this money in the hands of the victim. The\nmoney in the hands of the accident victim is not your\nmoney. It is not medical expense money. It was\nstipulated that it is not. That doesn't leave you\nwithout a remedy. The remedy is to go against the\ncauser of the accident and get the extra money that you\nthink is entitled to you. The statutes say that\nliterally, and why not just follow them?\nMS. FRENO: Your Honor, the third party\nliability provisions of Federal Medicaid law is what\ngoverns this case, and those statutes require that the\nStates seek -- seek reimbursement from liable third\nparties for medical costs for the full amount of that\nliability.\nNow, as a -- a condition of Ms. Ahlborn's\neligibility -- or as a condition of eligibility for\nMedicaid, Ms. Ahlborn had to assign to the State her\nright to payment for medical costs -- her right to\npayment for medical costs. Consequently, when she\nassigned that right to the State, it was synonymous\nwith what the State itself had to do, which was seek\nfull reimbursement from liable third parties to the\nextent of the third parties' legal liability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But could she -- after that\nassignment, could she bring a suit in her own right to\ndo that, to recover the medical costs?\nMS. FRENO: Yes, she could, Your Honor, and\nin fact, that is what the majority --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though she's assigned\nthe cause of action to the State?\nMS. FRENO: Yes, Your Honor. And that is\nwhat the majority of the Medicaid recipients in our\nState choose to do. They prefer to pursue the action\non their own and in the end just reimburse the Medicaid\nprogram.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it dismissed on\nthe basis that they -- they don't have a cause of\naction because they've assigned it?\nMS. FRENO: Well, they -- she is basically --\na recipient is pursuing the cause of action with the --\nthe approval of the State. And also, in the third\nparty liability provisions, it's important to recognize\nthat they provide -- they include a duty of cooperation\nthat the recipient has to cooperate with the State in\nseeking full Medicaid reimbursement. So the third --\nthe Federal third party liability provisions basically\nconsider the recipient and the State to be a team, a\nteam that is out to get full reimbursement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're -- you're talking\nwithout reference to the statute, and as I read the\nstatute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments\nmade by a third party for health care items or\nservices. So she has to turn over from her recovery\nwhat she got for health care, but we know that her tort\nclaim consisted of a lot more. So if the Federal\nstatute says she has to turn over what she received\nfrom the third party for health care services, well,\nshe did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair\nallocation. So I don't see how you get from her the --\na much larger share than what she got for health care.\nMS. FRENO: Your Honor, what the statute\nrequires -- this is in the Petitioners' brief on pages\n2 and 3 -- at 42 U.S.C. 1396k(a)(1)(A), which is the\nsection that talks about the scope of the assignment,\nshe has to assign her rights to payment for medical\ncare, not payments that she actually receives for\nmedical care.\nAnd what are her rights to payment for\nmedical care? If we would take this out of the\nMedicaid context and put it in a standard tort context,\nsomeone who's injured by a third party has a right to\nreceive all the money that she is out due to the fact\nthat she was injured by the third party.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't her response to\nthat argument, look, I've -- I've assigned you my\nrights? There's no question about that. I'm also\nwilling to give you whatever the amount is that they\nallocated. If -- if you want the difference, you've\ngot the assignment. Go ahead and sue for it.\nMS. FRENO: There is nothing, though, in the\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that would be\nconsistent with the -- with the statute. Wouldn't it?\nMS. FRENO: The third party liability\nprovisions do not require the State to ever seek\nreimbursement through the direct --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, but I -- I'm not\nsaying that it -- it does. The State can do nothing if\nit wants to. But the statute that you just quoted\nrequires her to assign to the State her right to\nrecover for -- for her medical expenses. She says, I\nhave done that. In fact, I've done that as a matter of\nlaw, under Arkansas law. You've got your assignment.\nNumber two, I'm giving you the portion of the\nrecovery that I got with respect to medical payments.\nYou can have it.\nNow, there's a difference between what you\npaid and what I got attributable to medical payments,\nan amount, by the way, which you stipulated was\ncorrect. So if you want the difference, sue for it.\nGo ahead. It's fine with me. Why isn't that the\nanswer?\nMS. FRENO: Ms. -- first of all, with regard\nto the stipulation, Your Honor, the parties have always\nagreed that Medicaid paid over $214,000 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMS. FRENO: -- for Ms. Ahlborn's damages.\nThe State is in no way trying to take anything from the\nthird party settlement proceeds that represents -- that\nrepresents payment for anything other than what is\nnecessary to reimburse the State for that amount of\nmoney.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- you're basing\nyour argument on this statute.\nMS. FRENO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And let me come back to my\nquestion. This statute simply says that she will\nassign her rights to recover for the medicals. She has\ndone that. She has also given you the portion of the\nsettlement which she and you agree is attributable to\nthe medicals. Why isn't the statute satisfied if she\nsimply says, you've got your assignment? If you want\nthe difference between what I've given you and your\nout-of-pocket expense, sue. You have the assignment.\nYou have the right. Go ahead and sue for it.\nMS. FRENO: Because she assigned, Your Honor,\nher right to recover -- or her right for payments from\nthird parties, she no longer has the right to\ncompromise the State's claim. Ms. -- the Respondent\ndoes not have --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it seems to me that\nthat is an entirely different argument. The question\nis what does the statute require her to do and entitle\nyou to do. And I don't see why, under the statute, the\nstatute is not satisfied if you simply sue for the\ndifference under -- under your assignment of her\nrights.\nMS. FRENO: There's -- under the statute, her\nassignment -- she has a duty of cooperation, first of\nall, to cooperate with the State in receiving these\nrecoveries. The assignment allows her to bring a\nlawsuit. It does not require her to bring a lawsuit.\nPrimarily the obligation is on the State to sue --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't the assignment allow\nyou to bring a lawsuit?\nMS. FRENO: Yes, the assignment allows --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you bring it?\nI mean, the answer to the -- to the statutory point,\nit seems to me, is you've got your assignment. If\nyou're not whole yet, sue.\nMS. FRENO: But she -- she opted to bring the\n-- she opted to bring the lawsuit on her own. And the\npoint I was making earlier --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So what? You can sue too.\nMS. FRENO: We could sue, but the State has\nlimited resources. Every penny --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- let me ask you\nthis question so far as the rights of the assignee and\nthe assignor. Suppose it's a very weak case and the\nlitigant says I want to settle for 20 cents on the\ndollar. Are you saying that there's some kind of duty\nto notify the State and -- and to consult with the\nState before this is done?\nMS. FRENO: Yes, Your Honor, and that is\nencompassed within State law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Suppose the -- the\nState says, well, we -- we don't -- we don't agree with\nyou. Then -- then what happens? Then they're at\nloggerheads and you go to Justice Souter's position I\nsuppose.\nMS. FRENO: In that situation, then the --\nthe case would just have to go forward to litigation.\nAnd yes, the State, if it wished to pursue --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would it -- if --\nsuppose in the instance I put they -- the -- the State\nhas -- has an objection, but the settlement is made,\nnonetheless, for 20 cents on the dollar. Do you still\nthink you have the right to receive 100 percent of your\npayment from the proceeds in the case that I put?\nMS. FRENO: Would you repeat that? I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that it's a very\nweak case. They settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Do\nyou have the right, as you understand the law, to\ninsist that you receive 100 percent of your payments\nfrom the gross settlement?\nMS. FRENO: The -- the Medicaid recipient can\nnever compromise the claim of the State.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The answer is yes, I take\nit.\nMS. FRENO: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The answer is yes, I take\nit. In the case I put, the answer is you would think\nthat you're entitled to 100 percent of your payments.\nSo that eats into her general damages.\nMS. FRENO: Well, she -- in that situation,\nYour Honor, she can -- she can compromise her own\nclaim. She cannot compromise the State's. If she\nwants --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you're\n-- you're entitled to 100 percent under Arkansas law,\nbut -- and I take it, that would be without regard to\nwhat the Federal law required. The Arkansas law can go\nbeyond -- just looking at the assignment provision,\nbeyond what the Federal law requires you do as a\ncondition of participation in Medicaid. Correct?\nMS. FRENO: No. State law cannot go, Your\nHonor, beyond Federal law, and Federal law allows the\nState to receive full reimbursement to the extent of\nthe third party's liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we disagree\nwith you on that -- in other words, you're saying we\ndon't even have to reach the anti-lien provision\nquestion. If we think the Medicaid condition only goes\nto the extent payments for medical care, then you would\nlose without regard to the anti-lien provision?\nMS. FRENO: I'm sorry. Would you repeat\nthat?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Arkansas law, as you\nunderstand it --\nMS. FRENO: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- requires a -- a\nfull -- full assignment of any expenses the State -- or\nfull recovery of any expenses the State has incurred.\nIt's not -- it's a debate whether Medicaid law requires\nthat. And what you're saying is if we think the\nMedicaid law does not require it, you would lose\nwithout regard to any consideration of the anti-lien\nprovision?\nMS. FRENO: If Medicaid -- Medicaid law does\nrequire full reimbursement. But if this Court\ndetermined that Medicaid law did not require full\nreimbursement from -- to the extent of a third party's\nliability, well, then there would not be an anti-lien\n-- there would not be an anti-lien provision question.\nBut Federal law does require the State to seek full\nreimbursement to the extent of the third party's\nliability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's one of\nthe issues, and I'm trying to understand. The\nRespondent's position is that the Arkansas law goes\nbeyond what the Medicaid assignment provisions require.\nAnd I want your position on whether or not, if that's\nright, again without regard to the anti-lien provision,\nthat you would lose. It seems to me that you can --\nArkansas can go beyond what the Medicaid law requires\nfor reimbursement, if it wants.\nMS. FRENO: No, that is not true, Your Honor.\nArkansas law must stay within the scope of the Federal\nlaw. Arkansas law cannot require a recipient to assign\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So if we read\nthe Medicaid statute to require something less than\nwhat your position is here, then you lose.\nMS. FRENO: That would be correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. That's without\nregard to the anti-lien provision, or is it because of\nthe anti-lien provision?\nMS. FRENO: It would be because of the anti-\nlien provision. But because she assigned her right to payment\nfor medical care, that -- the anti-lien provision\ndoesn't operate with regard to that amount of money\nthat is recovered from a third party in a -- in a third\nparty settlement.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. FRENO: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nExcuse me. The problem in this case -- and\nit's a common one -- is when private parties,\nbeneficiaries, sue first and run the well dry.\nThere's no question in this case that the\nsettlement includes the payment for medical care that\nshe was entitled to and the one she assigned to the\nState. That is not in dispute. The question is the\namount, and the amount is very much in dispute. The --\nthe position of the beneficiary is that the amount that\nis medical payment is the amount that we unilaterally\ndecide is the share of medical payments in the\nsettlement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What should have happened?\nIf, suppose that Ms. Ahlborn had cooperated. Would there\nhave to be an agreement among all of the parties as to\nthe breakdown of the -- of the settlement?\nMS. MILLETT: No. There are two options.\nOne would, of course, be to have an agreement on\nresolution of the medical claim, which would require\nnotice and involvement of the State. The State could\nact here.\nThe other option is if they're at\nloggerheads, for it to be clear up front amongst all\nthe parties that the -- the settlement isn't resolving\nall the third party liability. It -- the -- the\nquestion of liability for medical care, or at least the\nState's claim for medical care -- sometimes they have\ntheir own -- is still open, and there has to be enough\nmoney left in the well. There were two insurance\npolicies here that were paid at their caps.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, why does\nthere have to be enough money in the -- take -- take\nthe -- the case that we -- we put to your co-counsel.\nSuppose it's a settlement for 20 cents on the dollar.\nDoes the -- does the State have an absolute right to\nget reimbursement for 100 percent by invading the\ngeneral damages portion of the settlement?\nMS. MILLETT: No. The State has -- and the\nMedicaid statute is quite clear. They have an\nentitlement to payments for medical care, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but in my -- can you\nanswer the -- the question? You have the problem.\nThey settle for 20 cents on the dollar. Does the State\nin that case have the absolute right to a lien or a\nclaim or to a demand for the -- for the proceeds in --\nfor the balance of the 80 -- for the 80 percent balance\nof the medical costs?\nMS. MILLETT: No, not straight out, but what\nthey -- they have the right to make their own decision\nand compromise their own claim. The beneficiary may\nthink it's 20 cents on the dollar. The State may think\n-- the State can consider two things and two things\nonly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is -- that is as\nbetween the State and the third party tortfeasor, not\nbetween the State and -- and the Medicare recipient, I\nshould think.\nMS. MILLETT: Not when -- not -- not when the\nsettlement, as here, involves the complete claim.\nThere's never been a claim by the beneficiaries here\nthat there's something left under State law to do or\nsomething left in the well to go get on the part of the\nState.\nBut let -- if I -- I think it's important to\nunderstand why these suits against the -- or a State\ncould decide -- and the anti-lien decision does not\ncompel the State to decide otherwise. A State, with\nits discretion under Medicaid, could decide that\npursuing third parties is not viable. This is not an\nordinary assignment. This is an assignment with strong\nduties of cooperation required on the part of the\nbeneficiary.\nNow, what does the lawsuit look like when the\nState goes, after the settlement, against the third\nparty tortfeasor here? The State has no control of\nevidence. It has a pile of bills, none of the relevant\nevidence.\nAt the point of this lawsuit, the\nbeneficiary's interests are adverse to the State's.\nThey're not in a cooperative mode. They're interested\nin --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the State -- the State\ncould sue in the first instance. In fact, if you just\nread the text of the statute, it seems like the State\nis the one envisioned to be suing for reimbursement of\nthe medical expenses.\nMS. MILLETT: Two answers, Justice Ginsburg.\nFirst, a lot of times, the plaintiffs have\nalready started these lawsuits of these claims long\nbefore -- when the State has just started getting up\nthe process of paying the medical bills. And car\naccidents and stuff can get taken care of pretty\nquickly.\nAnd the -- the second point is, is that the\nState -- the State may -- needs the help of the\nbeneficiary to bring this suit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the State was in this\ncase. The State intervened. So it was party to the\ncase.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And when it -- it found\nout about the dismissal, why didn't it go right into\nthe Arkansas court and say, you forgot about us? We\nwere a party to this lawsuit.\nMS. MILLETT: They -- they could have, and\nthey'd be -- they'd be fighting the same anti-lien\nissue there that they ended up fighting in Federal\ncourt.\nBut there's one other thing too. Keep in\nmind these third party liability provisions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would they be fighting\nthe same anti-lien provision? They would be --\nwouldn't they be saying we have a claim for all of the\nmedical expenses? And no other party -- the injury\nvictim didn't have authority from us to compromise our\nclaim. It's for us to compromise it.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. They would say\nthat, and -- and the -- and where -- where the parties\ncame at loggerheads here was -- their position is\nmedical claim is in here. It's in this pot. That's\nnot in dispute. It's in here. How much do you get?\nDo you get the amount that we unilaterally designate,\nor can the State have a default rule that says when you\ncut us out and we no longer have a means of litigating\nin cooperation with you to make a reasoned judgment as\nto what the fair medical payment is in this settlement,\ncan we insist upon 100 percent?\nOtherwise, there's two things happening. The\n-- the beneficiary should not be better off for having\ncut the State out of the process, but that's what's\ngoing to happen.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, if your rule\nis just one that you have to pay the 100 percent if\nthere's non-cooperation and a non-notice, that's one\nthing. But the briefs, it seems to me, indicate that\nyou have an absolute right to 100 percent. And those\nare two very different propositions.\nMS. MILLETT: Our position is the 100 percent\nclaim -- the default -- as a default rule, when the\nState has been cut out and cannot make the reasoned\njudgment that the Medicaid statute charges the State\nwith making on these claims, that's a 100 percent rule.\nQuite -- our position, quite\nstraightforwardly, is if the State was involved or if\nthere was a jury finding of 50/50, you know,\ncomparative negligence, then the Medicaid claim gets\ncut in half because it -- the -- the State can consider\ntwo things, extent of liability and cost --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I know in the case of\na jury. But our question is what happens if there's a\nsettlement.\nMS. MILLETT: It's -- no. And -- and if\nthere's a settlement in which the State is not involved\nbut the medical bill is compromised -- so it's not out\nthere to be recovered -- the medical bill --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this clarifying\nquestion? If it's 50/50 because of a jury verdict of\ncomparative negligence, then you only get half the\nmoney. If it's 50/50 because of a settlement,\nbelieving they only have a 50 percent chance of\nrecovery, what -- what is your answer?\nMS. MILLETT: It depends on whether the State\nwas involved in making that judgment. If the State was\ncut out of making that judgment, the State can choose\nto have a default rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State was\ninvolved but disagreed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying the State\nshould sue here.\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying here the\nState should therefore sue, if I understand you.\nMS. MILLETT: No. The State -- the State\nshould be entitled to a 100 percent rule because -- for\ntwo reasons. One, there is no way post hoc -- or no --\na State can decide there's no reliable way post hoc to\nfigure out how much of this truly was a payment for\nmedical care. I mean, stop and think. Medical --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But here it's stipulated I\nthought.\nMS. MILLETT: No, no. What was stipulated --\nand I think you have to read the stipulation very\ncarefully. There is no stipulation in there that the\nState agrees that $35,000 is an accurate assessment of\nmedical liability. The stipulation says --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. It's a compromise.\nJust as my other example of a 50/50 chance of winning\nthe lawsuit, you compromise for 50 percent. I don't\nsee the difference.\nMS. MILLETT: No. The -- the difference is\nit's who makes the compromise decision. And the\nstipulation is -- from the beneficiary's view, they\nobviously made a compromise decision. They did an\nacross-the-board sort of mathematical reduction of this\nclaim, and they didn't sort of stop and think about\nwhat's more easily proven, medical claims or pain and\nsuffering. What's more easily documented. They didn't\ndo -- it's just a mathematical reduction.\nThe State never said that's accurate. The\nState said, if you win, your statutory construction\nargument, which is the amount that you unilaterally\ndesignate as medical care, is what we're stuck with.\nAnd if we try to take more, it violates the anti-lien\nprovision. That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State --\nsuppose the State is involved in the negotiations and\nthey disagree. The -- the parties in good faith say,\nwe've got to settle this for 20 percent. The State\nsaid, oh, your case is much better than that. Please\ndon't settle. Then what?\nMS. MILLETT: That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It has notice. It's\ninvolved, et cetera, et cetera.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. Then at that point,\nwhat should happen is there can be a -- the -- the\nbeneficiary can go ahead and resolve her other claims.\nBut everybody has to be on notice. Those third\nparties, in particular, have to be on notice that this\nis not the end of the game. You still -- this does not\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. --\nMS. MILLETT: -- cover medical payments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Millett, you've been\ntrying to tell us the difficulties that the State would\nhave in bringing suit later.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are they? I see your\nwhite light is on.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to hear what they\nare.\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the first one,\nobviously, -- there's three.\nThe first one is evidence control. The State\nhas a pile of bills but no evidence about liability.\nNow, beforehand, if they're involved, their -- their\ninterests and the beneficiary's are aligned to maximize\nrecovery. After the fact, the State is going to go in,\neither at a post hoc hearing with the beneficiary or\ntry to sue some third party, and the beneficiary is\ngoing to say, oh, I fell asleep at the wheel, I was on\nmy cell phone, I had preexisting conditions, because\nher incentive is now to reduce your recovery. This is\nthe exact opposite of the duty of cooperation that\nFederal and State law envisioned for this process.\nThe second --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it her incentive to\nreduce recovery? She may not be getting anything more,\nbut why does she have incentive to reduce it?\nMS. MILLETT: Because at this -- if -- if\nwe're in a post hoc hearing to sort of allocate the\nsettlement, she wants to keep -- have as much of it put\ninto the pain and suffering and lost wages pile and as\nlittle in the medical liability pile because she\ndoesn't go home with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I thought she and the\n--\nMS. MILLETT: And then if -- I'm sorry.\nThere's two -- there's two different post-hearings you\ncould have.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, yes.\nMS. MILLETT: One would be a fight with her.\nThe other one would be they go in to sue the\ndefendants. Now, at this point, she's not necessarily\nadverse, but she has no interest to help.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. Insofar as the suit\nagainst the defendant is concerned, she's not -- she\ndoes not have an interest in minimizing.\nMS. MILLETT: But she may if there's an\nindemnity agreement, which means if they have to pay to\nus, they will -- I'm sorry. Can I finish? That if --\nif the defendants have to pay more to us, then they\nwill get to go after her. And that's the concern.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nMillett.\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Blair.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. DAVID BLAIR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BLAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe problem here, of course, is one where the\nfunds, the proceeds, to resolve a claim are less than\nthe damages of all parties, including the medical bills\nthat have been paid by the State.\nNow, the Court is correct that not only under\nthe Federal statute did the State have the option of\npursuing an independent cause of action, there is a\nState statute that provides that very thing, our code\n20-77-301. And in fact, that statute, in effect,\nallows a splitting of the common law cause of action\nfor personal injury, which otherwise would be\nprohibited. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what incentive does\nshe have to cooperate in that later action? And isn't\nit the fact that she would have a disincentive to\ncooperate if she's going to have to reimburse the\ninsurance companies for any additional compensation\nthat they pay?\nMR. BLAIR: She would not have a disincentive\nto cooperate. She might not have an incentive to\ncooperate because they're bringing their own lawsuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- but -- but don't\nsome of the insurance policies require that if the\ninsurance company, which has settled the first claim,\nends up paying -- paying additional money, that that --\nthat that amount of money would be the -- the\nresponsibility of the -- of the claimant?\nMR. BLAIR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that's a disincentive on\nher part. She doesn't want the insurance company to\nlose any more money.\nMR. BLAIR: That -- that is correct. Had the\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me that\nthat's a very strange system for the Federal Government\nto set up and to -- to -- I mean, to -- to subsidize --\nto reward the failure of the -- of the Medicaid benefit\n-- beneficiary to cooperate. There's a statutory\nresponsibility for her to cooperate, isn't there?\nMR. BLAIR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And she didn't do that here\nbecause she just went ahead and settled without --\nwithout giving the State notice.\nMR. BLAIR: I disagree, Your Honor. I do not\nthink that the duty to cooperate necessarily included\nthe duty to include the State in the loop in the\nsettlement process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Really.\nMR. BLAIR: That is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the State is a party\nto the proceeding, and she goes ahead and gets the\nproceeding dismissed without even telling the State,\nand that -- that isn't included in the -- the\nresponsibility to cooperate?\nMR. BLAIR: The dismissal, of course,\nfollowed the settlement. What the complaint is, is\nthat they were not consulted about the settlement\nprocess.\nAnd it would have been of no benefit had they\nbeen consulted about the settlement process. The\ndefendants were only going to pay a certain amount of\nmoney. Had the State shown up at the settlement\nhearing if -- or the conference, if there was such a\nthing, no doubt it would have taken the position that\nit takes here, that it's entitled to be paid in full.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I suppose if the\ninsurance company heard from the State that the State\ncontinued to -- would continue to pursue its claim, in\nthe absence either of a more generous assignment or a\nmore generous settlement, there might not have been a\nsettlement.\nMR. BLAIR: That's correct, Your Honor. Had\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, so why -- why then is\nit unreasonable for the State to take this position,\nthe one that the government took? They said, of\ncourse, we, the governments of State and Federal have\nonly the right to attach the portion of that settlement\nthat is representative of the medical expenditure. And\nwhere we're in on the deal, you'll all agree what that\nportion is, or there won't be a settlement and we'll\nproceed to trial. But where we're cut out of the deal\n-- and we shouldn't be because there's a duty to\ncooperate -- we will assume in that instance that it --\nevery penny of that medical expense is included in the\namount that was settled for. And they say, given the\nstatutes, that's a reasonable way of enforcing their\nFederal obligation to recover the money.\nNow, whether we agree or disagree with it as\na matter of policy, what is wrong with their saying as\na matter of law, we choose to interpret the words this\nway and implement the statute that way and we have\nevery right to do it? Why don't they?\nMR. BLAIR: Well, first of all, the -- the\nremedy that the Petitioner here proposes is one that\nCongress has not proposed, for openers. And secondly,\nthe Petitioner acknowledges at page 33 of their brief\nthat they had no veto power over the settlement. The\nsettlement was a matter for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's all consistent,\nof course, with their position. They say Congress\ndelegated to us the authority to interpret the words\nthis way. It is a reasonable interpretation of the\nwords. We don't deny that you can settle for what you\nwant. All we're saying is, where we're cut out, that\nthat pile of money is deemed by us to include every\npenny of medical expense, and therefore we get it\nbecause we're not taking money that isn't medical\nexpense. We are taking money that does represent\nmedical expense according to our deeming rules.\nMR. BLAIR: Correct. According to their\nversion, they're taking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's legally wrong\nwith that?\nMR. BLAIR: Because they're -- they're taking\nmoney beyond the claim for medical expense, Your Honor,\nbecause the claim for medical expense is not measured\nby the amount of the medical expenses in terms of its\nvalue. It is measured by the various factors that\naffect the value of a claim, of which the payout is\nonly one of the factors. Had they appeared at the\nsettlement proceeding, had we had --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did they have\nnotice of the settlement proceeding?\nMR. BLAIR: No, Your Honor. The -- it was\nactually not a proceeding, and I'd have to go outside\nof the record to say this, but if the case was settled,\nas most cases are, by exchange of telephone calls and\nwhether --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were -- and they\nwere intervened in this lawsuit. Weren't they entitled\nto have notice that there was a settlement and that the\ncase was going to be dismissed?\nMR. BLAIR: I do not -- strictly speaking,\nno, they were not entitled to notice because the -- the\nintervention, it was secondary to the plaintiff's claim.\nThat is, they did not intervene and assert the\nindependent cause of action that the statute gave them.\nThey intervened and claimed a lien upon the\nsettlement's recovery. So since their lien, whatever\namount that lien is, was derivative of the plaintiff's\nclaim, I do not agree that they had to be notified of\nthe -- that the case had been settled and an order of\ndismissal was entered.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose, though, that were\nthe rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The plaintiff had -- had\nno obligation to notify the State? There was some\nmention of a -- of a obligation to cooperate. Is there\nany statutory obligation under -- I don't see it in the\nMedicaid statute, but under Arkansas law for -- for the\nMedicaid recipient to cooperate with the State?\nMR. BLAIR: Yes, there -- there is -- there\nis a general provision in Arkansas law that -- that the\nMedicaid recipients assign their claim to notify the\nState of any potential liable parties, the date of the\noccurrence, the kind of injury they sustained, the\ninformation that would enable the State to pursue its\nclaim should it decide to do so. And in this instance,\nthe State decided to do it by asserting a lien upon the\n-- the common law action asserted in the State court.\nNow, if the -- if the State had brought an\nindependent action and asserted its -- its right to\nrecover, rather than riding in the wake of the\nplaintiffs, then the State would have been in control\nof that claim and been in control of settlements and\nwhether it was dismissed or not, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The complaint -- the -- the\nintervention by the State claimed only a lien? Is that\nwhat the --\nMR. BLAIR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- document claimed?\nIntervention --\nMR. BLAIR: The -- actually -- actually there\nwas never a formal complaint and intervention filed.\nThere was a motion for leave to intervene. It was\nnever followed up on. Again, I'm getting outside the\nrecord when I say that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Roughly speaking -- I -- I'm\n-- there may be a few dollars and cents that -- that\naren't accounted for here. But roughly speaking, is it\nfair to say that the amount that -- that you and --\nand, for that matter, the State attribute to the\nmedicals out of the total settlement is the same\nproportion that the claim for medicals bore to the\ntotal original claim?\nMR. BLAIR: It -- it is the same percentage\nthat the total medicals bore to what we agreed was a\nfair valuation of the claim or what we agreed there\nwould be evidence to support.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. BLAIR: In other words, the State --\nafter this dispute broke out, the Respondent and the\nPetitioner reached an agreement as to the probable\nvalue of the claim, absent any considerations of\nliability or financial responsibility. And, of course,\nthe amount of the medical expenses was a liquidated\nsum, and that made it real easy to result in a\nfraction. And the $35,000 is that fraction times the\nState's payout.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but the -- the other\nthing that you're -- you're dividing that against is\nnot liquidated.\nMR. BLAIR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And nobody -- I mean, the --\nwhere there's room for -- for compromise is certainly\nin the pain and suffering part of a settlement, not in\nthe medicals. I mean, the medicals are a given in any\nsettlement I've ever heard of. There it is, black on\nwhite. This is how much was paid.\nMR. BLAIR: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the compromise.\nUnless there's a -- you know, a compromise on whether\nthere's liability or not, but -- but whether, if there\nis liability, this amount is owing, that's -- that's a\ngiven for the medicals. Isn't it?\nMR. BLAIR: Your Honor has put his finger\nexactly upon the problem in this case, and that is that\nthere was a tremendous question of liability. And as a\nmatter of fact, this was a high nuisance value\nsettlement, as lawyers refer to it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In a case like this,\nthen it would be in the interest of someone like your\nclient to make a claim not of $3 million but of $6\nmillion. Then if you settle for exactly the same\namount of money you settled for here, the percentage of\nthe medicals -- the amount attributed to medicals would\nbe exactly one-half of what it is here.\nMR. BLAIR: The claim was -- the $3 million\nclaim was not the amount claimed in the original\nlawsuit, which never got to the point of a claim being\nmade. It was for damages in excess of diversity\nlimits, the -- for diversity of citizenship limits.\nThere was not a $10 million lawsuit or a $20 million\nlawsuit or an $8 million lawsuit. The $3 million\nfigure --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in the original State\nlawsuit, did you have to state an addendum?\nMR. BLAIR: No. Only -- the only requirement\nis that there be an allegation that it's in excess of\ndiversity -- the diversity amount.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where did -- then -- then\ntell me again where we got the $3 million figure.\nMR. BLAIR: By negotiation with the\nRespondents, Your Honor, by -- by looking at the -- the\ndamages, the physical damages, the loss of earnings,\nimpairment of earning capacity, all of those things.\nAnd -- and however it's phrased, we essentially agreed\nthat that was a fair value, and if their claim is\nlimited to the medical expense component, they're\nentitled to $35,000.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And is -- is that in -- is\nthat in writing, along with the allocation --\nMR. BLAIR: Only to the extent that it is\nrepresented by the terms of the stipulation entered\nbefore the district court, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, is that part\nof the stipulation?\nMR. BLAIR: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. BLAIR: The -- the numbers are in the\nstipulation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a contention that\nthe medical was under-valued in the settlement or -- I\nthought it was understood that it was the same\nproportion of the settlement. I mean, if you\ndiscounted everything by 50 percent, medical was\ndiscounted by the same percentage as everything else.\nIs that correct?\nMR. BLAIR: That's -- that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because there's some -- I\n-- I wasn't clear on whether the State had stipulated\nthat this is what you agreed with the other side or\nthat this is a fair calculation of the settlement.\nMR. BLAIR: There was no agreement with the\nRespondent and the tortfeasor about allocation\nwhatsoever. The idea that we unilaterally came up with\na number is -- is not correct. It was a lump sum\namount, and when the State -- the Petitioner and\nRespondents couldn't reach an agreement, ultimately, in\norder to obviate the necessity for putting on evidence\nof damages before the district court, so the court\nwould have a factual basis to make this allocation, we\nentered into a stipulation. And that's where we got to\nthe number that we got to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think under Arkansas\nlaw that the injured party as an assignor has a duty to\ncooperate with the assignee in pursuing the claim?\nMR. BLAIR: Has a duty to cooperate with the\nassignee to the extent that it does not impair the\nassignor's interest, that is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that duty fulfilled by\n-- by entering settlement negotiations and not even\nnotifying the assignee?\nMR. BLAIR: In -- in this particular\ninstance, I think it was fulfilled because settlement\nnegotiations resulted in $550,000 that the Petitioners,\nin all likelihood, would have never received --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but what you're\nsaying is that there's no duty to notify the assignee\nif you think you might get a pretty good result for\nyourself. I don't understand that as much of -- much\nof a duty.\nMR. BLAIR: I think the duty to -- to notify\nthe assignee would be true insofar as proceeding\nagainst the third party is concerned. And to the\nextent that the notification to the assignee would\nserve any purpose in maximizing the total recovery,\nthere probably is a duty, but notice to the assignee\nhere would have been absolutely of no value insofar as\nthe common interests against the defendants were\nconcerned.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it certainly would\nhave avoided about 20 minutes of questions in this\nCourt.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BLAIR: In retrospect, Your Honor, they\nwould have been plastered with notices.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just given your experience\n-- say, think of the generality of cases like this one\n-- would it be difficult for you, representing the\nvictims, if the rule were that these statutes give the\nGovernment the authority that they want here, as I\nunderstand it -- the Federal Government -- which is to\nsay you have an obligation to notify the State of the\npresence of settlement negotiations. Now, once you've\ndone that, you've given them an opportunity to\nparticipate. If they have that opportunity, thereafter\nthey cannot attach more than what are the real medical\nexpenses, which could be a matter for argument in a\nsettlement like this. But if you don't give them that\nopportunity, they have the right to presume that that\nsettlement, which they knew nothing about, contains the\nfull amount.\nMR. BLAIR: As a practical matter, yes, it\nwould -- it would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because? What are the\npracticalities of that? Why would it hurt the lawyers\nrepresenting victims?\nMR. BLAIR: It -- it would be a logistical\nproblem, Your Honor, of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would just require a\nletter, certified.\nMR. BLAIR: But -- but the certified letter\nsaying that I'm going to stipulate with -- I'm going to\nenter into settlement negotiations with XYZ\ncorporation, would not really have served any purpose\nunless they were to be included in every step of the\nway, because these settlement negotiations sometimes\nextend over months and years and -- and some of them\nseem like they go forever. And to have the -- the\nState at the injured plaintiff's side throughout all of\nthat step would be a logistical problem.\nAnd -- and in any event, it -- the plaintiff\nis in control of the litigation. The State has no\nright to say, you go to trial or you don't go to trial.\nWe don't agree that you're getting enough. If -- if\nyou go -- if you settle at this figure, we're going to\nbe cut short.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't -- wouldn't the\ninsurance company have to worry about the same problem?\nThat is to say, even if it's not your problem by\nreason of our coming out the way you would like us to,\nwouldn't it remain a problem for the insurance company\nso they could not enter into any settlement until they\nknew that the State would go along with -- with the\ndivision between medicals and -- and other damages?\nThat -- that's what I don't understand. Doesn't it\nbecome a problem for the insurance company to somehow\nbring in the State in the process of the settlement?\nMR. BLAIR: The -- the insurance company\npotentially would have double liability under Arkansas\nlaw if -- if the claim is settled and they know the\nsubrogation claim and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BLAIR: -- and if it's -- but that's this\nunnamed defendant's particular problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but once -- once the\n-- once the -- the foolish insurance company figures\nout that that is what is going to happen, future\nsettlements will be very difficult I would gather.\nMR. BLAIR: I -- I cannot comment on that,\nYour Honor, since that has not been the -- the case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it's -- it's\nrelevant. And I'm trying to think through the\npracticalities of it, which you're more familiar with.\nSuppose that you win this. If you win this, then the\ndefendant's insurance companies know that they're\nsubject to further liability for the medicals in every\ncase. And why won't they sit there and tell you at\nthis settlement, hey, we're not going to enter into\nthis unless you get the State involved so they sign off\non it too? We're not going to just compromise some of\nour liability.\nMR. BLAIR: That -- that may be the result,\nYour Honor. I -- I cannot foresee all of the\nramifications either if we prevail or don't prevail.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it sounds as if\nwe're going to get to the same place, that if -- if you\nprevail, probably the insurance companies will want the\nState to be involved or they haven't limited their\nliability, and if you lose, then we would have said\nthat you have to get the -- the State involved.\nMR. BLAIR: Right. And -- and perhaps if we\nprevail and the State elects to pursue its own remedy\non its own, we'll have another round of litigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And your argument is if it\nis six in one, half -- half a dozen in the other, we\nshould do it your way because that's what the text of\nthe statute says.\nMR. BLAIR: We ultimately rely upon the text\nof the statute, Your Honor, irrespective of all of the\npolicy or the political arguments that have been made\nto the Court. We believe and have maintained\nthroughout that the text of the statute requires --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: With respect to the text of\nthe statute and whether the anti-lien provision\napplies, I'd be interested in your view, as a matter of\nArkansas law, as to who owned the chose in action first\nand, secondly, who owned the proceeds of the settlement\nrecovery after the assignment had taken place.\nMR. BLAIR: First, I think there's no\nquestion that Heidi Ahlborn owned the chose in action\nbecause under Arkansas law her claim was complete by\nthe time the glass and the metal stopped falling to the\nhighway.\nSecondly, as to the who owned the proceeds\ndepends upon the extent to which the State was allowed\nto take an assignment. If the State was allowed to\ntake an assignment from something other than the claim\nfor medical expenses, then they owned the proceeds.\nOur contention is that the State was only allowed to\ntake an assignment under the language of the statute\nfor the claim for medical expenses, and in that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about the\nFederal statute --\nMR. BLAIR: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not the State statute.\nMR. BLAIR: The Federal statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State statute clearly\ngoes beyond that and says --\nMR. BLAIR: We lose under the State statute.\nNo question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the Federal\nstatute provides you, you think, with a defense to the\nState law claim.\nMR. BLAIR: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why was there\nFederal jurisdiction in this case in the first place?\nMR. BLAIR: Because the Federal question\ninvolved the preemption issue as to whether the State\nstatute had been preempted by the anti-lien statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so your view of\njurisdiction depends upon the Federal defense.\nMR. BLAIR: Correct. That is, the -- the\njurisdiction of the district court action we believe\nwas a Federal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- and which\nof our cases say that a Federal defense supports\nFederal jurisdiction?\nMR. BLAIR: A Federal defense does not\nsupport the Federal jurisdiction, but the declaratory\njudgment act gives jurisdiction over Federal questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Allows you to come\ninto court if the claim that would have been brought\nagainst you would have been brought in Federal court,\nand the claim that would have been brought against you\nwould have been under Arkansas law.\nMR. BLAIR: The claim that was -- that we\nwere bringing was under Federal law in that we were\nclaiming the Arkansas statute was invalid by reason of\na anti-lien statute, and we believed that that\npresented a question of Federal law and therefore\nbrought it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sounds like a\ndefense.\nMR. BLAIR: -- in district court.\nWhich hadn't been raised, Your Honor, and I'm\nhaving to wing it. But that's --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you still have a\ndeclaration that the Arkansas statute was\nunconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal\nstatute?\nMR. BLAIR: That's correct. That was our --\nour claim before the district court that ultimately\nwound up in the Eighth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It still sounds like\na defense to me, counsel, and I think it may make a\ndifference if your argument relies on the anti-lien\nprovision as a defense or perhaps relies on the -- the\nassignment provisions in the Medicaid statute. That's\nwhy I'm just trying to focus on whether it's the\nassignment provisions that limit what Arkansas can do\nas a matter of its own law, or if it's the anti-lien\nprovision as a defense.\nMR. BLAIR: I believe that it is both. I\nthink that the assignment provisions limit the\npermissible assignment as a matter of Federal law by\nreason of the anti-lien statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there's nothing in the\nassignment provision as such that limits it, is there?\nMR. BLAIR: Other than its language as to\nwhat it's for.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it said -- I'm looking\nat 1396k(a)(1)(A), which refers to assign to the State\nany rights to payment for medical care from any third\nparty.\nMR. BLAIR: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's no limitation in\nthat.\nMR. BLAIR: Payments -- the right to payments\nfor medical care, which we believe is the language of\nlimitation in that the State is -- in effect, is\nseeking an assignment of the entire cause of action not\njust that that is related to the right to payment for\nmedical care, which is simply a component of the claim\nthat may have 5 cents on the dollar value or 100 cents,\ndepending on what the facts of the case are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any reason\nthat the Federal law would have to act as a limitation\non the State law? In other words, if we read the --\nthe Federal law your way, is there any reason it would\nfrustrate the Federal purposes for the State to say,\nwell, we want to get all of the medical expenses? We\ndon't just want to get the proportionate share of the\nrecovery. That -- that's enough for the Feds, but we\nare also out State money and we want that State money.\nThey can go further, can't they?\nMR. BLAIR: In the absence of the anti-lien\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the absence of the\nanti-lien.\nMR. BLAIR: In the absence of the anti-lien\nstatute, the State statute would be, in my opinion --\nthe State would be allowed to take a greater lien than\nprovided by Federal law. But -- and a lien statute is\nthere, and we say that that is the stopping point. The\nFederal anti-lien statute gives protection to the\nrecipient's property as to which these assignment\nstatutes are an implied exception, but the exception\nmust be limited by the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I assume the State --\nthe State tries to get around that by saying it never\n-- never became the property of your client, that by\nreason of the assignment provision, all choses in\naction automatically vest in the State, causes of\naction arising out of transactions in which there's a\nclaim for Medicaid compensation.\nMR. BLAIR: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say they\ncan't do that because, at the time the accident occurs,\nyou don't even know that there's going to be a claim --\nMR. BLAIR: I say -- excuse me, Your Honor.\nI say that that is a fiction because what it attaches\nto is the cause of action that existed instantly at the\ntime of the injury, and so say, no, you don't own that\nbecause it was assigned to us. Well, we had to have\nsomething to assign, otherwise assignment was\nmeaningless.\nWe -- in -- in summation, as I see the white\nlight is on, we believe that this case -- and it is\nRespondent's position that these three statutes that we\nhave been discussing here are plain and unambiguous and\nthat the case should be resolved upon the basis of the\nstatutory language. And we -- it is further\nRespondent's position that if the case is resolved on\nthe basis of the statutory language, the Eighth Circuit\nreached a very correct analysis of the language and the\nresults that that takes place.\nThere is no ambiguity, and under the first\nstep of the Chevron case, we submit to the Court that\nthis is a case of statutory construction within the\nterms of the statutes which, read together, are\nunambiguous and plain. They get an assignment for the\nclaim for medical care services. The anti-lien statute\nshields the rest.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Blair.\nMs. Freno, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI FRENO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. FRENO: Thank you, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, the default rule, that rule\nbeing that unless the State is invited into the\nnegotiations, that liability -- the extent of the\nliability of the third party can be considered to be\n100 -- the full amount that Medicaid had to pay -- that\nis a very important rule. And it makes sense because\nmoney that has to be spent -- there was a suggestion of\npost-settlement hearings to determine what portion of\nthe money is for -- for medical costs and what is for\nsomething else. Such hearings would be incredibly\nexpensive, horribly inconvenient. The State would have\nto, you know, burden -- shoulder this burden, and this\nis money that could be going into the Medicaid program.\nEvery dollar that's recovered from liable third\nparties is put back into the Medicaid program, and if\nthe State has to keep hiring more lawyers and has to\nhave administrative hearings or proceeding in judiciary\nproceedings to determine what part of a settlement\nconstitutes a payment, then that -- that is just a very\ninefficient use of -- of very limited Federal -- or\nState funds.\nI heard a comment in Mr. Blair's argument\nthat Arkansas law -- I think it was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I really didn't\nunderstand that argument. Does the State deduct from\nits Medicaid funds the amount that it pays lawyers to\nconduct Medicaid litigation?\nMS. FRENO: No, it does not conduct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then it doesn't matter\nas far as the Medicaid funds are concerned. It comes\nout of general State revenues. Right?\nMS. FRENO: It comes out of general State\nrevenues, but the amount of general State revenues that\nare there are what is available to put back into the\nMedicaid fund.\nAlso, Arkansas law does not require an\nassignment of a cause of action. Arkansas law is very\nclear on that point, and that's set forth in 20-77-301,\nwhich is at -- in -- at the cert petition appendix at\npage 38. It specifically states that any action taken\nby the State cannot be a bar to any action brought on\nbehalf of the recipient.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Freno.\nMS. FRENO: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
