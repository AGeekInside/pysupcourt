Mr.\nCrabtree.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. CRABTREE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CRABTREE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: There are three core reasons why the\nCourt should hold that disparate impact is an available\nmethod of proof in age discrimination cases. First, the\nCourt held in Griggs that identical prohibitory language\nprohibited facially neutral actions by an employer to\ndisproportionately impacted the protected class.\nQUESTION: Mr. Crabtree, we are not talking\nabout a situation where you are claiming that the fact of\ndisparate impact gives rise to a permissible inference of\nintentional discrimination. You are relying just on\ndisparate impact alone, are you not?\nMR. CRABTREE: No, Your Honor. We believe that\ndisparate impact both serves the purpose of proving\nindirectly that perhaps subconscious biases exist, as well\nas detecting biases that could otherwise be concealed.\nQUESTION: Well, now in Washington against\nDavis, we held that disparate impact was not enough by\nitself under the statute or Constitution that you could\ninfer from it an intent to discriminate. Now, are you, I\ndidn't get the impression from the court of appeals\nopinion that you are arguing that this plan by the\nRespondent supports an inference of an intent to\ndiscriminate on the basis of age.\nMR. CRABTREE: We believe it does support an\ninference of an intent, an intent that does not need to be\nproven, that it justifies that it can justify the\nnecessity for the doctrine because without it, it would be\neasy for an employer to conceal its intent for example, an\nemployer could choose a device like a five-year rule in\nwhich they said that we won't hire anybody with more than\nfive years' experience or we'll have speed tests.\nQUESTION: That's a very handy prophylactic\nrule, but with it, once you, once you acknowledge that\nindeed the malicious intent is necessary with it, with the\nrule that you propose, you are going to get a lot of\nemployers that have no such malicious intent.\nMR. CRABTREE: Justice Scalia, we are not\nsuggesting that malicious intent is required at all for\ndisparate impact. We are suggesting that disparate impact\nwill detect that as well, or at least the provision --\nQUESTION: You just say it is bad in itself.\nIt is not bad because it shows malicious intent.\nMR. CRABTREE: That's certainly true. We\nabsolutely believe that.\nQUESTION: Because if the only reason it's bad\nis because it shows malicious intent, my goodness, it\nseems to me it goes much too far. There are a lot of\nemployers who have in place policies that may affect\nelderly employees more harshly who, you know, have no\nintent to do that.\nMR. CRABTREE: That's certainly true, and\ndefinitely, the doctrine goes beyond that. But what we\nare suggesting is it will also, it also prevents an\nemployer from being able to hide behind --\nQUESTION: Well, you want us to consider the\ncase on the assumption that the employer has no intent to\ndiscriminate. He actually has, his intentions are\nabsolutely pure, but in some instances, he is still going\nto be liable under the adverse, pardon me, disparate\nimpact theory.\nMR. CRABTREE: In many instances, that is\ncorrect, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: And that's your position.\nMR. CRABTREE: That is our position. That's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: Okay. So you are relying on\ndisparate impact alone?\nMR. CRABTREE: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I ask, because it's always\nhelpful to me to know, what's at stake in the particular\ncase. What is the practice that you claim has a disparate\nimpact in this case?\nMR. CRABTREE: What we have alleged in this\ncase is that the employer's reduction in force has had a\ndisparate impact upon the older workers, the selection\ndevice of the older workers.\nQUESTION: Are you saying reductions in force\nare always practices that if they have a disparate impact,\ngive rise to a, an age discrimination claim?\nMR. CRABTREE: No, Your Honor, because in\nvirtually every instance where there is reduction in force\nit will be quite easy for an employer to satisfy the\ndefense under the reasonable factors of the age provision\nof the act.\nQUESTION: What is different about the\nreduction in force in this case?\nMR. CRABTREE: Well, in this case, Your Honor,\nas the district court acknowledged in its opinion that we\nare proceeding from, we had evidence at the highest levels\nthat the decision to undertake the downsizing was actually\na decision to get rid of, intended to get rid of older\nworkers.\nQUESTION: That's the disparate treatment\nclaim?\nMR. CRABTREE: Unfortunately, it's not, Your\nHonor, because as the district court judge acknowledged,\nwe could not make a disparate treatment case under these\nfacts because in the disparate treatment case, we would\nstill have to prove, unless we could make a cat's paw\nanalysis that the actual decision maker harbored an animus\nagainst the employee who is terminated. But what we are\nsuggesting under this model and under this framework is\nthat if we can make a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact, then the employer can justify that impact by\nshowing that its decision was based upon reasonable\nfactors and that those reasonable factors --\nQUESTION: But this is what I -- excuse me for\ninterrupting, but is it the decision to downsize that it\nhas to be reasonable or the particular discharge decisions\non each individual have to be reasonable?\nMR. CRABTREE: We have identified in this case\nthe action of the employer as being the decision to\ndownsize itself.\nQUESTION: The decision to downsize itself?\nMR. CRABTREE: Which for most instances will be\nmuch more difficult probably for plaintiffs than it would\nbe if you want on a more micro-level. However --\nQUESTION: Why would it be more difficult? All\nyou have to prove if I understand your theory is that\nthere are more older workers in the group that were\ndischarged than younger workers?\nMR. CRABTREE: Will, it would have to be a\nsubstantially disparate impact between the two groups. It\nwould be more difficult because it would be much easier\nfor an employer to justify a reduction in force in almost\nany circumstance.\nQUESTION: I thought you conceded that it was\nnot enough for you to show disparate impact. That you\nhad, say 70 percent of the people and my problem with your\npresentation is the same as Justice Stevens. In every\ndisparate impact case that I know, a rule neutral is on\nits face that disparate impact like the high school\ndiploma requirement in Griggs, there is the standard that\nhas a differential effect. A high school diploma, a pen\nand paper test as in Washington V. Davis, a height, weight\nrequirement as in Dothard vs. Rawlinson, but you don't\ncome to us with any rule, standard, practice. You just\nsay reduction in force.\nMR. CRABTREE: Well, what we are saying is\nthis, is that the Court indicated in Wards Cove that the\nplaintiff in an age -- in a discrimination case is to\nidentify a specific practice or action by an employer that\nresults in disparate impact that cannot be justified. We\nhave identified this downsizing as being such a practice\nbecause we don't believe the employer can justify it\nbecause the downsizing was motivated by desire to --\nQUESTION: Why don't we leave motive out of it\nfor purposes -- forget motive. Let's imagine in your\ncase, that's what I thought this case was about, we\nimagine in your case the employer had a wonderful motive.\nThere are other cases where the rule in question was we\nare going to fire some tenured teachers to save money.\nThat was the real reason to save money. The tenured\nteachers tend to be older teachers. There was another\ncase in which they said the court looked at a rule that\nsaid we will fire people in the higher-paid positions.\nThat was their real reason to save money.\nBut the court said each of those rules like\nyour case, too, has a disparate impact on older employees.\nAnd just saving money is not a justification and therefore\nthe plaintiff wins. Now, I take it that's the proposition\nyou are defending.\nMR. CRABTREE: We are defending that\nproposition. That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then the other parts to me\nare easy. Of course you can use it to prove bad motive,\net cetera, but that's the hard proposition. Now, I wish\nyou would explain why as a matter of law that tough\nproposition nonetheless is the law.\nMR. CRABTREE: Well, we believe it's the law\nbecause the prohibitions themselves as construed in Griggs\napply to actions and then the reasonable --\nQUESTION: Well, the background in Griggs was\nracial discrimination, and the policies there seem to me\nto rest on a long history of societal and historical bias\nagainst black people. Now, we don't have that background\nwith age discrimination, do we?\nMR. CRABTREE: No, Justice O'Connor, we do not.\nQUESTION: So it might be quite a different\nproposition here.\nMR. CRABTREE: Respectfully, no, Your Honor.\nAnd here's why. As the court acknowledged in Watson, the\ncourt is not limited a disparate impact to remedying past\nproblems with discrimination. Disparate impact goes\nbeyond that. Disparate impact exists to detect\nsubconscious stereotypes operating in the work force,\nexactly what the court identified as the primary form of\ndiscrimination that exists under the ADEA.\nThirdly, in Griggs the court said that the\nlegislative purpose of the act was \"plain from the\nlanguage of the statute\", so the court was looking at the\nstatute itself.\nQUESTION: That's a good idea. What is the\nstatute that we are dealing with here? Can we look at the\nlanguage of the statute?\nMR. CRABTREE: Sure, Your Honor. It's on page\n5.A, the appendix to the petitioner's brief. And when you\nlook at the statute itself, what you see between (a)(1)\nand (a)(2) is a difference between a micro and a\nmacro-orientation. In (a)(1), we are concerned about an\nemployer's individual actions directed towards an\nindividual employee, but in (a)(2), we are concerned with\nan employer's macro-actions directed towards its employees\nand how that impacts individuals.\nQUESTION: In each of those cases, Mr.\nCrabtree, it says because of such individual's age. Now,\ndoesn't that suggest that there is some motive\nrequirement?\nMR. CRABTREE: No, Your Honor. We don't\nbelieve it does and I'll explain why. When you look at\n(a)(2), the clause because of such individual's age, the\nword individual is critical because at the beginning of\ntwo, it reads, to limit, segregate or classify his\nemployees in any way which would deprive or tend to\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee\nbecause of such individual's age. So the clause relates\nto the effect and not to the motive of the actor.\nQUESTION: I would think it relates to, to the\nlimit, segregate or classify.\nMR. CRABTREE: It cannot, Your Honor, because\nthe word his employees follows those words.\nQUESTION: In any event, the wording is\nidentical to Title VII, and Title VII on that wording has\nbeen held to have this differential impact theory for sex,\nas well as race.\nMR. CRABTREE: That's absolutely correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. And of course, Congress has never acted\nto expressly prohibit disparate impact under Title VII.\nThe only prohibition of disparate impact under Title VII\nis in its age as the court construed in Griggs and Griggs'\nprogeny.\nQUESTION: Was this language adopted in this\nform after it had been clearly established that the Title\nVII language did include disparate impact? You know, as\nan original matter, I wouldn't have thought it did.\nMR. CRABTREE: Oh, it did not.\nQUESTION: We held that. Now, was this\nlanguage adopted after we held that or before it?\nMR. CRABTREE: It was before, Your Honor. It\ncertainly was. However --\nQUESTION: After Title VII, but before Griggs?\nMR. CRABTREE: That's correct. And to hold\nthat this language does not prohibit disparate impact\nwould mean that there was no disparate impact under Title\nVII. Even in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, all Congress did\nwas define a defense.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me that even if we\naccept your reading of the statute which I am not sure is\nthe more natural reading, you still have because of such\nindividual's age, that is to say what you would call\ndisparate impact, what the statute says adverse impact\nmust still be because of such individual's age and if we\nthink because of, implies or necessarily requires a bad\npurpose, you still have the same problem.\nMR. CRABTREE: If because of did require a bad\npurpose, we would, however, there is two reasons why we\ncan, why it is not. One is that the first one is that the\nreasonable factors other than age defense cannot make\nsense if the prohibitions only apply to intentional\nactions.\nQUESTION: Now you are going to the second. Just\nso I'm focusing in on this. (A)(2), it seems to me that\nyour reading of the statute doesn't explain because of,\nthen you have to go to this other part of the statute,\nwhich you have to do any way. So I mean this whole\nargument over how to interpret 2 it seems to me doesn't\nget you there.\nMR. CRABTREE: Again, we are relating because\nof back to the effect of the individual and we are relying\nupon the court's interpretation of that language in\nGriggs.\nQUESTION: Well, one, one might feel that\nGriggs is stare decisis because it could feel that perhaps\nit reasoning would not readily be extended if there was\nsome reason for distinguishing it.\nMR. CRABTREE: That might make sense. I would\nagree, Your Honor, however we don't believe there is any\nbasis to distinguish here given the court's subsequent\ncases post-Griggs.\nQUESTION: But as -- may I go back to the\nquestion that we opened with, and that is I don't know of\nany case under Title VII where someone could just say\nreduction in force affected more women than men,\ntherefore, I have an impact case or reduction in force, it\naffected more minorities than majorities so therefore.\nIt's always been some specific practice that you could\nidentify some rule, some neutral rule. In fact, it's even\nsometimes referred to as neutralized base discriminatory\nand impact.\nHere I don't -- reduction of force in and of\nitself is not such a neutral rule. It's -- it's too\ngeneral. So I, what is the precise rule practice standard\nthat's comparable to a high school diploma, a height and\nweight. What is there in this case?\nMR. CRABTREE: Your Honor, two answers. First\nof all, that we equate reduction in force to a test. It's\na selection process. We are not challenging a question on\nthe test. We are challenging the test itself. But even\nif the court were to find that we have inadequately\nidentified the action of the employer that should be\nsubject to disparate impact analysis, we would still, it's\nan interlocutory proceeding. We would be happy to proceed\non the theory as the court redefines or the court defines\ndisparate impact under the ADEA. We would amend our\ncomplaint in accordance with the court's ruling.\nQUESTION: I don't think that the district\ncourt finding allows you to say the standard is the\nreduction itself because the district judge said that the\npeople involved held a wide variety of jobs, were managed\nand supervised by different people and were terminated at\ndifferent times by different decision makers based on\ndifferent considerations of criteria, and that seems to me\njust wholly to reject that there is a rule or a standard.\nMR. CRABTREE: The reason why we believe it's\nimportant to be able to do the analysis with the reduction\nof force being the action is because otherwise it would\nallow an employer to purposely choose to do a reduction in\nforce to get rid of its older workers where there is a\ncorporate culture pervaded by ageism and have consequences\nas it did here where it greatly reduced the age of its\nwork force.\nQUESTION: What is your closest precedent under\nTitle VII dealing with race or dealing with sex where you\nhave something so groundly general as a reduction in force\nwith different decisions, different standards, different\ntimes?\nMR. CRABTREE: There are cases dealing with\nreduction of force under Title VII. There is one NAACP\nvs. Medical Center, Inc., It was out of the third circuit.\n657 F.2d 1322. There have probably been others.\nQUESTION: And nothing more specific than a\nreduction in force?\nMR. CRABTREE: Candidly, Justice Ginsburg, I\ndon't recall. I just know --\nQUESTION: Mr. Crabtree, I thought the question\non which we granted certiorari was not whether this\nparticular claim of disparate impact was too general or\nnot specific enough. But whether the whole, I'll read it,\nis a disparate impact method of proving age discrimination\navailable to plaintiffs.\nMR. CRABTREE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: And I would hope you would address\nJustice Breyer's question in which he said why should we\ndo this to say that tenured employees are the higher\nsalaried employees? What would be the justification in a\ncase such as that for using your theory of liability?\nMR. CRABTREE: Well, in most instances,\nemployer is going to be able to explain why he engages in\nany selection process.\nQUESTION: Most instances, they can't explain\nit very well. In most instances, I think in a business or\na university, you begin to look into it, and it dissolves\nin front of your eyes. People say you could do it this\nway, you could do it that way, you could do it some other\nway, and it will turn out you haven't thought about it\nthat much. Now, it may well be sensible to make an\nemployer go to that effort we were talking about race and\ngender, and yet here, there is so many rules correlated\nwith age. There are so many that how could the employer\nrun his business where you are going to have a court\nsecond-guessing every single rule that's correlated with\nage. That's the problem. What's your response?\nMR. CRABTREE: And that may very well be why\nCongress chose to use the result factors other than age\nlanguage, and that is why there are, although we don't\nagree with them, why there were good intellectual\narguments that reasonable factors other than age is\nsomething less than business necessity. That it is easier\nto justify.\nQUESTION: What would your test be? I mean do\nyou think the ninth circuit in the cases I mentioned was\nright? I mean, if you are going to apply exactly the same\ntough tests as in these other places, maybe they were.\nWhat's your opinion about that?\nMR. CRABTREE: We believe that the term is\nambiguous. And we believe for that reason the court\nshould defer interpretation.\nQUESTION: Which is what? Say what you think\nthe form of words is?\nMR. CRABTREE: That it is that the employer\nmust justify the action as being business necessity.\nQUESTION: But reasonable factors other than\nage provision doesn't really solve Justice Breyer's\nproblem, does it, because it puts the burden on the\nemployer to establish that, doesn't it?\nMR. CRABTREE: It does, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So you are still in a situation\nwhere the employer said well he could have done it a lot\nof different ways and you are saying I'm sorry, that's no\ngood.\nMR. CRABTREE: But if the employer must only\nshow that its action was reasonable, it is not as\ndemanding as showing that it was necessary.\nQUESTION: You said emphasize reason.\nQUESTION: It's still a burden on him.\nMR. CRABTREE: It is still a burden on him.\nYes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: May I go back to the --\nQUESTION: Please.\nQUESTION: May I go back to your argument of a\nminute ago that the, that the various defenses make no\nsense except on the disparate impact theory possibility of\ndisparate impact theory. What is your response to the\nargument that they make equally good sense on the theory\nthat they respond to mixed motive discharges? What's your\nanswer?\nMR. CRABTREE: They don't make sense on the\nmixed motive analysis because in the mixed motive analysis\nthere is still an issue as to whether or not the\nemployer's illegal motive caused an illegal action. In a,\nin a statute, it provides that the action is otherwise\nprohibitive, so you already have an action that is itself\na violation of the act but-for the defense that follows.\nWe don't have the same concerns we have in a mixed motive\ncase where we don't know if the motive of the employer\nactually caused the action. It's already been determined\nas a premise of the defense.\nThere is an additional reason why we believe\nthat the court should hold that disparate impact applies\nunder the ADEA. And that is Congress passed the OWBPA and\nprovided that employees who were terminated in reductions\nin force should be entitled to, were entitled to receive\nphysical information prior to deciding whether or not to\ntake the termination package, presumably of substantial\neconomic value, or take their chances in litigation.\nGiven that disparate treatment can generally\nnot be predicated upon nothing more than statistics. And\ngiven that employees terminated in RIF's usually do not\nhave an independent basis to suspect that they are being\nsingled out for discrimination.\nQUESTION: Mr. Crabtree, could I just come back\nfor a moment to, to your argument which I think is an\nimportant one that some of the defenses don't make sense\nunless there is a discriminatory impact basis. What about\nthe defense that says it will not be unlawful to discharge\nor otherwise discipline an individual, an individual, for\ngood cause? I mean, that's obviously a redundancy. It\ncan only imply to an intentional discrimination case, not\nto a, not to an impact case. But it's obviously redundant\nbecause if you are disciplining him for good cause, you\nare obviously not disciplining him with a motive of\npunishing his age. It's just thoroughly redundant. It\nseems to me a lot of these defenses are redundant. They\nare just there to make clear that there are safe harbors,\none of which is disciplining an individual for good cause.\nAnother one is observing the terms of a seniority system\nand so forth.\nMR. CRABTREE: Well, when you are observing the\nterms of a seniority system, you know, you may be looking\nat age directly. You may have, you can easily have a\nviolation that exists under the act otherwise.\nQUESTION: Well, no, I don't, I don't know any\nseniority systems that go on the basis of people's age as\nopposed to how long they have been working there. Do you\nknow any seniority systems that say you have more\nseniority if you are 65?\nMR. CRABTREE: I'm not sure, Your Honor. I\ndon't have an answer to that. But I don't think that we\ncan disregard the words of the reasonable factors other\nthan age in this case. I don't think we can ignore the\nterm reasonable factors, and when you look at, at (f)(1),\nand you look --\nQUESTION: It's redundant. It's just redundant\nthe way to discharge, it's lawful to discharge an\nindividual for good cause. Of course it's redundant. You\ndon't have to say that once you say that there has to be\neither intentional discrimination, or as you would say,\nadverse impact. You are talking about disciplining an\nindividual. You really don't need that. Once you say\nthere has to be intentional discrimination, but it's there\njust to make everything that much clearer. And you can\nmake the same argument about the BFOA provision.\nMR. CRABTREE: You might be able to make that argument,\nbut it is not the most logical argument. It does not\nrespect Congress' words. It does not respect the fact\nthat Congress required that the factors not just be\nneutral, but that they be reasonable because even if we\nignored the otherwise prohibitive language, Justice\nScalia, we still have to give effect to the term\nreasonable.\nCongress not merely required that the factors\nexist or that they be legitimate or bonafide as in the EPA\nor as Gunther acknowledged, but that they be reasonable as\nwell.\nQUESTION: I don't want. I think you should be\nable to reserve your rebuttal time. But I do have one\nquestion. You seem to acceed to Justice O'Connor's\nsuggestion that Griggs involving racial discrimination\ninvolved deeply rooted attitudes which called for special\nrules, and that those just don't apply with the age\nfactor. Would you want us to write the opinion that way,\nor are there some subtle biases against elderly workers\nthat are important to support your theory?\nIf you train a worker, you are going to get a\nbetter return on your investment as the worker is younger,\netc.\nMR. CRABTREE: That's certainly true, Justice\nKennedy. There are those subtle biases and that's what\nSecretary Ward's report acknowledged and that's what the\ncourt acknowledged in Hazen Paper when it said that subtle\nbiases, stereotypes are largely an issue, not animus in\nage discrimination and that is consistent with the court's\nholding in Watson that disparate impact exists largely to\ndetect subtle biases. If I may, Your Honor, I'll reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Crabtree. Mr. Nager,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. NAGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court: If I may, I'd like to address why fully\nconsistent and giving full respect to Griggs vs. Duke\nPower Company, this Court can and should hold that the age\ndiscrimination and employment act does not make --\nQUESTION: Even though the language is\nessentially the same?\nMR. NAGER: Justice O'Connor, it's not. It is\ncommon language in Section 4, but this Court doesn't\nconstrue language in a statute in isolation from the\nremainder of the statute, and the remainder of this\nstatute is quite different. The remainder of the statute\nincludes the reasonable factors other than age provision.\nThe remainder of this statute is based upon a report of\nthe Secretary of Labor which said that the problems of age\ndiscrimination in the workplace were quite distinct and\nquite different from the problems that motivated the\nenactment of Title VII and it's the problems that\nmotivated the enactment of Title VII which gave rise to\nGriggs. That's what this Court said in Griggs. It's what\nyour opinion for the court says in Watson. So what, if we\nlook at the statute, statutory language not in isolation,\nbecause in fact, we can read all of the court's Title VII\ndisparate impact cases and we won't see the language\nparsed. The court looked at that language in terms of the\noverall objectives of the statute, and rendered a decision\nin light of the distinct and enormous problems of race\ndiscrimination that this country has faced and dealt with.\nAge discrimination, the Congress itself recognized was\ndifferent. That's why it didn't include age in Title VII.\nInstead it commissioned a report from the secretary of\nlabor to tell us about the problems of older workers.\nRecommend legislation to us.\nAnd the bill, the report that was commissioned\nwas submitted. This Court repeatedly in EEOC vs. Wyoming,\nin Hazen Paper, has repeatedly recognized that that report\nset the foundation for the statute.\nQUESTION: I thought you were going to tell us\nthat because of age, is one of your strongest points, and\nas Justice O'Connor said, that's the same language\nstructure that we had in Griggs, and that we would have to\ninterpret them differently.\nMR. NAGER: You are right, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: But, but, but then you automatically\nthrow me over I guess to part (f) and talk about\nreasonable factors other than age, which is exactly what\nthe petition wanted to do.\nMR. NAGER: That's my lack of clarity, Justice\nKennedy. What we are suggesting to the Court is the more\nnatural construction of the language in 4(a), the because\nof language, is an intent requirement. The fact of that\nintent requirement is confirmed and compelled by the\nremaining provisions in the statute. Our suggestion is\njust as your opinion in Public Employee Retirement System\nvs. Betts did.\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt. I want to be\nsure I have -- you think that because of such individual's\nage or more normally refers to the very first part of the\nparagraph that talks in the plural rather than the\nsingular?\nMR. NAGER: Yes, Justice Stevens, because the\nstructure of the statute says that the employer can't\nlimit, segregate or classify his employees in a way that\nhas an adverse effect on an individual.\nQUESTION: On any individual.\nMR. NAGER: Because of such individual's age.\nQUESTION: Correct. The effect that that\nmodifies, not the classification.\nMR. NAGER: No. The comma in that provision, I\nthink eliminates any ambiguity about what the because of\nphrase modifies. That it modifies the verbs to limit,\nsegregate or classify.\nQUESTION: Even though the former is plural and\nthe because of is singular?\nMR. NAGER: Because the sentence has to be read\nas a whole. It says limit, segregate or classify the\nemployees in a way that has an effect on an individual\nbecause of the individual's age.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. NAGER: But the --\nQUESTION: You said it perfectly.\nMR. NAGER: It is -- I would grant you that it\nis not the most elegantly written sentence in the world,\nbut I would also urge upon you, Your Honor, that the comma\nin that sentence grammatically compels that the because of\nphrase modifies the to limit, segregate or classify.\nQUESTION: Your view is well, Title VII, the\ncourt really got it wrong. They are not good grammarians,\nso they got it wrong, but that's stare decisis so we'll\nleave it alone, because it's the identical wording, the F\npart I think you may have more of an argument there\nbecause it's not found in Title VII. But if your grammar\nargument has to be saying, and tell me if I'm wrong about\nthis, the court really got it wrong in Griggs because\nthere is no room for an impact test under Title VII any\nmore than under age, but because the court said it in 1971\nand continued to say it, we are stuck with it, but we\ndon't have to make the same mistake again. Is that your\nargument?\nMR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not here to\nchallenge Griggs in any respect. I am here to say that\nthe more natural construction of that language was not the\none the court adopted in Griggs, and just as this Court\ndoes that on occasion because of other materials that\ninfluence the construction of a statute.\nQUESTION: I mean, we look at the whole\nstatute, as you said, not just the comma.\nMR. NAGER: That's the point.\nQUESTION: The comma could be outweighed by\nother factors in one statute, and not in the other.\nMR. NAGER: And that is what the court has\nfound in its Title VII cases.\nQUESTION: A comma is not a very big thing, is\nit?\nMR. NAGER: I'm sorry, could you --\nQUESTION: I say a comma is not a very big\nthing.\nMR. NAGER: Well, it is part of the statute,\nand we think it has to be taken into account, but our\nargument that the age discrimination employment act should\nnot be allowed to recognize disparate impact claims does\nnot rest solely on the comma. Our point about Section\n4(a), Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg is that the\nmore natural construction of that language is the, an\nintent requirement, as Chief Justice Rehnquist recognized\nin his separate opinion on certiorari in Geller vs.\nMarkham. The fact that the court found other\nconsiderations to lead to a different conclusion in the\ncontext of a limited class of Title VII cases does not\ncompel a particular construction of the Age Discrimination\nEmployment Act.\nWe have to look at those other considerations\nthat inform the construction of the Age Discrimination\nAct.\nQUESTION: Well, I can see you point to (f) in\nthe reasonableness because there is no counterpart to that\nin Title VII, but frankly --\nMR. NAGER: That's --\nQUESTION: Frankly, I would find it unseemly to\ntake the identical words and say we ignore the comma in\none case. If we had paid attention to the comma, you have\nto reach the same result.\nMR. NAGER:\nJustice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION:\nMR. NAGER:\nQUESTION:\nto accept for Title VII but wouldn't require us to accept\nfor this statute.\nQUESTION: That's the very point I made to you,\nand you rejected it. I said --\nMR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has on\nany number of occasions, and I'll use the Chief Justice's\nopinion in Fogerty vs. Fantasy as an illustration, said\nthat identical language in two separate statutes can be\ngiven two different meanings by this Court if a single\nmeaning isn't compelled by the words themselves and if the\nstatute has different purposes or different legislative\nhistory. You coined that opinion.\nQUESTION: But here we know even though Griggs\ndidn't come until sometime later, the Congress did, when\nit wrote the Age Discrimination Act, it did copy quite\ndeliberately the Title VII language.\nMR. NAGER: That is true. But it is also the\ncase that it did not copy the 4(f)(1) language. It is\nalso the case that at the time --\nQUESTION: But that's a different argument,\nlooking at the statute as a whole and saying whatever the\nfirst part means, here we have another part that's absent\nfrom Title VII so we don't have to interpret it the same\nway.\nMR. NAGER: I have two points. Congress\ncouldn't have known about Griggs at the time that the,\nthat it used the language from Title VII in 4(a) because\nGriggs hadn't yet been decided, so that was not a\nwell-established construction by this Court in 1967. But\nyou are also right, it is the essence of our argument\nhere, not to ask the Court to construe 4(a) in isolation.\nIt's to ask the Court to do as it did in Betts and as it\ndoes in any number of cases to construe 4(a) in light of\nthe other provisions. Justice Scalia has made the point\nabout the discharge for cause. We also make the point\nabout the reasonable factors other than age. That is an\nintent-based provision and it shows that this statute at\nevery turn was concerned with employer intent, whether it\nbe good cause, whether it be decisions .\nQUESTION: What you do you with the argument,\nwhich I think is an interesting one, that it is a\nreasonable factors other than age requirement.\nMR. NAGER: It is --\nQUESTION: If, if there were an intent\nrequirement in the act, it wouldn't matter whether you are\nusing reasonable factors or not, so long as you are not\nusing age. You know, I don't like people with blue eyes.\nThat ought to be good enough, so long as blue eyes has\nnothing to do with age.\nMR. NAGER: As you have pointed out, Justice\nScalia, it's perfectly appropriate for Congress to clarify\nand make unambiguous in any respect conceivable that it\ndoes not want any decision that's based upon a reasonable\nfactor to be subject to liability under this statute.\nSecondly --\nQUESTION: Okay, but that argument is equally\ncompatible with the position that your brother is taking\non the other side, and if you take the ambiguity that is\nleft, and you combine it with the argument that Justice\nGinsburg is making about the parallel language with Title\nVII, doesn't it lead you to say all right, the parallel\nlanguage is answered only by an argument which in fact,\nboils down to an ambiguity and an ambiguity doesn't defeat\nthe policy of construing like statutes, like drafted\nstatutes in a like manner.\nMR. NAGER: The answer to that is no. The\nreason that it's no is because whatever one thinks the\nreasonable factor other than the word reasonable and the\nreasonable factors other than age means, it's still a\nmotive-based test based upon what considerations are you\ntaking into account, and --\nQUESTION: Why does it have to be a reasonable\nfactor other than age? I'm not sure you have answered my\nquestion? So long as it's not age, the intent factor is\nnot satisfied. You should be able to use an unreasonable\nfactor other than age.\nMR. NAGER: You absolutely can. Section 4 F\nsimply clarifies what's lawful. It doesn't tell us what's\nunlawful. We only can find what's unlawful by going to\n4(a) and reading it in light of the provisions in 4(a).\nQUESTION: So you say it's a safe harbor\nprovision for sure if it's a reasonable factor other than\nage, it's okay?\nMR. NAGER: And it tells us more than that,\nJustice Scalia. It tells us that intent is what counts.\nInterestingly enough, our opponents in both their opening\nbrief and their reply brief concede that the phrase based\nupon reasonable factors other than age is a reference to\nan intent requirement, and the whole notion, as Justice\nBreyer has pointed out through his questioning at the\nopening of this argument, is what distinguishes a\ndisparate treatment case from an impact case is that\nintent is irrelevant, so if reasonable factors other than\nage --\nQUESTION: I don't really understand -- I must\nsay, I don't entirely follow the argument. Supposing you\nhave a test that you have to have an IQ above 110,\nsomething or other, in order to avoid discharge, and you\nfind that that has a disparate impact on older workers for\nsome reason, they lose their intelligence quota or\nsomething like that. Beyond the age.\nMR. NAGER: Bad news for us.\nQUESTION: Bad news for many of us. But there\nis statistics that show that. And you might come back and\nsay I didn't realize that or something like that. It\nwould be enough for you to show that, that that's totally\nirrelevant because you just didn't realize that fact. But\nwhy then would they need to say you have to defend that as\na reasonable practice?\nMR. NAGER: The legislative history and the\nsecretary's report makes quite clear why they put the\nreasonable in there, because they were concerned about the\nmixed motive cases. This statute, when it was originally\ndiscussed, the question came up, does this mean age has to\nbe the only factor that's considered in order for it to be\nlawful solely? And the answer to that was the secretary\ncame back and said no.\nWe recognize that employers have been\nconsidering age for a long time. What we think the\nCongress should prohibit is the use of age as a screening\ndevice to filter. Now, it will still be the case because\nhuman beings are human beings that employers will still be\ncognizant of employees' age. They can't help but be.\nBut so long as a reasonable factor other than\nage is the basis of the decision, there should be no\nliability for it.\nQUESTION: Yes, but why is that necessary to\ndeal with mixed motive? Why can't you recognize mixed\nmotive by recognizing unreasonable factors other than age?\nThat's an equally mixed motive, if you would have an\nunreasonable factor.\nMR. NAGER: Well, every time that the mixed\nmotive issue has been discussed, this Court in construing\nTitle VII, in construing the National Labor Relations Act,\nin construing the Constitution, the 1983 and Mt. Healthy\ncases, has always put a verb -- an adjective, motivating\nfactor, substantial factor. Congress is speaking in\ncommon sense terms in writing these clarifying provisions\nto make it clear that age had to be the but-for cause of\nan employment action, and the employer had to intend it\nthat we give you the illustration, our brief of Judge\nWright's opinion for the D.C. circuit in Cuddy vs. Carmen,\nwhich talks about how the two provisions were intended to\nwork in tandem just as Justice Kennedy's opinion for this\nCourt in Betts said that 4(f)(2) and 4(a) were supposed to\nwork in tandem to define the elements of a plaintiff's\ncase.\nCould 4(a) have been written and construed\nwithout a clarifying provision? Of course. And we would\nbe taking that position whether that additional language\nwas there or not. But it doesn't weaken our argument in\nthe slightest that Congress went further and clarified\nwhat the standards would be in a mixed motive case.\nQUESTION: Well, what, what does seem to weaken\nthe argument is leaving even aside the mixed motive\nargument, you were, you are arguing that a reasonable\nfactor test is proof that in fact it was a, an, a\nmalicious motive-based liability in the first place. And\nit seems to me that what you are saying, if that is true,\nthen any motive other than the proscribed one is going to\ndefeat liability.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And the odd thing is that you are\nsaying that by specifying a reasonable factor defense,\nCongress was indicating that there would be an\nunreasonable factor defense because reasonable or\nunreasonable, if it's not age, there is no liability. And\nthat it seems to me is an odd argument to say that by\nputting in the word reasonable they are, they are in\neffect confirming that an unreasonable defense would be\nequally good.\nMR. NAGER: I think the answer to that question\nis that reasonableness goes, is a permissible, the\nreasonableness of a nondiscriminatory factor that an\nemployer offers is something that a judge can consider and\nif he finds a disputed issue of fact, a jury can consider\nin deciding whether or not the nondiscriminatory factor\nthat is offered is a pretext for age discrimination.\nQUESTION: But if you really held that reason.\nIn other words, the reasonableness of the, of the\nemployer's alleged motive goes somehow to the credibility\nof the employer's argument that it was his motive, is that\nwhat you are getting at?\nMR. NAGER: Correct.\nQUESTION: As an evidentiary point, I see it.\nAs a logical point for defining the statute, it seems to\nme that it's clear.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I understand your point,\nJustice Souder, and I will be the first to acknowledge\nthis case would be easier if the word reasonable weren't\nthere. But all the Court has to decide in this case is\nwhether or not the statute embraces a disparate impact\ntest.\nQUESTION: Is there anywhere we can go, is\nthere any way if you were finished, were you?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I just wanted to make the\nfollowing point. Whether it's a reasonable motive or an\nunreasonable motive, it's still a motive and that's\nincompatible with disparate impact. The question is one\nof intent, not one of statistical correlations with age\nand not one of accuracy and verifiability of business\njudgment which are the two core issues in a disparate\nimpact case.\nWhat distinguishes fundamentally a disparate\ntreatment case from a disparate impact case is that in a\ntreatment case while statistics are appropriate statistics\nthat would satisfy Delbare are admissible, and can go to\nmotive, the issue that we argue to the jury is motive. We\ndon't argue about whether or not the correlation is so\nsubstantial that it itself would state a prima facie\nviolation and the jury is not allowed to question the\nemployer's business judgment if it finds that in fact the\nemployer was not motivated by age, and that makes a huge\ndifference at a practical level and a legal level in the\nresolution of age discrimination cases, and that of course\nis why we would say that impact claims should not be\nrecognized. I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Is there any way, which I'm sure you\ndon't want to bring up necessarily, but is there any way\nshort of saying there is never a disparate impact claim?\nThe problem that you mention could be alleviated. If I\nthink, for example, that unlike race or gender, we might\ngo into an ordinary company and find dozens or hundreds or\nmaybe virtually every rule or practice or limitation\nconnected with promotions is correlated with age.\nMR. NAGER: That's true.\nQUESTION: On the other hand, you might have\nsome rules that are really correlated with age very\nheavily and have no justification. All right, so is there\na way of dealing with that problem short of saying there\nis never a disparate impact case?\nMR. NAGER: Well, there is a way of dealing\nwith it. I think Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court\nin Hazen Paper sets it out for us, but it doesn't require\nthe recognition of a disparate impact claim. Justice\nO'Connor's opinion for the Court in Hazen Paper says that\nmerely showing a correlation is not enough to create an\ninference of disparate treatment, but the court left open\nthe question if the employer, the reason they used the\nfactor, there was evidence that they thought that that\nfactor should be used.\nQUESTION: That denies my hypothetical. That's\nsaying you are going to go over to intent. What I'm\nasking you is if in fact the language here does justify a\ndisparate impact case, a real one, what I have been\ntalking about throughout. Is there any way to deal with\nthe problem of practicalities, which is a big one? That\ndistinguishes this from race and gender.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I can only answer the\nquestion the following two ways. I don't think Congress\ncontemplated which may be my legal answer for you.\nAnd I can answer it to you practically because\nI advise employers on these issues, and the way we deal\nwith these issues now is not to change the practices\nunless we find they are really ridiculous. The way we\nadvise our employers to deal with these practices now is\nto use quotas. When we advise employers if they are doing\na reduction in force as to how to reduce the probability\nof a disparate impact claim and the circuits that have\nrecognized them, we take out little five-year age bans and\nunder 40 and over 40 and we assess who is included within\nit and who isn't included within it, and we tell them if\nyou don't change the numbers, you face a greater exposure\nto a claim.\nNow, that is, I guess one way of discouraging\nemployers from having thoughtless, even though not aged\nbiased practice by the sword of a major lawsuit. Whether\nor not that's a legally common --\nQUESTION: But you don't have the power to do\nwhich this case I guess does ask us to do possibly, and\nthat is also to look at the question of the defense here\nand say what does it mean in context? I mean, you could\nsay, for example, reasonably necessary means necessary.\nOr you could say that reasonably necessary means a\nreasonable practice giving weight to the employer's\nreasonable judgment in this. There are a lot of things\nyou could say. So I want your opinion on that.\nMR. NAGER: Well, my opinion is that the\nstatute doesn't say reasonably necessary. That's what the\nBFOQ provision says.\nQUESTION: BFOQ. Based on reasonable factors.\nIt's hard to get around that. Based on --\nMR. NAGER: Yes. It's, the entire phrase has\nto be read. It says based on it. What are the factors?\nAnd that's a reference to motive. We know that from the\nordinary English language, we know it from this Court's\nown cases talking about factors, and we know it from the\nlegislative history because the secretary of labor in\nstudying and reporting to Congress at Congress'\nlegislative direction distinguished between purposeful\nuses of age as stereotypes of the abilities of older\nworkers, and other forces that adversely impact older\nworkers and what the secretary of labor recommended to\ndeal with your problem that you pointed out, Justice\nBreyer, is not a coercive sanction that used, made neutral\npractices with disparate effects illegal. What the\nsecretary of labor recommended to Congress and Congress\nadopted his recommendation in enacting the statute was the\npromotion of education, training and manpower programs\nboth to get employers to better understand the talents and\ncapabilities of older workers and where older workers\nwere --\nQUESTION: Isn't the answer to Justice Breyer's\nconcern about the employer who has an unreasonable\ncriteria that in fact has a bad impact upon older workers?\nIsn't the answer that there is a sanction, and that is a\njury is unlikely to believe it.\nMR. NAGER: Yes. That's the answer I gave,\nbut he told me I --\nQUESTION: Any lawyer advising such, such a,\nsuch an employer would say boy, if you are dragged into\ncourt, and nobody is going to believe that you didn't\nadopt this for the reason of getting rid of older\nemployees. That seems to me --\nMR. NAGER: It's a much better answer than I\ngave. I thought --\nQUESTION: It's a very good answer. I wanted\nto know whether there was also any other answer.\nQUESTION: You gave that answer. May I just\nask you this just to think through the problem a little\nbit. Assume I agree with you 100 percent that the\nreasonable factors other than age defense is a\nmotive-based defense, why couldn't you have a good motive\ndefense to a prima facie case that's based on objective\nfactors?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I don't think it's a defense.\nI should state that. I think that the provision is not in\nthere as an affirmative defense. I think the provision is\nin there to clarify what the scope of the prohibition is.\nQUESTION: Well, even as read in a defense, it's\nan exclusion category case, the motive. But whether it's\na defense or an exclusion, the fact that it is\nmotive-based doesn't seem to me necessarily to mean that\nthe prima facie case must also be motive-based.\nMR. NAGER: If we are talking about a disparate\ntreatment case, I agree with you, Justice Stevens, that in\nan appropriate case with an appropriate statistical\npresentation, a judge would be justified in saying that\nthe plaintiff has presented enough evidence to require the\nemployer to respond to a disparate treatment allegation.\nNow, you know, it's hard to speak universally about\nstatistical presentations. Most of them in my experience\nmay satisfy Delbare, but don't tell us very much about the\nreal merits of the case, but if we adopt as the premise\nthat you have got a particularly powerful statistical\npresentation, I don't think there is any case law and\ncertainly not from this Court because Teamsters and cases\nlike that say that statistics are admissible to prove\nintent, that a plaintiff couldn't have statistics alone as\ntheir prima facie case, but it would be about intent, and\nthe employer would be responding about its own intent. It\nwouldn't be responding about as the employer does in Title\nVII cases, about -- now, we not only had a good motive.\nHere's the proof that we were right about what we were\ntrying to predict, because that is what the rebuttal\nburden in a Title VII dispute.\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nQUESTION: I understand that. But it seems to\nme that it would be perfectly reasonable if you treat\ndisparate treatment as prima facie -- I mean a disparate\nimpact as prima facie evidence of a wrongful intent. But\nI'm not sure that it would not also be an appropriate\nresponse even if disparate treatment was sufficient\nregardless of the actual intent. It makes good sense for\nCongress to put this defense in any way. I'm not sure you\nhave --\nMR. NAGER: I'm not sure I understood the\nquestion.\nQUESTION: Assume your opponent is right. That\ndisparate impact, which is totally innocent in terms of\nany malicious intent creates a prima facie case. Would it\nnot nevertheless be sensible for Congress to say yes, all\nthat is true, but if you have the right kind of good\nmotive described in this paragraph, that shall\nnevertheless be a defense?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I think that would make good\nsense, but I think that Congress was advised by the\nsecretary of labor that we are going to see correlations\nbetween age and neutral selection criteria all the time,\nand I don't think that Congress had in mind that\nforeseeable adverse impacts, not done because of but in\nspite of, should be a common basis for a prima facie case,\nwhether it be called disparate treatment or disparate\nimpact.\nQUESTION: May I understand better than I have\nfrom your argument why you say it's the reasonable factor\nis not a defense? You are saying it's like the Equal Pay\nAct, which says any factor, any other factor other than\nsex. And that's always been regarded as a defense to an\nequal pay charge. You are charged with a violation of\nequal pay and you say no, it was based on any other factor\nother than sex.\nWhy isn't it, since you are using the Equal Pay\nAct to say there is no impact theory under the Equal Pay\nAct, why isn't this equally a defense, rather than as you\nsay, part of the definition?\nMR. NAGER: Well, perhaps our argument was not\nclear. We were not referring to the Equal Pay Act in the\nway that your question suggests. The only mention we made\nof the Equal Pay Act was where we made the point that the\ncourt in construing Title VII disparate impact doctrine\nhas suggested in county of Washington vs. Gunther and in\nJustice Stevens' opinion for the Court in Manhart, the\ndisparate impact claims would not be cognizable in the\nareas of pay disparities correlated with gender because\nthe Bennett amendment incorporated the effect of the Equal\nPay Act defenses into Title VII. It's our opponents who\nhave made arguments based upon Gunther that there is\nsomething different about this.\nQUESTION: I thought you were both making\narguments? I thought, maybe I'm wrong about this, that\nyour opponent was saying that this F provision is just\nlike business necessity under Title VII and you said I\nthought, no, it's as in the Equal Pay Act when, where\nthere is no impact test under the Equal Pay Act. I\nthought that was your argument. Maybe I misread you. But\nI think --\nMR. NAGER: No. That was not our argument,\nJustice Ginsburg. Our argument was that the reason, one\nof the reasons why this Court can and should rule that the\nAge Discrimination Act doesn't recognize disparate impact\nclaims and be completely consistent and respectful of\nGriggs is that the court in Title VII cases has recognized\nthat other provisions of the statute may cause Griggs to\nyield to other congressional manifestations of intent\nrequirements in specific areas.\nQUESTION: Well then, let's just take the two\nstatutes. One says reasonable factor, and the other says\nany factor, any other factor other than sex. Same kind of\nprovision. Why in one case is it a defense and the other\ncase, part of the definition of the --\nMR. NAGER: Well, I think the answer to that is\nthat the court construed the four so-called affirmative\ndefenses as affirmative defenses under the Equal Pay Act.\nThis Court in Betts recognized that when Congress wrote\n4(f), they didn't intend for all of the provisions in 4(f)\nto be affirmative defenses. Some of them were affirmative\ndefenses. This Court in Criswell held that the BFOQ was\nan affirmative defense. 4(f)(2) was held not to be an\naffirmative defense but was held to be an exemption that\nredefined the elements of a prima facie case and our\nsuggestion to the Court is since the reasonable factor\nother than age provision is not a provision in which the\nemployer is trying to justify the use of age, employer is\nsaying our decision should be held lawful because it's\nbased upon factors other than age that it's not\nappropriate to characterize that as an affirmative\ndefense, but rather --\nQUESTION: I don't follow why it isn't, you\ncouldn't make the very same argument about the Equal Pay\nAct.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I suppose if I had been\nbefore the court in 1974 arguing that case, I might have\nmade that argument.\nQUESTION: Well, that's another one we are\nstuck with it because it's stare decisis, isn't it?\nMR. NAGER: Well, no. We just recognize that\nwe have a different statute and we also have a different\ncourt. I mean, the fact that --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Nager. Mr. Crabtree,\nyou have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. CRABTREE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CRABTREE: Thank you, Your Honor. Justice\nScalia, you asked earlier why we should not construe the\ngood cause provision as just something similar to the\nreasonable factors provision.\nThe difference is the absence of the words\notherwise prohibited. The same words that did not exist\nin (f)2 when Betts was decided. Without the words\n\"otherwise prohibited\" there would be a good argument that\nthe reasonable factors defense was not a defense. But\nbecause of those two critical words, it is inescapable\nthat there has already been a violation of the act.\nSecond, Fogerty was a copyright case, not\nanother discrimination case in trying to import the\nattorneys fee provision, prevailing party fee provision in\nthat case did not make sense as it does here because the\nADEA in Title VII share a common purpose and the common\nlegislative history and the common language.\nIn Gunther, the court did not hold that there\nwas not disparate impact for a wage disparities under\nTitle VII. What the court held was that the defense was\nany other factor and that that applied or suggested that\nit might apply in a facially neutral practice. But the\ncourt also said in Gunther that the, that the Defendant,\nin proving its defense, must establish that factors were\nlegitimate and bonafide. Here, of course, we have the\nadditional word reasonable so mere legitimacy, or merely\nbeing bonafide cannot be enough.\nWhile the, as counsel conceded in mixed motive\ncases, the court's analysis is whether or not but-for, the\nbut-for analysis must be connected and whether or not the\nemployer's motives caused the employer's action is at\nissue. And again, going back to the words otherwise\nprohibited, we don't have that under the reasonable\nfactors defense for the ADEA. I have no more to offer.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Crabtree.\nMR. CRABTREE: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
