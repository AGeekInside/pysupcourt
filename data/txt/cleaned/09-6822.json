United\nStates.\nMr. Parrish.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PARRISH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHaving successfully completed drug treatment\nin prison and having come home to succeed as a college\nstudent, valued employee, and family man, Jason Pepper\npresents to this Court two questions: Whether\npost-sentencing rehabilitation is a permissible basis\nfor a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines\nat resentencing, and whether the district court judge in\nPepper's resentencing was bound by the law of the case\ndoctrine in its 5K departure ruling absent new facts,\nchanges in the controlling law, or to avoid a manifest\ninjustice.\nPost-sentencing rehabilitation has\ntraditionally been a relevant factor for judges to\nconsider and is now a permissible ground for a\nnon-guideline sentence. 3553(a) and 3661 are the\nauthorities permitting post-sentencing rehabilitation as\na consideration for variance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think\nyou -- I think you've got a difficult job navigating\nbetween your two issues. It seems on the first one, the\n40 percent to 20 percent, you're saying: Look, you've\ngot to stick with what you did before. And when it gets\nto the post-sentencing consideration, you're saying:\nWell, we can -- all bets are off; we can start -- start\nanew; we can look at things that have happened since.\nIs there a way you reconcile that -\nthose -- that tension?\nMR. PARRISH: They're like apples and\noranges. The law of the case doctrine is what you refer\nto as a matter that's left in the district court. The\nother issue of the -- whether or not the individual\nqualifies for downward variance is a completely separate\nissue. The law of the case remains with the district\ncourt judge.\nIn the other issue that we have, it's\nwhether or not he's entitled to a downward variance\nbased upon the book of remedies. So they are not, in\nfact, the same issues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law of the case -\nMR. PARRISH: And there is no tension -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law in the case is\nleft to the district court, then the district court can\nsay, well, the law of the case -- that's what that other\njudge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable\ntime, and I'm -- I appraise it differently.\nThe -- the judgment has been vacated, the\nsentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the\ncase survive? I mean, is -- the judgment is no\nlonger -\nMR. PARRISH: The law of the case survives\non a couple of basic principles. One, there has to be\nnew facts that the district court judge heard; there has\nto be a change of controlling law; and there has to be a\nreason to avoid a manifest injustice.\nIf you go back to the 5K, one departure that\nthe first judge made the decision on, that law -- that\nwas the law of the case. That percentage followed\nMr. Pepper straight through the process. That's a\ntotally separate ruling from any of the other factors in\nthis case that relate to his downward variance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a district judge say\nlater on in the process: I made a ruling earlier in the\ncase; I've since done a lot of research, and I now think\nthat that ruling was wrong?\nMR. PARRISH: Absolutely, they can do that.\nThe circumstances would be, did they see new facts? Was\nthere a change of controlling law? The reason we do\nthis is because we want to have confidence in that\ndecision to make sure litigants don't go judge shopping.\nSo that's part of the reason this law of the\ncase doctrine is in there. Even in Judge Posner's\nSeventh Circuit decision we cite in our brief, you defer\nto the first judge. But any time a judge can\nreconsider; there's no problem with that.\nBut the law of the case in the 5K departure,\nwhen the first district judge heard substantial evidence\nwith regard to the issue of cooperation, and that's what\nhe did. When the next judge heard it, she heard no new\nfacts, no change in controlling law, and absolutely\nheard no evidence with regard to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of\na fortuitous situation, then. You're sort of saying if\nyou end up with the same judge, she can reconsider her\nown prior determination. But if you, for whatever\nreason, the death of the first judge, you're in a\ndifferent judge, she's bound by what went before. That\ndoesn't seem right.\nMR. PARRISH: Well, that's an excellent\nexample -- bound by -- but you have to look at the law\nof the case and make a decision whether or not new facts\ncame in, there was a change of controlling law.\nOtherwise, you are still stuck, as law of the case, with\nthat particular information. If new facts came in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even with the original\njudge?\nMR. PARRISH: Even with the original judge.\nAbsolutely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless there are new facts\nor some -- some new -\nMR. PARRISH: New facts, a change in\ncontrolling law, or other factor. It's a basic concept,\nand that's why a lot of cases are not floating around\nabout that. Plus the government -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I'm a\nlittle confused.\nMR. PARRISH: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that the\nentire premise of Booker was that judges should have\nfull discretion under 3553 to balance the factors that\nare required by the statute to be balanced and to come\nto what they believe is the appropriate sentence.\nIf we impose, in a resentencing, in a remand\norder that has vacated a prior sentence, a limitation on\nthat power, don't we in turn do exactly what you're\narguing in your first half of your appeal, which is\nunconstitutionally tie the hands of the judge? I think\nthat was what Justice -- the Chief Justice was getting\nto in his first question.\nMR. PARRISH: That's absolutely -- that's\nwhy they are apples and oranges. If you go to the\nBooker decision with regard to Mr. Pepper -- and Mr.\nPepper's decision is under the remedial remedy that we\nare asking that you impose in this case -- Mr. Pepper's\ncase is still on direct appeal.\nAs a matter of fact, if the restrictions\nplaced upon 3742(g)(2), if they remained, Mr. Booker\nwould not have gotten the advantage of the remedial\nruling in the case. Actually, he was entitled to it as\npart of the Sixth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't a new\nsentence just that: A new sentence? And the judge,\nwhoever the judge is, can do what they're supposed to\ndo, which is to look at all of the factors and weigh\nthem as that judge believes is appropriate, assuming the\nremand order is not a limited order.\nMR. PARRISH: They can look at all of the\nfacts, if there are new facts presented. The difference\nis, in the law of the case, there were no new facts. In\nthis case, there were new facts to consider, which would\nbe part of the post-sentencing rehabilitation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -\nMR. PARRISH: In that issue, the Eighth\nCircuit rule that prohibited this was not even part of\nthe 3742(g)(2) statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but one -- one of the\nnew facts that -- that is before a judge on remand is\nthat part of the basis for his decision has been\neliminated. He -- he gave additional time because of a\ncertain factor, and the court of appeals says: Oh, no,\nyou can't look at that factor. And then he looks at the\nwhole thing. He says: Gee, without that factor this\nguy is getting off scot-free.\nYou mean he cannot -- he cannot readjust his\nother discretionary judgments in light of the fact that\nthis additional factor doesn't exist? That seems\nrather -- I don't -- counterintuitive, I guess.\nMR. PARRISH: Well -- well, Justice Scalia,\nunder the issue that's presented to the Court, if you\nmix law of the case doctrine with the 3742 problem, it\ncreates a problem in analysis. That's why they have to\nbe analyzed separately.\nA judge can look at new facts, even under\nthe remand statute, now that they are restricted to the\nfacts that were part of the first case. That's what\n3742(g)(2) does. It makes the guideline sentences\nmandatory on remand. That's the problem with it.\nIf they become mandatory on remand, the\nproblem is nobody gets the advantage of the Booker\nremedial ruling of it directly, and all sentences on\nremand are mandatory. Even in the Booker decision, you\nmake it -- which Mr. Pepper was a recipient of, because\nhis case was going on during that time -- he did not\never get the benefit of the Booker decision. When it\nwas sent back, he never did. Mr. Booker, under\n3742(g)(2), never would have gotten that advantage.\nAnd there were several other factors that\nwere coming into play where people would never get\nadvantage of the Booker ruling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you do with\n3742(g)(2)?\nMR. PARRISH: You excise it. You discussed\nit in the Booker decision. And in the Booker decision,\nyou indicated, Justice Ginsburg, that you excised two of\nthe other -- 3553(b); you also exercise -- excised\n3742(e), which made the sentences on remand mandatory.\nIn this case, 3742(g)(2)(A) and (B) were\nleft open. And what happens then, the district court\njudge has to come back. Once they look at the decision,\nthey are bound within those original facts. They can't\ngo outside of those facts to decide something different\nor to permit a variance.\nThe Eighth Circuit didn't use that rule.\nWhat we are suggesting is that you excise that rule.\nYou excise 3742(g)(2) and you excise (A) and (B) of that\nsection.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would it be consistent with\nBooker for Congress to pass a statute that says the\nfollowing? When a judge initially imposes a sentence,\nthe judge must specify all of the factors that the judge\nthinks are relevant to that sentence, whether it's going\nto be a sentence within the guidelines or a sentence\nthat's outside of the guidelines, and if there is then a\nremand, the judge may impose a sentence based on the\nfactors that were listed at the initial sentencing but\nnot based on any other factors.\nMR. PARRISH: Justice Alito, Congress could\ndo that. Unfortunately, that's not what they did in\nthis case. The 3742, which came down as part of the\nPROTECT Act -- in that case, Booker came after that.\nSo, consequently, 3742(g)(2) is problematic. It -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that exactly what\n3742(g)(2) does?\nMR. PARRISH: It does not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It says -- well, under\n3553(c), the sentencing judge is supposed to explain the\nfactors that justify the sentence that's imposed. And\nthat would -- that means explain a sentence outside of\nthe guidelines; also explain why the judge chooses a\nparticular sentence within the guidelines range.\nMR. PARRISH: Well, what -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And 3742(g)(2) says that\nwhen there's a remand, the judge may take into account\nall the factors that were mentioned the first time, but\nnot other factors.\nMR. PARRISH: Well, Justice Alito, let me\ngive you an example. What if they didn't state the\nreasons and you go up on the variance from the district\ncourt decision saying you didn't get the stated reasons?\nThe appellate court then sends that decision back, and\nthe judge is then bound by those facts. And if they\ndidn't find all of the facts, suppose again they went up\non a presumption that the guidelines were, in fact,\nreasonable. In that instance, you wouldn't get anything\nfor the judge to work from.\nAnd, absolutely, they work from facts now\nwithin the guidelines. You take the Stapleton case\nthat's in the Eighth Circuit that's cited in our brief.\nThey will increase the guidelines within the guidelines\non new facts. Yet, you can't take those same new facts\nand then use them to assist your clients under 3553 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has the Sentencing -\nMR. PARRISH: -- which goes against all of\nthe things -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the Sentencing\nCommission -- it still has that guideline that you\ncan -- you can depart -- you can lower within the\nguideline, but not beyond it?\nMR. PARRISH: Correct. You mean under the\npost-sentencing rehabilitation?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Is it -\nMR. PARRISH: They have it as a bar, a\npolicy bar, but the Kimbrough decision really indicates\nthat the courts are not supposed to use that as only one\nfactor. You're supposed to look at all of the rest of\nthe factors. And, as a matter of fact, the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the\nSentencing Commission itself is concerned, its position\nis still that postconviction behavior does not warrant a\nbelow-the-guideline sentence?\nMR. PARRISH: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -\nMR. PARRISH: And it comes right out of the\nEighth Circuit, which was not based upon empirical data,\nlike a lot of these other issues are based on that they\ncreate as policy matters. But, under Kimbrough, you\nsaid policy matters are only one consideration; you\nmust, in fact, look at all the other factors.\nYou also said it in Rita, too. You're not\nbound by just one of the factors. The court has to look\nat everything in order to be able to make a decision to\nbe consistent with all of the other decisions that\nyou've written in this area.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that Mr. Pepper had\nan identical twin, and suppose that Mr. Pepper and his\ntwin engaged in the same criminal conduct. They're\ncharged with the same offenses; they're tried together;\nthey're convicted of exactly the same offenses; they're\nsentenced on the same day.\nBetween sentencing and the time of the\nappeal, they -- they rehabilitate themselves in exactly\nthe same way. The twin's sentence is affirmed on\nappeal, and Pepper's sentence is overturned and he is -\nhe gets a remand for a new sentence.\nWhy is it justified for Mr. Pepper to get\ncredit for post-sentencing rehabilitation, but his twin\ndoes not?\nMR. PARRISH: Well, in that instance, the\nquestion is the guidelines accept the fact of some\ndisparity, and there's what's called \"warranted\ndisparity.\" Mr. Pepper did exactly everything that we\nwant a person convicted of a crime to do. He exceeded\nit. And in that instance, if his case comes back down,\nit doesn't fall on any concept of unwarranted disparity.\nThere is a difference. There's a difference with every\nindividual who faces -\nJUSTICE ALITO: His twin -- his twin did\neverything that was expected of him, too, but he doesn't\nget any credit for the rehabilitation. He just gets\ngood time credit for good conduct while he's\nincarcerated.\nMR. PARRISH: But our guidelines and our\nlaws make situations where people who are unique and\nwho, in fact, exceed don't fall into a separate category\nof being unwarranted disparity.\nThe -- the emphasis is on \"unwarranted.\"\nThere is some disparity, and if a person is unique and\nthat person does, in fact, under 3353 factors, meet all\nof the things that require us to look at a person as an\nindividual, that's what we want in our society. And\nthat's what your cases -- 3553, 3661 -- that's what they\nindicate. You look at the person as an individual.\nAnd, true enough, some disparity will be\nthere, but it's a warranted disparity. And it's\nsomething that the court can look at, along with all of\nthe other factors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- it's\nwarranted that the one get the benefit, and it's\nunwarranted that the other does not. I mean, the\ndeparture in the case of the one who gets\nreconsideration is warranted, but that doesn't mean that\nthe disparity is warranted.\nMR. PARRISH: Well, it would be on a\nvariance and, as you know, under the Gall decision,\nChief Justice Roberts, you can look at all of the other\nfactors. Under the departure theory, it's a little bit\ndifferent. They're little bit narrower, given it's more\nrestrictive, and there's other factors that come into\nplay.\nUnder the variance theory, you have to look\nat the entire individual. So if that individual can\ndemonstrate that they have made improvements -- not just\ngone to drug classes but completed them successfully;\nnot just worked as an employee but also excelled and got\non a management track after conviction; not just went to\ncollege but got on the dean's list and made straight A's\n-- those are the factors that we want these individuals\nto have.\nAnd that's why 3553(a) allows us that\nlatitude, and 3661, which has a long history based upon\nno limitation being placed upon the district court\njudge -- these are the things we want these people to\nhave.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a guideline that\nsays that there cannot be a departure for rehabilitation\nafter an initial sentencing that's set aside?\nMR. PARRISH: It's not a guideline. There's\na policy out of the Eighth Circuit -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. So there's no\nguideline. So as far as the answer to Justice\nGinsburg -- what I thought was her question, that is -\nthe guidelines initially said that the Commission has\nthe power to limit departures -\nMR. PARRISH: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but it doesn't do it,\nexcept for race and gender -\nMR. PARRISH: And age and factors like -\nthat's absolutely right, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and age. That's right.\nSo under the guidelines, a judge can depart for any\nreason except those few forbidden things, which I think\nare properly forbidden.\nMR. PARRISH: And that's the gram thing -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. And -\nMR. PARRISH: -- the statutory -- the\ndeparture from -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and that's still the\nlaw. That's still the law.\nMR. PARRISH: Correct. That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so it's -- it's the\ncircuits that have made this thing up.\nMR. PARRISH: The Eighth Circuit created it\nout of whole cloth following the Sims case. It was a\npolicy that was actually adopted by the guidelines in\nthe year 2000. Prior to that, there were about eight\ncircuits that allowed post-sentencing rehabilitation.\nNow, even under the new analysis, there are about six\ncircuits that allow it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what would the source\nof law be to make up such a thing? I mean, what is the\nsource -\nMR. PARRISH: No source of law -- it's a\npolicy -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What law gives the right to\nthe -- to -- a -- a circuit, to make that up, would have\nto say it was an unreasonable thing to do.\nNow, I guess you could have an argument\neither way on that, but it doesn't strike me off the bat\nas unreasonable, where a person has rehabilitated\nhimself, to take that into account.\nMR. PARRISH: I would agree with you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And we would have the power\nto say that.\nMR. PARRISH: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about 3742(g)(2)?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wasn't going to bring\nthat up.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what we're arguing\nabout.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No -\nMR. PARRISH: It is what we're arguing\nabout, not about the policy, because they didn't even\nuse that, Justice Scalia, in making their decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may want to -\nMR. PARRISH: I would like to reserve my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reserve time.\nThank you, counsel.\nMR. PARRISH: Thank you so much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McLeese.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. McLEESE, III,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McLEESE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is no valid basis to categorically bar\nvariances under the -- variances from the guidelines\nbased on post-sentencing rehabilitation. That's true\nfor four primary reasons.\nFirst, it's undisputed that post-sentencing\nrehabilitation is logically irrelevant to statutory\nsentencing factors in 3553(a), including the need for\ndeterrents and the need to protect the safety of the\ncommunity.\nSecond, the guidelines themselves authorize\nconsideration of presentencing rehabilitation to a\nlimited extent, because it's permissible under the\nguidelines to consider presentencing rehabilitation in\nselecting a sentence with inside the guideline range.\nWhat the guidelines do prohibit, and there\nis a provision in the guidelines that does prohibit,\nthe -- a departure from the guidelines based on\npost-sentencing rehabilitation. The guidelines prohibit\nthat, but the judgment of the Commission about how much\nweight that factor can be given after Booker in an\nadvisory guideline regime is advisory rather than\nmandatory.\nThird -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Which guideline?\nWhat guideline prohibits that?\nMR. McLEESE: 5K2.19.\nAnd, third, contrary to the suggestion of\namicus, there is no general principle in our law that at\na resentencing, new information may not be considered.\nTo the contrary, the consistent assumption of the law is\nthat at a resentencing, you take the defendant as you\nfind him as of the time of resentencing. That's clear\nfrom this Court's decisions in Pearce and in Wasman.\nIt's clear from the large body of cases from the lower\ncourts cited in Petitioner's brief at pages 42 through\n44. That's the way the guidelines operate. So there is\nno general principle that you cannot consider new\ninformation.\nNow, it's true, as Justice Alito's question\nsuggested earlier, that that can result in differences\nof opportunity, where one defendant will have an\nopportunity for a resentence and new information will be\nconsidered as to that defendant; a similarly situated\ndefendant will not get a resentencing.\nBut that opportunity is sometimes referred\nto as \"luck.\" First, it can be good luck or bad luck.\nAnd to take the example Justice Alito gave of two twins,\nif you have an example of two defendants who are twins\nwho are each convicted of an offense -- let's say\nburglary -- and they are given very lenient sentences,\nand because the judge looks at their record at the time\nand determines that they are sympathetic. They are\ndon't have a prior criminal record.\nOne of them's conviction, you know, has no\nclaims of legal error relative to his conviction; he\ngets no resentencing. The other gets a resentencing.\nBy the time of resentencing, it has become clear that\nthat defendant had previously committed several murders,\nand he has, you know, murdered -- has also committed a\nsubsequent murder.\nThere is no question that, at that\nresentencing, that information would be considered.\nThere is no question there would be a disparity, and it\nwould be true even if, let's say, those earlier murders\nhad been committed by both of the twins together.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't there a\ndifference between evidence that -- evidence of conduct\nthat occurred prior to the initial sentencing but wasn't\nknown at the time of the initial sentencing, and\nevidence of conduct that occurs between the initial\nsentencing and the resentencing?\nMR. McLEESE: There could be, but, again -\nmaybe going too far with the example of the two twins,\nif the two twins, while they were serving -- let's say\nthey got lenient sentences but not probation. While\nthey were serving in jail together, they murdered a\ncorrectional officer. If one of the defendants does not\nget a resentencing, if one of those twins does not,\nthere will be no opportunity for that to be taken into\naccount.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what's your -\nMR. MCLEESE: With respect to the other who\ngets a resentencing -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it's all or nothing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it works both ways,\nthat the defendant doesn't get the credit for good\nconduct between sentencing and resentencing but also\ndoesn't get punished at resentencing for unproven\nconduct that occurs between the first sentence and the\nnext -- and the second sentence.\nMR. McLEESE: That's a possible rule of law,\nbut my point was that's not the rule of law we've ever\nhad. That's not the -- and I should say, nor is it the\nrule of law that's created by 3742(g)(2), because\n3742(g)(2) is not a rule about consideration of new\nevidence. It's an anti-departure provision. It permits\nconsideration of new evidence, and it permits these\nkinds of -- if you -- disparities, whether warranted or\nnot, because it permits consideration of new evidence in\ndetermining the guidelines range, new evidence about\nloss amounts or -- or whatever. It permits\nconsideration of new evidence as it might relate to\nupward adjustments or downward adjustments, as it might\nrelate to criminal history. What it forbids is new\nvariances or departures.\nSo 3742(g)(2) does not implement some\ngeneral policy with respect to new evidence, nor, should\nI say, to the guidelines, because as I said, the\nguidelines permit consideration of post-sentence\nrehabilitation in setting a guideline range. They\nreflect a judgment not about the disparities always\ntrumping other considerations, including accuracy in\nsentencing, but only how much weight that those\ndisparities -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that your fourth point?\nI'm all on pins and needles waiting for your fourth\npoint.\nMR. McLEESE: No. Apologies. The fourth\npoint is simply that 3742(g)(2), if valid, would\nforeclose consideration of post-sentencing\nrehabilitation, but after Booker it is not valid, and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If Congress reenacted\n3742(g)(2) tomorrow, would it be valid?\nMR. McLEESE: It would be invalid. It would\nbe invalid because it would be -- as applied in certain\ncircumstances, it would unconstitutionally constrain the\nauthority of judges at resentencings -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. McLEESE: -- and also be inconsistent\nwith Booker.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because the -- look,\nthe -- that is not this case. This case, they never had\na chance to consider whether Booker applies or not, so\nthis is, I think, a special case.\nBut think of 3742(g) in general. It's\npretty easy to read that section as applied to instances\nwhere a judge, the initial sentencing judge, has decided\non his own volition to apply the guidelines rather than\nnot to apply them.\nNow, in such a case, he sentences the\nindividual. There's then an appeal, and the appeal he's\nreversed on. What in the Constitution says there has to\nbe a second chance to decide whether the guidelines or\nsomething else should apply? What in Apprendi says\nthat? What in any of these cases says that?\nThis is an Apprendi problem. As you know,\nI've dissented throughout; I think this is bad policy,\nbut -- I've disagreed with everything, but forget that\nfact, important though it is.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the thing that's\nworrying me about -- and I don't think -- I agree with\nyou on policy, but what I'm -- what I'm having trouble\nwith is: Is it better under the law to say yes, we can\ninterpret 3742(g) so it can be constitutional, and then\nif in some cases it violates Apprendi, let the court say\nthat in this case it violates Apprendi.\nBut it just isn't clear to me, which is why\nI left it alone the first time. It's not clear. So -\nso -- as to when it is, when it isn't constitutional.\nYou got my whole question there?\nMR. McLEESE: I do, and to take it -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'd appreciate as much\nanswer as you can give me.\nMR. McLEESE: To take an example that's in\nthe briefs, if at an original sentencing a judge\ndetermines the guideline range and ends up calculating\nit to be relatively low -- 57 to 73 months, which\nprobably aren't even exact numbers -- and determines\nthat that's an appropriate sentence, and although the\ndefendant is urging various factors as a basis for\ndownward -- for variance from the guidelines, the judge\ndetermines that there is no reason to vary because this\nis a sentence that seems reasonable.\nSo that, although those reasons might well\nbe persuasive in some contexts, they aren't given the\nrange down. The government takes an appeal and argues\nto the court of appeals: In fact, the judge was wrong;\nthe guideline range is much higher. And so on remand at\nthe resentencing, the judge makes some factual\ndeterminations, not found by the jury or admitted by the\ndefendant, which increase the guideline range under the\nnew advice from the court of appeals to a guideline\nrange of 121 to 151 months. And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think that violates\nApprendi?\nMR. McLEESE: Well, if the judge then says:\nI would like to vary from the guidelines; I am locked in\nunder the guidelines to a 121-month sentence, and I\nhave -- I didn't -- it's true I didn't vary before on\nthese grounds, but that's because the sentence didn't -\ndidn't warrant -- because of its relative lack of\nseverity, did not warrant a variance, I think that\nthe -- the logic of Apprendi and Booker would foreclose\nconstraining resentencings in that way.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm -\nMR. MCLEESE: And I think that's an\nanswer -- if I just -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. MCLEESE: I think that's an answer to\nthe question that you had asked earlier, which is, I\nthink, if Congress enacted a statute which categorically\nsaid that whatever happens at the original sentencing,\nthe judge has to list any reason that the judge is\nrelying on for a downward variance or departure, and\nthen cabins the judge on remand, that in certain\ncontexts that would be inconsistent with this Court's\nline of cases from Apprendi through Booker.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, under 3553(c), the\ncourt is supposed to explain the reasons for the\nsentence, even if it's within the guidelines; isn't that\nright?\nMR. McLEESE: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And so if the court is\ndeciding whether the sentence should be 57 months or\n63 months, whatever the figures were that you gave, and\nthe court thinks that some factor -- let's say age -- is\nsignificant, the court should say: I'm sentencing the\ndefendant to 57 as opposed to 63 because of the\ndefendant's advanced age or young age or whatever it is.\nNow, on appeal, the -- the court of appeals\nsays the guidelines sentence was improperly calculated;\nit should be -- the real range is 120 to 125 months.\nRemand. Now if the court wants to grant a departure or\na variance based on age, the court has mentioned age\npreviously as a relevant factor, and it can do that.\nBut if age wasn't -- if age was not relevant to the\ndetermination of where within the guidelines this\nsentence should be set, why is it -- why does the\nConstitution require that age be a relevant factor, a\nfactor that's open to the judge on resentencing?\nMR. McLEESE: Well -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's just a notice\nprovision. It's not -- it's not something that\nsubstantively limits what the court can do.\nMR. McLEESE: To clarify, a judge is\nrequired to state in open court orally the reasons for a\nsentence inside the guideline range, only if the range\nis sufficiently large, and the written statement of\nreasons is not -- the reasons for selecting a sentence\nwithin the guideline range are not required to be in the\nwritten statements of reasons. The written statement of\nreasons relates only to grounds outside the -- the\nguidelines. And to -- from a practical perspective, it\nwould be extremely difficult to expect sentencing judges\nto list every conditionally or contingently relevant\nfact, depending on whatever sentence ultimately comes\nback on remand, that might be relevant to a reason to\ndepart from a range that the judge is not contemplating\nat the time of the sentencing.\nBut I should say also that it -- the answer\nto this question, of whether Congress could reenact\n3742(g)(2) after Booker, and it would be constitutional\nor not constitutional as applied in certain settings, is\nnot essential to our point, because the appeal\nprovisions that were excised in Booker were not\ndetermined by the Court -- they were not excised because\nthe Court determined they would be independently\nunconstitutional.\nThe -- the remedial component of the Booker\nopinion was focused on the question of, having found a\nconstitutional violation, what then do we do to remedy\nit? And what the Court said was the way we will remedy\nthis is that we will make the guidelines advisory rather\nthan mandatory.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer to this case is,\nI don't think, too hard. You say it's at least\nquestionable enough, 42(g) you could say, at least\nquestionable enough that it's the same box as the ones\nthat were excised.\nMR .McLEESE: And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then there has not been\nfocus in the district court on what the district court\nwould want to do, assuming he is free to apply the\nguidelines or not, on the remand decision that that\njudge has never made.\nMR. McLEESE: Yes, and to elaborate on\nthat -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. McLEESE: Just -- just by its terms,\nsection 3742(g)(2) is inconsistent with the remedial\nrule announced in Booker, which was that the guidelines\nwould be advisory rather than mandatory -\nJUSTICE BREYER: They didn't say -- forget\nthat argument. What I was about -\nMR. McLEESE: But more specifically -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I do have another point I'd\nlike to get out, as long as I have this opportunity. It\nseems to me there's a considerable confusion, perhaps,\nonly from my point of view, but this word \"variance\" --\nI mean, why is it felt necessary to use the word\n\"variance\"? If it's true -- and it's not totally true,\nbut if it's true the judge -- you can apply the\nguideline, apply it. Now, the guidelines themselves\ngives you the right to depart in every single case but,\nfor example, a handful of factors such as race, where\nyou really shouldn't change the thing just because of\nrace. So what is the need for the variance?\nNow, maybe this 5K9-point whatever that\nis -- maybe there are a handful where there is a need,\nand maybe this is an example of it. But are there a\nlot, many, what -- can you just talk a little bit about\nit?\nMR. McLEESE: It's -- two points with\nrespect to that, one of which is this is a provision\nwhere the -- the Commission has specifically said it is\nnot lawful to depart on this basis, though it is\npermissible, again, to sentence within the range -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's just a policy\nstatement. Does it enjoy the same status of law?\nMR. McLEESE: Correct. Yes, they are\ntreated -- in the era when the guidelines were treated\nas mandatory, they were treated as binding in their\nturn. There are other guidelines provisions about\ndepartures which either foreclose other bases or which\nwill say they are not usually or ordinarily a basis for\ndeparture.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I get it.\nMR. McLEESE: And so, there still is\nlitigation in a post-mandatory guideline system about\nwhether it's a correct application of the guidelines to\ndepart on this basis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, perhaps\nbefore your time is up, you'd like to address the first\nquestion.\nMR. McLEESE: Yes. With respect to the law\nof the case issue, as it has been framed by the -\nthe -- the briefs by Petitioner on the merits in this\nCourt, it is an extremely narrow issue; and that is,\ntaking as a given that the Eighth Circuit had authority\nto order de novo resentencing and that, in fact, it did\norder de novo resentencing, was, at that resentencing,\nthe district court -- the resentencing district court\njudge bound by the earlier judge's discretionary\ndetermination that the substantial assistance provided\nby defendant Pepper justified a 40 percent reduction?\nAnd to ask that question is almost to answer it in the\nsense that the phrase \"de novo\" means anew or afresh.\nAnd the point -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it has\nnothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with\nthe issue at all? I'm thinking in -- the analogy in the\ncivil context, so you have two totally unrelated issues.\nIf you appeal issue B and that's what the fight is\nabout, and you reverse and send it back, it would at\nleast be unusual for judge to say, oh, and by the way,\nI'm coming out the other way on issue A.\nMR. McLEESE: And that's true in the civil\nsetting. Courts have taken the view that sentencing is\ndifferent because sentencing is a relatively discrete\nproceeding where there are a number of interconnected\ndeterminations, a lot of them discretionary based on the\njudge's assessment, a lot of them conditionally relevant\nto each other.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But these are not\ninterconnected, are they?\nMR. McLEESE: Well, the amount of\nsubstantial assistance that is given in a particular\ncase can easily be interconnected to antecedent\ndeterminations, including what the guidelines level is,\nbecause judges are often -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is that\nthe level of assistance is not in any way connected to\nthe post-sentencing conduct.\nMR. McLEESE: No, these two issues are not\ninterrelated, but I'm explaining the reason for the\ndoctrine in the -- in the sentencing setting. The\ngreater willingness of courts of appeals to order de\nnovo resentencing and say even though the particular\nissue on appeal doesn't directly open up the other\nissues that may have been determined at sentencing,\njudges in the -- courts of appeals in the sentencing\ncontext all agree they have authority to order de novo\nresentencing where they think it's appropriate. And\nthey tend to think it's more appropriate in the\nsentencing context than generally, because, as I said -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but why -- why\ndoes that matter when you're talking about two totally\nunrelated issues?\nMR. McLEESE: Because also -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no reason to\nsuppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to\nbe -- or any issue with respect to the question A when\nthey focus solely on question B.\nMR. McLEESE: I agree. But, again, when the\ncourt of appeals orders de novo resentencing, that\ndoesn't open up only substantial assistance. The point\nis the judge is going to go through and make, as of the\ntime of the resentencing, determinations on the\nsituation as it exists at that time. So, it is possible\nand not at all unusual that issues that were not up in\nthe court of appeals will come up on resentencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're worried\nabout the general rule, but you agree that none of those\narguments make any sense in this case.\nMR. McLEESE: I -- I agree that it would\nhave been permissible for the court of appeals here to\nchoose not direct a de novo resentencing. That would\nhave been a permissible way to resolve the issue as\nwell -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would not\ninterfere with the new judge's or the judge's discretion\nacross the board?\nMR. McLEESE: I -- I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have never had to\nsentence someone, but it seems to me, particularly when\nyou have a change in the judges, there's a very personal\ninvestment in what you do with the -- the defendant, and\nto say that, well, another judge looked at this factor\nso your hands are tied in that respect is -- is a\nquestionable result.\nMR. McLEESE: I agree. And I should say\nthat the issues that we're discussing are interesting\nones, but they are not in the law of the case issue\nthat's being presented here, because, in fact, the\nEighth Circuit did order de novo resentencing. The\ndefendant has never challenged the validity of their\nordering de novo resentencing. So the only issue is,\nwhat does it mean for the law of the case doctrine when\nde novo resentencing is ordered?\nAnd on that question, it's very clear. In\nfact, not just the Eighth Circuit but every court of\nappeals that we're aware of to resolve that question has\nsaid that, as the name suggests, when the circuit\nchooses, for whatever reasons, to order de novo\nresentencing, the -- the judge at the resentencing is\nnot bound by earlier determinations of the district\ncourt judge. And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there reason to\nsuppose when they say de novo resentencing, they're\ntalking about the mistake that was made with respect to\nissue B and not issue A?\nMR. McLEESE: No, there's no reason to\nsuppose that. But what there is reason to suppose -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they -- is it\ntheir practice in some cases to say we're sending this\nback for de novo sentencing but only with respect to the\nissue that we addressed? Or do they just normally throw\nit out and say start over, without any supposition that\nthe district court would take a look again at something\nthat wasn't before the court of appeals at all?\nMR. McLEESE: Different circuits approach\nthat somewhat differently, but all circuits have -\nunderstand that they have authority to make\nindividualized case determinations and they do. There\nare cases where -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they -- are\nyou aware of any case where the Eighth Circuit has said\nwe're sending this back for resentencing but only on the\nissue that we addressed on appeal?\nMR. McLEESE: Yes. And the Eighth Circuit's\nopinions make clear that -- although they apply sort of\na default presumption that there will be de novo\nresentencing, they make clear that they have authority\nto order limited resentencings. And they do that where\nin a particular case they think that's more efficient or\nmore appropriate.\nThey explained in this case, by the way,\nwith respect to the suggestion you made earlier,\nMr. Chief Justice, that part of the reason they thought\nde novo resentencing was appropriate here is because\nthey were reassigning the matter to a different judge,\nand, therefore, I think for some of the reasons that you\nwere suggesting, they felt de novo review was\nappropriate.\nBut, again, on the narrow law of the case\nissue that is presented, there is no disagreement among\nthe courts of appeals, and as the name suggests, if\nthere is a de novo resentencing, the matter is de novo.\nIf I could, for just a moment, turn back to\nthe post-sentence rehabilitation issue to make one last\npoint, which is, going one level deeper into the Booker\nremedy analysis, again, even if there were some -\nexcuse me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMR. McLEESE: All I was going to say is that\nin excising the appeal provisions that were excised in\nBooker, the Court identified four reasons why those\nshould be excised, and each one of them applies equally\nor more so with respect to the provision at issue here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Ciongoli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. CIONGOLI\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW\nMR. CIONGOLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress enacted 3742(g) for the purpose of\nstopping district courts from evading the mandate of the\ncourt of appeals on remanded sentencing cases by relying\non grounds that they did not consider at the original\nsentencing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And as far as you're\nconcerned, Justice Alito's question about post- -\npost-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered\nby a court, either?\nMR. CIONGOLI: I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because it wasn't a\nfactor mentioned in the original sentence, so you would\napply the rule equally to -\nMR. CIONGOLI: I -- I would, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any logic to\nthat? I mean, I know that when I was a district court\njudge, routinely post-sentencing criminal conduct would\nmake me wonder whether this person really was worthy of\na lower sentence or not, or of whatever largesse I may\nhave given him or her in original sentence. What makes\nsense about that?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Well, I think one thing that\nwould make sense of it is there's a different mechanism.\nThere's an opportunity for that to be reflected in a -\nin a separate criminal prosecution and a -- and a\nsentencing for that conduct. When -- when the\nsentencing guidelines were created and when 3742(g) was\npassed, all of this was done against the backdrop of a\nsense that the sentencing guidelines were to focus on\navoiding unwarranted disparities, but as the Court\nobserved in Booker, sentencing -- similar -- similar\nsentences for similar crimes conducted in similar ways.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- when this provision\nwas passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the\nsituations where district court judges' hands -- were on\nappeal told you can't use this ground for departure, and\noften the court, because they thought the original\nsentence they gave was fair, would then articulate\nanother ground for departure that they hadn't earlier.\nBut didn't all of that go out of the window with Booker?\nI mean, the presumption in -- that drove Congress was\nthat the guidelines were mandatory. Once Booker said\nthey weren't, why should we be limiting Congress -- a\njudge's discretion ab initio or post hoc to giving what\nthey believe is a reasonable sentence?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Justice Sotomayor, I think\nthat the purpose of 3742(g) is to limit the ability of a\ndistrict court to evade the mandate on remand in\nsentencing. And I think that purpose was valid before\nBooker; I think it's actually even more important after\nBooker if you're going, for example, to have meaningful\nopportunities for the government to appeal. If a\ndistrict court can impose a sentence that the court of\nappeals then finds substantively unreasonable, and -\nand on remand the district court can then consider\ngrounds that didn't exist at the time of the original\nsentencing and, in fact, couldn't have been considered\nby the court of appeals because the evidence didn't\nexist at the time the court of appeals reviewed it and\nis, in this case, uniquely in the hands of the defendant\nto create, then you're going to create essentially a\nprocedural merry-go-round where a district court will\nimpose a 24-month sentence, the government will appeal,\nthe court of appeals will think that's substantively\nunreasonable. It will be remanded to the district court\nwho will say: Well, in the interim this person has\nrehabilitated them self, they've gotten a job and\nthey've gone to school. The government -- imposing\nanother 24-month sentence. These are not related to the\nfacts of the case, but this is a different hypothetical.\nThe government will then appeal again and\nsay: This is ridiculous. The underlying conduct is\nextremely severe; 24 months is substantively\nunreasonable. And they'll appeal to the court of\nappeals.\nThe court of appeals will say: We agree\nit's substantively unreasonable; we're going to remand\nfor resentencing.\nAnd the district court will say: Well, not\nonly has he gone to school and not only does he have a\njob, but he's gotten married, and he has been promoted,\nand he has been named employee of the year. So I'm\nimposing a 24-month sentence again.\nAnd at some point, the district -- the\ngovernment is going to say: I give up, because I could\nkeep appealing, but what's the point? It appears -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there are two\nexplanations for your hypothetical. One is there has\nbeen a real change that affects the judge.\nThe other is where you -- where you began, I\nthought you were going, where the judge is evading the\ncourt of appeals. Those are two different things. I\nmean, one may happen, and one may not.\nMR. CIONGOLI: That -- that's right,\nJustice Kennedy, and I think that both purposes are\nserved by 3742(g). 3742(g), as both Petitioner and the\nGovernment -- serves a constitutional purpose. What\nboth the Petitioner and the Government object to is the\nway that it's drafted. It's not that Congress, they\nsay, couldn't pass this, but that they couldn't pass it\nthe way that it's passed because it makes essentially\nillegal references to the mandatory sentencing\nguidelines. That is a product of the fact that this\nstatute was drafted before Booker and didn't have the\nbenefit of knowing how Booker was going to come out.\nWhat the Court, I think, needs to decide is,\npost-Booker, how it's going to deal with statutes like\n3742(g) -- and there are others -- which stand for an\nentirely constitutional and important purpose but which\nnecessarily, because of the time they were drafted, have\nreferences to or language that assumes the existence of\na mandatory guidelines scheme.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many of those\nstatutes are left that we -- that the Court hasn't\nlooked at?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Well, I can think of at least\nthree problems that would -- that would result from the\nCourt saying that any reference to a mandatory\nguidelines scheme creates -- creates essentially a\nfacial invalidity if it's incapable of constitutional\nreview and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which are the three?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Well, first of all, 3553(a)\nmakes two references to -- to 3742(g). And so there's a\nquestion as how you would apply those if you strike\n3742(g). I think that 3553(c), to the extent that it\nrequires a written statement in the context of a\ndeparture, starts to -- starts to raise questions. And\nas Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in Booker\nitself, there's a real question as to whether 3742(f)\nhas any reason to exist after Booker.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But all those -- what you'd\ntend to do is take the parts that refer to the other\nstatute and say they don't do anything. And does that\nruin the provision it's in? The answer, I think,\nnormally ws no, it doesn't ruin it at all. It makes\nsense.\nBut this one is a tough one. I grant you\nthat this one is a tough one. And my problem of course\nis I can think of a constitutional way of applying this,\nbut it's a little far-fetched. And the far-fetched one\nmakes me think that it's unconstitutional in the\nfar-fetched nature of it, and I don't think it has a\nspillover.\nMR. CIONGOLI: But, Justice Breyer, I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see, the far-fetched\none was the one that was brought out. I mean, not\nfar-fetched. To -- to say in those circumstances that\nit is constitutional, where they're going to apply a new\nguideline and they don't have the evidence -- as much as\nI dissented in Apprendi, I think that one probably does\nviolate Apprendi.\nMR. CIONGOLI: Justice -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think I have to stick\nup for that, don't I?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Well, Justice Breyer, if\nyou're referring to the Solicitor General's hypothetical\nof a case in which they miscalculate the guidelines and\nthey don't announce their reasons otherwise, I actually\nthink that there's a way to avoid the problem in that,\ndepending on whether the case arises before or after\nthis case. If it arises after this case, I think it\nwill be very clear to district courts that they need to\nbe very careful and thorough in articulating their\nreasons for reaching the sentence, which, particularly\nin a post-Booker world, I think is a good thing. If\nthere's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that -- I mean -\nwe right now are receiving hundreds of petitions saying\nthe court didn't sufficiently articulate its reasons.\nWe're going to change the practice of the district\ncourt. I mean, dramatically.\nMR. CIONGOLI: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think that's a good\nthing to do?\nMR. CIONGOLI: I -- I think having a\ndistrict court articulate its reasons is a good thing.\nThey are supposed to do that under -- under\ncongressional statute now, 3553(c). They're supposed to\ndo it in open court very clearly, and in certain\ncircumstances, they're supposed to do it -- they're\nsupposed to do it in writing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They can check a box. They\ncan check a box and the -- unless they're going to\ndepart. Now, the part that's not necessary -- you could\ndeal with later, but the part that's confusing me is\nwhere this word \"variance\" comes into, because I think\nthe word \"departure\" would normally -- normally -- cover\nthe matter. And then when it gets to the court of\nappeals, the court of appeals, whether they're inside\nthe guideline or outside the guideline and have\ndeparted, reviews the matter for -- you know, inside and\nhave departed or outside, those situations. It says in\nBooker the standard is to review for reasonableness.\nBut where does this variance business come in?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Well, I think in the context\nof 3742(g), that's one of the -- the linguistic vestiges\nof the guidelines, which is that, up until Irizarry, the\nCourt itself used the terms \"variance\" and \"departure\"\ninterchangeably because a variance didn't exist prior to\nBooker.\nI don't -- the Court obviously spoke to the\nquestion of whether or not it was going to equate a\nvariance and a departure in the context of rule 32(h) in\nIrizarry. I don't think actually that that distinction\nwas essential to the holding in Irizarry, and I think\ncould be limited there. I think, particularly where the\ncourt is trying to avoid invalidating a duly enacted\nstatute, some flexibility in terms of interpreting\ndeparture in 3742(g)(2)(B) would be warranted, and you\nwould essentially say that to the extent that a court is\nvarying or departing, that they would need to articulate\nthe reasons.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's true that -- that in\nall of the briefing in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned\nby any party.\nMR. CIONGOLI: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't a question\nof the Court overlooking it. The Court didn't say\nanything one way or the other about it because it wasn't\npresented as one of the statutes that would have to be\noverruled.\nMR. CIONGOLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat obviously the Court is dealing very clearly with\nthe constitutionality of it now. And I think that\nCongress had very good reasons for enacting it that\ncontinue to be valid. It's capable of constitutional\napplication, I think, in the mine run of cases and, in\nparticular, in this case. There's no Sixth Amendment\nallegation in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the problem, to be very\nspecific, is I think the following: The first\nsentencing, the judge applies the guideline. He says:\nThere was $300,000 stolen from the bank. I look it up\nover here and I get sentence X. On appeal, the\nappellate court says: You should have counted the\nsecurities as money taken. So it's 1,300,000. So go\nand apply guideline Y. He goes back, looks at Y -- it's\na very high number -- and thinks: Given certain\ncircumstances which make this case unusual, I want to\ndepart downward.\nNow, I would have thought that the judge's\nbehavior in that second instance would have violated\nApprendi, because that judge was either going to\nsentence even without the departure on the basis of his\nhaving taken some securities worth a million dollars\nwhich was not a fact that went to the jury. So there it\nis. Or he'd have to throw aside the guideline.\nBut this statute says you can't throw aside\nthe guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that\nwasn't previously given. So this statute is -- is\nforcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was\nnot found by a jury. I think that's the argument for\nsaying it violates Apprendi. And I -- I don't see why\nit doesn't.\nMR. CIONGOLI: Justice Breyer, I -- I think\nthat in -- in certain applications of this statute,\nthere will be problems. I -- I think that's\nunavoidable, and I think it's an unavoidable consequence\nof having been drafted before Booker. The question is\nhow the Court is going to address that. Is the Court\ngoing to read the statute flexibly? Is -- is it going\nto interpret it in a way that tries to avoid those\ncircumstances, those constitutional problems? Or does\nit ultimately determine that it's -- it's essentially\nnot capable of a saving construction.\nI think it is capable of a saving\nconstruction; I think it's capable of a saving\nconstruction in a couple of ways that avoid most of the\nproblems that have been articulated by -- by both\nPetitioner and the Government.\nThe first, which actually Petitioner points\nout in his reply brief, is in 3742(g) itself. There's\nthis language about \"except that,\" that appears to limit\nthe -- the ability of the district court to actually\nfollow the mandate of the court of appeals.\nI don't think that that can be read to limit\nthe mandate of the court of appeals, nor do I think that\nanyone is suggesting that 3742(g) changes the rule in\nHarper v. Virginia Department of -- of Taxation, the\nidea that -- that district courts obviously would have\nto give the benefit of intervening changes in -- in law\nin judicial decisions. And so Booker, which has been\nused as an example -- Booker on remand would likely have\nbeen entitled to a -- a resentencing, a resentencing\nbased on factors that the district court judge could\nhave considered at the time of the original sentencing,\nbut now in light of Booker, basically a do-over. And\nfor a -- for a small section of cases, I think that\nwould work.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How? Would -- would you\nexplain, as concisely as you can, why you think that\n(g)(2) would be unconstitutional in -- in some limited\ncategory of cases, and how that can be avoided by what\nyou call a flexible interpretation?\nMR. CIONGOLI: Justice Scalia, I think I\nsaid it would be problematic; I don't think I conceded\nthat it would be unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. CIONGOLI: I -- I think that -- I think\nthat there are some -- there are some circumstances\nwhere, by a strict read of -- of (g)(2), the court would\nbe required to apply the guidelines, a guidelines range.\nAnd the example that -- that the Solicitor General's\nOffice gave might be the best, which is where you have a\ncircumstance where the district court has imposed a\nsentence within the guidelines range, has not given any\nother reason for a variance, the sentence is at the\nbottom of the range, which may or may not indicate that\nthey thought that the -- that the sentence should be at\nthe low end; and then on a -- on a calculation, there's\na determination that the -- on appeal, there's a\ndetermination that the calculation was incorrect; and on\nremand, the district court says: I'm -- I'm bound by\nthis new calculation, and I'm giving you a mandatory\nsentence. I'm giving you -- I'm bound by the guidelines\nrange because I didn't give any other reasons. I didn't\ngive any other reasons under -- under (2)(A), and,\ntherefore, I can only give you a guideline sentence.\nAnd in those cases, the guidelines would be\nmandatory. And, under Booker, I think there's -\nthere's a question as to whether a court can -- can\nimpose a mandatory sentence in any case after Booker.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- I mean, why\nwouldn't you read that simply to have been overcome by\nthe holding of Booker, that you apply -- that every\njudge has to apply 3553 factors and decide the ultimate\nsentence on the basis of those factors? I mean, isn't\nthat what Booker said? And why wouldn't you apply that\nto -- to (2)(A) and (B) as well?\nMR. CIONGOLI: I -- I certainly think the\nCourt could take that approach, and -- and, in fact, I\nthink -- I think to the -- I think it should. I think\nthat the Court should find a way to read or construe\n3742(a) to be constitutional, because it serves an\nimportant and independent policy choice that has been\nidentified by Congress.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't it conflict\nwith 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that\na sentence should be sufficient but not greater than\nnecessary to deter criminal conduct? And the judge is\nlooking at this defendant and says -- a criminal -- to\ndeter criminal conduct and protect public against future\ncrimes: Well, this person has turned out to be a model\ncitizen, and we don't have to keep him in for a longer\ntime to protect the public against future crimes. So if\nI were to apply 3742(g)(2), I would give him a sentence\nthat is unnecessary to protect the public against future\ncrimes.\nMR. CIONGOLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nyou're pointing out that there is some tension which I\nhave admitted. I think that, again, this statute was\ndrafted at a time when there was a different set of\nassumptions, and so there -- there may be applications\nwhich create some difficulty. They create more\ndifficulty in terms of how it's applied, but they are\nnot the kinds of difficulties that I think are\ninsurmountable. And they're certainly not the kinds of\ndifficulties that support what I think is -- is a\nproposed broad solution by both Petitioner and the\nGovernment, that post-Booker, sentencing statutes which\n-- which impose a mandatory guideline sentence really in\nany applications are facially unconstitutional.\nI don't -- I don't read Booker that way. I\ndon't think the Court intended it that way. Certainly,\nthe remedial holding in Booker doesn't indicate that.\nIf it did -- if that is, in fact, what the remedial\nholding in Booker stands for, I think the -- the\nimplications are more far reaching than the Court -- the\nCourt intended.\nIf there are no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Parrish, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PARRISH: Thank you. I would like to\nfirst address the law of the case issue, and that -\ninitially, I said it was apples and oranges, and it is.\nOn two separate occasions after the 5K ruling had been\nmade by District Court Judge Bennett, it was appealed\ntwice to the Eighth Circuit. After it was appealed\ntwice to the Eighth Circuit, they had an abuse of\ndiscretion standard they could have used to resolve it.\nThey did not comment on it. They upheld it.\nThen it was sent back down. After it had\ncome up on an original writ to this Court, this Court\nvacated the Eighth Circuit opinion, sent that opinion\nback down. But the law of the case, as you said, Mr.\nChief Justice Roberts, still remained with the district\ncourt on the initial ruling. The initial ruling that\nJudge Bennett made with regard to the 5K departure was a\nseparate ruling.\nNow, the Eighth Circuit, in its own analysis\nof how you interpret its remand -- we disagree with the\nGovernment. They said they -- you look at the analysis\nof the case to determine the remand. And in that\ninstance, we believe that the remand was the analysis of\nthe case that the 5K departure remains. No new facts\ncame in, no new controlling law came into place, and\nthere was no manifest injustice. She heard no new facts\non this case.\nWe believe the Court should reverse -\nvacate the Eighth Circuit court of opinion case\nregarding post-sentencing rehabilitation, remand with\ndirections from this Court consistent with an opinion\nthat requires the court to impose a sentence that does\nnot exceed 24 months.\nAnd, Justice Ginsburg, we did mention, on\npage 33 of our brief, the 3742(g)(2) as a footnote, when\nthe case first came up. But the Eighth Circuit, as you\nall know, did not use that rule. They used an old rule\nthat was in effect from the Sims case to impose the\nsentence. It was not part of 3742(g)(2) or any other\nstatute.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Ciongoli, you have briefed and argued\nthis case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment\nbelow at the invitation of the Court and have ably\ndischarged your responsibility.\n"
