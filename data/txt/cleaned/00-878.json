Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe local telecommunication provisions of the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 introduced competition into\nlocal telephone markets. The act did so in sections 251\nand 252. Section 251 imposes the obligation to\ninterconnect, and requires incumbent carriers to enter\ninto agreements that will provide access to their\ncompetitors to those incumbents' networks.\nSection 252 prescribes procedures under which\nthose agreements, contracts, as they are, are negotiated,\narbitrated, approved, and filed, and the act stops there.\nIt does not go on to interpret -- to discuss\ninterpretation or enforcement of those agreements.\nFrom its title through its text, section 252\ndemonstrates that Congress was silent regarding\ninterpretation and enforcement. Nonetheless,\ninterpretation is not unaccounted for, because into that\nsilence, under preexisting law, stepped the States. That\npreexisting law, still good under the 1996 act, not\npreempted or repealed by it, provides that the\ninterpretation of these contracts is a State law process\nwhich has been deliberately left by Congress to State\nregulators, including State judges, who will apply State\ncontract law to those provisions.\nQUESTION: Can I ask a very preliminary, quick,\nI hope -- and I hope you'll have a conclusive answer. I\ncan't get an answer. It's a procedural matter. I take it\nyou won below.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: We --\nQUESTION: You won on the merits.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, I've always thought\nthat you appeal from a judgment, basically. The judgment\nnow under the Seventh Circuit says, you win. But what\nyou're saying is, their reason was the wrong one. We\nshould have won because there was no jurisdiction or there\nwas a Fourth Amendment bar.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And the reason they gave for our\nwinning was wrong. Well, I didn't think you could appeal\nthat kind of thing. Judges make mistakes in their\nreasoning all the time. I do, too, and if you could\nappeal from the reasoning of an opinion, as opposed to the\njudgment, we'd be here 700 days a year, so -- and I can't\nfind a case where that happened, so is that -- and I hope\nthere's a conclusive answer to what I say, because it's\nterrible if the case washes out for that reason.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I believe the\nconclusive answer is that our assertion that there was no\njurisdiction over us and that we -- if there was\njurisdiction over us and over this cause of action, we are\nasserting immunity as a claim that we can bring regardless\nof the result on the merits.\nQUESTION: And is there any precedent at all\nwhere that's ever happened before?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I cannot -- I'm\nafraid I cannot cite you to any. I believe that these\nquestions are preserved regardless of the merits. I\ncannot point you to --\nQUESTION: Does the opinion below cause you some\nkind of continuing injury?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Well, it does, Your Honor, in\nthe sense that it is going to, if it stands, result in our\ncontinuing to be brought to Federal court, in spite of the\nimmunity that we assert, and it is going to continue to\nplace these cases in Federal court even though we believe\nthat they are properly State court cases completely, and\nthat our State court should have the opportunity to review\nthese, to review all the matters that are raised, and to\nfulfill both their duty to apply State law and their\nobligation to consider whether their State law\nconstruction in any way is inconsistent with Federal law.\nQUESTION: There's a patent case in 307 U.S.\nthat says -- where the lower court ruled both on\ninfringement and on the validity of the patent, and the\nperson who sought to -- had won on one of them. This\nCourt said you could have a decision on the other point.\nThat might be of some help to you.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: I appreciate that, Your Honor,\nand I will have a look.\nQUESTION: Except, isn't it the ordinary rule\nthat when -- there may be a special consideration in that\npatent context, and maybe yours is also, but I had thought\nthat reasons that went against the judgment winner do not\nget any kind of preclusive effect, so that you would not\nbe bound by this jurisdictional holding which was against\nyou. You prevailed on the merits, you have that judgment,\nso you don't -- you're not stopped, precluded from\nrelitigating the case. In other words, the two go\ntogether. If you can't appeal it, then you're not bound\nby it. Isn't that --\nMR. BERTOCCHI: I understand, Your Honor. I\nbelieve, though, that we -- that the district courts of\nthe Seventh Circuit would consider themselves bound by the\nSeventh Circuit's decision, and we would have to go to\ncourt to litigate that, which we believe would be a\nviolation of our immunity, and in addition, we believe\nthat the jurisdiction would not be there, and by doing\nthat we would essentially be being kept out, as we have\nbeen kept out of our State courts for at least some period\nof time, and in that sense I believe that there is a\ncontinuing injury that results from this.\nQUESTION: Your injury results at least in a\nformal sense from the fact that, in order to get the\nreview which the companies sought, they made your State\nregulators defendants in a case, is that correct?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: They subjected them to -- the\nindividual commissioners to suit and made them defend\ntheir rule, yes, sir.\nQUESTION: But the essence of what they were --\nthe essence of what the companies were claiming was not\nsome kind of right asserted against the State as a\nsovereign entity or against these regulators in official\nor individual capacity. The essence of what was going on\nwas an attempt to review in effect a regulatory decision.\nWhy does that implicate immunity in the sense that we\nusually think of immunity in Eleventh Amendment issues to\nbe implicated?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I think it does so\nfor two reasons. First, if you take a look at the\ncomplaint that Ameritech filed, Ameritech asserted in its\ncomplaint that it had been injured by the actions of the\nState commissioners.\nQUESTION: Well, but that's -- anyone who loses\na case has been injured by the actions of the judge who\nmade a mistake of law, or by the regulator in a regulatory\ncase, so that in itself doesn't take it out of the usual\nattempt simply to get review of a judicial or a quasi-\njudicial decision that you say is wrong.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthe result -- the other thing that the complaint does is,\nit names the individual commissioners as defendants. It\nsubjects them to the jurisdiction of the Federal court,\nand it raises issues as to whether -- which we have argued\nat great length in all of our briefs, as to whether that\nviolates sovereign immunity.\nQUESTION: But that's a formality. It seems to\nme that by naming them the -- those who are appealing are\ndoing nothing more than saying, look, these people in\ntheir adjudicatory capacity made a mistake, we want that\nmistake reviewed, in the same sense that people work their\nway up through levels of appeal in the judicial system,\nand that certainly is not a classic example of the kind of\nimplication of State sovereignty which the immunity\ndoctrines and the Eleventh Amendment have addressed. I\nguess I'm saying, is this really a case that implicates\nEleventh Amendment immunity?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, we believe it does.\nI will admit that as things have turned out, in light of\nthe fact that the district court and the Seventh Circuit\ndid not disagree with the decision of the commission,\nthere have -- none of the parade of possible bad things\nhave happened to us. There has been no injunction entered\nagainst us. There has been no contempt proceeding. At\nthis point there might not be an award of attorney's fees,\nbut that's because of the way the case came out.\nQUESTION: Is it your position that the private\nparties could have brought the case to the district court\nwithout naming the commission?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, not in this\ninterpretation case, no. We believe we were necessary\nparties, but we believe that because we believe these are\nState actions and that we are -- and we are necessary\nparties under State law to administrative review.\nQUESTION: But does that, again, put you in any\ndifferent position from a State commission in a run-of-\nthe-mill utilities case, even within -- let's say just\nwithin the State system, to keep it simple? In some,\nmaybe all States, if there is an appeal from a rate order\nthe regulatory body can be represented by counsel and say,\nyou know, we got it right, don't reverse us, but they are\nnot regarded as parties to litigation in the classic\nsense.\nSo you could have been -- I guess what I'm\nsaying is, you could have been heard, which is one of the\nconsequences of the way they went about this procedurally,\nbut you could have been heard without being a party in the\nusual sense.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, given the fact that\nthis was a Federal court reviewing a State proceeding, we\nmight well have been able to be heard if the district\njudge had allowed us in, and again, as I indicated -- and\nI believe this is still in response to the question -- it\nhas turned out that because the district court agreed with\nus, nothing has happened to us that doesn't happen to us\nin State court when our decisions are affirmed.\nBut in State appellate proceedings from Illinois\nCommerce Commission orders, when the appellate court\ndisagrees, it enters a decree that invalidates or in some\nway amends or remands the order. That is not the type of\nrelief that is contemplated in the full range of a Federal\nequity suit in which commissioners are named as\nindividuals or even, I would submit, in a case in which\nthe State commission were named as a party.\nIn this case, Ameritech did not sue the State\ncommission, for reasons I'm not quite sure I understand,\nbut we're willing to, because we're here, assume that the\ncommissions are -- commissioners are an acceptable\nsubstitute, but even in that instance, the order is\nentered by the tribunal, by the appellate tribunal on the\nState side against -- an order is entered that simply\nsupervenes the commission's order.\nIn this instance, Ameritech filed a complaint\nasking for the Federal court to enter orders that are\nspecifically directed at the commissioners and, if they\nhad sued the commission, would have been specifically\ndirected at the commission. That is relief that we don't\nbelieve is contemplated by the statute, but we also think\nit's significantly -- it could be significantly different.\nIt hasn't turned out that way -- excuse me. It hasn't\nturned out that way in this case, because the district\ncourt and the Seventh Circuit have agreed on the merits,\nbut it could have, and that was our concern, and that is\nwhy we are here, because we don't know how it's going to\nturn out in the next case.\nYour Honors, these proceedings, interpretive of\nthe contracts as they were, did not take place under\nsection 252. That qualifier is critical to jurisdiction\nunder section (e)(6) and, indeed, limits any application\nof (e)(6). It does not make any difference -- respondents\nhave devoted a substantial amount of energy to this, but\nreally it does not make any difference if we are talking\nabout an action, a case, a determination, whatever it is\nthat the commission does still must be done under 252 in\norder for jurisdiction to attach under 252(e)(6), and in\nthat respect the text and scope of section 252 is plain.\nIt goes as far as the filing, the formation and filing of\nthe agreement --\nQUESTION: Where do we find section 252 in the\nbriefs?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, if you take a look\nat the blue brief in -- we've attached both sections 251\nand 252 as an appendix, and 252 starts at page 12a of that\nappendix.\nQUESTION: Suppose that you're in the State\ncourt and you've won, and they've sued you in the State\ncourt, and then suppose that their claim is the following,\nthe agreement as interpreted by the commission does not\nmeet the requirements of section 251, including the\nregulations prescribed in the FCC pursuant to section 251,\nand then the judge asks you this question: Counsel, where\nis the law that says it has to meet the requirements of\nsection 251, including the regulations prescribed by the\nFCC pursuant to section 251? Where is that law? What was\nthe answer?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, if we're talking\nabout an interpretation case, the answer is essentially a\ncombination of State law, which now makes compliance with\nFederal law, with the act, a requirement, and the general\nrequirement that in any case that a State court hears, it\nnot contravene Federal law. That law --\nQUESTION: It's not in 252?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: No, Your Honor, it's not, if we\nare talking about an interpretation. To read that\nlanguage into 252 is to suggest that an interpretation is\nreally a modification, and I think those things are very\ndistinct concepts of the law.\nIf it happens during an approval process, that's\ndifferent, but that would be my response. I think in the\nend the result would be the same, because the State court\nis clearly required in any case, and certainly in one of\nthese cases, to determine whether it -- its decision, its\nconstruction of the contract follows Federal law. That's\nwhat the commission did in this case, and that's what the\nIllinois appellate court would do.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that in a post\ndetermination interpretation case, that the commission\ndoesn't look to 251 and 252, it can't look there?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: It -- well, Your Honor,\ninterestingly enough, in this case it can't, because this\nwas -- the provisions that deal with reciprocal\ncompensation in this case were negotiated, and they're not\nrequired to comply with the act, but even in a case where\nthere had been an arbitration, and where there was an\nissue with respect to that, I believe that certainly the\ncommission -- certainly the court could look to Federal\nlaw and see if there was anything that didn't comply with\n251 and 252.\nQUESTION: I mean, it's just a very odd concept\nthat the State commission launches this vehicle having\nlooked at the Federal law, and then subsequent\ninterpretation doesn't involve Federal law. It's just --\nthat's just hard for me to understand.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: I think the interpretation will\ninvolve Federal law in many instances, Your Honor, but the\ninterpretation cases are going to be driven by State law,\nand this case is another good example of that.\nIn this case, the way the commission, I think,\nlooked at this case is the proper way. They construed the\ncontract first and then determined whether their\nconstruction violated any Federal law, including FCC\nrulings, and decided that it did not, so I am not at all\nsuggesting --\nQUESTION: What if they had decided that it did?\nI think that's the question. What if they had decided,\nhaving construed it, well, you know, this is really what\nit says, but boy, if we interpret it this way, it violates\nthe act? Then what do they do?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Then I think that they would\nhave to construe it differently. They would have to --\nQUESTION: How can you construe it differently?\nI mean, it says what it says.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Well, they cannot -- they are --\nQUESTION: So then they're not doing\nconstruction any more, they're doing application of\nFederal law.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: I think, Your Honor, in that\ninstance, if they wanted -- if the contract could survive,\nwhat they would do is, they would say the Federal law\nsuperseded whatever State contract principle they applied\nin construing it in the first place.\nQUESTION: Well, there isn't any Federal law of\ncontracts. There may be a lot of Federal law of\ntelecommunications, but the two could certainly be\nregarded as separate, I think.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Exactly, Your Honor. There is\nnot a law --\nQUESTION: And if they came to that conclusion,\nthat although they construe the law of contracts to have\nreading A, nonetheless reading A violates or does not\nviolate the Federal statute, do you still maintain there\nis no Federal jurisdiction to review that, neither under\nthe provision at issue in this case nor under 1331?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: We do maintain that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Even though it's no longer an\ninterpretation question? They are no longer interpreting\nthe contract. They have interpreted it, but they say,\nhaving interpreted it this way, we find that this way\nviolates Federal law, and therefore we disallow it, and\nthere's still no review of that --\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes --\nQUESTION: -- under 1331?\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me your position\non 252 and in response to your question from Justice -- is\nvery likely well-taken. I think your position is 1331 is\nharder to defend. How do you defend that?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Well, Your Honor, with respect\nto section 1331, we start our analysis back at section\n252. We believe that -- and I think that the case that\ncomes closest to describing the way this would work is the\nJackson Transit case.\nJackson Transit -- in Jackson Transit, the Court\nseemed to assume 1331 jurisdiction but went on to say, we\nhave to take a look at congressional intent to determine\nwhether those contracts which are required to be in place\nby Federal law, whether litigation over whether those\ncontracts are binding and what they mean should take place\nin Federal or State court, and we believe, again, that the\nsilence regarding interpretation in section 252 and the\nremedy provided in section 252(e)(6) suggests that that is\nthe remedy that Congress intended to be made available.\nQUESTION: But you're relying on silence\nregarding interpretation, and in the hypothesis we were\njust discussing, it was no longer an interpretive\nquestion. The State court, or the State commission had\ndecided the interpretation. Having decided it, they moved\nto another question, does this interpretation violate the\nFederal statute?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: You say they have to move to that\nsecond question, and if they do, they just override their\ninterpretation, but that's no longer an interpretive\nquestion, it seems to me, at that point, so your\ndistinguishing of section 252 doesn't --\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I -- it is no longer\nan interpretive question, but the proceeding is still an\ninterpretive proceeding. We read 252 to cover a certain\ntype of proceeding that leads to approval and ends at a\nvery particular point.\nRespondents point out that this is not the end\npoint for disputes under the contract, and that is\ncertainly likely to be true, but it is the end point for\nhow far 252 goes, and the fact that Federal issues may\ncome up afterwards does not change the fact that Congress\nin 252(e)(6) provided a very specific remedy that was\ndesigned to review matters that were decided in the\napproval process. We believe that that jurisdictional\nrestriction operates both with respect to 252(e)(6) and\nsuggests that it applies under -- that a limitation should\nbe placed on 1331 jurisdiction as well.\nQUESTION: But it suggests there's a large\nlacuna between the approval process and the interpretation\nprocess, which is -- you know, I can understand how you\ncan construe 252 that way, but I think you have to read\n252 as precluding 1331 jurisdiction, and I think that's a\nmore difficult question.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: It is more difficult, Your\nHonor, but I believe that that's what it does. We're\ntalking about --\nQUESTION: Isn't it -- isn't the difficulty\nthis, that -- I mean, we don't lightly imply a negative on\n1331 jurisdiction, and it's perfectly possible to read the\nsentence in subsection (6) as simply saying, whatever the\nState commission may do in applying these two sections\ngets Federal court review, and going no further than\nsimply to make it clear that you do get Federal court\nreview of it, in effect as a regulatory matter. If you\nread it that way, which the text certainly allows you to\ndo, 1331 stands.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I believe that to\nread it that way and then -- and to include\ninterpretation, enforcement proceedings under it would\nessentially read the words under 252 under the statute.\nCertainly there is a difference between the language, the\nword determination and the language in the actual\npreemption provision in (e)(4) that says, approvals or\nrejections, but -- and the respondents argue that that\nsuggests that determinations is a broader term.\nOur position is that it doesn't matter whether\nit's a broader term, but our -- that if it's not under\n252, it doesn't matter what kind of action it is, and\ninterpretations and enforcements are not covered by that\nstatute. It's a very particular statute that goes only so\nfar and no further.\nIn addition, it seems that that argument and the\nuse of those words is somewhat inconsistent, because the\nUnited States suggests that the more specific terms in\n(e)(4) suggest that determinations must mean anything that\nhappens in a case related to these contracts, but it seems\nto me if approvals and agreements in (e)(4) is a narrow\nterm, then approvals and agreements, which is all 252\naddresses, is -- must be read equally as a narrow term,\nand it's inconsistent to say that determinations under 252\ngoes beyond that.\nQUESTION: Well, approvals, agreements and\narbitration. You would agree that would be covered, too?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And did you say -- did I understand\nyou correctly to say that if this particular issue had\ncome up at the time of approval, then there would be\nFederal court review, so if something -- the character of\nthe issue has nothing to do with it. It's just, if it\ncomes up in one proceeding, Federal court, if it doesn't\ncome up simultaneously, the very same question doesn't\ncome up simultaneously, then you have this split.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Exactly, Your Honor. We believe\nthat that procedural difference is the basis for the\ndistinction, but we believe that that distinction is\nentirely rational is in accord with what happens in the\nlife of contracts.\nIn real life, in contracts outside the context\nof telecommunications, issues will come up in negotiation\nand maybe there'll be a contract and maybe there won't.\nIf the same issue comes up once the contract is in force\nand the parties can't reach an agreement, which they have\nthe opportunity to do in any case, then they have to go to\ncourt, someone has to go to court to get it enforced, so\nthe notion that the timing of an issue affects where it's\ngoing to be litigated is not at all surprising, and is\nentirely consistent with what we believe Congress' intent\nwas in 252.\nQUESTION: Yes, but in an ordinary private\ncontract, if the State court refuses to enforce the\ncontract, let's say on the ground that it would be a\ncontract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade\nand thus violate the Sherman Act, you would be able to get\nreview of that determination in Federal court, wouldn't\nyou?\nBut you're saying that this contract can be\noverridden and disallowed by a State court on a Federal\nground with no review of that Federal ground by any\nFederal court, so that you can have different\ninterpretations of the Sherman Act all around the country,\nwith no Federal court being able to review it.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, my belief is that if\na State court invalidated a contract on Federal grounds,\nappeal would be to the State appellate court, and the\nFederal court that would be able to review that\ndetermination if it was wrong is this Court, so there is\nalways going to be a Federal court that can determine\nthat. What -- and the --\nQUESTION: We can review it because there is a\nFederal question involved --\nMR. BERTOCCHI: If that were --\nQUESTION: -- but for purposes of 1331 there's\nno Federal question involved?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: For purposes of 1331, there may\nbe Federal issues involved, but we believe that there is a\nspecific congressional intent, reflected in the\nspecificity of 252 -- you can look at it as silence, or\nyou can look at it as specificity -- in the specificity of\n252 to have these matters litigated in State court, and\nagain I would cite Jackson Transit for the proposition\nthat whether there is an arising under question under 1331\ndoes not mean you still don't look to the question of\nwhere the contracts are litigated.\nIn that case, the contracts had to be there\nbecause of Federal law. They had to be honored because of\nFederal law, but there was a legislative intent that was\ndiscerned by this Court to have those -- the binding -- to\nhave the litigation concerning those contracts take place\nin State court.\nQUESTION: Why --\nQUESTION: Let's assume we can --\nQUESTION: Why would they?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I mean, you know in order to --\nQUESTION: That's my question, too.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm going to ask the same question.\nQUESTION: In order to win your 1331 point, you\nhave to show that Congress really wanted this\ninterpretation that you're giving of 252, right, it really\nwanted it and had a pretty good reason for it.\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What's the reason? I mean, it\ncreates a pretty big mess, doesn't it? We're going to get\ninto a new jurisprudence of what's an interpretation and\nwhat's an approval, and you're going to start splitting\nthe documents apart and it sounds to me like a mess, and I\ndon't know why -- maybe Congress wrote those words, but\nwhy would they want such a thing?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I think they would\nwant such a thing because the Telecommunications Act\nrepresents a change in the way utilities are regulated,\nand although everybody agrees that that is true, I think\nthat the respondents misapprehend the change. The change\nis to reduce regulation over the parties to\ntelecommunications transactions once access is assured.\nThe interest in this case was access, and once that's over\nwith, these are to be -- these cases are to be treated, I\nbelieve, like regular contracts cases.\nThis case, again, is a good example. It was\ndriven by State law and the Federal questions came up\nafterwards in determining whether the construction was\nproper, and in that instance I think Congress intended to\nleave the matters to State -- to the State commission\nunder State law and to State courts.\nQUESTION: No, but that still doesn't explain --\nI mean, you've still got the mess that Justice Breyer\nreferred to. Why would Congress want to legislate that\nkind of bifurcation that makes for all of this confusion?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Your Honor, I think Congress\nwould want to do it because it recognized that most of\nthese cases were going to be like this one. This is not a\ncase about access, which is --\nQUESTION: And Congress would have wanted this\nto happen?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Well, Your Honor, I think --\nthis, in the sense of State courts deciding, construing\nthese contracts and then deciding any incidental Federal\nlaw questions under their normal obligation to do so.\nYes, we think that's what they wanted, and we think that's\nwhat they wanted because they would recognize, as in this\ncase, that these cases are State-law driven.\nThe goal of the act is access. This case is not\nabout access. The respondent, the competing telecom\ncompanies had had access, they will have access, they have\nit today, and they will have it tomorrow. This case is\nabout whether Ameritech owes them money. That is a\ncontracts case. It may implicate Federal law, as any\nState contracts case theoretically could, but we believe\nthat Congress wanted them to be treated as contracts\ncases.\nI'll reserve the remainder of my time, if I may.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bertocchi.\nMs. McDowell, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nMS. McDOWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Federal district courts have subject matter\njurisdiction over cases contending that a State public\nutility commission has construed and enforced an\ninterconnection agreement in a manner contrary to Federal\nlaw. That's true whether one looks specifically at\nsection 252(e)(6) of the 1996 act, or more generally at --\nQUESTION: Well, let's look specifically at 252,\nand 252(6), where it says in any case in which a State\ncommission makes a determination under this section, and\nall the section talks about is approval.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, Your Honor, the section\nestablishes specific procedures to be followed at the\narbitration and approval stage.\nQUESTION: But it talks only about -- you agree,\ndon't you, that it -- substantively it deals only with the\napproval?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, but these\nagreements exist only by virtue of section 252. The State\ncommissioners have authority to regulate these agreements\nonly by virtue of section 252. They're subject to the\nstandards of section 252, and --\nQUESTION: But all it talks about is approval.\nI don't think you've answered my question.\nMS. McDOWELL: No, it doesn't speak specifically\nabout interpretation and enforcement.\nQUESTION: Speak specifically or any other way\nabout it.\nMS. McDOWELL: But this Court said in the\nArdestani case, for example, that under a statutory\nprovision means subject to or by authority of, and State\ncommissions are acting by authority of section 252 when\nthey're construing and enforcing interconnection\nagreements. They have no other authority under Federal\nlaw to do that.\nQUESTION: Well, Ms --\nQUESTION: Do they have authority under State\nlaw to do that? If we asked the Solicitor from\nIllinois -- I didn't have time to ask him -- what is the\nauthority by which the State commission proceeded in this\ncase, what would he have said, do you think, and would\nyou -- and is that the same as your position?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, we don't have to guess,\nbecause the State commission specifically said what\nauthority it was proceeding under, and it cited both\nsection 252 and Illinois law, and certainly a State\ncommission, whenever it takes an official act, is acting\nat least in part under its own State law --\nQUESTION: Absent --\nMS. McDOWELL: -- and here it's acting also\nacting under section 252.\nQUESTION: So you say it -- are you saying that\nnecessarily the State commission must be acting under 252?\nMS. McDOWELL: When it's regulating an\ninterconnection agreement that's established by virtue of\nsection 252, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: 252 --\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, I -- go on, Tony,\nfinish.\nQUESTION: Well, I was just going to say, 252\nrefers to public interest, convenience, and necessity. Is\nthat a Federal standard, or does that just incorporate\nState standards from State to State, or is it a little bit\nof both, because most States have a formulation something\nlike that.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, it's a Federal standard.\nIt's a standard that's been incorporated in the\ncommunications laws for many years. The States, pursuant\nto section 252(e)(3), are allowed to also impose\nconsistent State standards in the course of their\napproval, and interpretation we would say of the\ninterconnection agreements as well, but it's basically a\nFederal standard. It's one under which the FCC could\npromulgate regulations to instruct the State commissions\nand to --\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, I have a problem with\nother language in this (e)(6). One of the arguments you\nmake is that it doesn't make any sense to bifurcate these\nproceedings, that they should all be in the Federal court,\nthe interpretation as well as the approval. The problem\nis, the only thing that (e)(6) allows the Federal district\ncourt to determine is not the interpretation of the\ncontract. It does not give the Federal court authority to\ndetermine what the contract says. It only gives it\nauthority, I quote, to determine whether the agreement or\nstatement meets the requirements of section 25 and this\nsection.\nNow, in some cases, there may be a dispute\nbetween the parties as to whether a particular\ninterpretation will violate the Federal rules, but there\nare going to be a lot of other contract disputes that have\nnothing to do with whether there's a violation of the\nFederal rules. Now, are all of those contract cases going\nto go to State court, and all of the contract cases that\nsomehow involve the question of whether the agreement or\nstatement meets the requirements of this section, do they\ngo to Federal court, or do you just ignore those words,\nthat limitation? To determine whether the agreement or\nstatement meets the requirements of section 25 and this\nsection, that's the only authority the Federal court has.\nMS. McDOWELL: I agree with you, Your Honor, and\nthe --\nQUESTION: So you're still going to have some\nbifurcation? You're still going to have some contract\ncases that go to the State court, and some that go to the\nFederal court? Is that --\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, you may have bifurcation,\nor there are other alternatives. For example, at the\ninterpretation and enforcement stage the parties would be\nfree to go to State court. There's not an exclusive\ndirection of the parties to Federal court, as there is at\nthe approval stage under section (e)(4), and in some of\nthese cases State commissions may waive their sovereign\nimmunity and decide that they would rather have these\nclaims heard entirely in Federal court, and that would be\npermissible as well under the supplemental --\nQUESTION: What about under 1331? Would you say\neverything gets into court under 1331, whether it deals\nwith deciding whether the agreement meets the requirements\nof this section or not? You would say the contract is a\nFederal contract, so that under 1331 even the\ninterpretation of that contract gets into Federal court,\nwouldn't you?\nMS. McDOWELL: We're not pressing that argument,\nYour Honor, although Ameritech --\nQUESTION: Well, gee, you ought to, because\nthat's the only thing that will stop this terrible\nbifurcation that you're so worried about. It's still\ngoing to be a mess. You're going to have some cases in\nFederal court and some in State court.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, there may be some such\ncases, but as I was suggesting, there are alternatives to\nthat. In addition, there may not be that many cases in\nwhich there's a viable claim that a State commission has\ninterpreted an agreement contrary to Federal law.\nThese cases have typically come up only with\nrespect to this particular issue of compensation for\nInternet calls, a very important issue to the carriers,\nand one that they've been willing to litigate extensively,\nbut it's not clear at this early stage in the\nimplementation of the 1996 act that there are going to be\na large number of claims of this sort, so the thought that\nthere are going to be -- there's going to be a bifurcation\nproblem in every case is not clear, at least at this\nstage.\nQUESTION: I'm still not entirely clear on what\nyour position is if the -- if there's an interpretation\ndispute that doesn't raise any Federal question at all.\nDo you agree that that has to be resolved only in a State\ncourt, or do you think they have a choice of forum?\nMS. McDOWELL: Unless there was some basis for\nFederal jurisdiction, they would have to go to State court\nfor that --\nQUESTION: The only question is, do they have to\npay on Tuesday instead of Thursday, and that's governed by\nsome State common law rule or something. That, you would\nagree, could not be litigated in Federal court?\nMS. McDOWELL: We haven't yet taken a definitive\nposition on this question, Justice Stevens. Ameritech is\narguing that these contracts, interconnection agreements\nare pervasively Federal, similar to a Federal tariff, so\nthat every question that arises under them is necessarily\nFederal.\nWe think for purposes of this case, and what the\ncourt of appeals decided, what's relevant are only those\nclaims that contend that a State commission has violated\nthe 1996 act in its interpretation of an agreement, so\nthere may be a large category of cases that can come to\nState court and that would present only issues of State\nlaw.\nQUESTION: But, and could not go to Federal\ncourt. That's the other part of my question. I didn't\nquite get your answer to that.\nMS. McDOWELL: Well, yes, unless there was a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity by the State commission and\ndiversity or some other basis for jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Well, even if there's a waiver, I\nmean, what is -- you have to have Federal jurisdiction\nbefore you can sue in Federal court.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, and there may be\ndiversity. Diversity was asserted, for example, in the\nNorth Carolina case.\nQUESTION: Well, assume there's no diversity,\njust a normal State law. I'm still not quite clear\nwhether you say yes or no. Do you agree with the carrier\nthat it is a pervasive -- like a tariff, so that anything\nrelating to it raises a Federal question, or do you agree\nthat they are a category of contract issues that could\nonly be regulated at State, or litigated in State court?\nMS. McDOWELL: We see it as a difficult question\non which we haven't taken a definitive position. The\nquestion ultimately is one of Congress' intent, and\ncertainly there is much in the statute to suggest that\nCongress was creating federalized contracts. These are\nnot simply private party agreements. They are Federal\nregulatory instruments.\nOn the other hand, Congress also left room for\nStates to apply their own consistent standards under\nsection (e)(5), and Congress also expressly preserved\nexisting State and Federal law to the extent that it was\nnot expressly preempted, so it's a more difficult question\nwhether these contracts are entirely Federal, and we have\nnot take a --\nQUESTION: In all of the instances projected by\nJustice Stevens, do you think the State would be a\nnecessary party, or would there be any cases in which, a\ncontract dispute where the State isn't a necessary party?\nThe State is a necessary party because it goes first\nthrough the commission?\nMS. McDOWELL: We don't think they're necessary\nparties. We think they're valuable parties to have\nbecause it makes it easier to enforce the Federal court\nor, indeed, a State court judgment, but we think that in\nthe ordinary case --\nQUESTION: Well but doesn't -- even in the case\nJustice Stevens describes about paying Tuesday or\nThursday, isn't the presumption that there would have been\na State commission order which is now being set aside?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes, or its enforcement is being\nenjoined. Typically, though, a --\nQUESTION: And they're not a necessary party,\nthen?\nMS. McDOWELL: No. To the extent that there\nwill be two adverse parties to the proceeding, one\nchallenging the State commission's order and one defending\nit, the party defending the order can ordinarily be\nexpected adequately to represent the State commission's\ninterest.\nQUESTION: District judges aren't parties to an\nappeal from their decisions, are they?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, and certainly\nFederal statutes are often challenged in cases in which\nthe United States is not involved.\nQUESTION: But if the FCC were performing this\nrole -- take Virginia's statement -- and you are appealing\nthe FCC's order, all those cases are you against the\ncommission. Isn't it -- isn't that routine?\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct. That's the\nstandard practice in the Federal system, and when the FCC\nacts in the place of a State commission the FCC's\ndecisions will be reviewable in a proceeding in the court\nof appeals under the Hobbs Act, in which the FCC is named\nas a party. That's the standard procedure, as we\nunderstand it, and most States as well, that the agency\nissuing a decision will be a party to proceedings\nchallenging it. We don't see that as essential, though,\nin this particular context. We see no particular reason\nto think the parties will not abide by the Federal court's\ndecision, and that the State commission also will not\nabide by that.\nQUESTION: And the -- I mean, I take it the\nreason you assume that is that the commission is not a\nparty in interest in the sense of having a personal stake.\nThey have the same kind of stake, I suppose, that any\njudge does when an order of his gets appealed, but that's\ntheir only interest.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nIf I could turn briefly to the sovereign\nimmunity questions, as several courts of appeals have\nrecognized, this is a straightforward Ex parte Young case\nagainst State officials. The case is seeking prospective\ninjunctive relief to include their enforcement of orders\nthat are alleged to be contrary to Federal law. Ex parte\nYoung itself was, the underlying action was one against\nState regulatory commissioners, and there have been many\ncases in this Court that have involved Federal challenges\nto State regulatory decisions of this nature.\nWe see nothing in section 252(e)(6) or anything\nelse in the 1996 act that suggests a congressional intent\nto preclude this sort of ex parte Young --\nQUESTION: Ex parte Young, though -- I'm trying\nto recall the facts. It was decided even before I was on\nthe Court.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It was enjoining a Minnesota Attorney\nGeneral, wasn't it, from doing something in the future?\nMS. McDOWELL: From enforcing rate orders issued\nby the State commission. The specific case before the\nCourt was contempt sanctions against the Attorney General,\nbut the underlying case was also against the State\nregulatory commissioner. Also, in Ex parte Young the\nCourt cited a number of prior decisions as authority,\nincluding Reagan v. Farmer's Loan & Trust, which was\nanother similar type of action against State regulatory\ncommissioners.\nWe have --\nQUESTION: It's also -- would you correct -- as\nlong as we're on Ex parte Young, as I understand it, in Ex\nparte Young, there was no action brought until the\nexecutive branch of the State said, we're going to take\ncertain action here in accordance with this order. In\nother words, they -- Ex parte Young was not brought\nimmediately upon the issuance of the State rate order --\nMS. McDOWELL: I think it --\nQUESTION: -- as simply to review the order.\nQUESTION: It was brought because a -- somebody\nin a different branch or agency of the Government said,\noh, now we are going to take some action under that which\nis, in effect, going to hurt the person who brought the Ex\nparte Young action. Is my understanding correct?\nMS. McDOWELL: As I recall, and my understanding\nmay be inaccurate, the case was brought before any\nenforcement action had actually been threatened or taken.\nQUESTION: But the Attorney General of the State\nwas going to enforce it, isn't that right?\nMS. McDOWELL: Oh, I think the Attorney General\nwas expected to enforce it. There was a specific\nMinnesota statute, as I recall, that --\nQUESTION: He had to.\nMS. McDOWELL: -- required him to enforce the\nrate orders, but I don't think that that was critical to\nthe Court's holding. There are many, many cases,\nincluding several, in fact, against members of the\nIllinois Commerce Commission, that have involved\nchallenges under Ex parte Young to rate orders and other\nsorts of regulatory orders.\nQUESTION: Do you think it's sustainable to say\nthat there has been a waiver because -- by participation\nin the State scheme, so that you don't need Ex parte\nYoung?\nMS. McDOWELL: We've argued that as well, Your\nHonor. That's dependent on whether the statute was\nsufficiently clear to put the State commissioners on\nnotice that by exercising Federal regulatory authority\nunder the act they would thereby be subject to suit in\nFederal court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMr. Smith, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS WORLDCOM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,\nMCI WORLDCOM NETWORK SERVICES, INC., MCIMETRO ACCESS\nSERVICES LLC, AND FOCAL COMMUNICATIONS CORP.\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe complaint that Ameritech filed in this case\nin Federal court specifically alleged not only that the\nICC had misinterpreted the interconnection agreements at\nissue, but also that its order requiring payment of\nreciprocal compensation for a particular category of calls\nviolated several specific sections of the\nTelecommunications Act as well as several allegedly\napplicable FCC rulings.\nFor that reason, our position, and I'm arguing\ntoday for WorldCom and several other companies who had\nsigned interconnection agreements with Ameritech and also\nwere sued as codefendants along with the ICC, our position\nis that the complaint stated straightforward preemption\nclaims alleging ongoing violations of Federal law by State\nofficials and therefore those claims were within Federal\njurisdiction and also actionable notwithstanding the\nEleventh Amendment.\nWhere we differ with Ameritech and actually with\nthe final respondent AT&T is on the question that was\nbeing discussed earlier, which is the scope of valid\nFederal claims in enforcement cases, and specifically\nwhether a claim of mere misinterpretation of an\ninterconnection agreement raises any Federal issue or not.\nOur position is that in most cases, at least, a claim of\nmisinterpretation of an interconnection agreement would\nraise claims only under State common law contracts and\ntherefore has to be treated as a State law claim, but in\nterms of this case, since the contract -- the complaint\ndid allege violations of the statute and FCC rulings,\nthere certainly was jurisdiction, we believe.\nNow, let me turn first to the jurisdiction\nissue, and then I want to get to --\nQUESTION: Before you get into that, you're\nseparating interpretation of the contract from violation\nof the Federal law.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Does that mean the State still has\ncontrol over what the contract means? It's still a State\ncontract, and the ultimate determiner of what the contract\nmeans ought to be the State, if it's State law, right?\nMR. SMITH: Certainly it ought to be done by\nvirtue of some analysis of the intent of the parties, if\nit's a negotiated agreement. There also are agreements\nwhich are imposed through arbitration, and then the\ncommission is essentially analyzing its own intent in\nimposing --\nQUESTION: Yes, but different States have\ndifferent approaches. They may even have different rules\nof evidence and so forth. What's going -- I don't see how\nthe Federal Government gets into this business without\ntaking on itself the burden of interpreting these\ncontracts.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Congress, Your Honor, very\nspecifically turns over responsibility for developing\nthese contracts, reviewing them, to State commissions, and\nin the process of doing that says that while the State\ncommissions have to follow various substantive standards\nin 251, they also are authorized in more than one place in\nthe act to impose their own policies that are not\ninconsistent with the Federal policies, and it also said\nthe parties can negotiate agreements notwithstanding the\nsubstantive provisions of the act, and that the State\ncommission can't overturn them unless they find that they\nviolate the public interest and necessity.\nSo what you have here is a very clear\nrecognition by Congress that they want these to be real\ncontracts, not merely orders applying Federal standards,\nand that there will be lots of issues which under this\nCourt's ruling should be viewed as State law contract\nissues that will come up in the enforcement proceedings,\nso we don't see any basis under Jackson Transit and this\nCourt's other cases dealing with the development of\nFederal common law for saying that the contract\ninterpretation rules, the rules for determining how the\ncontract ought to be read, ought to be elaborated as a\nmatter of Federal common law in the Federal courts rather\nthan through analysis of State common law which already\nexists.\nNow, these cases will be sometimes in Federal\ncourt and sometimes in State court, because there will be\nsome times when there are Federal claims that are brought\nthat can sustain a motion to dismiss. I don't happen to\nthink these claims would have sustained a motion to\ndismiss, but --\nQUESTION: What if you have a case in which one\nof the arguments made by one of the parties is that if you\ninterpret the contract this way, it will violate the\nFederal act? Does that stay in the State court, or is\nthat a Federal question?\nMR. SMITH: I see that as a Federal question,\nYour Honor. I don't think there's any question about\nthat. That is essentially what Ameritech claimed here.\nThe district court and the court of appeals, of course,\nrejected that on the merits, but their claim was that this\ninterpretation was barred by the FCC's interpretation of\nthe act.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, interpretation is\nbarred? I mean, if a contract says something, it very\nplainly on its face says something that violates the\nFederal act, there's only one way to interpret it.\nMR. SMITH: Their claim was that even if that is\nwhat the parties intended, that Federal law had evolved to\nthe point where that was preempted by Congress, or by the\nFCC.\nQUESTION: I just don't understand how you play\nthat game. I mean, you're assuming that it's always\nambiguous whether you can interpret in a -- so that you\ncan interpret it in a way that violates Federal law or in\na way that doesn't, and that somehow therefore that\ninterpretation becomes a Federal question. Even if that's\ncorrect, it's certainly not always true that there is the\npossibility of interpreting it in a way that does not\nviolate Federal law, and I guess you're saying that\nnonetheless, in that case, the case becomes a Federal\ncase.\nMR. SMITH: I'm not sure I really meant to say\nthat every case becomes a Federal case. I think there are\nlots of situations in which the interpretation as done by\nthe commission is then a matter -- whether that's correct\nor not is a State law issue.\nWhat I meant to answer in response to your\nquestion was then, if a party says that interpretation of\nwhat the parties really intended has somehow brought the\ncontract into some inconsistency with applicable FCC\nregulations, that's a Federal claim. At the same time, if\nthe commission says, we think they probably intended this,\nbut we're not going to do that because we think Federal\nlaw requires us to do Y instead of X, that also raises a\nFederal question.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SMITH: But if they're merely looking at the\nintent, there will be lots of situations where there isn't\nany Federal preemption because the law, after all, says if\nyou negotiate it, the substantive provisions of 251 don't\napply. In most of those situations, you're going to have\nState law contract issues which will be then analyzed by\nthe State commission and, absent some additional Federal\nissue that comes along, the place where that would be\nappealed would be the State court, in my understanding.\nQUESTION: And it could not be appealed in the\nFederal court?\nMR. SMITH: Unless there was some odd situation\ninvolving diversity, my sense is -- my understanding is --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess the claim would be,\nlook, the very contract that you're interpreting is a\ncontract which is authorized, and authorized only by\nFederal law, and that's enough to get us into Federal\ncourt, and you reject that position.\nMR. SMITH: Our position, Your Honor, is that\nunder Jackson Transit, that the fact that the Federal\nstatute requires that a contract exists but doesn't\nspecify the terms of the contract, in that situation the\ncontract itself remains a matter of State law.\nQUESTION: Well, aren't we slightly outside of\nthat situation, because there are some Federal standards\nhere, aren't there?\nMR. SMITH: Well, actually, as to negotiated\ncontracts, the Federal standards --\nQUESTION: They can be --\nMR. SMITH: -- are very, very loose.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. SMITH: It has to either be discriminatory\nor a violation of public interest, which is -- and the\nspecific rules of 251 don't apply.\nQUESTION: Is public interest a State concept or\na Federal concept?\nMR. SMITH: I would view that as something that\nis authorizing the State commission to --\nQUESTION: It has to be State on your --\nMR. SMITH: -- to apply its -- no, obviously,\nthey can look at Federal policies if they want to, but I\nwouldn't suggest that it's inherently Federal in the way\nthat the Solicitor General does.\nNow, there are other situations that could come\nup. A contract could expressly incorporate Federal law,\nand that might or might not create a Federal claim. This\nCourt has wrestled for 100 years with the issue of when\nFederal law incorporated into State law causes of action\ndo or don't create Federal question jurisdiction.\nIn other situations, the State commission might\nhave imposed the terms of the contract in an area where\nthe parties didn't agree, and in that situation, if they\nare imposing it by virtue of their interpretation of the\nFederal regulations, and then that particular clause is\nlater interpreted in some way that deviates from the\nFederal regulations, that might well be a Federal claim as\nwell.\nQUESTION: That issue we've been wrestling with\nfor 100 years exists in one of these cases, doesn't it? I\nmean, don't one of these contracts refer to Federal law?\nMR. SMITH: Well, there have been assertions,\nYour Honor, that that's the case. My reading of these\ncontracts is that they make -- that they -- and certainly\nin this case, the Illinois case, it specifically gives a\ndefinition of when reciprocal compensation will be paid,\nand both the commission and the two lower courts all said\nthat this is not a case where there has been an\nincorporation of Federal regulations. This is a case\nwhere we can divine the actual intent of the parties, that\nthese calls should be treated as calls where this\ncompensation would be paid.\nAnd so what they said was, this is not an\nincorporation case, and I believe the contract in the\nVerizon case, to come next, is the same, that there was an\nintent at the time that was -- that the State commissions\nhave said we're going to hold you to -- even though\nFederal law may have moved on, every time it moves on they\nsay, if you agreed to something else, you're still stuck\nwith it, and that's what the courts in both of these cases\nhave said as well as the commissions.\nMaybe if I could turn, then, to the Eleventh\nAmendment issues, it is certainly our view that the five\ncircuits that have said these cases present\nstraightforward Ex parte Young cases, those circuits are\ncorrect, because they do involve, in situations where\nthere is a Federal claim being asserted against an action\nof a State commission, either an enforcement case or an\napproval case, a claim seeking an order bringing the State\ncommission into compliance with Federal law, and it is, I\nthink, an ongoing violation of Federal law, because when\nthey approve and enforce an interconnection agreement, or\nthey enforce it in some way, interpret it in some way,\nthey are then telling the parties that they have to live\nby that interpretation during the term of the agreement.\nQUESTION: You think the commission is a\nnecessary party, then?\nMR. SMITH: It's our position that they are a\nnecessary party, but to use the technical term under the\nFederal rules, if there was a reason why they can't be\nsued and that the case can't go forward, then they may not\nbe an indispensable party. The distinction is drawn in\nRule 19 between those two. Certainly, they've --\nQUESTION: If that's the case, then, it says\nwe've got an unusual action here, because we're talking\nabout parties who have no personal or even official\ninterest except as interpreters of law.\nMR. SMITH: That's true, Your Honor, but what\nmakes them a necessary party is that the private parties\nhave an interest in having the administrative body that\nhas told them to do X be bound by a ruling from the\nFederal court which they're trying to get which says don't\ndo X, do Y, and that --\nQUESTION: You're in effect saying that they\nmight dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause.\nThat's --\nMR. SMITH: And the reason why a Federal\ndistrict court is not named as a defendant in the court of\nappeals is because the court of appeals has the power in a\nunitary system to direct the district court to do\nsomething. When a Federal court, though, is --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the State court is not named\nas a party when a case gets from a State supreme court on\na Federal question here.\nMR. SMITH: Right, but I think --\nQUESTION: It's assumed that they will respect\nthe Supremacy Clause if there is a Federal declaration of\nlaw, and why shouldn't the same assumption govern if there\nis Federal review of a State order on, in effect, a\nFederal question jurisdiction basis?\nMR. SMITH: It may be factually true that most\nof the time State commissions will obey Federal courts,\nbut 100 years of jurisprudence under Ex parte Young and\nbefore all follow the Federal administrative model and say\nthat as to Federal -- State executive officials, when they\nviolate Federal law, that you name them as a defendant.\nQUESTION: Oh, I agree. The only thing that I\nhave been suggesting takes this out of that simple case is\nthat you don't have, I think, here the classic case of the\nState executive official. You have a State regulator that\nis acting in a kind of a quasi-judicial capacity, and it\nseems that one way to look at it would be to think of it\nmore as a court than as an executive office.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, though, the -- a\nlarge number of these Ex parte Young cases, going back to\nthe Reagan v. Farmer's Loan case that Ms. McDowell\nmentioned, an Ex parte Young, cases involving rate-making\ncommissions, railroad commissions and others that are --\nhave always been named as the defendants. In their\nofficial capacity the individuals are named, and that\nReagan case in 1894 said that's not an Eleventh Amendment\nproblem.\nYou're not really suing the State, you're suing\nthem to bring them into compliance with the Federal\nstatute. Ex parte Young, the defendants included not just\nthe Attorney General but also the rate-making\ncommissioners, and that is just the way it's done, and I\ndon't think it has any, as you have suggested, any great\nintrusion on the sovereign interests of the State to have\nthem named.\nIn fact, that's the essence of Ex parte Young,\nthat it's not an intrusion on their interests to have them\nbrought into compliance under the Supremacy Clause, and it\nwould be, I think, an odd rule to say, well, we're going\nto start having review of State actions, or some category\nof State actions in Federal court for compliance with\nFederal law where we don't name the defendants as -- the\nState as -- State individuals as defendants.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. SMITH: Now, there's been a number of other\narguments raised against the application of Ex parte Young\nhere. I don't think any of them is very substantial.\nThere's a notion that somehow there's an elaborate\nremedial scheme here comparable to the one in Seminole\nTribe, but in fact there isn't any elaborate remedial\nscheme in the statute. It just says you can sue State\ncommissions in Federal court, or to the extent we're\nrelying on 1331, there's no scheme at all.\nWe also have an -- the invocation of the Larson\ncase which was discussed by this Court in detail in\nPennhurst. Larson, I believe, is the case that you apply\nin a situation where you don't have Supremacy Clause\nconsiderations at stake.\nEssentially, what the Court said in Pennhurst\nis, when the Supremacy Clause is at issue, we basically\nallow lawsuits to proceed against all prospective ongoing\nviolations of Federal law by State officials, but Larson\nprovides a test that says where you're suing without\nSupremacy Clause considerations to enforce State law\nagainst State officials or Federal law against Federal\nofficials, in that situation you try to differentiate\nbetween mere violations of Federal law and violations that\nare so serious that we won't treat the State official or\nthe Federal official as an agent of the State any more.\nThat is not the test that ought to be applied under Ex\nparte Young, and certainly has not been applied in the\npast.\nWe also have the Fourth Circuit's analysis in\nwhich it undertook an entire sort of ad hoc balancing test\ntrying to weigh State interests against Federal interests.\nI think this Court is clearly on record as saying that in\nthe Ex parte Young context we're not going to get into\nthat kind of balancing test. The balancing test of the\nFourth Circuit I thought was particularly unfortunate,\nbecause basically what that Court did is, it looked at the\nmerits of the case and said, well, we don't think that the\nFederal claims are very strong here, so therefore we're\ngoing to say there's no ability to sue the State under Ex\nparte Young, and that doesn't seem like a very helpful way\nto go about -- thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Smith. Mr. Bertocchi,\nyou have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BERTOCCHI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn response to questions from Justice Souter,\nadjudicative context really provides the reasoning that Ex\nparte Young doesn't apply here. Contrary to what\nMr. Smith said, the statute doesn't say you can sue State\ncommissioners in Federal court. (e)(6) doesn't reference\nState commissioners at all.\nThis case is in a sense more like Larson than\nLarson. Larson was not about whether the case -- whether\nthe authority for the contracting official came from\nFederal or the State law. It was about the\ncharacterization of what he was doing, and the Court\nassumed he was wrong in what he did in that instance, and\nin this instance, in the adjudicative context, it makes\neven more sense.\nCertainly with respect to, I believe, Mr.\nSmith's remark about a -- Mr. Smith referred to the fact,\nor there was a question about the fact that the commission\nmight dispute the application of the Supremacy Clause, and\ncertainly, if a commission did that, if a commission\ndeclined to follow Federal law, that would be a different\nstory, and undoubtedly there would be some ability to\ncorrect that action.\nBut the Illinois commission isn't doing that.\nAs a matter of fact, the Illinois Commerce Commission has\nnever tried. This is, I think, correctly characterized as\na quasi-judicial proceeding, not executive or legislative.\nIt is not accurately compared to rate-making cases, which\nare much more legislative.\nThis is adjudication of a contract issue\nregarding a particular contract, and in that respect I\nwould go back -- that would lead me to the last point I\nwant to make, which is that this is a case about a\ncontract to which the act does not apply. It's\ninteresting, Mr. Smith said he didn't think the complaint\nin this case would survive a motion to dismiss, and yet\nhe's here arguing that it belongs in Federal court.\nI'm assuming that -- and I may be wrong. I\ndon't want to speak for him. I'm assuming that the motion\nto dismiss would be an attempt to throw it out of Federal\ncourt. These cases, this case is a contract case\nregarding a contract to which the act does not apply, and\nsection 252(a), which allows the courts to negotiate --\nallows the parties to negotiate contracts any way they\nwant clearly suggests that they have the right to do so\nwithout regard to Federal law.\nIn this instance, Ameritech has put Federal\nallegations in the complaint. One of them is that this\ncontract violates the act, but if you look in their brief,\nthey'll see -- you'll see that they say that this can't be\nrestricted to violations of Federal law because in\nnegotiated cases that would allow jurisdiction to move on\nto the -- to move to what they call the vanishing point.\nWe agree with that entirely. Jurisdiction over\ninterpretation does go to the vanishing point.\nThe only way Federal issues are going to come up\nin these cases is if State courts construe a contract in a\ncertain way and then disregard Federal law. That is not\nwhat the Illinois Commerce Commission is going to do.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
