DABNEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DABNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case concerns how far the Federal Circuit\ncan properly go in taking jurisdiction to the exclusion of\nthe regional circuits.\nIn its recent construction of its appellate\njurisdiction, the Federal Circuit has effectively taken\nthe position that the defendant's answer containing a\npatent counterclaim acts like a super removal petition.\nThe Federal Circuit says that if the defendant in a non-\npatent suit files an answer that includes a patent\ncounterclaim, that pleading automatically removes the\nplaintiff's non-patent suits from regional circuit\njurisdiction and transfers it to Federal Circuit\njurisdiction.\nAccording to the respondent, that same pleading\nautomatically has the effect of changing the substantive\nlaw governing non-patent claims in the plaintiff's non-\npatent suit from regional circuit to Federal Circuit law,\nand the decision below demonstrates that these principles\napply even when a judgment is entered which doesn't\naddress patent law at all.\nThe petitioner respectfully submits that the\ndecision below is antithetical to what the Congress had in\nmind when it established the Federal Circuit.\nQUESTION: Well, Congress did want patent law to\nbe uniform, didn't it?\nMR. DABNEY: Congress --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's why it placed the\njurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit.\nMR. DABNEY: One -- Mr. -- Your Honor, one of\nthe Congress' objectives in establishing the Federal\nCircuit certainly was --\nQUESTION: And to the extent that you then allow\nthe other courts of appeals to deal with patent claims,\nyou're defeating that uniformity goal.\nMR. DABNEY: Your Honor, the Congress in\nenacting 1295, according to this Court in Christianson,\nestablishes not that every case in which a Federal patent\nclaim is raised automatically goes to the Federal Circuit.\nThis Court in Christianson held -- this Court in\nChristianson addressed the question, how do we know if a\ncase belongs in the Federal Circuit? That was the\nspecific question raised in Christianson.\nCiting the legislative history of 1295, this\nCourt answered that question. Cases fall within the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit, this Court\nheld, in the same sense that cases are said to arise under\nFederal -- under Federal law for purposes of Federal\nquestion jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dabney, has the Federal Circuit\nheld that whenever there's a patent claim in a -- in a --\na patent issue in a counterclaim, it has jurisdiction? Or\nmust it be a compulsory counterclaim?\nMR. DABNEY: The Federal Circuit has held in the\nDSC Communications case that permissive or compulsory, it\ndoesn't matter.\nQUESTION: It doesn't matter.\nQUESTION: But in this case --\nQUESTION: In this case, it was compulsory.\nRight?\nMR. DABNEY: Your Honor, it is far from clear\nthat the counterclaim in this case was in fact compulsory.\nThe -- and the -- and the Court can see that most clearly\nby looking at the answer that was actually filed in this\ncase, which appears on pages 94 to 98 of the lodging. The\none thing that's conspicuously absent from the answer\nfiled in this case was any counterclaim for trade dress\ninfringement. Well, if this was --\nQUESTION: But did -- did the court of appeals\nsay in this case that the -- the counterclaim was\ncompulsory?\nMR. DABNEY: The court of appeals did not say\nthat. There's absolutely nothing in the decision --\nQUESTION: We're not talking about the trade\ndress claim. It was the patent infringement counterclaim\nthat was in question.\nMR. DABNEY: The respondent has taken the\nposition that the patent counterclaim that it filed in\nthis particular case was compulsory within the meaning of\nrule 13. No court has passed on that question that --\nQUESTION: Did it not arise out of the same\ntransaction and occurrence which under the rules is\ninterpreted broadly?\nMR. DABNEY: The subject matter of that\ncounterclaim was, at the time it was filed, the subject of\nanother pending proceeding. And it is far from clear that\nthis respondent was under any legal duty whatsoever to\nassert that patent counterclaim at any believable risk to\nitself.\nQUESTION: Suppose that respondent who started\nhis own show in the -- in the CIT -- when the defendant in\nthat case turns up as plaintiff in Kansas District Court\n-- was it? The -- the district court here?\nMR. DABNEY: At the time that the present action\nwas commenced, the plaintiff in this action was one of\nthree named people whom the respondent was trying to get\nan investigation started against.\nQUESTION: No. I just wanted to know where the\nforum was. The forum that the plaintiff is suing in is in\nthe Tenth Circuit.\nMR. DABNEY: Correct.\nQUESTION: And it's in Kansas.\nMR. DABNEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nSuppose the plaintiff in the suit in New York\nthen brings that same claim in the district court in\nKansas and says, court, please consolidate these two, and\nthen you don't have a counterclaim. You have two claims\nconsolidated for adjudication. Suppose that were the\ncase.\nMR. DABNEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Then, I take it, the judgment is\nrendered. There's a patent claim, not a counterclaim, but\na claim, and then the jurisdiction is in the Federal\nCircuit. Is that right?\nMR. DABNEY: That is a hypothetical situation,\ndifferent from this case. I would suggest that the\ndistrict court has an arsenal of remedies to decide\nwhether that should or should not be the outcome in that\ncase.\nQUESTION: I'm asking you a question that puts\ntogether two claims, not counterclaims, two claims. The\ndistrict court has made the judgment that these arise out\nof the same transaction and occurrence and therefore\nconsolidates them because it makes sense in terms of\njudicial economy. Okay. They are processed as\nconsolidated cases. There's a judgment. Where does the\nappeal go?\nMR. DABNEY: I -- I would say in practice that\nwould depend in large measure on the sequence in which the\nmatters are tried, whether they are tried at the same\ntime, whether they are tried separately.\nQUESTION: Yes, they are tried at the same time.\nMR. DABNEY: Tried at the same time? I believe\nthat under the question that this Court has not accepted\nexpressly under question 2, it would be open to both sides\nin that situation to request that the district court enter\njudgments which would preserve regional circuit\njurisdiction over the plaintiff's non-patent suit in the\nfirst case.\nQUESTION: They're both plaintiffs.\nMR. DABNEY: I understand. And no one in this\ncase -- there's no question in this case as to what the\nappropriate disposition would be of any claim for patent\ninfringement or any judgment adjudicating any such claim.\nIf the question had come up --\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting in -- in response\nto my question that they would -- these two cases that\nhave been consolidated would then be split apart for\npurposes of appeal and one claim would go to a regional\ncircuit and the other to the Federal Circuit?\nMR. DABNEY: It would be open to the parties to\nthat litigation in -- where they're both plaintiffs and\nthey both have filed claims, to request the entry of\njudgments if they felt it was in their interest to do so,\nbased on the outcome of the trial.\nQUESTION: Well, you're assuming they could have\nseparate judgments under 54(b). Is that what your point\nis here?\nMR. DABNEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nBut if there were a single judgment which did\ninclude the patent claim, then I think you'd say the\nappeal would go to the Federal Circuit.\nMR. DABNEY: Not -- not necessarily.\nQUESTION: Come on. Give us a little bit.\nSurely, surely in that case.\nQUESTION: Well, why not? I mean, what are you\ngiving up in your case by agreeing to that? I don't\nunderstand that.\nMR. DABNEY: I think it's important to\nunderstand that when a -- when a person comes to court and\nasked for a court to vary the rights and obligations of\nparties, seeks judicial relief, what that person comes to\ncourt with is a bundle of rights. That's his suit. That\nis what he's asking the court to vindicate. This Court\nhas never said that that bundle of rights, the plaintiff's\nright to choose who's going to decide that claim, and what\nlaw is going to govern that claim, can be changed at all\nautomatically by something the defendant pleads or by how\nthe --\nQUESTION: May I -- may I interrupt and ask a\nkind of a basic question here?\nMR. DABNEY: Certainly.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that you could prevail\non either of two theories, that -- that the counterclaim\nshould be ignored for purposes of selecting the appellate\ncourt to go to, or you could say that in this particular\ncase, you got a 54(b) judgment that had -- was totally\nunrelated to patent claims and therefore, in this case,\nregardless of whether we agree with Aerojet or the rest,\nyou should prevail.\nBut you seem to be arguing that even if the\ncounterclaim had been decided and adjudicated on a patent\nissue, that you -- it would be the same case.\nMR. DABNEY: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You're not relying on the fact that\n-- that there was a severance of the non-patent claims\nunder -- with a 54(b) finding, that it was a separate\nclaim.\nMR. DABNEY: That would provide a narrower basis\nfor reversal.\nQUESTION: But you're not asking us to rule on\nthat basis.\nMR. DABNEY: Well, we did in the petition, but\nthe Court declined to accept question 2 in the petition.\nWhat Your Honor asked me was specifically question 2 in\nthe petition for certiorari.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. DABNEY: And the Court did not accept that\nquestion before the Court. Hence, we're up on the broader\nquestion of whether or not the plaintiff's well-pleaded\ncomplaint continues to govern the basis of arising under\njurisdiction in the Federal court.\nIn Christianson, to decide this case, the Court\nneed look hardly beyond 486 U.S., page 814. Right then\nand there the Court was faced with the question, how do we\nknow if a case properly belongs in the Federal Circuit?\nAnd the Court held, we know that because Congress has told\nus the answer. What Congress said is, cases fall within\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit in the\nsame way that they are said to arise under Federal law for\npurposes of general Federal question jurisdiction under\n1331. The cases are legion which say that what a\ndefendant pleads in its answer, whether it's an\naffirmative defense or a counterclaim, is irrelevant to\nwhether a case falls within the original arising under\njurisdiction of the Federal court.\nQUESTION: In the -- in the context where\nthere's a great concern about Federal-State relations,\ncases lodged in the State court being lifted out of that\nState court and put into a Federal court, this context is\ntotally different. It is an entirely Federal context, and\nit's a question of which appellate forum it goes to. And\nit seems to me that you can't just say that what arising\nunder means in the original jurisdiction context it\nnecessarily means when we're talking about an exclusive\nappellate forum for a case that's colored Federal totally.\nThere's no State element in it.\nMR. DABNEY: Your Honor, I would say two things\nin response to that.\nIn the first place, that was exactly the\nargument which the respondent in Christianson made. In\nfootnote 2 of Christianson, the Court expressly recited\nmaybe our arising under jurisprudence is irrelevant in\nthis case since, after all, we're only deciding whether\nthe Seventh Circuit or the Federal Circuit should decide\nthis antitrust case in which the district court\ninvalidated a number of patents.\nAnd citing the legislative history that the\nCongress chose, for better or for worse, to make the\nreferent of Federal Circuit jurisdiction the same as the\nreferent of district court jurisdiction under 1331 and\n1338, under the page and in the passage that I just read,\nthis Court I believe specifically considered and decided\nthat notwithstanding that the outcome in this type of case\nis simply which of two Federal courts of appeals will hear\na case. Nevertheless, for better or for worse, Congress\nhas decided that the referent of Federal Circuit\njurisdiction is the same.\nQUESTION: Christianson was the first time the\nCourt encountered this issue, and Christianson affirmed\nthe Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit said, we don't\nhave the appellate authority in this case.\nA couple of years later, the Federal Circuit\nlooked at the issue again in Aerojet and it wrote an\nopinion saying these are different. In one case we were\ndealing with a defense, an issue, a question, and in\nanother case, we've got a claim. And for purposes of\nwhich court of appeals it goes to, maybe the court is --\nin Aerojet is saying we have to qualify Christianson's\nreasoning if not -- not its result.\nMR. DABNEY: Justice Ginsburg, in Aerojet, the\nFederal Circuit stated, among other things, that the\ntraditional prerogative of the plaintiff to choose his law\nand to choose his court applies only to the trial court\nlevel. The Aerojet case said that the plaintiff in that\ncase had fully exhausted his right to choose his court and\nto choose his law because he had access to a district\ncourt forum.\nThis Court -- this case demonstrates how that\nrationale of Aerojet is mischievous and dangerous and\nincorrect. Since Aerojet in 1989, there has been a sea\nchange in the Federal Circuit's approach to what law it\nchooses to apply in cases such as this, and it is the\nFederal Circuit's choice of law approach, adopted in the\nlate 1990's, which has given birth to this entire action.\nQUESTION: When you say choice of law, you're\nnot talking strictly about patent law, I take it.\nMR. DABNEY: Absolutely not. This -- it's\nundisputed that what --\nQUESTION: You're talking about Federal law\ninterpreted differently by different circuits.\nMR. DABNEY: Precisely.\nQUESTION: It's not like am I going to choose\nthe law of France or the law of Oklahoma versus the law of\nNew York.\nMR. DABNEY: That's absolutely the case. And\nthe Federal Circuit, being a co-equal court of appeals, is\nfully entitled, I suppose, to fashion its own liability\nrules and apply them even to claims over which it has only\nnonexclusive or pendent jurisdiction. But by doing that,\nit has given rise to great incentives, which the\nrespondent has attempted to avail itself of in this case,\nto get a case into the Federal Circuit and take advantage\nof the different law of the Federal Circuit on a non-\npatent claim.\nSo, I would suggest to Your Honor that this\nCourt has never wavered from the idea that a person who\ncomes to court seeking relief -- there's a lot of\nuncertainty in litigation. I'm called upon to advise\nclients all the time whether they should or should not\nbring suit, where they should bring suit, how they should\nbring suit. The one thing this Court has said, whatever\nelse is uncertain in litigation, the one thing you know\nis, number one, if you bring a suit, you have -- you are\nabsolute master to decide what law you're going to rely on\nin your complaint. That's your claim. If I specify the\nlaw of California in my complaint, that's my choice. If\nthe plaintiff specifies the law of the Tenth Circuit or a\njudgment of the Tenth Circuit, that is the plaintiff's\nchoice.\nQUESTION: That's a little odd, don't you think?\nWe are talking about one law, a Federal law. It is not\nquite the same as talking about the law of California, the\nlaw of Nevada. And wasn't one of the purposes of having\nthe Federal Circuit so that you would reduce the number of\ndisparities in -- in Federal law?\nMR. DABNEY: Well, early in its history the\nFederal Circuit seemed to be more mindful of that type of\nconflict than it is today.\nIt's very important that Your Honor understand.\nIn the Midwest case, which fomented this whole thing, the\n1999 Midwest case, that was a case that involved not just\nFederal law claims, that was a case that involved claims\nunder Iowa State law. And the Federal Circuit in that\ncase was considering whether or not a plaintiff could\nproperly claim trade dress protection for the shape a boat\ntrailer winch post. And the district court had granted\nsummary judgment dismissing the plaintiff's claims not\njust under the Lanham Act, but under Iowa State law.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you don't mean that the\nFederal Circuit has asserted that where you have a State\nclaim, that it's going to apply Federal law to that State\nclaim.\nMR. DABNEY: That is exactly what it did in the\nMidwest case. The Federal Circuit --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dabney, we're all quite close to\nyou. I think perhaps we can hear you even if you don't\nspeak so quite so loudly.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You -- you are saying that the\nFederal Circuit said we have the right not only to\ndetermine what is an answer to a Federal issue, but we\nhave a right to tell Iowa what the law of the State of\nIowa is? That would be astonishing.\nMR. DABNEY: I invite Your Honor to look at\npages 1564 and 65 of volume 175 of Federal 3rd, and Your\nHonor will read there that the Federal Circuit reversed a\nsummary judgment under Iowa State law on the ground that\nin its view the Federal patent law doesn't limit any claim\nthat can be asserted under Iowa State law. And therefore,\nthe district court erred in not holding that Iowa State\nlaw could protect the shape of a trailer winch post.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dabney, would you heed my\nadmonition? Please do.\nMR. DABNEY: Thank you, Your Honor. I\napologize, Mr. Chief Justice.\nSo, therefore --\nQUESTION: On -- on one point that you made\nabout the Federal Circuit saying, well, if it's a Federal\nquestion, what is the Federal law? We decide that as our\nsister circuits do. It's just asserting that it's a court\nof equal dignity, that it's not under the enthrall of the\nTenth Circuit or any other circuit.\nMR. DABNEY: I am not questioning that that is\nwhat the Federal Circuit is currently doing, and that it\n-- it -- I'm not questioning it has the power to do that.\nQUESTION: May I ask this -- just a question\nabout the history of what we've got before us? Am I\ncorrect in believing that until the Federal Circuit\nchanged its view and started to apply its own law to non-\npatent issues as opposed to applying other circuits' law\nwhen the case arose in another circuit, the bar generally\nwas totally happy with the rule that the counterclaim\nwould -- counterclaim alleging a patent claim would be\nsufficient to give appellate jurisdiction to the Federal\nCircuit?\nMR. DABNEY: I cannot say that that is a fair\ncharacterization of what the bar generally holds. I\nbelieve that the bar is very cautious in what it says\nabout any court in which it may appear in front of.\nQUESTION: Is it --\nQUESTION: So, it is true that this -- this has\nbecome a much more important problem since they changed\nthe -- their rule on what they do with the ancillary\nclaims.\nMR. DABNEY: It has much greater practical\nsignificance now. But the fact of the matter is that the\narising under basis --\nQUESTION: The jurisdiction rule is the same in\neither event.\nMR. DABNEY: Is -- is the same. We have a\nbright line test. How do we know whether a case belongs\nin the Federal Circuit or in any Federal court? You look\nat what's presented on the place -- on the face of the\nplaintiff's well-pleaded complaint. You don't inquire\ninto the plaintiff's motives or -- or spin-out theories as\nto why the plaintiff is doing what it's doing.\nQUESTION: Well, may I ask a question?\nMR. DABNEY: Certainly.\nQUESTION: Not -- not your case certainly, but\nwe had a case called Cardinal Chemical Company v. Morton\nInternational in 1993, which seemed to say that a patent\nlaw counterclaim could serve as an independent basis for a\ndistrict court's original jurisdiction.\nMR. DABNEY: That's not how I read Cardinal\nChemical, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DABNEY: Cardinal Chemical was a straight-\nup patent infringement case. The defendant in that case\nasserted two -- at least two things in -- in response to\nthe claim of patent infringement. The defendant in\nCardinal Chemical said, your patent is invalid, and\ntherefore I'm not liable. And then, as many defendants do\nnowadays, the defendant in Cardinal Chemical says, I also\nwant a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that your\npatent is invalid. One of the reasons why I want that is\nso that if you, the plaintiff, decide to pull the plug on\nyour suit, I can stay in court on my counterclaim. And\nthat was what came up and that was the issue.\nHowever, it's very clear that since at least\n1990 the source of a district court's power to hear a\ncounterclaim like that is in 1367, supplemental\njurisdiction. The district court unquestionably --\nQUESTION: Not 1338?\nMR. DABNEY: Not -- absolutely not. 1367.\nSo --\nQUESTION: What is -- what is -- taking a case,\nMr. Dabney -- and this has come up I think again and again\n-- where you have a counterclaim that would qualify for\nFederal jurisdiction whether under 1331, 1338, whatever,\nthat for whatever reason, the main claim drops out, maybe\nbecause it failed -- fails to state a claim. The\ncounterclaim, whether it's an antitrust claim, patent\nclaim, copyright claim, stays in Federal court and it's\nnot supplemental to anything. It has its own\njurisdictional base. It's a Federal claim. And if it\nweren't a Federal claim, it couldn't stay there because it\nwould have nothing to pend to.\nMR. DABNEY: I don't believe that's a correct\nstatement of 1367. I believe that a Federal court can\nretain --\nQUESTION: Are there not many, many cases in the\ndistrict court, blessed by the courts of appeals, where\nexactly what I've described happens? The main claim drops\nfor whatever reason. There's a counterclaim that would\nqualify independently for Federal jurisdiction. The court\nwill adjudicate that. But if it has a counterclaim that\nwould not independently qualify, it is not likely to hang\nonto that case. Right?\nMR. DABNEY: That is what happens --\nQUESTION: Because -- because the only Federal\npeg is gone. And pendent jurisdiction is exercised when\nthere's a tail that's attached to a dog, but when the dog\nis gone, the tail doesn't stay.\nMR. DABNEY: Yes. But in that situation,\nJustice Ginsburg, you're not talking about nullifying a\nplaintiff's choice of law and forum through the -- the\nassertion of a well-pleaded complaint. If a plaintiff\nasserts a defective complaint and shouldn't --\nQUESTION: The question I asked you is you said\nthat what had been going on for years before there was\n1367 codified, all of a sudden that independent Federal\nclaim, be it an antitrust claim, a patent claim, suddenly\nbecomes shrunken to a supplemental jurisdiction rather\nthan having its own jurisdictional peg.\nMR. DABNEY: I don't know that the legal\nsignificance of the source of a district court's power to\nact in that situation has ever been a subject on which any\nlegal consequences followed so that the body of law that\ndeveloped on that would have any precedential significance\nin this situation.\nThe fact -- the critical distinction between\nthis situation and the one Your Honor is positing is that\nin the situations Your Honor is talking about, you're not\ntalking about a plaintiff who had a well-pleaded complaint\nwho he prevailed on being ousted of his chosen court and\nforum. I don't believe that the appropriate disposition\nof a counterclaim in that situation sheds any light on\nwhat should happen to a plaintiff who files suit under\nnon-patent law and wins, and the plaintiff doesn't seek\nrelief under Federal patent law. The plaintiff doesn't\ncare what the defendant does with other claims the\ndefendant has. If the respondent wants to have a patent\ncounterclaim, go to the Federal court or litigate a\nFederal patent counterclaim in the International Trade\nCommission, more power to it.\nThis suit was brought to get preliminary\ninjunctive relief against threatened, imminent,\nirreparable harm to the plaintiff's business which was\ngranted. There was a preliminary injunction that was\nissued in January of 2000, which remains in effect to this\nday upon the posting of a $100,000 bond. The plaintiff\nhad every right and entitlement to go into court, to plead\nhis claim in the way that the plaintiff thought would best\naccomplish the plaintiff's objectives. That is a\nprerogative which this Court has said over and over and\nover again is the plaintiff's right. No well-counseled\nplaintiff could possibly file a lawsuit without thinking\nwhat court is most likely to give me the relief that I'm\nseeking. That's not forum shopping. That's good\nlawyering. And that's what happened in this case.\nQUESTION: And what about a defendant who would\njust love to have -- not particularly litigious, has a\nclaim, a good claim, asserts it as a counterclaim, goes\ninto the district court because that's where it belongs?\nI just don't understand why the rule that would apply to\nthe district court carries over to the specialized court\nof appeals if you are, in fact, dealing with a patent\nclaim that's been adjudicated.\nMR. DABNEY: This Court has held and the -- the\ncongressional choice of the arising under referent for\nFederal Circuit jurisdiction clearly recognized that there\nwill be many, many times when patent law questions and\npatent law issues, including the issue of validity, will\nbe decided not just in the regional circuits, but in the\nState courts.\nWould it really have mattered in Lear v. Adkins\nif the defendant in that case hadn't just said, the\ncontract is invalid because the patent is no good and\nthere's no consideration, if it had filed a counterclaim,\nas was done in Cardinal Chemical and said, I want a\ndeclaratory judgment that the patent isn't valid? No\nlegal consequence should follow from that.\nAnd in the real world, Justice Ginsburg, if a\ndefendant really is concerned about maintaining its access\nto the Federal Circuit, the defendant will file his own\nsuit, as Your Honor suggested in that --\nQUESTION: This defendant did.\nMR. DABNEY: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Didn't -- this defendant did. He\nstarted in the -- in the --\nMR. DABNEY: The respondent -- and -- and it was\nfree at all times to pursue all available remedies in that\nforum and that's not -- that's not even in question at\nthis point. But just as the respondent was free to choose\na forum that it thought was most favorable to it, which,\nby the way, would have been subject to Federal Circuit\nreview, so was the petitioner. And the petitioner filed\nsuit in accordance with the rules. It got a judgment. It\nwon, and it's had its judgment taken away by a court that\nclearly does not have jurisdiction to hear the\ncontroversy.\nIf there's no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the rest of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dabney.\nMr. Gowdey, we'll hear -- hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER W. GOWDEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GOWDEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn light of the colloquy that we've had, I want\nto make a preliminary point and then a couple other\nstarting points.\nThe first is that there's absolutely no issue\nthat the Federal Circuit has failed to follow this Court's\nprecedents and, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out\npreviously, correctly anticipated this Court's holding in\nChristianson.\nAnd to respond to a question that Justice\nO'Connor raised, in the Cardinal case, this Court did say,\nin this case Cardinal properly invoked the original\njurisdiction of a district court by way of its patent\ncounterclaim.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gowdey, do you think the court of\n-- the Federal Circuit's opinion here is entirely\nconsistent with footnote 2 in our Colt opinion?\nMR. GOWDEY: In the which opinion, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: In -- in our Christianson v. Colt\nIndustries?\nMR. GOWDEY: I think -- I think that the\nposition that the Federal Circuit has taken this Court is\ncompletely consistent with Christian v. Colt.\nQUESTION: And -- and with footnote 2 therein?\nMR. GOWDEY: Yes. And -- and I say that because\nof the reasoning and the procedures and the -- and the\nconsidered exhaustive review that the Federal Circuit made\nin Aerojet or the Christian v. Colt case. They started\ntheir Aerojet decision saying that the question was of\nexceptional importance and, because of that, sat on their\nchoice en banc. They exactly framed the question in that\ncase, which was whether --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gowdey, may I suggest that you\nraise that a little higher? The podium. I'm having some\ntrouble hearing.\nQUESTION: We had the opposite problem. The\nfirst counsel had a very loud voice and yours is very\nsoft. So --\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I do have a soft voice and I\napologize.\nThey framed the question in Christian v. Colt --\nin -- in Aerojet as being one where you do not have a\npatent issue as the complaint, but you have a patent\ncounterclaim coming in. And in that case, it was a\ncompulsory patent counterclaim. Should that be a\nsufficient basis for giving exclusive appellate\njurisdiction to the Federal Circuit? They answered that\nit was.\nThe Aerojet opinion is -- is well-crafted. It's\na thoughtful opinion. It goes through analysis --\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's this CAFC's\nruling on its own jurisdiction.\nMR. GOWDEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: In the Aerojet case.\nMR. GOWDEY: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, in effect, we're trying to decide\nwhether that's right in this circumstance.\nMR. GOWDEY: That is absolutely correct, Your\nHonor.\nThey -- they looked --\nQUESTION: But it does seem to be unlikely, does\nit not, that where the counterclaim raising the patent\nissue hasn't been dealt with and what we're dealing with\nis an appeal from this injunction which was rendered in\nthe plaintiff's suit below -- why should the CAFC get into\nit at all?\nMR. GOWDEY: Because we should look at\njurisdiction for an appellate court at the time of the\npleading stage of the case, Your Honor. And at the\npleading stage, you have the complaint and you have the\nanswer and counterclaims --\nQUESTION: I would think it would have to be\nconsidered also in light of what's happened in this case.\nI don't see why you would be so limited necessarily. It\nseems so odd that this appeal would go to the Federal\nCircuit.\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I don't think it's odd, Your\nHonor. I think that you have to establish appellate\njurisdiction at the beginning of a case so that as a case\nproceeds, if there are interlocutory appeals that -- that\nare going to happen, where is it that they should be\nproperly directed? And there should not be a conundrum as\n-- as to that. And if you look at the claims in the case,\nif you look under 1338 and 1295, talking about civil\nactions and claims, the jurisdiction of a Federal Circuit\nshould -- should be decided by what claims are pled.\nQUESTION: Well, what case of ours do you think\nmost strongly supports your view of this jurisdictional\nquestion?\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I think you have to look at\nChristian v. Colt and the fact that in that case, the\ndecision said it should be adapted to 1338. I think the\nAerojet decision that comes along after that and its\nexhaustive review of Christianson makes clear that -- that\nyou should look at claims. And as you're adapting 1338 to\nthe patent situation --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gowdey, I -- I think Aerojet\nmakes a whole lot of sense if -- if the issue before the\n-- the court there and the issue before us here were what\nmakes sense. Then -- then Aerojet may -- may well be\nright.\nBut -- but it seems to me that the issue really\nbefore us is what does section 1295 mean. What was it\nunderstood to mean when it spoke of a claim arising under\nany act of Congress relating to copyrights and trademarks?\nAnd that's a different question. And when you have a long\nhistory known to every first-year law student that a case\narises under a certain law, if the well-pleaded complaint\ninvokes that law and does not arise under that law if --\nif a counterclaim invokes it, I find it hard to believe\nthat anyone would interpret the statute, written with that\nmagic language, in any other way.\nNow, it -- it might well be the case, as you\nargue, that another disposition is more sensible for the\nFederal Circuit. But we have to deal here with what\nCongress said, and the -- and the whole issue is whether a\nclaim arising under an act of Congress isn't magic\nlanguage that -- that the whole legal community has known\nfor many years, which means you have to have a well-\npleaded complaint invoking it.\nMR. GOWDEY: Well --\nQUESTION: And that's what I think we said in\nChristianson.\nMR. GOWDEY: Well, in Christian v. -- in\nChristianson, however, there was no counterclaim. That --\nthat issue was not before the Court. That issue has not\nyet been addressed by this -- by this Court, which is why\nI think looking at the Aerojet decision and looking at the\nreview that it made of Christianson is important for this\nCourt to -- to undertake and to look at. There were --\nQUESTION: Not just Aerojet, but I would like\nyou to pursue that because my understanding is the same as\nJustice Scalia's. You started out by saying, in response\nto the Chief Justice's question, that footnote 2 applies.\nI take it that means we now have an issue that does not\njust concern patent law. It concerns all of Federal\njurisdiction.\nYou then said we look to what is filed in the\ndistrict court at the complaint stage. Again, all of\nFederal jurisdiction.\nYou then say that all these other cases involved\na well-pleaded complaint and an answer. This one, though,\ninvolves a well-pleaded complaint and a compulsory\ncounterclaim.\nMR. GOWDEY: Yes --\nQUESTION: I agree. So, I look up Wright and\nMiller, and Wright and Miller says it is not sufficient\nfor the Federal question to enter the case as a\ncounterclaim asserted by the defendant. Now, he didn't\njust make that up. He has dozens of citations. So, at\nthat point I think QED. You lose.\nNow, why don't you?\nMR. GOWDEY: Well, for the reasons set forth in\nAerojet. First, had the --\nQUESTION: Aerojet, to my way of thinking, just\nsaid it's a counterclaim. It's not a defense. Okay, I\naccept that. But I still have Wright and Miller and all\nthe cases they cite.\nMR. GOWDEY: And -- and I think most of the\ncases that I'm aware of that talk about counterclaims are\nremoval cases. That's where you have a -- a State/Federal\nissue.\nQUESTION: Are what -- what kind of cases?\nMR. GOWDEY: Removal cases, Your Honor, where --\nwhere you -- and there is no issue of federalism here.\nThe -- the petitioner properly brought a case in -- in the\nFederal district court in Kansas.\nQUESTION: Then you're -- you're now defeating\nyour first concession which was with footnote 2 in\nAerojet, that we are to deal with this case exactly as if\nit were a removal case because it's a question of all\nFederal jurisdiction, not just patent. The word is\narising under. That's in fact -- I flag it because that's\nwhat frightens me. I thought that if all that were at\nissue here were patent cases, we weren't going to make a\nbig mistake either way.\nMR. GOWDEY: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But once you tell me that this\ninvolves all cases of removal, I suddenly get quite\nnervous about departing from well-settled law.\nMR. GOWDEY: Then -- then I must retract it. It\ndoes not -- it does not involve all cases of removal.\nThis is a patent case, and -- and I think we're talking\nabout patent issues and whether the Federal Circuit has\nproper jurisdiction of claims in a case involving patent\nissues.\nQUESTION: Well, then that means we interpret,\nunder your view, arising under in different ways in the --\nin the patent statute and in -- in the Federal\njurisdiction statute.\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I think that arising under is\nnot to be interpreted in a different way, but I think as\nthis Court said in Christianson, that it should be adapted\nto 1338. It should be adapted to 1338 because, under\n1295, Congress was interested in getting as many patent\nclaims to the Federal Circuit as it could.\nQUESTION: But certainly Christianson gave no\nintimation that the phrase, arising under, should be\ninterpreted differently in the statute conferring\njurisdiction on the Federal Circuit as it has\ntraditionally been in 1331.\nMR. GOWDEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is there a difference in interpreting\na different way and adapting?\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I think it's a question of --\nof looking at claims that are pled in a case. If -- if\nyou look at the second point of Chief -- Chief Judge\nMarkey in Aerojet, he was -- he was taking a -- a look at\nclaims. And a patent claim, as Justice O'Connor pointed\nout earlier, has its own separate, independent\njurisdictional base under 1338. Once you find that a\npatent claim comes in under 1338 with its own\njurisdictional basis, under 1295 that is an appeal-\ndirecting mechanism that Congress put into place.\nAnd -- and I think that if you go again to\nAerojet, as Chief Judge Markey pointed out in his first\nreason for why the patent counterclaim should be\nconsidered arising under and give appellate jurisdiction,\nhad that counterclaim been filed as a complaint, there's\nno question that -- that Federal Circuit jurisdiction\nwould have been invoked.\nQUESTION: But that's -- you can say that by\nanalogy to 1331 too, that although you can have a -- a\ncompulsory counterclaim will not change the result there.\nIt still goes to Federal court if -- if the well-pleaded\ncomplaint doctrine is applied. You could say, well, the\ncompulsory counterclaim could have been in its own right a\ncase of Federal question, but that doesn't change the\nrule.\nMR. GOWDEY: It does not change the rule. I\nbelieve, Your Honor, you're talking about removal cases.\nAnd certainly if -- if you have --\nQUESTION: But why does it make a difference if\nwe're talking about removal cases? Because the language\nis exactly the same.\nMR. GOWDEY: Because I think in a\nFederal/Federal situation where there is no federalism,\nthere is no issue with respect to States' rights and\nStates' claims. And -- and we're not talking about a -- a\nreading of 1338 or 1295 where you -- where we're concerned\nabout somehow taking away the essence of -- of a State\ncourt to deal with State court actions. And -- and we're\nnot talking about that. This Court does not need to, I\nthink, even go there.\nWe're talking about a situation where you have a\nFederal question that has been properly presented in a\nFederal court. Original jurisdiction has been applied. A\n-- a patent counterclaim comes in that has its own\nseparate jurisdictional base under 1338. The question\nthen is, from an appellate standpoint, has Congress set up\nand dictated an appellate-directing mechanism with 1295?\nAnd I think they have. And they recognized when they\nsaid, as long as jurisdiction was based in whole or in\npart under 1338, that not all of the case would have to be\npatent cases. It could be part of it.\nAnd once you have the nexus between a district\ncourt having original jurisdiction under 1338, 1295\ndirects that that appeal -- for the patent cases, 1295\ndirects that appeal should go to the Federal Circuit.\nI -- I think the basic purpose of -- of the\nwell-pleaded complaint rule was -- was to avoid the -- the\nsort of State/Federal conflicts. Since that's not here,\nthen there is -- is no reason to say that there should be\na compelled disregard of -- of counterclaims. And where\nCongress' intent was to get as many patent claims as\npossible to the Federal Circuit, again --\nQUESTION: But you -- you can say, I think, that\nwhen Congress used the term, well-pleaded complaint, its\nintent was to have the same sort of analysis as there is\nin 1331.\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I think the language is the\nsame. But again, going back to what this Court --\nQUESTION: Congress didn't use it -- Congress\ndidn't say well-pleaded complaint. It said -- it said\narising under.\nMR. GOWDEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd I think, as this Court said in Christianson,\nby adapting that under 1338, there are -- there is a way\nto accomplish both the jurisdictional goals and the intent\nof Congress of getting patent claims --\nQUESTION: But you are giving arising under a\ndifferent meaning for appellate purposes. You are\nincluding the counterclaim, a different meaning from\noriginal jurisdiction where, as Justice Breyer read,\neverybody agrees that for original jurisdiction purposes,\ncounterclaims don't count.\nMR. GOWDEY: I -- I think --\nQUESTION: You're suggesting they do count for\nappellate jurisdiction.\nMR. GOWDEY: I'm suggesting that they do, and\nI'm suggesting that Congress recognized that in 1295 where\n-- where, unlike petitioner, I -- I think when -- when a\nplaintiff comes into court, clearly he has his choice of\n-- of what Federal court to go to, what State, and so on.\nUnder 1295, once you have patent claims in a case, I think\nCongress set up an appellate-directing mechanism that --\nthat does not make it a litigant's choice. It defines\nwhere it goes.\nQUESTION: Suppose you did do that, which -- I\nmean, suppose you took Justice Stevens' concurring view in\nChristianson, which was a view that would come closer to\ndoing what you want. It would make sense. You'd look at\nthe -- look at the case after it's decided in the district\ncourt to see where -- whether there's a patent claim.\nYou'd still lose here, wouldn't you?\nMR. GOWDEY: Well, I think Justice Stevens\nactually goes farther than we need to go because --\nQUESTION: Well, why farther? Because I would\ngo just as far as he went. You went just as far as he\nwent. You look at the whole thing after it's decided.\nMR. GOWDEY: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, how could you go further than\nthat?\nMR. GOWDEY: Well, I'm saying he -- he went\nfurther. He -- he's saying, I believe, that you could\neven look at -- at Federal Circuit jurisdiction being --\nbeing shown where you have amended a complaint later on,\nthat you could get a patent issue under that -- in at that\npoint.\nIn -- in this case here, there was a patent\nissue that came in at the pleading stage. And so that --\nthat's the distinction that I -- that I would see. That's\nwhy I'm saying you don't have to go so far as -- as to say\nyou look at the well-tried case.\nQUESTION: Was there patents issue adjudicated\nat all here? And there was not a judgment. The judgment,\nthe 54(b) judgment, was on trade dress alone?\nMR. GOWDEY: There has not been a patent ruling\nyet, Your Honor. We didn't get that far. We haven't --\nQUESTION: So, there's not only the no judgment,\nbut no adjudication?\nMR. GOWDEY: No adjudication, not even any\ndiscovery, Your Honor. So -- so, we have a patent -- a\npatent case that has, in essence, a -- a very young one,\nthat has not gotten very far except for the fact that we\nhave this preliminary injunction from Judge Brown in\nKansas.\nQUESTION: I think it would be consistent with\nJustice Stevens' opinion to say you look to see what was\nadjudicated. His concurring opinion suggests that. And\nif what was adjudicated was the patent claim, whether it\nwere a claim or a counterclaim, then that's what should\ncount. If what were adjudicated were a trade dress claim,\nthen that's what should count.\nMR. GOWDEY: 1338, however, talks about civil\nactions, and civil actions goes -- goes back to a\ndescription of being all claims for relief. We would say\nthat you should look for the claims that are made for\nrelief at the time the case is -- is being pled. That is\nthe point at which I think you should have appellate\njurisdiction being decided so that as interim or\ninterlocutory appeals happens, you know appellate court it\ngoes to.\nIf you waited until you -- you saw what was\nactually tried in a case and, as Justice Stevens\nsuggested, you waited even to see if the -- if a complaint\nwould be amended subsequently after the pleading stage,\nearlier -- earlier disposition of interlocutory orders\nmight go somewhere else, and appropriately so.\nQUESTION: If the district court has to decide\nwhich of two different circuits' laws you're going to\nfollow, I guess he knows what the case is going to look\nlike at the end -- or she. Maybe -- maybe the trial judge\ndoesn't because the trial doesn't know which circuit to\nfollow, so he doesn't know how it's going to come out.\nMR. GOWDEY: Well, but if -- Your Honor, if --\nif --\nQUESTION: It's a circular analysis.\nMR. GOWDEY: If -- if you're looking at the\nclaims that are pled at the pleading stage, the district\ncourt judge will know what appellate court will -- will\napply certainly under the Aerojet rule, which -- which\nagain would -- would place appellate jurisdiction at the\nFederal Circuit if you have a well-pled patent\ncounterclaim coming in at the pleading stage as part of\nthe defendant's answer.\nQUESTION: But you will -- you will have the\nsituation then in which the district judge is -- is going\nto have to defy the law of his circuit on a -- on the non-\npatent issue.\nMR. GOWDEY: Perhaps that's a more difficult\nquestion. I think the Federal Circuit, being a sister --\nsister circuit to the rest of the regional circuit courts\nof appeal, certainly would make an effort to apply the\nappropriate regional circuit law to non-patent issues.\nQUESTION: Well, the claim is -- and I -- I will\nbe candid to say I'm not in a position to -- to evaluate\nthis claim because I haven't gone back and looked at -- at\nmany of the cases on it to find out what's really going\non. But I mean, the claim is made that the Federal\nCircuit is not doing that.\nMR. GOWDEY: Well, I think the Federal Circuit\nis making an attempt to look at its -- its historical base\nfor decisions with respect to those issues that relate to,\nin effect, patent law issues. Now, the way I read cases\ncoming from the Federal Circuit, they're making an attempt\nto apply law of their own where they find either there --\nthere is conflict or where there has not been a well-\ngrounded set of policies or law to decide an issue. Where\nthe regional circuit has laws that are not affecting\npatents, my reading is the Federal Circuit is applying\nregional circuit law in an appropriate way as they see fit\nfrom panel to panel.\nQUESTION: That's what it used to do. You say\nthey -- you think it's still doing that? It's still\nfollowing circuit rule on non-patent law issues?\nMR. GOWDEY: I think they are, and I think as\nthe -- the court was started in 1982, and by -- by that\nmeasure, it's a relatively young court. Aerojet has been\naround half of its lifetime since 1990.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand at the time\nAerojet was decided, they did that. But I thought there\nwas a recent -- in the last year or 2, they had taken a\ndifferent view and were applying their own law as opposed\nto the Tenth Circuit law in this case on the non-patent\nlaw issues.\nMR. GOWDEY: Certainly in Midwest, they -- they\nwere -- they were taking a look at trade dress law because\nof the interrelationship trade dress has on the Lanham Act\nwith patent issues. To that extent, they certainly were\nlooking at new law and saying where there is an\ninteraction of laws and holdings with respect to patent\nissues, that that is an area that they -- they can and\nperhaps should get into.\nQUESTION: But that seems somewhat inconsistent\nwith the last part of 1295(a), which in effect says that\nwhen it's a non-patent law issue, they -- the 1291 and the\n1292 and 1294 shall apply.\nMR. GOWDEY: Are you talking about the exception\nof 1295, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GOWDEY: Certainly that's a two-part\nexception, and where you have other claims pending, you\ncan still have jurisdiction under 1338.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, now the trial judge has to\nsay, well, there may be two circuits involved here. One\nis my own circuit and it's not related, and so the Federal\nCircuit won't control, but if it's somehow related to the\npatent claim, then the Federal Circuit would -- so, this\n-- this is a further metaphysical exercise. This -- this\nis great for the legal profession actually.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOWDEY: It keeps all well employed, Your\nHonor.\nI -- I think that where -- where there are\nissues that relate to patent law, certainly they -- they\nwill be looking to Federal Circuit precedent to help them.\nWhere there are non-patent law issues, it's the regional\ncircuit law that can and should control. And -- and I\nthink that as the court develops in time, there will be --\nthere will be a larger body of law that -- that will help\ndistrict circuit judges in that regard.\nAs respects this case, however, where -- where\nwe have a patent counterclaim, I think the Aerojet\ndecision and looking at what went on before Christian --\nChristianson, looking at -- at the Christianson decision\nitself and the analysis that that court did with Chief\nJudge Markey speaking for the whole court en banc, very\ncarefully and thoughtfully gives a legitimate basis for\nwhy a Federal Circuit should have jurisdiction over cases\nwhere there is a well-pleaded compulsory counterclaim at\nthe district court level.\nChief Judge Markey also noted at 895 F.2d at\n742, in all events, the Supreme Court did hold in\nChristianson or in any other case that for all cases and\ncircumstances only the complaint and never a counterclaim\ncan serve as the basis of district court jurisdiction.\nAnd under section 1295, the basis of district court\njurisdiction is for this Court an appeal-directing\nmechanism. And I think that's where 1295 really is -- is\nimportant and the interconnection with -- with 1338.\nIf there are no other -- no other questions, I\nthank the Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gowdey.\nMr. Dabney, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DABNEY: In response to your question, Mr.\nJustice Kennedy, there is no difference between different\ninterpretation and adaptation. The respondent's position\nwould call for this Court to retreat from Christianson and\nto adopt some special interpretation of arising under\nunique to 1338(a) that deviates from the arising under\nlanguage as it was clearly adopted by Congress in 1295.\nSecondly, with regard to the question of -- of\nFederal Circuit choice of law, what Mr. Gowdey stood here\n-- I just would call -- call Your Honors' attention to\npage 94a of the joint appendix which is the district\ncourt's opinion in this case in which the district court\nsays, Vornado -- that's the respondent -- contends that\nthis change in the law exception is met because in Midwest\nIndustries, the Federal Circuit expressly rejected the\nTenth Circuit's Vornado I holding, ruling instead that a\nclaim for trade dress protection was not barred by the\nfact that a product configuration has been claimed as a\nsignificant inventive element of the patent. As part of\nits ruling in that case, the Federal Circuit abandoned its\nprior practice of applying regional circuit law on\nquestions involving the relationship between patent law\nand other Federal law rights and said, quote, henceforth,\nwe will apply our own law to such questions.\nThere is no doubt whatever that the Federal\nCircuit has recently and radically changed how it\nadjudicates trade dress claims, and it was the opportunity\nto try to take advantage of the -- of the Federal\nCircuit's view of trade dress protection which was before\nthe Court in the TrafFix case, and rejected by the Court\nin the TrafFix case, which drove the case that's currently\nbefore the Court, which isn't to say that the Federal\nCircuit can't do that. But by doing that, whatever\nlegitimacy could have been before it, even as a matter of\ncommon sense, Justice Scalia, in derogation of clearly\nexpressed congressional intent, in 1989, the Federal\nCircuit has done a 180 degree U-turn in its approach to\nits choice of law in these matters. And therefore, the --\na critical underpinning of the Aerojet principle has been\ncompletely wiped out.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're telling us that this\nis unqualified. I think Mr. Gowdey said that the\nrelationship language is -- that it's -- it's only in the\nintersection of patent law, not just any -- any question\nthat comes along.\nMR. DABNEY: That -- it is the issue that was\nbefore this Court in the TrafFix case. It is a question\nof how far State law, how far Federal law can properly go\nin allowing a company like the respondent to claim\nunregistered, judge-made --\nQUESTION: And I don't see what the Federal\nCircuit meant when it said the relationship between patent\nlaw and other Federal rights.\nMR.
