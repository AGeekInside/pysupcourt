PINAUD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINAUD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about the vitality and scope of the\nrule of construction from Shamrock Oil that says that the\nremoval jurisdiction to Federal courts should be narrowly\nconstrued.\nAs we see it, the overarching question in this\ncase is, as posed by respondent, whether or not the rule\nfrom Shamrock Oil applies to cases brought in State court,\nbut based upon a Federal question. We think it has to for\nthree reasons, and I'd like to, if I can, list them, and\nthen I'll go back and -- and cover each of them\nindividually.\nFirst, respondent proposes an unworkable\ndistinction whereby the -- whereby Shamrock Oil is not to\nbe applied where a case is brought under the Fair Labor\nStandards Act alone, but it should be applied if it's\nbrought together with some State law claims.\nSecondly, Florida has a right to protect its\ncitizens.\nAnd thirdly, the Fair Labor Standards Act is\njust -- just as much a part of the law of Florida as any\nact of the Florida legislature or any decision of the\nFlorida courts.\nLet me cover that first point first, which is\nthe unworkable distinction.\nRespondent concedes that Shamrock Oil would\ncertainly apply in a situation where a State law claim was\nbeing brought together with a Fair Labor Standards Act\nclaim. In this case we did not bring a State law claim.\nWe only brought a Fair Labor Standards Act claim. We\ncould have, but we didn't.\nIf you were to -- if you were to have that rule,\nyou would have a situation where whether or not Federal\njurisdiction was proper would be wholly dependent upon\nwhether a State claim was brought with Federal action. We\ndon't think that --\nQUESTION: But there are unworkable aspects to\nyour position, Mr. Pinaud. For example, a Title VII case\ncombined with an equal pay case, the equal pay case could\nnot be removed, but the Title VII case could, and then you\nwould split what is essentially one controversy into two\nparts because one is -- is not removable.\nMR. PINAUD: Well --\nQUESTION: The equal pay would be governed by\nthe same thing as --\nMR. PINAUD: There is --\nQUESTION: -- the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nMR. PINAUD: There is, I think, no question that\nthe Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination Act -- Age\nDiscrimination Enforcement Act would be covered by the\nCourt's decision in this case because the enforcement\nprovisions of those statutes are tied to the Fair Labor\nStandards Act.\nQUESTION: And if you're right -- if you're\nright -- the equal pay case would have to stay in the\nState court, although the Title VII case could go forward\nin the Federal court.\nMR. PINAUD: That would be correct.\nThe -- the second reason that I think Shamrock\nOil applies in this case is because Florida has a right to\nprotect its -- its citizens. This is a dispute between\nPhillip Breuer, Mr. Breuer, who is a resident of the State\nof Florida who lives in Duval County, who works for Jim's\nConcrete of Brevard, which is a company in Brevard County,\nin an employment relationship that took place in Florida,\ngoverned by Florida law. They worked in many counties in\nFlorida. Certainly then Florida has an interest in that\nrelationship and in this dispute. This is not a case like\nAsahi where you have a -- a California court looking at a\ndispute between a -- you know, a Taiwanese company and a\nJapanese company. Florida has an interest.\nThe third point is that the Fair Labor Standards\nAct is just as much a part of the law of Florida as any\ndecision of the Florida legislature or any -- or any\nopinion of its court. Under the Supremacy Clause, the\nlaws of the United States are the laws of Florida.\nFlorida courts have an obligation, an absolute duty, to\nenforce and uphold the Fair Labor Standards Act just like\nthey have to enforce and uphold the -- the Fourth\nAmendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIt -- it would be unrealistic to say that Florida has an\nobligation to uphold these laws, but then has no right or\nno interest in having them upheld in -- in Florida courts.\nSo for -- for those reasons, we think that\nShamrock Oil certainly has to apply to this case.\nIf you then go ahead and -- and apply the\nShamrock -- the Shamrock analysis to either the expressly\nprovided language of 1441 or the maintain language of the\nFair Labor Standards Act, you have to reach a decision\nthat these cases are -- are not properly to be subject to\nremoval.\nQUESTION: Well, one can certainly maintain an\naction in the Florida courts, and unless it's removed, it\nwill continue there. I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me that\nusing the word maintain means that the action must\nnecessarily remain there.\nMR. PINAUD: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, obviously\nit's our position that maintain in this case does mean\nthat it should remain in State court, and we think it's\nfor a couple of reasons.\nThe first reason we would say is that once you\napply the Shamrock analysis, maintain has to mean what we\nsay because in the very worst-case scenario, at least for\nour position, maintain is ambiguous or -- or capable of\ntwo different constructions. Everybody here has argued --\nthe Government argues and respondent argues -- that it's\nambiguous. Well, if it's ambiguous, if it's capable of\nmeaning you can maintain to a conclusion in State court,\nor if it is, rather, capable of meaning that you can only\nreally bring or commence it, then under Shamrock Oil, when\nwe apply that analysis, we should use the conclusion that\nmost limits removal, which would be to -- which would be\nto say that maintain means you continue on to -- to final\njudgment.\nQUESTION: Well, except -- except that you have\na later statute that says that it's removable unless --\nunless it is expressly provided otherwise.\nMR. PINAUD: Justice --\nQUESTION: And I don't think something that is\nambiguous expressly provides otherwise.\nMR. PINAUD: Well, Justice Scalia, I think what\nyou have to do, though, is I think when looking at the\nexpressly -- expressly otherwise provided language, you\nhave to -- first, you have to apply Shamrock Oil to that\nlanguage. Now, it's -- it's our position that when\nCongress used the word expressly provided, otherwise\nexpressly provided, it meant it in a textual sense.\nThat is, the word expressly is capable of two\ndifferent meanings itself. It can mean super clear or\nabsolutely unambiguous, or rather, it can mean grounded in\nsome text.\nmeanings, we think that when you apply Shamrock to\nexpressly, you choose the textual meaning because the\ntextual meaning shrinks removal considerably whereas the\nother meaning expands it. But I think --\nQUESTION: And your reading of the word\nmaintain -- and your whole case hangs on that word,\nmaintain -- suppose the case were brought initially in a\nFederal court, and there were -- there was a motion, a\n1404(a) transfer motion, to transfer the case from one\ndistrict court to another. I take it on your reading,\n1404(a) couldn't apply either because you would have to --\nif the plaintiff chose to maintain it in one Federal\ncourt, therefore it couldn't be switched to another?\nMR. PINAUD: Justice Ginsburg, I -- I don't\nthink that would be the case. I -- I don't think that\nthat's really analogous to the situation of bringing it\nfrom the State court to the Federal court. It's --\nit's -- the -- the forum choice I think is significantly\ndifferent. When the employee brings his action in State\ncourt, he's choosing that State -- that State forum, and\nit's for a reason. And -- and we think that -- that those\nreasons are -- are actually well articulated in -- in the\nGovernment's 1947 brief when they were actually supporting\nour position. So I -- I don't think it's --\nQUESTION:\nof the statute, maintain in any Federal or State court,\nany State court, any Federal court. So if you are\nconceding that you could transfer from one Federal court\nto another, then the plaintiff's choice doesn't inevitably\nprevail.\nMR. PINAUD: Well, I think then my -- my answer\nto that would have to be the rule from Shamrock Oil says\nif there's two reasonable interpretations, we -- we make a\ndecision that limits removal. I'm not sure it's\nreasonable to say that if you bring it in one Federal\ncourt, it can't be transferred to -- to another Federal\ncourt on -- on the -- the concerns would -- that would\ngive rise to it.\nIf I could go back, just a moment, to what I was\ntalking about, the -- the expressly provided language,\naddressing your question, Justice Scalia. We also think\nthat the expressly provided language has to be the textual\nbasis based upon this -- this Court's construction of\n28 U.S.C. 2283. That's the anti-injunction statute. In\nthat statute, Congress has provided that no -- that no\nFederal court shall issue an injunction to enjoin a State\ncourt proceeding unless expressly authorized by Congress.\nWe're dealing with expressly provided language in 1441.\nWe see the language as completely indistinguishable.\nIn Mitchum v. Foster, this Court construed that\nlanguage in 2283 as saying, look, that language does not\nmean that you have to have a -- a statute that says you\ncan issue an injunction. Rather, what the Court said was,\nwe look at the scope -- we look at the purpose and intent\nof the statute and say is the purpose of -- and intent of\nthe statute to allow an injunction. So really, what the\nCourt is saying in -- in Mitchum --\nQUESTION: That was just a magic language case.\nI mean, I think all it was saying is you don't have to use\nthe -- the very words so long as you have clearly made\nthat disposition, but I don't know that I would go so far\nas to say that it -- it stands for the proposition that\nsomething has been expressly provided for when there is\nsimply an ambiguous provision that might be interpreted\nthat way, but then, on the other hand, might not be\ninterpreted that way, which is -- which is what I think\nyou have to fairly say about maintain.\nI -- I don't think your maintain argument goes\nanywhere unless you apply to it the -- the rule of\npreference that you're urging upon us, that -- that you\nhave to interpret it so as to prevent removal rather than\npermit it. But that -- that preference is eliminated by\nthe later statute unless you -- unless you interpret that\nexpressly to mean that an ambiguous provision expressly\nprovides, and I just find it hard -- hard to swallow that.\nAnd I just don't see any of our cases that -- do you have\na case that deals with what was truly an ambiguous\nprovision and -- and nonetheless said that it expressly\nprovided for something?\nMR. PINAUD: I -- I don't have -- there -- there\nis no case that I know of that would be on point in -- in\nthis situation, Justice Scalia. But I would also add that\nwe do not -- though we think that the first analysis\nshould start with Shamrock because -- the first analysis\nof maintain should start with Shamrock because at best\neveryone -- everyone agrees that the statute is ambiguous\nand that is -- that is, that the respondent and the\nGovernment would say, well, it could mean this but maybe\nit doesn't. I don't think we say that it's -- that\neverything hangs or falls on Shamrock necessarily.\nIf you look at the way maintain was used in the\nFair Labor Standards Act, we think that the word maintain\nis an express prohibition -- prohibition on its own. This\nis not just our opinion. This was the opinion of the --\nof the majority of judges, the majority of courts that\nconstrued the statute prior to the 1948 amendment. It was\nalso the opinion of the United States back in 1947.\nQUESTION: What's the reason? I mean, leaving\nthe word out of it, I mean, normally the background rule\nis -- this is an -- case arising under Federal law, and\nthe background rule through removal is if either party\nwants to go into Federal court, you can. Now, you say\nthere's an exception for this statute. Why?\nMR. PINAUD: We believe that the word\nmaintain --\nQUESTION: I understand the linguistic point.\nI'm saying leave the linguistic point out. Why?\nMR. PINAUD: Justice Breyer, I'm not exactly\nsure why we --\nQUESTION: What -- what reason would there be\nthat people would want to make an exception for this\nstatute, the normal -- I'm not saying there is none. I\njust want to know what the reason is. The -- the\nnormal -- I would be just repeating myself. Have you got\nwhat I'm saying?\nMR. PINAUD: I -- I think I understand what\nyou're saying now --\nQUESTION: Yes, all right.\nMR. PINAUD: -- Your Honor.\nThe -- the reason why Congress wanted an\nexception in the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow\nemployees to bring these cases in -- in State court --\nQUESTION: Or Federal, yes. Give them a choice.\nMR. PINAUD: Well --\nQUESTION: Is because?\nplace. Right?\nMR. PINAUD: Well, they can -- they can bring it\nin -- in either place. I mean, there would be no reason\nwhy Congress --\nQUESTION: The reason why Congress would want\nemployees to have a choice, but would not want the\ndefendant to have the choice or bring it to State court,\nunlike other Federal statutes is?\nMR. PINAUD: Because in 1938, when this statute\nwas passed, it was difficult for many employees around the\ncountry to -- to effectively vindicate their rights for\nunpaid overtime if they had to go to Federal court. This\nis --\nQUESTION: Mr. Pinaud, that's the same thing\nwith respect to the FELA, and -- and Congress therefore\nexpressly provided that if a railroad worker brings a case\nin State court, it cannot be removed. And Congress was\nresponding to the problem of the person who would find it\ndifficult to go to the big city to litigate in the Federal\ncourt rather than stay in the State court close to home.\nAnd so doesn't the -- the fact that Congress expressly\nprovided that FELA cases are not removable cut against\nyou?\nMR. PINAUD: Justice Ginsburg, I -- there are\ncertainly cases -- certainly statutes where Congress has\nsaid this is not removable. We don't think that Congress\nis to be held to a standard where they have to use magic\nlanguage in order to prohibit removal. We think that\nthe -- the real analysis should be what was Congress\nintending by the statute at issue or else you --\nQUESTION: But -- but before the -- the 19 --\nwhat was it -- what? 1445 -- before 1948, were FELA cases\nremovable?\nMR. PINAUD: I'm not sure. I -- I will say\nthis. Before 1948, you know, Congress had used language\nin other statutes that said you can't remove it, and --\nand we recognize that. But if you -- if you hold Congress\nto this magic language statute, then -- then nothing they\ncould do or nothing they could intend would matter unless\nthey use this specific language, and we're not sure that\nthat's what the standard should be.\nQUESTION: But we have a string of specific\nstatutes, and then we have 1445 that lists in a row\nnon-removable actions, a catalog of actions that are not\nremovable. And this one is left out. Wouldn't one infer\nfrom that, well, they --\nMR. PINAUD: Well -- I'm sorry.\nThe -- the Reviser's Notes to the -- the 1948\nrevisions are rather meticulous. They talk about\neverything they're accomplishing and what they're trying\nto do. I -- I think it's noteworthy that with all the\nchanges that were made to the other sections, like\nsection (c), the other subsections, that in order to\naccept the proposition proposed by respondent, you would\nhave to conclude that Congress throughout, with these\nother sections of 1441, certainly intended to contract\nremoval, but yet with 1441(a), it grossly expanded\nremoval. I mean, this is a time now where Fair Labor\nStandards Act cases were generally considered to be not\nremovable. That was the prevailing opinion.\nThere's no mention in the -- in the Reviser's\nNote or any of the history to the statute that -- that\nCongress even thought about the Fair Labor Standards Act,\nso I think the more realistic assumption in the enaction\nof -- of that legislation was that Congress accepted\nthe -- the prevailing opinion which was that maintain was\ngood enough, that maintain was an express prohibition\nagainst removal.\nThe -- when you're looking at the word maintain,\nalso I think it's to see obviously the -- the public\npolicy concerns that I was just addressing with Justice\nBreyer, but we do think it's important, as did the\nGovernment back in 1947, that in enacting this\nlegislation, as it was -- originally appeared back when it\nwas passed, Congress used the word maintain within 38\nwords in the same sentence. Congress said an action may\nbe maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction, and\nthen 38 words later, it said it may be maintained by an\nagent or representative of the employee. If you were\nto -- if you were to assume that maintained does not mean\nwhat this Court essentially has said it meant in the\nGeorge Moore and Smallwood cases -- and that is that\nmaintain means to -- to continue on -- to continue or\nuphold, continue on foot a suit already commenced --\nQUESTION: When -- when you say that the -- the\nprovision said it could be maintained by an employee, that\nsounds more like a synonym for brought by the agent of the\nemployee, that the action could be brought an agent of the\nemployee, which of course does not help you.\nMR. PINAUD: Well, the way I think we look at\nit, Mr. Chief Justice, is certainly Congress could not\nhave meant by saying it could be maintained by an agent of\nan employee that he can file it, bring it, and then\nsomehow have the case ripped from his control. That is\nwhy we think that if you --\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that's the case in\nany case of a Federal statute covered by the removal\nstatute unless -- unless Congress says otherwise. I mean,\nto say it's ripped from his control by being removed, that\nhappens all the time.\nMR. PINAUD: Oh, no. I'm sorry, Mr. Chief\nJustice. That -- that's not what I mean. I don't -- I'm\ntalking about when -- when the Fair Labor Standards Act\nwas originally enacted -- it -- it no longer appears with\nthis language.\nWhen it was originally enacted, it said, an\naction under this section may be maintained in any court\nof competent jurisdiction, which we all agree is --\nincludes a State court. And it also said in the same\nsentence that that action can be maintained by an agent or\nrepresentative of the employee so that he didn't have to\ndo it himself. Somebody else could do it for him.\nAnd the point that we're making is certainly\nwhen Congress said that that other person can maintain it,\nthey didn't mean that that person could start the case and\nthen have the case ripped from him and have somebody else\ntake it over. So if you -- if you --\nQUESTION: Well, ripped from him in what manner?\nMR. PINAUD: Well, that's exactly it, Mr. Chief\nJustice. If -- if you were to accept the argument\nproposed by respondent, you would have to accept that\nthe -- the agent or representative of the employee in 1938\ncould file the case, but then after he filed it, somebody\nelse or someone would have the authority to divest him of\nhis right to prosecute it.\nQUESTION: Are -- are you talking about removal?\nMR. PINAUD: No.\nQUESTION: So you -- you -- when --\nMR. PINAUD: I'm --\nQUESTION: -- you say ripped from him, you're\nnot talking about the effect of removal.\nMR. PINAUD: No.\nQUESTION: What are you talking about?\nMR. PINAUD: I am talking about what could the\nword -- I -- I was responding to a -- a question by\nJustice Ginsburg about the definition and -- and so forth\nof maintain. And the point I was making is that maintain\nhas to mean more than simply start or bring or something\nlike that just because, if for no other reason -- if you\nput aside Shamrock and you put aside the policy arguments,\nfor no other reason that Congress in this statute, in the\nFair Labor Standards Act, when it enacted it, used the\nmaintain twice, one to mean you can maintain the suit and\none to mean that a person can maintain it for you on your\nbehalf. And obviously, if Congress is going to give the\nemployee the right to have an agent maintain the suit for\nhim or her, certainly they didn't mean you can just bring\nit and then somehow, not for removal purposes, but you\nwon't have the authority any more to prosecute it.\nQUESTION:\nyou're representing says, I don't want you, I want another\nrepresentative. Then you can no longer maintain it.\nMR. PINAUD: Well, I -- that's -- I suppose that\nwould probably be the -- be the case, but I -- I think\nthat's -- I think that's more -- that's more akin to\ndismissal. I mean, if an employee brings a case in State\ncourt and brings a case in Federal court, I mean, they can\nalways -- they wouldn't be maintaining it if they\nthemselves choose to -- to abandon it.\nQUESTION: No. He said, I -- I want -- the\nemployee says, I don't want you as my agent. I want\nsomebody else.\nMR. PINAUD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that\nwould be the employee's decision. That would be no\ndifferent than saying an employee can maintain the case in\nState court when --\nQUESTION: I'm just questioning your -- your\nsaying no one could -- you couldn't wrench the case from\nthe agent because the word maintain is used. Well, of\ncourse, the employee could wrench it from him and give it\nto somebody else.\nMR. PINAUD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nemployee could wrench it from him just as the employee who\nwas maintaining his suit could choose to dismiss it. I\nmean, the employee controls the suit.\nanalogous to the -- to the employee's power --\nQUESTION: But nobody else could appoint an\nagent. So I can't see the other wrencher in the picture.\nMR. PINAUD: Well, if the -- the point I -- I am\ntrying to make is that if this representative is\nmaintaining the suit for the employee, if it only means\nbring, then one could conceivably fashion reasons why that\nperson wouldn't have a -- would not be able to continue on\nfoot that suit aside from the employee.\nI -- I know we're kind of dealing with -- with\nthe semantics of the word, but I think it's important to\nshow that the word means more than just bring or commence.\nAt this same time also -- and we've cited the statutes in\nour brief -- the -- the Government passed a whole host of\nlaws where they used words like bring and commence. Why\nchoose the word maintain if it doesn't mean something --\nsomething more in -- in this case?\nAlso -- and I know I've mentioned this a couple\ntimes -- the word maintain itself -- it was the prevailing\nopinion back then, before 1948, that maintain was express.\nThat is the exact language that the Government used in its\nbrief filed in the Johnson case, that this was an express\nprohibition against removal. So these are the people that\nlived contemporaneous at the time, that understood the --\nthe public policy arguments of it, that understood the --\nthe semantics of it, that understood presumably the intent\nof it. And we think that that -- those are entitled to\nsome weight.\nThere's -- you know, there is another argument\nthat is addressed by respondent that, you know, State\ncourt judges are -- are not competent to handle these --\nthese kind of things. Or I shouldn't say competent, but\nthey're not experienced enough to handle it and so forth\nand so on. We don't think that that's realistic. State\ncourts handle matters of Federal jurisdiction all the\ntime. We depend upon State courts to interpret the\nConstitution and properly apply the Fourth, Fifth, other\namendments. There's no reason why they -- they can't\nhandle Fair Labor Standards Act cases, and they handle\nthem all the time. We filed many -- we have brought many\nFair Labor Standards Act cases. Most are removed to\nFederal court because removing to Federal court makes the\ncase take a lot longer.\nQUESTION: No one would suggest that a State\ncourt isn't competent to hear an ordinary tort case, an\nordinary contract case, but if there's a diversity of\ncitizenship, it can be removed to the Federal court.\nRemoval doesn't mean that the State court is in -- in any\nrespect incompetent.\nMR. PINAUD: I agree.\nmeans that the State court is incompetent. I -- I was\naddressing an argument made that essentially that, well,\nState court judges don't have enough experience, they're\nnot -- Federal courts are better at handling these things.\nI don't think that that's fair nor realistic. State\ncourts handle these matters all the time.\nFair Labor Standards Act cases are not overly\ncomplex. They're certainly not as complicated as\nTitle VII cases which States handle all the time and\nhandle their own similar anti-discrimination cases all the\ntime. So there -- there's just no -- that particular\nargument made by respondent we don't believe has much\nimport.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nQUESTION: Fine, Mr. Pinaud.\nMR. PINAUD: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hament.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. HAMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HAMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSince 1875, a defendant in a civil action has\nhad a right to remove a case arising under Federal law to\na U.S. district court.\nin 28 U.S.C. 1441(a), which authorizes a civil action --\nthe removal of a civil action of which the Federal\ndistrict court has original jurisdiction except as\notherwise expressly -- otherwise expressly prohibited by\nan act of Congress. The except as otherwise expressly\nprovided language was added in 1948.\nThe court below correctly ruled that respondent\nhad a right to remove this case for three reasons.\nFirst, the plain language of 1441(a) which\nallows removal of a case arising under Federal law, such\nas a Fair Labor Standards Act case, unless Congress has\nexpressly prohibited removal. There is nothing in the\ntext of the Fair Labor Standards Act or its legislative\nhistory which even mentions the word removal much less\nexpressly prohibits it.\nSecond, Congress has explicitly prohibited\nremoval in a series of enactments, and when it has done\nso, it has used very explicit language directly referring\nto removal.\nThird, the words, may be maintained, in any\ncourt -- or any Federal or State court of competent\njurisdiction in the Fair Labor Standards Act is identical\nto language that Congress has used in other statutes,\nincluding the Family Medical Leave Act and the Employee\nPolygraph Protection Act.\nremoval is barred under the Fair Labor Standards Act, then\nthis would affect those statutes. And again, there is\nnothing in the text of those statutes which suggests that\nCongress was attempting to prohibit removal. The word is\nnot mentioned in the text or the legislative history.\nWhen Congress has prohibited removal in a series\nof statutes, starting in 1910, it has very directly used\nthe word removal, and this has happened both before and\nafter it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938.\nIn fact, in 1948, Congress created a section of\nthe 28 -- Title 28 under section 1445 and entitled it\nNon-Removable Actions.\nIn 1910, Congress stated that certain\nrailroad -- cases against railroads under the Federal\nEmployer Liability Act, FELA, that actions arising under\nthose laws may not be removed -- used the words, may not\nbe removed.\nIn 1914, Congress passed an enactment stating\nthat certain actions against common carriers may not be\nremoved.\nIn 1933, they passed the Securities Act and used\nthe words, shall not be removed.\nSo these laws were in place using very direct\nlanguage when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in\n1938.\nSince the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted,\nwe have examples of four different laws that were passed\nby Congress, some in 1441(a), some stand alone, that use\nthe words, may not be removed or shall not be removed.\nThe last one was the actions under the Violence Against\nWomen's Act of 1994. So we know from example after\nexample what Congress had in mind in 1948 when it used the\nwords, except as other expressly provided.\nQUESTION: But the Wage and Hour Division\ndidn't. In 1947, it expressed the opinion that Fair Labor\nStandards Act cases were not removable.\nMR. HAMENT: Number one, Justice Ginsburg, at\nthis point the Department of Labor has changed their\nposition, and I think that's because of the addition in\n1948 of the very express standard that except as otherwise\nexpressly provided by an act of Congress, this type of\ncase would be removable.\nQUESTION: Well, what do we care what their\nposition is? This is not a matter that's within their\nadministration, is it? Do they administer the -- the\nremovability of matters in -- in Federal courts?\nMR. HAMENT: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, you know, their -- their view on\nthat matter is -- is no more persuasive than -- than\nyours, if I may say so.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And yours might be very persuasive.\nThey have the --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: They have the power to persuade, and\nthey're knowledgeable.\nMR. HAMENT: Respondent's relying on the view of\nCongress which set forth a very clear standard in 1441(a)\nthat these types of actions are removable unless expressly\nprohibited, and we're relying on Congress.\nQUESTION: Is your position they were never\nremovable or that the law changed in 1948?\nMR. HAMENT: Our position is that they were\nnever removable.\nQUESTION: And the -- the Department was just\nwrong on its opinion.\nMR. HAMENT: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Though what he I guess was driving at\nis what the -- in 1938, the year I was born, I'm in San\nFrancisco, but there are a lot of workers down in Salinas\nputting artichokes in cans. And their employer perhaps\nwas violating the law, so they go into the State court in\nSalinas and the employer runs up to San Francisco. And\nonce he can remove that case to San Francisco, it's too\nexpensive for the employee to run up there. And that was\nwhy your opponent says they -- they wrote this statute.\nThey used the word maintained, and the administrator who\nwas present at the creation, so to speak, had followed\nthat for quite a long period of time.\nNow, you're -- you're saying look at the\nlanguage. The language just isn't good enough. Is there\nanything else you want to add on that?\nMR. HAMENT: Well, Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: You know, on the purposive part.\nMR. HAMENT: Yes. Yes. Justice Breyer,\nthere -- there is no legislative history to support that\nCongress was intending to prohibit removal for that or\nfor -- or for any other reason. And -- and yes, in --\nthere are small claims that are possible under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act, but there are also very large claims,\nincluding very large collective actions. If Congress\nwanted to put a limit on the amount of claim that could be\nbrought in a Federal court, then Congress could certainly\ndo that, as it has done in other statutes, and as -- as it\nhas also done in limiting removal of certain cases based\non amount. But Congress hasn't chosen to do that.\nTurning to the point of the effect of a ruling\nthat these words, may be maintained, could bar removal\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act, as mentioned and as\ncounsel for the petitioner concedes, this would also\nprohibit removal under the Family Medical Leave Act, the\nEmployee Polygraph Protection Act --\nQUESTION: Well, it might if you -- it might not\nif you, in fact, did put considerable weight on the\nknowledgeable views of the -- of the administrators who\nwere present at that time and the presence of a good\nreason for wanting to have achieved that result. I -- I\ngrant you, I see problems with the approach I'm\nenunciating, but -- but it wouldn't necessarily change\nthose other acts.\nMR. HAMENT: I -- I think the problem would be\nthat the Court would have to -- to eliminate from 1441(a)\nthe expressly provided otherwise language to -- to achieve\nthat result.\nQUESTION: Is it meant to apply retroactively in\n1948 to those statutes passed preceding 1948?\nMR. HAMENT: I believe -- I believe it was. If\nyou look at the timing of the addition of that language in\n1948, at that time, the right to remove didn't have the\nexpressly provided otherwise exception. It just was a\nright to remove, and it was at that time codified in\n28 U.S.C., section 71, which had the right to remove.\nBut coupled in that same paragraph were two\nexamples of cases where Congress said there was no right\nto remove, the FELA action and the action under the\nInterstate Commerce Act dealing with loss of -- or injury\nunder certain actions against common carriers. So right\nin the same paragraph was this language, may not remove\nthese two types of cases.\nWhen they reorganized, they moved that language\nto 1440 -- 1441 -- 1445 and I think they were just making\nclear, when they left the right to remove, that they may\nfrom time to time, as they have, expressly prohibit\nremoval of certain actions. So I -- I think the -- the\naddition of that language changed nothing. It is just\nsimply adopting what the Congress had already applied as a\nstandard.\nQUESTION: Are you saying then what it did was\nto clarify what was ambiguous before, and the\nclarification made it apparent that the Wage and Hour\nDivision had been wrong? Is that -- is that your\nargument?\nMR. HAMENT: I would be a little disingenuous if\nI said I think that Congress had looked to the Wage and\nHour brief or the Johnson decision in doing that. I'm not\nsure that they did and my guess is --\nQUESTION: But in any -- in any event, they\nclarified --\nMR. HAMENT: Right.\nQUESTION:\nof the Wage and Hour Division --\nMR. HAMENT: To the extent they --\nQUESTION: -- meaning --\nMR. HAMENT: -- considered it, they overruled it\nbecause Johnson in that case, although it reached the rule\nthat -- that there was no removal by implication, said\nrepeatedly in the decision that Congress was not clear in\nexpressing its intent. So to the extent that Congress was\npaying attention to Johnson, it overruled it with the\nexpressly provided other language in 1948.\nIf removal were barred in this case, just to\nfinish on the point of the effect on these other laws, you\ncould have a very problematic situation, which I'm sure\nCongress never intended, of having, for example, an age\ndiscrimination case which would not be removable under the\nADEA, but a race discrimination case under Title VII that\nis removable, or a handicap or disability discrimination\ncase under the American with Disabilities Act which would\nbe removable. You'd have ERISA claims which would be\nremovable, but not claims for leave benefits under the\nFamily Medical Leave Act. You'd have a Title VII sex\ndiscrimination claim due to unequal pay that would be\nremovable, but not an Equal Pay Act case under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act. And again, there's no indication\nthat Congress, in using the words, may be maintained -- it\nsimply confers right of action -- would have ever intended\nthis effect.\nFinally, I'd like to just briefly address\npetitioner's argument in the reply brief dealing with\nMitchum v. Foster. They're arguing that there's similar\nlanguage in the anti-injunction statute which says that\nexcept as expressly authorized, a State court\ninjunction -- a -- a Federal court may not enjoin a State\ncourt, and relies on Mitchum. This reliance is misplaced.\nFirst, the underlying law in Mitchum was the\nCivil Rights Act, the 42 U.S.C. 1983 action. And the\nCourt determined that the power to enjoin a State court\nunder that statute was inherent in the necessary and\nindispensable power to remedy civil rights violations.\nAnd the -- the right to enjoin State court actions was\nabsolutely essential to the purpose of 1983.\nSecond, the Court observed that it had a long\nhistory of making exceptions to the anti-removal statute\nwithout directly referring to the anti-removal statute or\nState court injunctions.\nAnd third, in --\nQUESTION: Are you talking about the\nAnti-Injunction Act or the anti-removal statute?\nMR. HAMENT: Anti-injunction statute, I'm sorry.\nAnd third, in Vendo Company versus Lektro, this\nCourt said that the fact that in Mitchum there was no\ndirect reference to the anti-injunction statute or staying\nState court injunctions was cured by the fact that there\nwas relevant legislative history.\nNone of those factors are present here.\nObviously, the Fair Labor Standards Act does not rise and\nfall on this removal issue. Second, Congress has\nrepeatedly made exceptions very expressly and directly\nreferring to removal when it made an exception. And\nthird, there is no legislative history.\nFor these reasons, the respondent respectfully\nrequests that this Court affirm the Eleventh Circuit's\ndecision that this case was removable.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hament.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe general policy of the removal statute is to\ngive the defendant the same right as the plaintiff to have\nhis case heard in Federal court. The removal statute\nachieves that objective by permitting the defendant to\nremove an action to -- to Federal court if the plaintiff\ncould have originally filed his suit there.\nThere is no dispute in this case that the\nplaintiff could have filed this action in Federal court\neven had the -- even had the defendant preferred that\nthe -- that a State court adjudicate the dispute. The\npolicies underlying the removal statute are therefore\nserved by giving the defendant the same right to insist\nupon a Federal forum.\nNow, the removal statute creates a narrow\nexception to this policy when another statute expressly\nbars removal. And Congress has foreclosed removal in a\nnumber of statutes in direct and explicit terms by\nproviding most notably in section 1445 of Title 28 that,\nquote, a civil action in any State court may not be\nremoved, or in other statutes that no case brought in any\nState court shall be removed. There is no similar\nprohibition in the Fair Labor Standards Act, which does\nnot address the issue of removal at all.\nThe language in the Fair Labor Standards Act\nproviding that an action may be maintained in any Federal\nor State court of competent jurisdiction does not\nexpressly foreclose removal. Rather, it grants an\nemployee a cause of action over which State and Federal\ncourts have concurrent jurisdiction.\nThe language does not purport to trump or\noverride generally applicable rules that affect the\ndisposition of the proceeding such as whether the action\nmay be stayed or transferred under other express statutory\nprovisions.\nQUESTION: What you're saying sounds so\nsensible. Why was it that a number of Federal courts\ndidn't get it, Ms. Blatt? There was quite a division of\nauthority on this question and the Wage and Hour Division\noriginally took the other view.\nQUESTION: You want to be very careful about\nanswering how Federal courts don't get things.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: There was division and there still\nis division today, but we think that the 1948 revision\nmakes amply clear that what's required is an express bar.\nAnd when compared to the established template of the other\nstatutes where Congress has foreclosed jurisdiction in\ndirect, unambiguous terms, it makes clear that the -- the\ncorrect answer is that the actions are subject to removal.\nAnd the example I wanted to give was about why\nthe word maintain doesn't speak to how the action may be\ndisposed of under other provisions was a bankruptcy\npetition. Under Federal law that would operate to stay\nthe continuation of any judicial proceeding, and a similar\nresult would hold true under State and Federal venue\nprovisions. And we think the same result is true under a\nFederal removal legislation.\nThere's nothing in the Fair Labor Standards Act\nthat suggests that the plaintiff's initial choice of a\nState law -- State court forum must prevail over the\ndefendant's express statutory right to remove an action\nunder section 1441(a), and we think the employee's right\nto sue accordingly is subject to removal.\nAnd the only thing I -- I'd like to address in\nresponse to the petitioner's argument is this principle of\nnarrow construction. We don't think that principle\napplies for basically two reasons.\nAnd the first is that because there was no\ndispute about the Federal court's jurisdiction to hear\nthis case, again notwithstanding Florida's interest in the\ncase or even if the -- had the defendant preferred the\nState court forum, the plaintiff could have insisted that\nthe Federal court hear the dispute. And thus the only\nrelevant inquiry is not one of narrow interpretation, but\nit's a standard that's set forth on the -- under the plain\nterms of the statute itself, and that is whether another\nstatute expressly bars removal. And we think for the\nreasons that have been given, even if one were to apply a\nprinciple of narrow construction, it would not be\nplausible to construe the word maintain as an express bar\nto removal.\nAnd for those reasons, we would urge that this\nCourt affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Pinaud, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. PINAUD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINAUD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Ginsburg, you had asked respondent a\nquestion about whether or not the -- the 1948 amendments\ncould have in any way been intended to -- to clarify the\nremovability of Fair Labor Standards Act cases. And as --\nas I think I mentioned earlier, I -- I just wanted to add,\nI think respondent agreed with that. I don't agree\nbecause, as I stated, if you look through the Reviser's\nNotes, they -- they are extraordinarily meticulous. They\nlist what they are doing and why --\nQUESTION: I didn't ask whether they intended\nto. I asked whether they did. I don't know that -- that\nCongress paid any attention to this particular Johnson\nagainst Butler Brothers case.\nMR. PINAUD: Oh, no. No, it did not. It\ncertainly did not. And I -- I think that is important.\nI -- I think also that these public policy\nconcerns that -- that Justice Breyer was -- was\ndiscussing, these are really very important concerns that\nwe don't think should be overlooked. This is a time where\nyou don't have an interstate highway system. You don't\nhave a whole lot of time -- a whole lot of lawyers who\nwant to practice in Federal court or who can practice in\nFederal court. There were claims at the time for as low\nas -- as low as $11. Even the cases today, when they're\nindividually brought, they're not typically enormous\ncases. These are -- these are employees suing for their\nwages, trying to have an opportunity to -- to collect them\nwithout it being inordinately long or inordinately\nimpractical. Nobody is going to take a case for $11 or\n$250.\nQUESTION: Was there ever a proposal made in\nCongress to give workers who have FLSA claims the same\nexpress provision that is there for railroad workers?\nMR. PINAUD: Not that we know of, but it's our\nposition that that would be because Congress, at the time\nit passed this law, believed it was express, that that was\nthe prevailing opinion, and that even now that was still\nthe opinion of about half of -- about half of the courts,\nhalf of -- half of the district courts. You know, this\nis -- district courts every day -- in fact, after this --\nI think just before this Court granted certiorari, there\nwas a district court in -- in Texas that said, absolutely\nthese cases need to be staying in State court.\nSo I think Congress didn't get -- I don't know\nwhy Congress didn't get involved in it, but I would think\nit would be because they thought maintained was express\nenough, that maintain was good enough.\nMr. Chief Justice, if there are no further\nquestions, I have nothing further.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Pinaud.\nMR. PINAUD: Thank you.\n"
