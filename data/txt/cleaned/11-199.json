BRINDLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRINDLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen determining whether an error affects\nsubstantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error\nstatute, courts should first begin the analysis with the\nerror itself, consider it in the context of the entire\nrecord, determine what potential impact it may have, and\nthen ask the question: Can the government prove to the\nrequisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair\nassurance -- that the error did not substantially impact\nthe verdict of the jury that heard the case?\nIt is impermissible for the reviewing court\nto merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a\nreasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this\njury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness\non that basis.\nKotteakos --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem --\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is I can accept that\nformulation certainly for purposes of this case. I just\ndon't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of\nthe court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test.\nIt didn't use the magic words, and it\nstarted out with let's look at the big picture, and it\nsaid, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and\nthis is a tough sell because. But then it quotes what\nhappens with the jury. It -- and it -- and it ends its\nanalysis for -- saying: We -- this evidence would have\nmoved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from\nanything it heard in the government's case.\nI just -- I just don't see that you have\nsupported your theory by what the -- by what the court\nsays.\nMR. BRINDLEY: Before the harmless-error\nanalysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have\nto decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him\nabsent the error. And so, the question that they ask\ndoesn't require any consideration of the error. And the\nconclusion they reach that he would be convicted without\nany consideration of the error also doesn't consider the\nerror.\nThey do not address the error or its impact\nat all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the\nextraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error.\nThey don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't\naddress it at all.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what\nthe error actually was? I see -- and you can add\nanother -- three potential things about these calls or\nthree potential errors: One, that they proved as a\nmatter of fact that she was biased. But, as the\nmajority points out, she already said she was before the\ntapes were played. So, whatever error may have been\noccasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth,\nit really was cumulative to an already admitted bias.\nThe second is some sort of ambiguous\nstatement by her that all of them were in trouble,\nmeaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by\nthe -- by Petitioner's lawyer. So, what was it that was\nerror that affected or influenced the jury among these\nthree choices?\nMR. BRINDLEY: The -- the statements from\ncounsel, two statements: One, that everyone was going\nto lose the case, which was repeated several times by\ngovernment counsel during the cross-examination of Ms.\nPerez.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was never referenced\nin the summations, however, or in the reply.\nMR. BRINDLEY: They were not specific -- the\nrecordings were referenced, and they told them to look\nat the recordings. They didn't reference that specific\nstatement. It was referenced three times in the\ncross-examination. When the witness suggested that\nit -- who was going to lose the case only referred to\nher husband, the government corrected her and said, no,\nit was everyone. And then they played the tape to make\nthat clear.\nThey also played a portion of a recording\nwhere it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez\nabout pleading guilty. Now, if you take those two\nstatements together for their truth, what they mean is\nthat counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he\nshould plead that way.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that's the error\nthat you think --\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think that's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- influenced this\ntrial?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think that's the most\nsubstantial one.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, tell me\nwhat in this record reflects that influence.\nMR. BRINDLEY: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The fact that they asked\nfor her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire\ndefense. So, what does the asking for her testimony\nshow that they were interested in that particular part\nof the transcript?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Well, asking for her\ntestimony shows that they were focused on the -- they\nwere asking for a transcript that would have contained\nthat part of the record. We don't -- we can't prove,\nand we don't have the burden -- I think that's\nimportant -- to prove that she -- they were focused on\nthat specific statement. However, they did ask for that\ntranscript.\nI also think they rendered the split verdict\nin the case, which is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which transcript? The\ntranscript of her testimony?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Her testimonies, both on\ndirect -- and then they asked for both, plural,\nindicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which\nwould have included these statements.\nAnd I don't think there's any way for the\ngovernment to prove on this record to any degree of\nassurance that they weren't concerned about that error,\nan error that I think if they took these things for\ntheir truth, then they could have thought he essentially\nconfessed to his lawyer. His lawyer knew he was guilty.\nThose are fair inferences if taken for their truth. And\nthen they could have disregarded all arguments that were\nmade on his behalf. That's a sort of error that could\ninfect the entire proceeding.\nAnd when you ask --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that the\ndifference between your position and the Government's\nposition is that the Government says the focus should be\non a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on\nthis particular jury?\nMR. BRINDLEY: That is one of the important\ndifferences. I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that I understand.\nBut beyond that I really don't understand the difference\nbetween the two positions.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I -- well, in the\nGovernment's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our\nreply, it seems that they support a very similar test to\nours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that\nyou can just look at a reasonable jury and how they\nwould view the evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me -- let me read\nyou two sentences and tell me whether you think there's\na difference between them. First one: \"Is there a fair\npossibility that this particular evidence caused the\njury to convict?\" Second statement: \"Is there a fair\npossibility that this jury would have\" -- \"that this\njury would have convicted without the evidence?\"\nDo you see a difference between those two?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I do.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference?\nMR. BRINDLEY: The difference is one of them\nwas going to focus on the entire record, which includes\nthe error. The other is going to focus on the evidence\nin the record without the error, and that's important,\nparticularly with an error like this, an error that\ncould have a pernicious effect that could affect a\nlarge, substantial part of this evidence, everything the\ndefendant presented. It's really --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I --\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- stop you there?\nI -- where in the Government's brief do you\nsee the statement that the analysis should not look to\nthe error, should not include the error?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Part of the Government's\nbrief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable\njury would convict him absent the error. That\nassessment doesn't require a consideration --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where --\nMR. BRINDLEY: -- of the error.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where exactly is\nthat in their brief? That the -- the question is\nwhether a jury would convict him without considering the\nerror. Because I look at the Government's brief, and\nthey have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error,\nwhy they think it's not important, why they -- you know.\nBut I don't see them saying you don't look at the error\nat all.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think there's a\nsignificant -- I don't have the exact citation.\nOn page 29, Your Honor, it indicates:\n\"Although the Court's analysis often has not focused\nexclusively on the overall strength of the government's\nproof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's\ndetermination of harmlessness can properly rest on the\nconclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is\nsufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of\nerroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have\naltered the outcome.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, exactly. In\nother words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the\nerroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered\nthe outcome.\nMR. BRINDLEY: If that's the -- and there's\nparts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with\nus in large part on what this test should be. And as\nfar as that goes, I think the problem is the majority\nbelow asked a different question and appeared to do a\ndifferent analysis.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What would you point at in\nthe majority opinion below that suggests that they did\nan analysis that didn't look at the error and its\npossible prejudicial effect?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Two things: First, the\nquestion that they asked. The question that they asked\nwas whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent\nthe error. There is no focus on this jury that heard\nthe case or this verdict. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where is that\nstatement? Where is that statement?\nMR. BRINDLEY: In the -- you mean in the\nmajority opinion?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. BRINDLEY: It's immediately prior to the\nharmless-error analysis.\nIf we go to page 16A of the appendix to our\ncert petition, it states at the bottom of that first\nparagraph: \"On appeal, the burden lies on the\ngovernment to prove that a reasonable jury would have\nreached the same verdict without the challenged\nevidence.\"\nThat's the question they're asking. That\nquestion doesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but in the context\nof the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they\nthen proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very\nend of its discussion -- what happened in this\nparticular case. And it concludes, from this evidence\nwe believe -- \"This evidence we believe would have moved\nthe jury to convict.\"\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think the problem is they\nasked that question, which I think is the wrong\nquestion. Kotteakos says you can't ask that question\nbecause you can't strip the error from the whole.\nThat's the question they ask. And to answer that\nquestion, you don't have to consider the error.\nThen I think it's important they didn't\naddress the error at all; they didn't address its\npotential impact, despite that dissent which laid out\nthat this is one of the most prejudicial errors you\ncould have in a trial. They ignored it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They say --\nimmediately after the sentence you gave us, they say\n\"looking at the evidence as a whole.\"\nMR. BRINDLEY: They do say that. But then\nlater on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that\nhere's where the evidence was. And I think it's\nimportant that the only evidence they talk about is the\ngovernment's evidence, and they talk about it in a way\nthat views the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe government.\nIn their harmless-error analysis, they don't\naddress Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more\nimportant thing is they don't address the error at all.\nThey don't even disagree with the dissent's contention\nthat it's this terribly prejudicial error.\nInstead, they do what many of the courts\nbelow have been doing when they do this guilt-based\napproach to answer this question. They focus on the\ngovernment's evidence viewed in the light most favorable\nto the government and then find, well, he could be\nconvicted on that basis by a reasonable jury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You didn't -- you didn't\nread the whole thing. I -- it's a little hard to\nunderstand. And looking at the transcript on page 769,\nam I right? I want to get my own understanding right.\nAt that moment your client's lawyer, who they call\n\"Beau\" -- is that right?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes, that was me, Judge.\nYes, Your Honor, yes, it was me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right.\nYour client's lawyer, namely you --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- has not yet seen the\nclient; is that right? They think you haven't seen the\nclient yet. They say somewhere you haven't even talked\nto him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau. He\nhasn't seen his lawyer yet. They say that two\nparagraphs earlier.\nSo, is that right, basically, that they\nthink that, anyway? You see at the top of the page,\nabout six lines down: He hasn't even talked to the\nlawyer yet. He hasn't even talked to Beau.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think that actually what\nthey're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had\ntalked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they're talking about\nthe lawyer. All right. And what you're trying to do,\nas far as I can read this, is they think what you're\ntrying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty. Is that\nthe fair thrust of this?\nMR. BRINDLEY: There's some discussion\nbetween them --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think it means?\nMR. BRINDLEY: There's -- it's hard for me\nto tell exactly what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, it's hard\nto tell what they're talking about, I grant you that. I\nthought they were talking about trying -- that you\nthought it would be better if everybody got some kind of\nagreement worked out.\nAnd then she says, Perez's wife: \"How can I\nnot worry?\" He says: \"I don't understand what's going\non.\" Which is fair comment. \"But it's not the way\nBeau -- he's putting it two different ways. If he\ndidn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's\na different story. If you don't ask him\" --\nThen she says: \"Yes, he's saying that\neverybody's going to lose. He's saying that whatever\nhe wants to say. I don't believe him.\"\nWell, by the time I got through reading\nthat, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and\nI thought it sounded like they're talking about: Let's\nall make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.\nAnd -- and I could see that you could say\nthat's prejudicial. I could also see that the\ngovernment could say it isn't prejudicial. And it's\npretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking\nthey were really not thinking about that error. I mean\nthat was -- or not an error. I mean, of course, they'd\nbe thinking about that; that was the issue.\nAnd as I read the opinion, they\nsaid, well, there's so much other evidence in the case,\nand in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't\n-- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you\ndidn't, say, take it for the truth.\nAnd the other, dissenting judge, common, is\nthinking: No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard\nto understand what it means, but there's an implication\nthere the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in\ncontext that might have made a difference. So, he comes\nto a different conclusion.\nThat's what I saw going on. And I didn't\nsee some big war of standards. I just saw judges\ndisagreeing about a fairly tough question in an\nindividual case. So, what can you say to make me change\nmy mind and think this is a war of standards that we\nought to --\nMR. BRINDLEY: Well, because -- I think -- I\nthink the most important thing is what I've already\nsaid, is the question they ask isn't about the error,\nand they don't address it at all. And when you consider\na dissent with that robust of language, the idea that\nthey wouldn't address it at all is problematic.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, would it satisfy\nyou in your opinion if we said: We aren't finding your\nopinion totally clear. And, luckily, people don't have\nthe right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we\nhave the right to send cases back to you on that basis.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we would\nlike you to clarify whether you do or did or did not\ntake in the actual transcript page there, when you\nreached your conclusion.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I don't think that would be\nsufficient, because I think the important thing here is\nthat they be required to ask the right question, to\nfocus on this jury that heard the case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean,\nI guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating\nJustice Alito's question, but it seems that you're\nparsing things pretty closely. If I ask the question\nwhether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm\nasking pretty much the same question as whether without\nthat verdict the -- whether without that error, the\nverdict would be the same. That seems like just two\nways of saying the same thing.\nNow, if what you're saying is put aside that\nformulation, there are lots of courts that are doing\nsomething wrong, which is that they're not looking at\nthe error and its possible prejudicial effect at all,\nthen I understand the argument; but then I ask the\nquestion, well, is that what this court did?\nMR. BRINDLEY: And I think that the -- by\nasking the question in that way and talking only about a\nreasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying\nabsent the error and you start looking at the evidence\nwithout the error, you're looking at a case the jury\ndidn't hear. And I think that's the biggest problem.\nIf you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then\nthe reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment\nabout a case they didn't hear.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, look, if you -- if you\nwin, your client will get a new trial. Let's suppose\nthat the new trial is exactly like the trial that took\nplace. Every single thing is the same except the error\nis corrected. All right. Isn't that essentially the\nharmless-error analysis?\nMR. BRINDLEY: No, I don't think so.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I don't think so, because I\nthink if you do the analysis that way and you say the\nerror is corrected, you don't take into account its\nimpact. The question has been to be whether it\ncontributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the\nverdict would be the same in another trial. That's\nwhere that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was\nworried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in\nNeder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's\nprovince, we have to do an exacting review of the entire\nrecord including -- that would include the error,\nobviously, and its impact.\nAnd here this court didn't address the error\nor its potential impact, and I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you -- are you saying\nthat it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been\nthe same by this jury if the error had not been made?\nYou're --\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes, I am saying that. I'm\nsaying that the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the test\nis whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did,\nit doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have\nbeen pronounced absent that evidence?\nMR. BRINDLEY: That is correct, Your Honor,\nyes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, what is\nharmless error? Every error is harmful. Every error\nthat's -- that's there contributes to the verdict.\nThere's no such thing as harmless error.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think -- I don't think that\nshould be the formulation of the test. I think it has\nto have a -- what the government has to be able to do is\nprove to the necessary degree of certitude that the\nerror doesn't substantially impact the verdict. And the\nreason I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does that\nmean? To say that it doesn't substantially impact the\nverdict means the verdict would have been the same\ndespite this evidence. But you're saying, no, that's\nnot the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to\nthe verdict. The Government says, well, it did, but the\nverdict would have been the same anyway.\nThat's what harmless error is, it seems to\nme.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think what the -- when you\nask the question about whether the verdict contributed\nsubstantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error\ncontributed substantially to the verdict, what you're\ndoing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire\nrecord and you have to look at the error's impact. And\nwhen you do that, you can make a determination whether\nthere's anything in the record that would allow the\ngovernment to prove to the right degree of assurance\nthat it didn't.\nNow, you could -- it could be the case that\nyou look at all of the evidence and you can say, well,\nin light of all the other evidence, the error was\ncumulative, or it was essentially uncontested. And then\nyou can find that error is harmless. It couldn't have\ncontributed to the verdict, and we know that to the\nright degree of certitude.\nI think the problem comes in when you're\ntalking about this reasonable jury and whether they\nwould convict without the error. That's some other\ntrial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we get a little\nmore practical here? I think I understood your basic\nargument, which is: My defense was by this one woman,\nthe wife of one of the codefendants. She tells a story,\nand if the jury had believed her story they would have\nacquitted your client.\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, I am\nassuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if\nI'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error\ncommitted affected her credibility in a meaningful way,\nthat that deprived you of a defense. Is that what\nyou're saying?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of the potential of\nconvincing the jury.\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely, in addition\nto the fact that the error -- if those things are taken\nfor their truth, they serve as an independent basis for\nconviction, believing he had essentially confessed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Now, assuming\nthat's your argument --\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I go back to my\nquestion. Okay? Because what you said to me earlier,\nit wasn't about believing her or not; it was about\nbelieving the defense attorney when -- whether the\ndefense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or\nnot.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think that -- well, I think\nthe two go hand in hand. I think that if they take these\nstatements for their truth, they could disbelieve her\nand the defense attorney who called her because the\ndefense attorney knew he was guilty and then called this\nwitness to say otherwise. I think that would in that\nsituation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the\ntruth. And I think the important thing about this whole\nanalysis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's --\nMR. BRINDLEY: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you\ntaking the position in this case that a reviewing court,\nunder no circumstance, could conclude that this error\nwas harmless? Or are you taking the position in this\ncase that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think,\ncommitted review error and we should send it back for\nthem to do it the right way?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I -- I am first saying that\nthe court committed review error. But I think -- I'm\nalso saying on top of that if you do the error -- review\nproperly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be\nformulated, then what this -- this case is going to come\ndown to is really one question, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you're -- and\nyou're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think\ndid say this error is harmful.\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes, of course.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, you're not saying\nthat it's just that they didn't use the right formula,\nbut you would say, given what occurred here, the\nimportance of this witness, that -- that this was a --\nthis was a harmful error?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes, absolutely. I -- I\nthink if you do the test appropriately and do the proper\nanalysis focused on this jury and the potential impact\nof the error, then this is a harmful error.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Back to Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is your argument something\nlike this? Let's assume there are 10 pieces of\nevidence. Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted.\nEvidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so\nprejudicial that that's all the jury looked at. There\nis a substantial likelihood of that.\nI think this is your argument: If the jury\nwas so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which\nwas improperly admitted, what would happen if we\nconcluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if\nthey had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted?\nWhat result?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think if you did the\nexamination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what\nyou're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through\n9, but you're not considering the possibility that you\ncould convict as an independent basis on 10. And the\ngovernment would have to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're not only saying it's\npossible to convict, but that likely, probably would\nhave happened.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I don't -- well, if the error\nis the error in this case, that's number 10, then I\nthink when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as\nit might be, I don't think there's any way on this\nrecord that the government can prove with fair assurance\nthat that didn't infect the jury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my hypothetical is\nthat the court of appeals says that if the jury had\nlooked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted\nbefore them in this trial, they would have convicted,\nlikely.\nNow, we -- then the hypothetical is: We\ndon't think they did because this item was so\nprejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they\nlooked at. Is that what your argument is? It seems to\nme that's stronger than the argument you're making. I'm\nnot sure even that works for you.\nMR. BRINDLEY: I -- the formulation you've\nstated, I agree with that. If number 10 is such that\nthere's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact\nthe jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think\nthey can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our\nargument. And the one reason I think it's most\nimportant in this case is because this case comes down\nto -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --\nessentially it's a circumstantial case. This isn't like\nHarrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence\nwhere this Court has found harmless error.\nThis is a case where the ultimate question\nis, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not\nguilty; if you don't, he is. And in order to find\nharmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a\ncold record making that credibility determination,\nsomething that this Court has continually said a\nreviewing court is not in a position to do. And when a\ncase can be ground down to the point where it's going to\ncome to a credibility determination about a witness the\nreviewing court did not see --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe the majority in\nthe court of appeals was wrong in its application of the\nharmless-error test. I didn't think that was the reason\nwhy we took this, why we took this case. What I'm\nconcerned about is the test. Now, the only aspect of --\nthe only thing that I understand that really\ndifferentiates your position from the Government with\nrespect to the test is whether the focus is on a\nrational jury or on this particular jury.\nAnd when you say the focus should be on this\nparticular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by\nthe -- by an appellate court? How is an appellate court\nsupposed to tell whether this particular jury was\ndifferent from a hypothetical rational jury?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Because this -- the reviewing\ncourt has to look at everything in the entire record.\nThat includes in this case the jury note. It includes\nin this case the split verdict. All of those things.\nAnd when you look at all of those things, you can get\ninsight into the jury that heard the case and how they\nviewed it.\nYou can also look at how a reasonable jury\nwould view the case as heuristic device to get back to\nwhat this jury thought. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought\nyour main point -- yes, you said \"this jury\" rather than\na hypothetical jury. But I thought your main point is\nthat what's wrong is to say strip out the infected\ntestimony, take that out, look at the rest of the\nrecord, and if the rest of the record warrants\nconviction, no harmless error.\nI thought that what you're saying is that\nthe basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to;\nare they looking to all of the evidence, or are they\njust asking the question, let's take out the tainted\nevidence, see if there's enough to convict?\nMR. BRINDLEY: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I\nagree with that. The problem is the question asked by\nthe majority strips out the error and it also focuses on\nthe reasonable jury rather than this jury.\nAnd with that, if there aren't any further\nquestions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Brindley.\nMr. Yang.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe harmless-error inquiry, as this Court\nexplained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately\non one question: Whether a rational jury -- and this is\na quote -- \"whether a rational jury would have found the\ndefendant guilty absent the error.\" Now --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, that does raise\nthe question that I think most separates you and Mr.\nBrindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito\nsuggested. So, let me give you a hypothetical.\nLet's say that this jury was not out for 8\nhours but was out for 8 days. And on the 7th day, a\nnote came from the jury, and the note said we really\nthink that these tape recordings are extremely\nimportant, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how\nimportant they are, and we'd like to listen to them\nagain. And they do that, and then they come back with\nthis compromise verdict.\nNow, what you are suggesting is that we\ncannot look at any of that. Essentially, the best proof\nthat's available to us about whether the error in fact\naffected this jury's decision, you would have a court\nclose its eyes to. And I guess -- why would that be?\nMR. YANG: Well, I don't believe our view is\nquite so firm. I think, as a general matter, our view\nis that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury\nmight or some subset of the jury might be considering is\ngenerally very unreliable. And that, in your case, the\nCourt shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what\nit should do is redirect the court back to the evidence\nthat was before the jury. Because if we're assuming a\nrational jury, there often is some correspondence; it\nshould be an indication to go back and look again.\nIf the Court were to conclude, wow, the\nevidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no\nrational jury would have, you know, had a problem with\nconvicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the\nsituation that your hypothetical poses would result.\nSo --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, let me make sure I\nunderstand what you're saying to me, that you're saying\nto me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was\nirrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court\nshould be cautious about it and look at that kind of\nevidence in the -- in light of everything else that\nhappened at the trial.\nMR. YANG: Ultimately, the appellate court\nshould look back at what the jury was supposed to\nconsider, the evidence in light of the instructions. It\nshould be a cautionary note but ultimately should\nredirect the court back to the evidence.\nAnd I think that focuses on, again, one of\nthe two related legal points that Petitioner made in\nargument that I think there's real disagreement between\nthe Government and Petitioner on: one, the inquiry of a\nreasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the\nGovernment's view, versus this particular jury; and the\nrelated claim that the inquiry is how this influenced\nthe deliberative process, if it was like a factor that\nthis jury might have considered in reaching its\nverdict --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know how to\nseparate out an admitted error situation. And let me\nexplain why, okay? Let's assume the facts of this case,\nbut instead of this tape recording, the improperly\nadmitted evidence was a confession by the defendant.\nWould you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial\ncase of guilt -- now, we've already said that\nconfessions are one of the most powerful pieces of\nharmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that\nsomehow this was still harmful -- harmless?\nMR. YANG: Are we taking Marina's testimony\nout now?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. Yes.\nMR. YANG: Okay. If Marina's testimony was\nnot in and you had the evidence here -- now, an\nunconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the\nbar, right?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different\nstandard.\nMR. YANG: We're going to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's talk\nabout it under the Kehota standard. Let's talk about\nthe standard we're assessing.\nMR. YANG: If you're -- all you're asking is\na fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same\nresult here, because what you -- when you take Marina's\ntestimony out of the picture, there was really no\ndefense at all. What the government had was a strong\ncase --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. He\ntestifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said.\nMeaning, he -- when I used the word \"confession,\" I'm\nsorry, I misspoke.\nHe takes the stand. He -- or doesn't take\nthe stand. He says everything he said to the police.\nAnd that confession that he was there, et cetera --\nMR. YANG: So, he testified to the substance\nof Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive\nthere?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She called him --\nMR. YANG: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- et cetera.\nMR. YANG: And then the error is the same\nerror?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was improperly\nadmitted. Without Miranda --\nMR. YANG: The tapes were --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- Miranda warnings.\nMR. YANG: The tapes?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh. Not the tapes,\njust the story.\nMR. YANG: I'm a little confused --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nMR. YANG: -- because if he's testifying in\ncourt, the government is not putting him on. He's going\non as -- there's no Miranda question or anything.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My hypothetical is not\nworking for this reason, and I understand what you're\nsaying. It's hard to identify a comparable mistake.\nBut my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the\nerror sort of vary with the strength of the government's\ncase?\nMR. YANG: Undoubtedly. I think that's right.\nNow, let --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If he had not run away,\nand the tapes were admitted --\nMR. YANG: We would have a weaker case, and\nit would be -- ultimately, these lines that the Court\nhas to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond\na reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by\nthe court of appeals. The Court has repeatedly\nrecognized that this is a reviewing court's judgment\nbased on the record.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly.\nMR. YANG: Now -- now --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what the defense\nsaid was there's only one defense here, and it's the\nwife's defense that he was there by accident, not\nintentionally. There was a lot of countervailing\nevidence to disprove that, but the question is could a\nreasonable jury have -- might have or could have\ncredited that defense?\nMR. YANG: Well, I'm not sure that that's\nPetitioner's view. I mean, I would -- there's two\naspects to this case. We can talk about the fact-bound\nins and outs of that, which is interesting in its own\nright. But I think one of the key legal questions for\nthe Court is what's the standard that the Court must\napply. And there's a real difference between\nPetitioner's and the Government here.\nAnd that standard the Petitioner has\nadvocated is that this jury, as opposed to the\nreasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must\nlook at the thought process of this jury to decide\nwhether the error might have had some influence.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, you look at how the\ncase was tried.\nMR. YANG: Well, no, I think the position\nabout this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at\nthe deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this\nCourt's decision in Shinseki.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Yang --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you just told me it\nwasn't, Mr. Yang. Because -- well, I think that the --\nthat the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury\nis important is whether you're going to take into\naccount what you know about what this jury did: how\nlong it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court,\nwhat eventual verdict it reached.\nAnd you just suggested to me that that was\nfair game to consider in this analysis, although one\nshould be cautious about doing it.\nMR. YANG: I should qualify that. I didn't\nintend to give the Court the misconception that we're\nlooking at this jury. The ultimate question is whether\na rational jury would have convicted absent the error.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, a rational jury is not\nthe jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back\na note on the 7th day. That's this jury.\nMR. YANG: And the reason that I believe\nthat the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back\nat the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what\nthe evidence should be saying to a rational jury. But\nthe ultimate question is the rational jury.\nAnd let me give you a few examples from the\nCourt's case law, because I think this really puts it\nbeyond dispute that the real question is the question of\na rational jury, what they would do absent the error.\nFirst, in Neder the Court explained that\nerroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of\nevidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an\nelement of the offense, or failure to instruct on a\nnecessary element of the offense as was the case in\nNeder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and\nwill affect the deliberative process in ways that are\nnot readily calculable.\nThe error in Neder was that the jury was\ninstructed not to consider the question of materiality,\nwhich was an essential element of the defense. And the\nCourt specifically rejected that the -- that the fact\nthat this jury didn't actually make a finding based on\nthe evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're going back then to\nyour position in your brief where you said that you\nwould not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that\nthe jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the\nlength of their deliberations, the divided verdict? You\nsaid in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would\nnot include those.\nMR. YANG: That's right. Those types of\nindications are entirely unreliable and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought you\nanswered Justice Kagan that you could take them into\naccount, the court could take them into account but\ncautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight.\nMR. YANG: What I think the court should do\nis when you have a -- what is a much better indication\nor at least a -- of what this jury might have been\ndoing, you use that as a reason to go back and look\nagain at the evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I suspect --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a case in\nwhich, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for\na new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge,\nand the trial judge said: I now acknowledge that this\ncourt committed error in introducing item 10 in\nevidence. And the court remembers that when this came\ninto evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was\ntransfixed, jurors were weeping. This was the high\npoint of the trial.\nThat's wrong for the judge to say. All he\nhas to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1\nthrough 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a\nrational jury -- so, that's the end of it. Judges do\nthe -- do what I suggested all the time.\nMR. YANG: Well, we think that, again, the\n-- the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a\nrational jury would do. And let me give you an\nexample --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That's starting to look, Mr.\nYang, very much like a directed verdict for the\ngovernment on the part of a judge, because you're so\nabstracting it from this case and this jury and what\nthis jury's reactions to everything that happened was\nthat, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict\nroute?\nMR. YANG: This Court has repeatedly\nrejected that. The reason it's not a directed verdict\nis you have a jury verdict. You have a jury verdict\nthat beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually\ndetermined that this defendant is guilty of the offense\ncharged, on proper instructions. Then the question is:\nWhat remedy do you have?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You do have a jury -- excuse\nme. You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a\nformulation of the test that essentially pretends that\nthe jury is not there and that we know nothing about how\nit reacted to various things.\nMR. YANG: The reason --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry. A question mark.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YANG: This I think can be answered if I\ncould just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I\nthink this shows the Court's rationale here and shows\nthat our view has to be the right view.\nFor instance, in a series of cases, this\nCourt has concluded that the unconstitutional admission\nof a confession, either of the defendant or the\ncodefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming\nevidence such that a rational jury would convict without\nthe evidence.\nNow, if we're looking at what a jury would\nhave considered, whether they were brought to tears or\nwhatever, when you're talking about a confession,\nthere's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is\ngoing to have that far in the forefront of their minds\nwhen they are deciding guilt or innocence. But the\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I just don't\nsee how you can do it without the error. I keep going\nback to this point. How about if the prosecutor had\ndone in summation the following: Ladies and Gentlemen,\nwhatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer\nsaid he was guilty.\nMR. YANG: I'm sorry. I just --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The lawyer -- the\nprosecutor got up at the end of trial and said:\nDisbelieve everything the wife told you, because the\nlawyer said the defendant was guilty. All right? I'll\ngo through all the other evidence I have that might\nprove that she was not telling the truth, but the\ncentral, most important piece of evidence in this case\nabout his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty.\nCan you say that this jury was uninfluenced\nby that error?\nMR. YANG: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because under your\nformulation --\nMR. YANG: No. You can't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a rational jury would\nhave convicted absent the lawyer saying that.\nMR. YANG: That's right. But this Court has\nrepeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the\nquestion was the jury was told to presume certain malice\nin a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have\naltered the basis on which the jury decided the case is\nnot the question; you look to the reasonable juror.\nSimilarly in Pope, the Court said the\nquestion does not turn on whether the jury did not, in\nfact, have this error in mind when it found the\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would -- you would\ntake into account that the prosecution apparently\nthought this was important, so important. The trial was\nover. The prosecutor said: Judge, I'd like to come\nback so these tapes can be introduced.\nThat -- the -- we have the witness\ntestifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not\npart of the scheme. We have no direct evidence, because\nCruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez. He's at\nthe scene, we know that. And an explanation, an\ninnocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene.\nAnd then the government comes back, after everything is\ndone, and says: We want the jury -- we want these tapes\nto be before the jury.\nIsn't that -- don't we take into account\nthat the government itself thought this was very\nimportant?\nMR. YANG: I -- I think it's a factor that\nyou consider, again, in directing the courts look at\nreally what the trial evidence was. I mean it, I think,\nbelies the facts of this case -- obviously, that's a\nhypothetical. But when you look at how cases really\ndevelop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you\nknow, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes\nthat weren't transcribed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But my point to you is it\nwasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend\nthe trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them.\nAnd they contain not just the one statement. There's\nthe one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial\nwill be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --\nthey should take a blind plea.\nMR. YANG: I think when you look at what\nhappened at trial, you see that the tapes were played\nfor two reasons: one, to show that Marina had bias\nbecause she was told by Petitioner's counsel that\nPetitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --\nPetitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and\narguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dissent pointed out\nthat she admitted that before the tapes were played.\nMR. YANG: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That she was testifying\nin the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her\nhusband. So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for\nthat.\nMR. YANG: Well, the tapes certainly were\nreinforcing of that. And, in fact, when the\ngovernment's closing argument -- it did not reference\nanything about this -- what I think you and\nJustice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous\nsentence in a series of long tapes. And, remember,\nthese --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was --\nMR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the\nrecord are only one portion of the tapes. So --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was your second --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the line that\nthe government, the prosecutor, repeated three times\nwhile she was on the stand, the exact line?\nMR. YANG: The exact lines?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. YANG: This is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The government thought --\nthought it was important for the jury to hear it,\nbecause they said it three times.\nMR. YANG: Well, to be fair, I think you\nneed to look at what's before and after it. The\ngovernment is focusing on three different statements\nthat are at issue in the case.\nThe first one is that -- with some\nprofanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to\nsucceed at trial. The second one is that defense\ncounsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel\nsuggested that everybody was going to lose. And then,\nthird, she thought everybody was in, again with\nprofanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, why does any of\nthis have to do with her credibility? Did the dissent\nsay that the way this affected the jury was that it\nrendered her less credible? I thought --\nMR. YANG: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the dissent just\nsaid it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant\nthought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer\nthought he was going to lose.\nMR. YANG: The reason that this was in --\nand I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the\nargument was made that these statements equating\nPetitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or\ntheir likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with\nMarina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you\nknow, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up\nunknowingly because she asked him. That was the theory.\nIt's not contested. And, in fact, nothing\nthat the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's\ntheory would be different. The only difference would be\na limiting instruction that would simply say you can't\ntake these statements for the truth of the matter.\nSo, nothing that the jury heard would have\nbeen different. When you read the short passage in the\ncontext of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not\nfully transcribed. Petitioner asked for the entire\ntapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial,\nwhich -- which was -- based on the government's showing\nthat was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene,\nhe drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and\nCruz while the informant was coming back, he was there\nwhen the call was made to the informant that said they\nhad the money.\nNow, there's some dispute over whether he\nsaid that, but certainly he was there when that call was\nmade because that's what triggered the raid. All of\nthat was basically undisputed. You've got all these\ncalls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez,\n27 calls --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're going over\nthe evidence. And I may simply be asking the same\nquestion Justice Kennedy asked earlier. But let's say\nyou have a situation where it's the same thing, and at\nthe -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence\nhas the defendant saying: I'm guilty, I'm guilty. And\nthe evidence is the same as all you've set forth at\npages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what,\nyou know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting.\nAnd the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes: You\nknow, the guy said he was guilty.\nIs that a situation in which we're supposed\nto then go back, look at all the complicated evidence,\nand see if a jury would have convicted? Or can we with\na fair degree of confidence say that the error is what\nled the jury to convict?\nMR. YANG: Well, I think the former, but let\nme explain. And again, I'm going to go back to Neder,\nif I may, for a second. In Neder, the jury never found\nan element of the offense. Never did. There's no\nquestion that the jury's verdict was affected by the\nfailure to instruct. In fact, it was not just a failure\nto instruct. The district court told the jury this is\nnot for them to consider. And --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But critical to the Court's\nview in that case was that the -- the defendant could\nnot have contested that element.\nMR. YANG: Well, but if we're -- again, if\nwe're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the\nother side about whether we're looking at this jury or\nwhat a rational jury would do when you excise the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would like very\nmuch to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's\nhypothetical and the Chief Justice's. As I understand\nthose hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --\nMR. YANG: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where the particular\npiece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from\nhow the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's\nthe kind of thing that could really make a difference.\nI mean, they were in tears, et cetera.\nMR. YANG: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, in my\nreading of this, which I once had to read about 100\nharmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can\nconfirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the\njudge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's\nfeeling this way, asks himself or herself the question,\ncould this illegally admitted evidence make a\ndifference? Could it have made a difference in this\ncase? Could it have? And the answer is going to be\n\"no\" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not\nhave thought it made a critical difference.\nAnd that's just putting the same thing I\nthink slightly differently. But the answer in\nJustice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going\nto think it has nothing to do with rationality. If the\njury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close\ncase. And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a\ndifference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless.\nAnd if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't\nhave made a difference to any rational person, he's\ngoing to say \"harmless.\" Period.\nNow, that was my impression reading those\ncases. And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting\nat that. And -- use them. Answer them rather than me,\nbecause that's what I'm interested in.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. YANG: The answer is that in a case\nwhere the jury -- where you have some very provocative\nevidence, but there's also a very strong case that\nexists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that\nyou need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But even in those\ncases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as\na whole and says that there was so much evidence before\nthis stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that\na rational jury would have gotten to the same result,\nthat it would have convicted, then --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the\njudge concludes that both this jury that I had and some\nhypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on\nthis evidence that that's all they would have looked at,\nbut if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible\nevidence, they would still have found guilt.\nIs that -- is that what you're -- is that --\nMR. YANG: I think so, but let me give you\nan example.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a proper application of\nthe -- of the framework?\nMR. YANG: I think so, but it's not, again,\nwhat a -- what this particular jury was doing, because\nwe know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession\ncases, the jury hears a confession, an\nunconstitutionally obtained confession,\nunconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is\ngoing to be -- right there. You know? A jury -- a\njuror could say: Let's go home, we have a confession.\nIt's out of his own mouth. There's very little else to\ndebate.\nBut when the evidence is beyond that\nconfession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would\nhave gotten to a different result, and you could say\nthat with a fair assurance or if there's a\nconstitutional error as it would be with a confession\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is\nharmless.\nAnd the reason that the Court's taking that\ninquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long\nrecognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very\nsignificant costs of retrial. And so, the premise\nthere --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you are\nessentially saying, as I understand you, that if there\nwas such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal\ncase, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a\nverdict here because there's only one way a rational --\nrational jury could come out.\nMR. YANG: This -- that argument was\nspecifically rejected by this Court in Neder. The same\nquestion came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more\ndifficult case for the government than this, because at\nleast in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this\njury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt\nbecause it was never instructed to find an element of\nthe offense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Yang, I think you may be\ntaking a harder position than you really need to. Why\nshouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court\nshould look at what would be done by a rational jury,\nexcept in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that\nhave been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a\nfew of the other questions, simply because it's so\ndifficult to determine what a -- what the jury was\nactually doing?\nWe have a rule that prohibits consideration\nof what goes on in the jury room. But suppose we didn't\nhave that. Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the\njury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you\ncould watch it and see. If that were the case, then\nsurely the rule would be what would this jury have done?\nBut most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what\na jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly?\nWell, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it\ncaused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise\nwould have been a difficult case.\nDid they take a long time? Well, it shows\nit was a close case, and, therefore, any error might\nhave tipped them one way or the other.\nYou just can't tell.\nMR. YANG: I'm -- I don't want to resist\nthis too much, because I think we're fighting about\nthings at the very extreme. Most of the times that\nwe're talking about these purported indications from the\njury, it's entirely ambiguous. And the -- so, there may\nbe well be extreme examples. And I think those would\nrightfully influence a court's consideration in a case.\nBut, again, when you have harmless-error\ncases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder,\nthat the jury did not find an element of the offense,\nthe inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court\nhas repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19\nof our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error\ninquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact\nthat the primary purpose of a trial is the factual\nquestion of guilt or innocence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you read --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, when you\nbegan, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were\ntwo ways in which your position was different from Mr.\nBrindley's.\nMR. YANG: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One I understand is\nthat you look at a rational jury --\nMR. YANG: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and not the\nparticular jury.\nWhat's the second?\nMR. YANG: Well, it's related. His focus on\nthe -- this jury I believe is seeing whether there's\nsome influence on the process, deliberative process,\neven if the outcome would have been the same absent the\nerror. And so, he's kind of trying to get into the\nminds of the jury. And this Court has repeatedly\nrejected that. Again --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you a different\nquestion, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference\nin the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to\nwrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that\nthere's two different ways of saying the same thing.\nBut I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out\nthere which suggests that courts that use one\nformulation tend to come out one way, and courts that\nuse the other formulation tend to come out the other\nway.\nAnd I'm just wondering what your view of\nthat is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the\nemphasis on the entire case, whereas the other\nformulation seems to put the emphasis on only the\ngovernment's evidence, and that that makes a difference\nin the end.\nMR. YANG: We don't think that there is this\ndeep -- there are some disagreements or some things we\ndisagree with about what courts of appeals do in any\nparticular cases. But with respect to this formulation\nof the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused\nversus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the\nscholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge\nEdwards' opinion about harmless error. That came out in\n1995, when it was already swimming against -- upstream\nagainst this Court's harmless-error decisions.\nBut he had in his pocket the Sullivan\ndecision, which was admittedly a structural-error case,\nbut there was language in Sullivan which suggested that\nyou need to look at what this particular jury was going\nto do.\nThen we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce\nthis very well -- but Recuenco. It's the -- the\nApprendi application of Neder, which specifically rejects\nthis kind of broad logic in Sullivan as being\ninconsistent with the Court's harmless-error cases.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You do agree -- you do\nagree that the government has the burden of showing that\nthe error is harmless?\nMR. YANG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the government's\nburden. And you also agree that we should look at the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in\nmaking --\nMR. YANG: No. The Court, even in -- I\nthink most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki,\ntalking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind\nof presumptions or rigid rules. And the reason that you\ndo, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of\na reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And then\nthe question is, are you setting aside that verdict\nbecause -- do you think that this error was the thing\nthat tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty? And\nso, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all\npresumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how\nthis Court has conducted the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what does it mean\nthat the government has the burden? What does the\ngovernment have to do?\nMR. YANG: The government has to show, as --\nthis is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has\nsaid in Neder is the same thing that applied in\nerroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a\nrational jury would have found the defendant guilty\nabsent the error, and that involves the three core\nelements we explained in our brief. And then the Court\ntakes into account --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The absent error. So,\nthat means -- wait. You look at just the evidence\nthat's not tainted?\nMR. YANG: In some cases you can do that,\nwhere the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I\nmay finish.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.\nMR. YANG: Briefly. In some cases, you\nmight do that. In other cases where it's close or the\nevidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error\nto see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing\nin getting to guilt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice allowed\nme to ask one question. Could I amend your statement so\nthat you would say a rational jury in all the\ncircumstances of this case, given what this jury heard,\nwould have?\nMR. YANG: Yes. It's -- in the position of\nthis jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury,\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Brindley, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU R. BRINDLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRINDLEY: I first want to address\nNeder, which Government counsel continually referenced.\nNeder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also\nlimits itself to situations where the evidence is\nuncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in\nthose situations the difference between the reasonable\njury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent\nbecause it would be impossible for the error to have an\nimpact.\nSecondly, I think it's important to note\nfrom Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't\nconsider the error, then even that extreme case, that\nwould have to be ignored. And so, I think the\nGovernment's formulation and the formulation used by the\nappellate court below would justify -- would lead to\nthat bad conclusion.\nI also think that when you do that\nformulation, where you're talking about the reasonable\njury and absence of error, the reason those cases come\nout different is because those courts think they don't\nhave to address the error, which is I think what\nhappened in the majority below, why they didn't address\nit despite the dissent.\nThe other thing I think it's important to\nnote is the reason you have to look at the error and its\npossible impact and not just whether you could be\nconvicted on the other evidence is because you say,\nwell, he could be convicted on the other evidence. If\nthat's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on\nthe evidence which could independently in this case be a\nreason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt\ndetermination that this Court says is not supposed to\nhappen. And I think the majority's opinion below is\nconsistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it\nto suggest that's not exactly what they did.\nI also think that in the end -- there was a\nmention of the limiting instruction; a limiting\ninstruction would have cured this problem. We assume\njuries would follow it. That means they wouldn't have\nconcluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then\nput Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't\ntelling the truth.\nWhat this error allows, what -- if taken for\nits truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his\nlawyer. They could disregard everything that was said\non his behalf. They could say we know that he's guilty;\nhis lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on\nthat basis. That's an error that can infect the\nentirety of the proceedings.\nAnd if you look at this jury and what they\nheard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez\nis credible or not, there is nothing in this record the\nGovernment can point to that would allow a reviewing\ncourt to make that determination. A reviewing court\nthat didn't see --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did the panel majority in --\ndid the panel majority in this case say anything that\ndiffers from what this Court has said about harmless\nerror? If we were to reverse, what would we point to in\nthe panel majority's opinion that was erroneous?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think you would point to\nthat first statement of the test where they say whether\nthe reasonable jury would convict him absent the error,\nbecause Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out.\nThis Court has never overruled Kotteakos.\nThe other thing --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Hasn't this Court said\nexactly what Seventh Circuit said there? In other\ncases?\nMR. BRINDLEY: This Court has used, I think,\ndicta that has language of that sort. But in those\ncases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they\nlook at what the error was; they put it in the context\nof the whole case, and they can say the government could\nprove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree\nof assurance, because it was cumulative, because --\nthere's no -- there's nothing --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You want us to say -- you\nwant us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit\npanel, because you said what we have said in prior\ncases, but we were wrong?\nMR. BRINDLEY: I think the reason to reverse\nthem is because that formulation has proven to lead to\nthe wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this\nguilt-based approach; and it is not the law of\nKotteakos. This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.\nAnd to focus on it allows a guilt\ndetermination by a reviewing court that would be\nviolative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was\nconcerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was\nconcerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even\nconcerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases\nwhere the evidence is uncontestable.\nBecause if you took these statements as true\nand then you came down to a question, well, is Marina\ncredible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the\ngovernment can do on this record to prove that the jury\nwould have found her credibility differently because\nthis Court can't figure that out on a cold record.\nIt said so, many times. It's not possible\nto do, especially in a case that's based on\ncircumstantial evidence like this one.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
