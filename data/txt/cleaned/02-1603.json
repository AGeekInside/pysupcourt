Banks.\nMr. Eisenberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. EISENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAt his trial in 1983, George Banks' team of\nthree defense lawyers presented 23 mitigation witnesses,\nincluding three forensic psychiatrists, his mother,\nbrother, and co-workers, a priest, and two nuns. The\ntrial court instructed the jury that it must consider any\nmitigating evidence unless it was unanimous in rejecting\nit.\nNow Banks claims that Mills v. Maryland, a\nruling of this Court made after the completion of his\ndirect appeal, entitles him to re-open his death sentence\nfor the killing of 13 people. In fact, Mills creates a\nnew distinct rule regulating the manner of conducting a\ndeath penalty hearing that is not applicable retroactively\nand that in any case was reasonably applied by the State\ncourts attempting to interpret it.\nThe primary issue in this case, though, is\nwhether the Mills rule which prohibits unanimity\nrequirements at the mitigation stage was merely a minor\napplication of existing law dictated by prior precedent or\nwhether it's instead Teague-barred. Mills does cite\nLockett v. Ohio for the general proposition that it's\nbeyond dispute that the sentencer, quote/unquote, may not\nbe precluded from considering mitigation.\nBut before Mills, the sentencer, quote/unquote,\nalways referred to the judge or the jury, never to\nindividual jurors. That was a leap made for the first\ntime in Mills. That was new. Even with a unanimity\ncharge, although there wasn't one in this case, as we'll\naddress, a jury still considered the evidence in the\nmanner that juries historically have considered evidence,\nthat is collaboratively. Until Mills, the Constitution\nhad never been read to forbid unanimity as to verdicts,\nwhether general verdicts or special verdicts. And even\nsince Mills, as this Court recently said in Jones v.\nUnited States, we have long been of the view that the very\nobject of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a\ncomparison of views and by arguments among the jurors\nthemselves.\nSo the question of jury unanimity, we believe,\nremained open not only after Lockett but even within the\nunderstanding of members of this Court at the time of\nMills and thereafter. In fact, in McKoy v. North\nCarolina, decided 2 years after Mills, four Justices of\nthe Court rejected Lockett as supporting, let alone\ncompelling, a rule against jury unanimity.\nNow, whether the dissenters in McKoy can be said\nto be right or wrong about the meaning of Mills is\nirrelevant in this Teague context. The question is that\nthey believed that Mills, not to mention Lockett, did not\nresolve the unanimity question presented here.\nQUESTION: Mr. Eisenberg, tell -- tell us\nexactly what you mean by jury unanimity because, you know,\nmost States require jury unanimity in the -- in the final\nverdict.\nMR. EISENBERG: Excuse me, Your Honor, yes. I\nmean only at the stage of finding whether particular\nmitigating circumstances are present. That is the -- the\njury unanimity question that was decided in the Mills and\nMcKoy cases, as I've said, subject to dispute, strong\ndispute, among the Court that continued even after Mills.\nBecause this is a Teague case, the question, as\nI've said, is not whether Mills was right or McKoy was\nright or which side can be better defended now, but\nwhether State court judges reasonably could have known\nwhat the outcome would be. And since even within the\nCourt there was such continuing controversy on the matter,\nit cannot be said that State judges reasonably could have\nknown, and therefore the case is Teague-barred.\nBut that uncertainty continued even beyond McKoy\nbecause in the next similar case before the Court, Walton\nv. Arizona, the issue was presented on essentially the\nsame basis as the Mills case had been. The single hold\nout juror scenario, that a single juror because of a\nunanimity requirement in Mills or because, in Walton, a\npreponderance of the evidence standard, could block\nconsideration of mitigating evidence and thereby mandate a\ndeath penalty case.\nQUESTION: On -- on the instructions in the red\nbrief at page 8 and then at page 9, there are two\ndifferent instructions set out. This is in the\nrespondent's brief. And then the jury form which has to\nbe checked is set out on pages 9 and 10. In your view is\nthat all we should consider when we interpret these\ninstructions, or do you have some additional instructions\nthat you wish us to refer to?\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, I think that the\ninstruction here was basically the same throughout, that\nthe message as to unanimity regarding mitigation or not\nwas basically the same throughout the instructions. It's\nin the joint appendix at page 21. It's repeated at page\n26, and we think embodied in the jury form -- I'm sorry -\nalso at pages 66 and 67.\nAnd in each of those cases, the jury was\ninstructed first that it must be unanimous to find\naggravation or no mitigation and then that it must\nunanimously find whether any -- find aggravating\ncircumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.\nBut, of course, the threshold question is\nwhether the State courts could even have known that there\nwas such a thing as a rule against unanimity, whether or\nnot unanimity was actually required on the facts of this\ncase. And the Walton case, as I've mentioned, is relevant\nto that question because in Walton the same argument was\nat issue, and the argument was that because of the\npreponderance of the evidence standard, a hold-out juror\nor even really 12 hold-out jurors, so to speak, could be\nsomewhat persuaded by mitigating evidence, could think it\nsignificant, but not quite past the tipping point required\nby the preponderance standard and yet be precluded from\nconsidering that evidence at all in the weighing stage.\nAnd yet, the defendant lost that argument in Walton.\nAnd again, the relevance for Teague purposes is\nto leave the State courts in the position of trying to\ndetermine before Walton, before McKoy, before Mills, in\nthis case in 1983 that the Eighth Amendment through the\nLockett case somehow precluded the establishment of\nunanimity.\nQUESTION: Well, with Lockett -- with Lockett\nthey -- what Lockett says is that the sentencer cannot be\nprecluded from considering as a mitigating factor any\naspect of the defendant's character or record or any\ncircumstance.\nNow, one thing that could have meant -- one\nthing -- is that you cannot execute a person unless 12\npeople think that not only that crime is unusually\nterrible -- that's aggravating -- but also that it\noutweighs in this person's life any good things he wants\nto bring in. That's his character. And 12 people have to\ncome to that ultimate judgment. Now, if that's so, 12\npeople have to come to that ultimate judgment, 12 people\nhave not come to that ultimate judgment when in fact 11\nwould let him off, but one blocks it by saying I don't\nagree that this is the mitigating circumstance. So if\nthat's what Lockett means, it would be obvious that that\nwouldn't satisfy it.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well -\nQUESTION: Well, what else could Lockett mean is\nmy question.\nMR. EISENBERG: Lockett -- Lockett -\nQUESTION: What else could Lockett mean that\nwould make sense in the context of the death penalty? And\nyou'll have a lot of answers, but I want to know what they\nare.\nMR. EISENBERG: Excuse me, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. EISENBERG: It -- what it also could have\nmade sense is that the jury as a whole in the historical\nmanner of juries had to consider the evidence, and there's\nno doubt that it could have meant the interpretation that\nyou suggest. And we know that because Mills held that and\nMcKoy held that. So, of course, it could have meant that.\nBut the fact that it could have meant that and was\neventually held to mean that over continuing dissent by\nthe Court is not -- does not resolve the Teague question.\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't, but I want you to\ntell me precisely in a reasonable way -- and I'm going to\nwonder if that's -- if it is reasonable or not. That's\ngoing to be the issue -- what other thing it might have\nmeant. And I -- I'll draw here on the concurrence in\nPenry where the statement is made it's obvious it's meant\nwhat I just said it meant because anything else would have\nbeen arbitrary in the context of our arbitrariness\njurisprudence.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well -\nQUESTION: So -- so you tell me -- I understand\nthe words, well, historical, et cetera, but I want to pin\nyou down more than that.\nMR. EISENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. Let me speak\nfirst to Penry.\nPenry did not involve this question of\nunanimity, and the reason I believe that the opinion was\ntaken that it was obviously an application of Lockett is\nbecause it involved very much the same kind of categorical\nquestion that was presented in Lockett. In the Penry\ncase, there were three questions before the jury, three\nmitigating categories given to the jury. The defendant\nsaid, I have some evidence that doesn't strictly fall\nwithin one of those three categories. In Lockett, there\nwere three categories of mitigation given to the\nsentencer, and the defendant said, I have some categories\nof mitigation that don't fall within those three\ncategories that my sentencer was limited to. That's why\nPenry is a straightforward Lockett case.\nQUESTION: But I'm thinking of Penry's\ncommentary about Mills or whatever. I may -- I may get\nthese cases mixed up, but I thought that Mills was\ncharacterized as a case that follows obviously -\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, I --\nQUESTION: -- from Lockett -\nMR. EISENBERG: I could be wrong, but I -- I\nremember no such statement from any of the opinions in\nPenry or really in any other case except for the -- the\nMills and McKoy cases where the subject was in dispute.\nSo that to the extent it was obvious to some members of\nthe Court, it was far from obvious to other members of the\nCourt, and therefore certainly couldn't have been obvious\nto the State court judges who were expected to know before\neither of those cases were decided.\nQUESTION: Mr. Eisenberg, the court of appeals\nhas changed its mind in this area, has it not?\nMR. EISENBERG: That is certainly our view, Your\nHonor, and that is very relevant to the second question\npresented here, which is whether, even assuming that the\nMills rule could be applied retroactively, there was a -\nan unreasonable application of that rule by the State\ncourt.\nNow, originally this question came before the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals in 1991 in the Zettlemoyer\ncase. It was the same type of instruction that's\npresented here that tracked the structure of the\nPennsylvania sentencing statute. And the court of\nappeals, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, said that\nthat instruction was not inconsistent with Mills, and it\nsaid it was not inconsistent with Mills because an\ninstruction that requires unanimity as to aggravation but\ndoesn't mention unanimity as to mitigation is not an\ninstruction that requires unanimity as to both. It's the\nsame theory that we have been presenting in this case all\nalong.\nIn the next case that came up before the Third\nCircuit in 1997 in Frey, the Third Circuit held, no, that\nkind of instruction, with all the words and proximities at\nissue there, did violate Mills.\nQUESTION: Did it -- did it treat the Frey case\nas overruling its earlier case?\nMR. EISENBERG: It's -- it treated it as\ndistinguishing, Your Honor, but that -- Mr. Chief Justice,\nbut we think that that's irrelevant for our purposes\nbecause the Frey case was a pre-AEDPA case, certainly\nwasn't applying a deference standard. And the Frey case\nnot only wasn't applying the deference standard, but went\nso far as to characterize the State court's interpretation\nof its instruction in these capital cases as plausible.\nNow, whether or not plausible means\nreasonable -\nQUESTION: Could I interrupt?\nMR. EISENBERG: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: May I interrupt with just one\nquestion? Because I'm -- I'm a little rusty on just what\nthe sequence of opinions was. And I -- I think you have\none impression of the case if you just read the\ninstructions because I think you've got a very strong\nargument on the instructions.\nI get a different impression of the case when I\nlook at the jury form, the verdict form, which in effect\nrequires a check to show the jury acting unanimously. And\nmy question is at the first go-round, did the court of\nappeals actually focus on the -- the jury form as well as\nthe instructions?\nMR. EISENBERG: The court of appeals in the\nZettlemoyer case, the first one in 1991, focused on both,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: It did.\nMR. EISENBERG: And the court of appeals -- it\nwas faced with the -- the -- I believe that the page\nexactly is 923 F.2d at 308. It's cited in our -- in our\nbrief. The court of appeals specifically quoted both the\ncharge and the verdict form, and we would suggest that\nboth were legally parallel to the charge and the form\ninvolved in this case. And the court made its comment in\nregard to both of those provisions.\nQUESTION: Because the jury form does seem to\nimply a concept of unanimity because they got to require\n-- you know, the form definitely refers to unanimity.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, the form refers to\nunanimity in exactly the same way that the charge does, I\nwould submit, Justice Stevens, because it says, we, the\njury, unanimously sentence the defendant in the above\nmatter, and then you have two options, just as the statute\nin Pennsylvania and just as the judge's charge laid out.\nWe unanimously sentence the defendant in the above matter,\nand it says to at least -- we -- we, the jury, unanimously\nsentence the defendant in the above matter to death or\nlife imprisonment. We, the jury -- have you found\nunanimously, and then the two options. At least one\naggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance or\n-- and there's a big or in the middle of the verdict form\n-- or one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh\nany mitigating circumstances. So -\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but the key point is that\nin the mitigating circumstances are, there are one, two,\nthree options. They just checked one.\nMR. EISENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. There are\nblanks next to the mitigating circumstances, but frankly,\nwe still have those blanks next to mitigating\ncircumstances now after Mills, after it's been changed, in\norder to make it perfectly explicit that any one juror can\nvote for mitigation.\nQUESTION: And see, it isn't explicit here, and\nthe check seems to me to indicate that they were unanimous\non mitigating circumstance number 1, but they were not on\nthe others.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well -\nQUESTION: And so it seems very likely that some\nof the jurors may have considered -- felt they could not\nconsider mitigating circumstance 2 or 3.\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, two things. First\nof all, the reason that there are checks there is that the\njury, under the Pennsylvania structure, is essentially\nrequired to give a second look at mitigation in the\nweighing charge, even if some of those jurors may have -\neven if the jurors may have been in dispute about the\nexistence of those mitigating circumstances. So in order\nto apply the first phase of the instructions, they have to\ndecide whether all of them find no mitigation. If all of\nthem don't find the absence of mitigation, then they go to\nthe second stage, and at that point, they are all required\nto look at mitigation, even if they might have voted\nagainst it the first time. So the statute appropriately\ntracks the kind of mitigation that all of them are\nrequired to consider in the weighing process.\nThe second point I want to make, however, Your\nHonor, is that, of course, this is not the first time that\na verdict form like this and an instruction like this have\nbeen looked at. And I must emphasize this is a deference\ncase under section 2254.\nAs I explained, the Third Circuit in 1991 looked\nat a verdict form like this and said, no, this is not a\nviolation of Mills. Other circuits around the United\nStates have consistently held that this kind of\ninstruction and verdict form are not a violation of Mills.\nWhere the -- where the instruction and verdict form\nexplicitly require unanimity as to aggravation but don't\nexplicitly require unanimity as to mitigation, then\nthere's no violation of Mills. And that's -\nQUESTION: And so -- so if in fact we have 12\njurors and all 12 believe that this person was awarded the\nCongressional Medal of Honor and 11 of them think that\nmeans he shouldn't get death, but one of them thinks it\nisn't that much of an offsetting factor, on your reading\nof this, the -- they could conclude after Lockett that\nit's death because we don't have unanimity on whether that\nCongressional Medal offsets the horrible crime.\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Breyer, for purposes of\nthe second question here, the deference question, our\nargument is that that is not the case, that the jury here\nwas not permitted to vote for death or not required to\nvote for death automatically merely because they were not\nunanimous in failing to find a particular piece of\nmitigation.\nQUESTION: So if they had been -- because let's\n-- I -- I was reading the jury form differently, and I\nmight be wrong. I'll go back to that.\nBut take my hypothetical and I want to go back\nto the retroactivity question. And on that, you're\nthinking, well, before Mills a State that came to that\nconclusion would not be violating the Constitution.\nMR. EISENBERG: What I would say, Your Honor, is\nthat before Mills a State that came to that conclusion\nwould not have acted unreasonably for purposes of the\nTeague standard.\nQUESTION: Yes, all right.\nNow, suppose in Mills -- suppose you're right.\nAnd now in Mills you would say, well, that's not right,\nand the reason that's not right is because the role of the\njuror is not simply to find the facts, but also to weigh\nthe significance of the mitigating fact against the horror\nof the crime. That's what Mills then on that view would\nhave said.\nWell, why isn't that terribly important? I.e.,\nthat is a radical shift in the role of the juror from what\nwas previously viewed as simply finding facts, now to a\nperson who is going to make the ultimate weighing question\nin his own mind in respect to life and death and the\nperson's career.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, Your Honor, we think it is\na significant change and that's -\nQUESTION: But amazingly enough to fall within\nin -- you see where I'm going?\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, that's -\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm saying -\nMR. EISENBERG: -- to the same exception.\nQUESTION: -- a watershed rule. Is it a\nwatershed rule?\nMR. EISENBERG: Yes, yes. Yes, Your Honor, and\nthe answer to that is -\nQUESTION: If it is a watershed rule, then of\ncourse it's retroactive.\nMR. EISENBERG: Then answer to that is, Your\nHonor, that the fact that a rule is new enough to be\nTeague-barred is hardly enough to make it -- render it -\nQUESTION: In other words, it's not that -\nMR. EISENBERG: -- a second Teague exception.\nIn fact, Your Honor, this Court has on numerous occasions\nheld that rules, including Lockett-based rules, are not\nnew, and yet not a single one of them has been held to be\na second exception. The Court has made clear that that\ncategory is exceedingly narrow, that such exceptions will\nbe very rare, and surely in every other case where a -- an\nimportant Lockett-based rule has been announced that has\nbeen found new for Teague purposes, the Court has gone on\nto reject second exception status here. In fact, even\nBanks in his brief here does not argue second exception\nstatus for the Mills rule.\nIn further comment on the Mills rule, however, I\nwould -- I would like to -- on the Teague bar, Your Honor,\nI would like to point out, as I've mentioned, that the\nCourt has previously considered Lockett-based claims for\nTeague purposes. In Simmons, for example, and in the\nCaldwell case, the Court established rules that were\nexplicitly based on Lockett concerning -- concerning the\njury's consideration of evidence at the -- at a capital\nsentencing hearing. And yet, in both of those cases, even\nthough I would suggest they were really smaller leaps from\nLockett than Mills was, the Court has held that those were\nnew rules that were not entitled either to old rule status\nor to second exception status. And as in the cases\nholding that Simmons and Caldwell were new rules, we\nbelieve the Court should hold that Teague is a new rule.\nNow, to return to the question -- to the\ndeference question, which -\nQUESTION: You mean that Teague is a new rule.\nMR. EISENBERG: I'm sorry, Your Honor. That's\nMills is a new rule.\nQUESTION: Mills is.\nMR. EISENBERG: Thank you.\nTo return to the deference question, the second\nquestion presented, as I was saying, the Third Circuit\nheld that the State court's interpretation, the one that\nwas victorious here in State court, the same\ninterpretation based on the same State court precedents,\nwas plausible. And whether or not plausible means\nreasonable, it surely does not mean unreasonable.\nAnd yet, in the first post-AEDPA case involving\nMills that came along in the Third Circuit, this one, the\nThird Circuit held without discussion of either its\noriginal 1991 ruling that had upheld this charge or any\ndiscussion of its 1997 ruling that had noted that the\ncontrary construction was not unreasonable, the Third\nCircuit held in this case that no court could reasonably\nhave applied Mills in the way that the State court did.\nAnd the -- the reason that all the other\ncircuits have disagreed with the Third Circuit on that and\nthat the Third Circuit itself has come to a different\nposition on that gets back to Mills itself because Mills\nwas not the kind of charge that was involved in this case.\nIn Mills, the charge explicitly required the jury to be\nunanimous in order to find the presence of mitigation.\nQUESTION: Just to get back a minute, Mr.\nEisenberg, this case was decided before Mills was decided.\nRight?\nMR. EISENBERG: The direct appeal in this\ncase -\nQUESTION: Yes, the direct appeal.\nMR. EISENBERG: -- was completed, including\ndenial of certiorari by this Court, before Mills was\ndecided. Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd in the Mills case, the Court was faced with\na verdict form which explicitly required unanimity to find\n-- to mark yes for mitigation and explicitly required that\nonly those mitigating circumstances marked yes -- that is,\nunanimously marked yes -- could be considered at the\nweighing stage.\nNow, contrast that in both respects with what\nhappened here. There was no instruction on unanimity for\nyeses. There was no instruction that only unanimous yeses\ncould be weighed. Instead, we have only an instruction\nrequiring unanimity for no votes on mitigation.\nAnd I think that there's a further important\npoint about the Mills case.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Eisenberg, you would concede\nthat those -- those questions are -- are certainly\nambiguous. The -- Pennsylvania made the change just to\nclarify that it was the individual juror and not the -\nthe group. You can look at those and conclude that just\nlike you had to find the aggravated unanimously, so you\nhad to find each mitigating unanimously. The form is\ncertainly susceptible to that reading.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, Your Honor, I would\nsuggest that if it is susceptible to such a reading at\nall, it is far from the primary meaning, and the reason\nfor that is really just the rules of English grammar. The\ntwo stages of the process that are laid out in the\ninstruction in question are not parallel. They are\ndramatically different. So the first stage says, you must\nbe unanimous in finding aggravating circumstances or no\nmitigating circumstances. And there's no question, as a\nmatter of grammar, that there's only one verb in that\nsentence with two objects, aggravating circumstances and\nno mitigating circumstances. The verb, unanimously finds,\nmust apply to both nouns.\nIn the second sentence, we have a different\nstructure. Unanimously find -\nQUESTION: Mr. Eisenberg, if you -- if you were\n-- if you were a -- a defense lawyer and you knew that the\n-- the law was that each juror could individually decide\nthe mitigators and you were confronted with a form like\nthis, would you object?\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, Your Honor, had the Mills\nrule already been decided, I think somebody might have\nraised an objection. It may or may not have succeeded but\ncertainly had an objection been able to be made\ncontemporaneously, we wouldn't have to have worried about\nerror being built into the trial and the matter could have\nbeen handled expeditiously.\nThat's why we have changed our verdict form, not\nbecause Pennsylvania has changed its understanding of what\nhas always been the structure of its sentencing process,\nbut because once Mills was decided, once the matter was\nconstitutionalized, it became certainly wise for the court\nto attempt to avoid further litigation on the question by\nmaking it explicit.\nQUESTION: Before it was just the law and not\nconstitutional, it was all right to be -- to be ambiguous,\nbut once it was constitutional, it had to be clear? I'm\nnot following.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, our -- our argument, Your\nHonor, is that the fact that they changed the form in\nresponse to a new rule is not evidence that they\npreviously read their statute in a different way. In\nfact, the State supreme court has always said that it has\nalways read the statute to require unanimity only as to\nthe absence, to the rejection of mitigation and not to the\nfinding of any particular mitigation.\nBut in reference to your question concerning\narguments of counsel, in fact, there was no argument of\ncounsel from either side here that the jury had to be\nunanimous about mitigation. In the same manner that Your\nHonor has suggested, presumably the prosecutor, had he\nbelieved that the jury had to be unanimous about\nmitigation, it would have been to his advantage to say so\nand to argue to the jury, all 12 of you have to find these\nbefore you can consider them. He didn't say anything like\nthat.\nAnd in fact, here's what the defense lawyer said\nin volume 6 of the trial transcript at pages 2300 and\n2301. He wasn't, I believe, specifically referring to\nmitigation, but he said, quote, think individually, decide\nthis individually. All it takes is one person to save his\nlife.\nNow, in light of the manner in which the case\nwas argued to the jury and in light of the manner in which\nthe judge presented the charge and laid out the verdict\nform, we believe that the jury would not have -- cannot be\nassumed to have come to the wrong conclusion here, and\nsurely that the State court and, as I've mentioned, every\nFederal circuit court looking at similar instructions and\nverdict forms, could not be said to have acted\nunreasonably in finding the absence of a Mills violation.\nThank you. If there are no further questions,\nnow I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Eisenberg.\nMr. Flora, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT J. FLORA, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FLORA: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nLockett and Eddings established a fundamental\nprinciple which basically provides that a State which\ncreates any barrier which precludes a sentencer from\ngiving full consideration and full effect to mitigating\nevidence relating to a person's character, background, and\ncircumstances of the offense is constitutionally\nimpermissible.\nWhen we look at Mills and take into account the\ndecision in McKoy, the unanimity instruction in Mills, in\na weighing State such as Pennsylvania, essentially was a\ndifferent type of barrier which precluded jurors to give\neffect to mitigating evidence. In a non-weighing State,\nthe unanimity requirement would probably be appropriate,\nbut in a weighing State, what happens is a single juror\ncan say to other 11 jurors, I don't believe that this\nparticular piece of evidence satisfies a mitigating\ncircumstance, and that single juror can preclude those\nother 11 jurors from giving effect.\nQUESTION: That might have been, Mr. -- Mr.\nFlora, the logical extension of Lockett, but to say that\nLockett itself compelled or directed that extension I\nthink is quite a stretch.\nMR. FLORA: Justice Ginsburg, I think when you\nlook back at the legal landscape over a period of time,\ngoing back from Hitchcock, to Skipper, to Eddings, in all\nof those cases, the Court dealt with different types of\nbarriers. The Court dealt with different pieces of\nfactual evidence relating to character and background and\ncircumstances of the offense.\nWhen the Lockett rule was initially announced by\na plurality of the Court, the Court could not perceive in\nthe future every different type of barrier that may come\nabout, and so what happened over a period of time, when\nyou took the Lockett rule, you were essentially applying\nit to a variety of factual different situations, and each\ntime the Court would look at a particular barrier, which\nit had not perceived in the past, and if it precluded a\njuror or a jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence,\nit struck down that barrier. And that's where we're\ncoming from here.\nSo when we say that it is a stretch of Lockett,\nI don't believe so. I think it is a logical consequence\nof Lockett. I think it is dictated by Lockett and the\ncases that followed after that.\nQUESTION: Does it -- does it mean nothing that\nthis Court was so sharply divided and that you really have\njust an opinion? The lead opinion is labeled opinion of\nthe Court, but Justice White disassociated himself from\nthe reading. He -- he had a much narrower view of the\ncase.\nMR. FLORA: If we look at Mills and if we look\nat the dissent, in looking at the dissent, my\ninterpretation was that the issue was over how a\nreasonable juror would have interpreted the particular\ninstructions in that case. I did not glean from the\ndissent that they thought a unanimity requirement would\nnot constitute a barrier to a jury or jurors giving effect\nto mitigating evidence.\nIf you look at McKoy -- and I think this is a\nquestion that Justice Breyer had posed about a case -- in\nMcKoy at 494 U.S. at 438, the Court says in the majority\nopinion, we reason that allowing a hold-out juror to\nprevent the other jurors from considering mitigating\nevidence violated the principle established in Lockett v.\nOhio, that a sentencer may not be precluded from giving\neffect to all mitigating evidence.\nQUESTION: Yes, but Lockett didn't put it quite\nthat way, did it? I mean, frequently a later decision\nwill kind of characterize an earlier decision in a way\nthat tends to support the later decision.\nMR. FLORA: That is correct. I -- I would agree\nto a point. If we look at Lockett, Lockett did not say\nthat an evidentiary ruling which precluded the\nconsideration or giving effect to mitigating evidence was\nconstitutionally prohibited.\nQUESTION: It said that the -- it said the court\nhad to admit any evidence dealing with the defendant's\ncharacter.\nMR. FLORA: That is correct, but what I'm saying\nis when you look back at Lockett, at the time Lockett was\ndecided, I don't think the Court could -- could envision\nthe various types of barriers that a State could create\nwhich would preclude a sentencer from giving effect to\nmitigating evidence. So each time a barrier came up,\nwhether it was in Eddings or Skipper or Hitchcock -\nQUESTION: But what happened in Lockett was\nquite different than what was involved in Mills. In\nLockett, evidence was offered to be considered by the\njury. The court said, no, that's not what we think of as\nmitigating evidence. And our Court said, any evidence\nbearing on the defendant's character is admissible for\nconsideration by the jury. Now, that's a long step from\nthe way you describe Mills.\nMR. FLORA: The way I describe Mills is\nessentially again that in order to give effect to\nmitigating evidence, you simply cannot have a requirement\nwhich allows one juror to preclude the other 11 from\ngiving that effect. And it's my position that that is -\nthat concept is dictated by the Lockett rule.\nQUESTION: If there's doubt about that, I mean,\none might say you would prevail on that argument in a\ndebate, but Teague requires more, doesn't it?\nMR. FLORA: There is language as to whether if\nthere is a reasonable debate amongst the minds of the\njurors. The problem with that concept, when you look at\nthe history of capital jurisprudence since Furman on\nforward, I can only think of probably two cases in which\nthis Court has been unanimous in its decision, one of\nwhich was Hitchcock v. Dugger. If we say that the rule\nupon which a defendant seeks to rely is a new rule, if so\nmuch as one Justice disagrees, I don't think we could ever\nhave then a rule that would be based on precedent. That's\nthe problem I have.\nQUESTION: Does it make any difference if it's\nfour Justices, as it was in McKoy, do you think?\nMR. FLORA: I don't think you can honestly\nquantitate it -- put a quantitative amount to it. I just\nthink that -\nQUESTION: Does it make any difference that the\ndissenters say Lockett didn't remotely support the rule\nthat a mitigator found by only one juror controls?\nMR. FLORA: I think -- that's a tough question.\nQUESTION: But that is what -- what was said in\nMcKoy by the dissenters.\nMR. FLORA: That is what was said in McKoy by\nthe dissenters, but the majority in McKoy disagreed with\nthat.\nQUESTION: Would it be all right, let's say\ntoday after Mills, for a trial judge to instruct a jury,\nladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is a case of utmost\ngravity from the standpoint of both the defendant and -\nand the families of the victims? And your verdict will be\nmost valuable if you are unanimous as to mitigating and\naggravating factors. You should not surrender your\nindividual views. If you cannot come to that conclusion,\nthen I'll give you further instructions. Could a judge\nsay that? Would that serve a purpose?\nMR. FLORA: A judge could not say that in light\nof Mills. I think, however -\nQUESTION: It's too dangerous?\nMR. FLORA: -- especially in a weighing State\nbecause you're talking about unanimously find aggravating\ncircumstances. Then you also used the phrase unanimously\nfind mitigating circumstances, and that's the problem that\nI have.\nI think clearly a court can give guidance to a\njury in the consideration and weighing of evidence, and\nquite frankly, that happens all the time.\nQUESTION: Because it seems to me that what I've\nsaid is right, that if they are unanimous on all factors,\nthat that's -- that's the jury functioning at its best.\nAnd you would give further instructions in the event that\nthe jurors cannot surrender -- should not surrender their\nindividual views on mitigation, and if that's the way it\nhas to come out, fine. But I want you to try to do this.\nYou think that would be error?\nMR. FLORA: If you tell the jury to try to\nunanimously find all of the mitigating factors, the\nproblem I see with that is what happens if they don't. In\nPennsylvania there is no remedy if there is a deadlock on\nthe finding of a mitigating factor.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, my hypothetical was\nhalf -- half completed, and then we'd have to fill in what\nwould happen and I -- I didn't bother to do that. But it\ndoes seem to me that the instruction I suggest in the\nfirst instance is -- is valuable and also reflects the\nunderstanding at least pre-Mills that -- that many people\nin the legal system had as to the way the jury functions.\nMR. FLORA: It was an understanding of the way\nthe jury functions pre-Mills. I would agree there, but in\nthe penalty phase, in taking a look at the way the\nunanimity requirement would operate in that phase, it is\nvery different -\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think for your case you\n-- you have to amend your statement. If you say this was\nthe general understanding as to the way the jury functions\npre-Mills, I think you should say pre-Lockett or -- or\nyou're in danger of losing your Teague argument.\nMR. FLORA: Well, when I think of a unanimity\nrequirement in a non-capital setting, if one juror holds\nout, that juror cannot force a guilty verdict. In a\ncapital case, if one juror holds out and precludes the\nother 11 from giving effect to mitigating evidence, that\none juror essentially can effect a sentence of death.\nQUESTION: That's true, but now what are you -\nwhat do you say to a different reading of Lockett, which\nwould be the following? A State official reads Lockett\nand says, this is how it's supposed to work, that the\ndefendant can introduce evidence on anything he wants and\nthe jurors can consider any of this mitigating evidence,\nand they do consider it. But when it comes time to vote,\nthe only things that the jurors can use to offset the\naggravating factors are mitigating aspects of the\ndefendant's life, that they unanimously agree are, one, in\nexistence and, two, are mitigating. They look at Lockett\nand say, of course, the jurors considered everything. Now\n-- now it comes time to vote, and at this point these are\nthe rules in our State.\nNow, what I think is the hardest for you is,\nwhile that might not be the best reading of Lockett and it\ncertainly doesn't prove to have been the true reading of\nLockett after Mills, can we say it's an unreasonable\nreading of Lockett?\nMR. FLORA: I think we can.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. FLORA: I think we can because merely giving\nconsideration to mitigating evidence would, I think, also\nnecessitate the ability to give effect to that evidence,\nand I think that's what's essential. If we're left with\nthe fact -\nQUESTION: But you -- you don't seem to mention\nour holding in Saffle v. Parks which was a much harder,\ncloser case in my view about whether it was dictated by\nLockett than your case. And the Court said no. And in\nlight of Saffle, I -- I don't see what you have left going\nfor you on that argument.\nMR. FLORA: In Saffle, you were dealing with an\nanti-sympathy instruction. Sympathy in and of itself is a\nconcept, but it's not evidence of character. It's not\nevidence of background. It's not evidence of the\ncircumstances of a crime.\nQUESTION: Sympathy is a -- a conflict?\nMR. FLORA: Is a concept.\nQUESTION: Concept.\nQUESTION: Oh, concept. Excuse me.\nMR. FLORA: When you introduce sympathy, as the\nattempt was to be done in Saffle, that by doing that\nyou're bringing into the picture something that is totally\nirrelevant and from which a jury would not be able to make\na reasoned moral inquiry into the culpability of the\ndefendant to determine whether a sentence of death or life\nshould be imposed. So when I look at Saffle and I look at\nwhat Saffle was attempting to do, I think that's very\ndifferent than having a barrier which precludes giving\neffect to character evidence and background evidence and\nevidence specifically relating to the circumstances of an\noffense. I see it as being very different under the\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Is -- is -- the point I was thinking\nbefore and I'd -- it was Justice Kennedy actually. I\nthink when he -- he wrote in concurrence. It is apparent\nthe result in Mills fits within our line of cases\nforbidding the imposition of capital punishment on the\nbasis of caprice in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion\nor through arbitrary or freakish means. That's Franklin\nand California v. Brown and Furman and so forth.\nAll right. Think back to what my -- my effort\nto characterize a reasonable State interpretation of\nLockett different from yours. Well, can you say why would\nthat be in your opinion, the State saying they consider\neverything? You remember what it was. Right? All right.\nWhy would that be freakish or arbitrary?\nMR. FLORA: It would be freakish or arbitrary\nagain I think because mere consideration of evidence by a\njury is not enough. I think you have to give that\nevidence effect. Without giving that evidence effect, I\nthink you can end up with an arbitrary imposition of the\ndeath penalty.\nQUESTION: No, but the question is how you give\nit effect. Eddings and Lockett said you cannot preclude\nthe jury, all 12 people, categorically from giving a\ncertain kind of mitigating evidence any consideration.\nThe question in Mills was can you preclude one juror from\ngiving dispositive effect to an item of evidence in such a\nway as to determine the verdict. Those are two very\ndifferent questions. They can be placed under the\numbrella of what effect must jurors be allowed to give to\nmitigating evidence, but they are very different questions\nwithin that umbrella. And it seems to me that because the\nquestions are different, there is not something irrational\nor capricious in someone having a question -- in someone\nbeing uncertain of the answer to the second question even\nthough the first question has been answered in favor of\nadmissibility. What do you say to that?\nMR. FLORA: I think that it still comes back to\nhow the unanimity requirement operates. And the mechanism\nthat's being utilized in employing that unanimity\nrequirement is the actual juror, and if that juror is\nagain I think a lone, hold-out vote, then I think under\nthe circumstances that is a clear violation of the Lockett\nrule.\nQUESTION: Is -- a different question. Is the\njury form in the record -- do we have it? I'm -- I'm\nlooking at pages 66, 67, and 68 of the appendix where --\nof the joint appendix where you have the form. And I'm\ntrying to work out whether this is or is not ambiguous.\nAnd it seems to me it might depend on the way in which it\nappeared on the page because you see the word unanimously\nappears over here in question 2 on page 66, and depending\non how this is indented, it might be whether the jury\nwould reasonably think that that word unanimously does or\ndoes not apply to the questions that are on page 68.\nMR. FLORA: It's improperly indented. When you\ngo back and I think you could actually look at the -- at\nthe jury -\nQUESTION: But the form itself is -- it's\nindented. If it were indented, it would seem that the\nunanimously would govern what follows thereafter, but if\nit's not indented, it seems to me a judge might reasonably\nthink that that word unanimously didn't govern what --\nwhat follows thereafter.\nMR. FLORA: When you have we, the jury, have\nfound unanimously, my recollection of the form was that it\nis actually not indented like that.\nQUESTION: If it's not indented, then -- and\nthis is the other part of the case. See, if -- if it's\nnot indented, then you look at the instruction and in the\ninstruction itself, nowhere does the judge say anything\nabout having to find the -- the mitigating factors\nunanimously. He doesn't say that. And then you look at\nthe jury form and again, if it's not indented, it really\ndoesn't seem to say that they have to find this\nunanimously because the word unanimously seems to apply\nhere on the page to the first three things that are blank.\nAnd then we get a new section. In the new section it\ndoesn't say anything about unanimous.\nSo -- so that was what I want you to reply to\nbecause the question is whether a judge in that State\ncourt could reasonably have taken this form and the\ninstructions and said, well, it -- it doesn't say they\nhave to be unanimous. They wouldn't have thought they\ndid.\nMR. FLORA: My understanding of the verdict form\nwhen it was developed was that we, the jury, have found\nunanimously basically applies to all of the check-off\nitems.\nQUESTION: All of those things.\nMR. FLORA: I beg your pardon?\nQUESTION: And -- and if a judge -- if a judge\nin the State says, well, I think it didn't, what would you\npoint to in reply?\nMR. FLORA: The only thing that I could point to\nis the actual verdict form itself. That's all I could\npoint to.\nI'd like to go back a minute on the -- the\nquestion on the jury question -- or the jury instructions.\nJury instructions in capital cases to begin with\nare very difficult to get across to jurors. Just\ntraditionally we've had a tough time. When you look at a\ncase like this and you have the jury going through the\nguilt phase of the case, that jury is already conditioned\nto a unanimity requirement in finding guilt. When you\nthen carry them over to a penalty phase and you take the\ninstruction that we have here and you give that\ninstruction to them, given the fact it's the way they've\nalready been conditioned and listening to that instruction\nand hearing the word unanimously repeated and repeated,\nthere is a substantial likelihood that the jury would\ninterpret that instruction as requiring unanimity both as\nto the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. And\nthat's the problem with the instruction.\nAnd then when you take the verdict slip and put\nthat on top of it, I think that compounds everything under\nthe circumstances. And that's the problem here.\nWhen we -- staying with this, when the State\nsupreme court looked at the Mills issue -- and they\ndecided Mills on the merits in 1995. It was not decided\nduring the direct review process. Pennsylvania has a very\nunique procedure dealing with finality in capital cases.\nIn 1995 when the State supreme court applied Mills on the\nmerits, what they simply did was they said, we interpret\nour statute as not requiring unanimity. They looked at\nonly a portion of the instruction, I believe approximately\nthree sentences, and they say, the instruction tracks the\nlanguage of our statute and therefore there is no\nviolation of Mills. I suggest that's an unreasonable\napplication because what they didn't do is apply the\ncorrect standard in -\nQUESTION: But that was something in 1995, and\nyou're talking now about a case that was over on direct\nappeal before Mills was decided.\nMR. FLORA: That is correct, but in 1995, when\nthe case was decided, the Pennsylvania supreme court had\nthe benefit of Mills. And that's what's different about\nthis case.\nPennsylvania has a very different and unique\nprocedure which essentially leaves open the direct review\nprocess because in capital proceedings in Pennsylvania\nprior to 1996, the State court on collateral review would\napply any existing constitutional precedents to a claim,\neven though it was not considered first on direct review\nand even though the decision came up or was decided by\nthis Court after the direct review process. It's a very\ndifferent concept there. So there's a question here as to\nwhen finality I think occurred.\nQUESTION: But wouldn't that undercut this\nCourt's remand the first time around? I mean, if it were\n-- if it was still on direct review, then there wouldn't\nbe any question about applying Teague and yet we sent it\nback.\nMR. FLORA: And I understand that, and when you\nsent it back, one of the questions we had in our own mind\nis whether in fact this Court was fully aware of\nPennsylvania's unique process dealing with finality in\ncapital cases.\nIn looking at Teague, one of the very first\nthings you have to do is determine when the judgment is\nfinal. Teague itself speaks in terms of conventional\nnotions of finality, but that doesn't mean a State can't\ndevelop its own concept of finality to which the Federal\ncourts should give respect. After all, States have the\nprimary responsibility for establishing rules of criminal\nprocedure and protecting the rights of an accused.\nWith that in mind, concepts of federalism and\ncomity which underline the basic precepts of Teague are\nnot offended if a State court decides to keep open its\ndirect review process and on collateral review say, look,\nhere's a decision that came down from the United States\nSupreme Court. We are going to apply it to the facts of\nthis case because we want to be absolutely certain that\nexecution of an individual is beyond constitutional\nreproach.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that's the State making a\npolicy that its State court judges will do that, and\nthat's different from a Federal intrusion.\nMR. FLORA: I think the States have a right to\ndo that.\nMay I finish the question?\nQUESTION: I think you've answered it, Mr.\nFlora. Thank you.\nMr. Eisenberg, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. EISENBERG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAs to the last point concerning finality, Your\nHonor, and the argument that the -- Pennsylvania has\ncreated a unique form of collateral review, which is\nreally just direct review, that would be news to the State\nsupreme court which declared this very case to have become\nfinal at the conclusion of direct appeal in 1987.\nMoreover, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has on\nnumerous occasions applied the Teague rule in cases\narising on collateral review to hold that the claim at\nissue was a new rule. Obviously they couldn't have done\nthat if they didn't think that their own collateral review\noccurred after the point of finality.\nAnd -- and furthermore, in -- in response to the\nargument that this Court may not have been fully aware of\nthe supposedly unique nature of Pennsylvania's procedure,\nMr. Flora made exactly that argument in the brief in\nopposition to certiorari that preceded this Court's\nprevious summary disposition in this case.\nConcerning the general argument that Lockett is\nnot a new rule because it forbids any barrier to the\nconsideration of mitigation, of course the whole question\nof what's a barrier that qualifies for Lockett protection\nor not -- and that question has by no means been clear, as\nI mentioned. That was the exact argument that was at\nissue in Walton, and the majority of the Court held that\nto the extent the preponderance standard is a barrier,\nit's an acceptable barrier. But, of course, even in those\ncases where the Court has held that Lockett applies, to\ncreate a rule against a barrier to consideration such as\nSimmons and such as Caldwell, the Court has, nonetheless,\nheld that that rule is new.\nSaffle is certainly additional support for that\nproposition, although in Saffle the Court declined to\ncreate a rule. In Simmons and Caldwell, the Court did\nfind that the rule was required by Lockett, and yet in\nlater cases found that the rule was new.\nNow, one of the reasons I think that the\nalternative view or the -- the failure to see Lockett\nimmediately as a case that precluded unanimity is because\nwe must consider what the nature of consideration of\nmitigating circumstances is, Your Honor. It's not merely\na fact finding. It is really a mixed question of law, in\nfact. The jury is not required to find fact A, fact B, or\nfact C. It is required to find a mitigating circumstance.\nAnd given that that is the nature of mitigating\ncircumstances, it was all the more reasonable for the\nStates not to understand Lockett as precluding unanimity\nfor the purposes of making that mixed fact -- mixed fact\nand law determination at the mitigating stage. But in any\ncase, as I've said, given the dispute even on this Court,\nit was certainly reasonable for the -- for the State\ncourts not to know.\nAnd given the dispute among the other courts\nabout the -- the nature of the application of the Mills\nrule to verdict forms and instructions like this one, it\nwas certainly reasonable for the State courts to -\nQUESTION: See, this mixed question of fact of\nlaw that I think makes it more difficult for you in the\nsense that if it's a mixed question, it's really asking\nthe jurors to decide should this person die, does he\ndeserve to die. And then the pre-Mills statute in the\nState becomes a situation where he will die even though 11\njurors think he shouldn't.\nMR. EISENBERG: But, Your Honor, those -\nQUESTION: And that -- that -\nMR. EISENBERG: -- those difficult mixed\nquestions are exactly the kinds of questions that we\nalways ask juries to decide and in every context outside\nof this one, to decide unanimously, even for example, not\njust in the case of the commonwealth meeting its burden of\nproof, but the defendant meeting his burden of proof where\nthat burden of proof is on him in the situation of a -- of\nan affirmative defense.\nOf course, my argument is not that Lockett can't\npossibly be read to require the result that you suggest.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nEisenberg.\n"
