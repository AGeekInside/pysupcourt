ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. OWEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
When this Court granted review in mid
October in these consolidated cases, the cases
exemplified the Fifth Circuit's settled approach to
reviewing claims of error under this Court's 1989
decision in Penry v. Lynaugh. In both cases the court
below failed to take seriously the requirement that
capital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect
to the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's
evidence, and in both cases the court below found as a
factual matter, both against common sense and this
Court's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard
evidence that a defendant had experienced significant
mistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental
impairments as an adult as reasons to find him less
dangerous rather than more dangerous.
But those opinions, however incorrect, no
longer represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry. In
mid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc
decision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn
away from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to
follow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and
Smith. Under such circumstances, where the assumption
that we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant
review in this case has been so profoundly changed by an
intervening decision of the court below, we respectfully
suggested by motion that the Court return these cases,
vacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit
for further consideration in light of the new opinion in
Nelson.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why, when we are told
that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in
this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so
all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting
the Nelson case for this one?
MR. OWEN: I don't believe, Your Honor,
that, that all that would be accomplished by that would
be certainly not just delay. I think that if the Court
chooses to wait for the State's cert petition in Nelson,
the Court could certainly put our cases aside and hold
them awaiting Nelson -- Nelson's cert petition should be
filed by mid March -- and then could make its judgment
about whether to grant cert in Nelson or not.
If it granted cert in Nelson it could decide
the three cases together; if it found Nelson raised no
questions that were worthy of review, it could either
proceed to decide these cases or send them back to the
Fifth Circuit. I think that the State's decision,
though, Your Honor, is based on a, a misreading of
Nelson. I think that the State has suggested to the
Court that Nelson is in the State's phrase a narrow
fact-based decision and I think that's not, I think
that's not a fair characterization of the Nelson --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why can't we just
read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not
it's correct?
MR. OWEN: I think the main reason, Your
Honor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that
Nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the
Court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle,
rather than trying to use in effect these cases to
decide issues that are presented by a different set of
facts.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If these cases aren't
Nelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases;
it seems to me.
MR. OWEN: Well, Your Honor, I am, I am
confident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the
merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits,
until it finds --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why don't you try to
convince us of that?
MR. OWEN: Then let me turn, let me turn to
our, our merits, Your Honor.
The issue before the Court in this case as
we said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors
a meaningful basis for considering the relevant
mitigating qualities of these two Defendants' mitigating
evidence. In Mr. Brewer's case that included the fact
that he was hospitalized for treatment for a major
episode of depression about three months before the
murder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had
suffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional
abuse from his father as a teenager. In Mr. Cole's case
the evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and
deprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself
emotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic
depression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of
emotional turmoil and problems that continued into
adulthood.
And in addition to that, the expert who
testified at Mr. Cole's trial indicated that he had been
given a set of generally accepted neuropsychological
tests and that on those tests he had scored below normal
and on some of them very far below normal, under the
fifth percentile. And as a result that he probably
suffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction
which limits his impulse control. We respectfully
suggest that under this Court's decision in Penry, those
are all the kinds of facts about these two Defendants
that could reasonably support a juror in concluding that
a life sentence rather than the death penalty was an
appropriate sentence.
But because the jurors were never asked
whether the mitigating evidence reduced the Defendant's
culpability in such a way as to call for a life
sentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable.
The jurors are asked only two questions as the Court
well knows. But just to review, under the pre-1991
Texas statute jurors were only asked two questions: Was
the crime committed deliberately and is the Defendant
likely to pose a continuing threat to society? And
those instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier
this morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the
verdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so
this Court has held repeatedly that whether that two
question format satisfies the Eighth Amendment's
individualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the
evidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's
argued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about
the meaning of their instruction.
And we believe that in this case, throughout
the trial -- in both of these cases, excuse me --
throughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told
that they were not entitled in deciding the future
dangers test question to engage in any sort of broad
inquiry into these Defendants' moral culpability.
Instead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear
to the jurors during jury selection that in answering
the future dangerousness question you must put to one
side your opinion about whether the Defendant's
background, for example, calls for a particular sentence
and answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put
it, the basis of the facts. And we feel that the
evidence in this case very strongly would have supported
the inference that these, both of these Defendants were
likely to be dangerous --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you
compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?
MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: These are closer
cases than Penry, I think. You'd have to concede that,
wouldn't you?
MR. OWEN: I think they are different cases,
Your Honor, I'm not willing to concede that they are
closer cases. I think that in, in the juror's mind, the
only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in
these cases is that the Defendants are likely to be
dangerous in the future. That is exactly the same
conclusion that would have been compelled by the
evidence in Penry. I think that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that, if the
evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's
still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of
some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.
MR. OWEN: Absolutely. Absolutely, Your
Honor,.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- if your case is
less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other
way. But it doesn't mean that those factors are not
mitigating factors.
MR. OWEN: I couldn't agree more, Your
Honor. I think it's very clearly settled by Tennard and
other cases going back to 1976 that facts like a
deprived or abused background or mental impairment are
certainly mitigating. And with further response to your
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: Tennard, Tennard was
decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?
MR. OWEN: This Court's decision in Tennard
postdates the State court decisions in both of these
cases. Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And where is -- this is an
AEDPA case, isn't it?
MR. OWEN: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So we're, we're asking
whether this State court made an unreasonable decision
at the time, and at the time regardless of what the
Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson,
and -- and there is another earlier case, we said that
you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long
as there was some manner in which mitigating effect
could be given that was enough.
MR. OWEN: The Court has been consistent --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So I think Tennard is
utterly irrelevant even if it is right.
MR. OWEN: I, I -- I don't agree. And
here's why, Your Honor. Tennard was itself both a
habeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism
act, like these two cases. And so in Tennard the Court
was called on to decide not squarely the question of
whether the State court decision in that case had been
objectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable
jurist could have found it to be objectively
unreasonable such that a certificate of appealability
was warranted.
Mr. Tennard's case was decided by the State
court in 1997, so I think it is immanent in this Court's
ruling in Tennard that at least as of 1997, it was
apparent that a, a low IQ score alone implicated the
concerns of Penry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did Tennard purport to
overrule Smith, even when it came down? It simply, it
simply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's
concurrence in an earlier case. It certainly didn't
purport to overrule Smith?
MR. OWEN: I, I see where Your Honor is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, Johnson, not
Smith.
MR. OWEN: Yes. And I, and I -- no, it
didn't purport to overrule Johnson. And the reason why
is this: I think the concept that ties this Court's
cases together on Penry is this concept of meaningful
consideration. Because Your Honor focused on one bit of
language from Johnson: the jury has to be able to give
some effect. Elsewhere in the Johnson opinion the Court
said there has to be a meaningful basis for giving
effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the
evidence. And I think neither of those two phrases can
be read out of the context of the other.
In other words, it can't just be some
imaginable, conceivable, strained effect. It has to be
some effect which speaks sensibly to the way that a
juror would -- would understand the evidence to relate
to future dangerousness. In the Johnson case, the
defendant's evidence was his chronological youth, and I
believe that it was, it is sensible for the Court to
find that a reasonable juror could conclude that, that
its relevance to culpability and its relevance to future
dangerousness are essentially coextensive. This case is
not like that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Brewer --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in Johnson wasn't
there also --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.
JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there also mitigating
evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth,
which is analogous to what was involved at least -- well
in both of these cases?
MR. OWEN: Very little such evidence, Your
Honor, in Mr. Johnson's case. And in that case moreover
this Court's question presented, the question on which
it granted review, was limited to the question of age,
so this Court didn't reach or decide in Johnson the
question of whether the other facts about Johnson's
background that found their way before the jury might
have been within the jurors' effective reach.
And I do think that the specific evidence in
Johnson again was argued as a basis for a finding of
nondangerousness, of rehabilitatability. That's utterly
untrue of evidence in Mr. Brewer's case and Mr. Cole's
case, where I think it's very clear that the evidence is
being offered to provide some kind of explanation for
the jurors about what caused these men to commit these
terrible crimes, not that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in, in Brewer's
case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one
hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic
major depression. So it was certainly opened for a jury
to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in
assessing the likelihood that there was going to be
further violent behavior.
MR. OWEN: I don't think, Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Quite a bit
different than Penry.
MR. OWEN: I don't think that you can
separate the diagnosis of depression, that, even that
one single episode of hospitalization for depression,
from what the jury knew about Mr. Brewer's upbringing,
from the fact that they knew he had been hit by his
father in the terms of, his mother said, numerous times.
He was struck with the butt of a pistol, he was hit with
a flashlight, he was hit with a stick of firewood. His
father told him if you ever raise your hand to me you
better kill me, because I'll kill you. He saw his
father bloody his mother, and bruise her eyes, throw
chairs at her.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your submission
-- your submission is that every juror is, or a
reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only
conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is
more likely to be violent in the future? As opposed to
the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because
of this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him
in light of all of this? And I just don't see how you
can speculate which way the jury is going to go.
MR. OWEN: I think that it's not simply
speculation, Your Honor, I think this Court recognized
in Tennard as it did in Penry, that when there is
evidence of mental impairment before the jury, there is
at least the probable inference of dangerousness. The
amici before the court, both the American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, on the one hand, the
Child Welfare League of America, on the other, their
amicus briefs I think really -- really detailed the fact
that this is a commonplace understanding in our society.
And the reason that we know that, Your
Honor, is what the prosecutor said in his closing
argument, where he said to the jury if you take a puppy
and you beat that puppy, then he is going to bite and he
is going to bite as long as he lives. There is nothing
you can do to change that. I think that where you
have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that was in, in
Brewer. Now --
MR. OWEN: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there was no
reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in
Abdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.
MR. OWEN: There was no similar --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So do we have
different results in these two consolidated cases?
MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think that
this Court's case in -- decision in Tennard, when it's
talking about the inference of probable future
dangerousness, this Court says: The jurors might well
have believed that Mr. Tennard would be dangerous in the
future, both as an inference to be drawn from the
evidence and because the prosecutor expressly told them
that's how they ought to regard the evidence.
And in this case we have the prosecutor, in
Mr. Brewer's case we have the prosecutor expressly
telling the jury, just as the prosecutor did in Mr.
Tennard's case, what is mitigating about the guy's
background --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the, so the --
but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial
statement in the Cole case cuts against you.
MR. OWEN: It simply doesn't cut as far in
favor of us, Your Honor. The fact that in Tennard this
Court said that from mental impairment, a probable
inference of dangerousness may be drawn, cuts squarely
in our favor. And you don't even have to go to the
level of inference. In Mr. Cole's case his expert
witnesses said that the background experiences that this
young man had make him dangerous. And they, they could
not forecast exactly how long it might be before he
would conceivably age out of that. But they said is it
10 years? It could be 15 years, it could be 20 years.
I mean, there is just -- that doesn't give a
reasonable juror, as -- if all you ask the juror is,
after they have heard that evidence is, is there a
probability that this guy is going to be dangerous in
the future? I think they would be compelled to say yes,
even though they might say, if they were broadly
instructed --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is evidence of
abatement in that case that was before the jury? So
that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some
moral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show
mercy? And if you ask them whether he is going to grow
out of it, they may well say, it was not his fault
because of this brain disorder and he is going to grow
out of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not
going to sentence him to death.
MR. OWEN: I think that it's not
unconceivable that a juror could have reasoned in that
fashion. But I think it's not reasonably possible. I
think that this Court's decisions in Penry and Tennard
suggest that a juror's commonsensical response to
evidence that a defendant has, presently poses a grave
danger as a result of his life experiences and the
enduring impacts that they have left upon him, the
reasonable response of a juror shown such evidence is to
find future dangerousness, and that that is precisely
the problem with the pre-1991 Texas sentencing statute.
If we had a broad mitigating evidence
issue like the one that's presently given to Texas
juries then we could all be confident that the jury had
engaged in precisely the reasoning that the Court --
that the Court is hypothesizing. That they looked at
the evidence and said yes, he's dangerous, but he's also
deserving of something less than death so we will
accomplish that by answering this issue in a certain
way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Penry we
didn't establish a per se rule. We said it depends upon
the evidence. It depends upon the instructions. It
depends upon what the prosecutors say. It seems to me
that you're arguing for an absolute rule.
MR. OWEN: I don't -- no, Your Honor, and
don't let me, please don't let me be misunderstood. I
do not believe that this is a per se rule. I think
Johnson stands with our case. I think that Graham
stands with our case. I think there's no -- there's no
need for the Court to -- to change anything other than
to -- and it doesn't have to change anything about its
existing approach to Penry for our clients to prevail.
Because I think that if the Court looks at this evidence
and concludes that a reasonable juror approaching this,
there's no reasonable probability that they would have
felt constrained to find him to be a future danger, then
we lose. But I don't think you can look at this record
and see that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not no
reasonable probability, that's not the standard. The
standard under Smith is whether the juries can consider
this mitigating evidence in some manner.
MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, that again,
removing that language from Smith, from the language in
-- if you're talking about Johnson, I know you're
referring to Johnson, that the language in Johnson about
some effect can't be separated from the language about
meaningful effect.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's absolutely one step
removed from that.
MR. OWEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE SCALIA: I say the actual question
is even one step removed. It's whether it is
unreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you
conclude, which is wrong.
MR. OWEN: That's correct. And I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But unreasonable.
MR. OWEN: That's correct, and I think that
it is unreasonable. I think the State court in this
case had essentially two lines of authority, that it was
trying to decide which one controlled this case. It had
Penry which involved evidence of mental impairment and
child abuse, and it had Johnson and Graham which
involved evidence of youth and other background. And I
think that the facts of these cases, given the facts of
these two cases, it is objectively unreasonable to say
they fit over here with Johnson and Graham rather than
they fit over here with Penry. And that's why I think
the decisions by the State courts are not just wrong,
but objectively unreasonable.
If the court has no further questions, I
will reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Owen.
Mr. Marshall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD L. MARSHALL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
When the State court considered these Penry
claims in 1994, 1999 and January 2001, this Court's
decisions in Graham and Johnson made it clear that the
Eighth Amendment requires only that a jury be only able
to consider mitigating evidence in some manner, not in
every conceivable manner. This is because virtually any
mitigating evidence may be viewed as relevant to moral
culpability apart from its relevance to these Texas
special issues.
Cole and Brewer with sizzling bright IQ
scores of 121 and 115, dysfunctional childhoods and
depression, are much more like the troubled childhood
and youth evidence in Graham and Johnson than the mental
retardation, brain damage and severe child abuse
evidence in Penry. Equating these facts to Penry --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the same kind of
evidence. It may be weaker. In other words, it's not
evidence of good deeds in the community. It's two
specific kinds of evidence, the very kinds of evidence
that were involved in Penry. You can argue about
whether this was weaker, but it's certainly different
from youth and reputation for good character.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, I disagree, Your Honor.
In Graham in particular, the Court was not just
considering youth, the Court was considering a troubled
childhood, a difficult childhood in which Graham's
mother had been hospitalized with a mental illness, his
custody shifted from relative to relative. That's
exactly the same kind of evidence we have in Cole.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the evidence was that
he didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds. On
the contrary, he was gentle, kind, God fearing, and
that's why the jury should regard the murder as
aberrational. That was the Graham picture, whereas here
we're dealing with people who are dangerous.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, that's not
the way counsel argued it to the jury in either case.
In both of these cases defense counsel presented his
case to the jury during -- through his evidence and his
argument, that this was youthful indiscretion or it was
an aberration, and it wouldn't happen again, which is
exactly what Graham --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What other choice does
defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to
get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the
future? What else could counsel argue?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Justice Ginsburg,
that's not the question before the Court. The question
before the Court is whether the Eighth Amendment was
violated and whether the jury had a reasonable
opportunity, and in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Well, maybe sending
counsel into those two questions, what violates the
Eighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does
and say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge.
We're not going to bottle it up inside of two special
questions.
MR. MARSHALL: Respectfully, Justice
Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court,
though. We're trying to determine in this case whether
the State courts unreasonably determined that these
juries had a fair opportunity to consider that evidence.
And I think looking at argument, when we're determining
the reasonableness of that decision, looking at
counsel's argument is all we have to go on in
determining whether the jury had a fair shot. Now I
think if you look back at the '90s --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But realistically, a
defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have
those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the
jury into those questions.
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, that was a
strategic choice, though. This is not a Sixth Amendment
claim. We're looking at the Eighth Amendment now. And
so what counsel chose to do is not the question. We're
looking at what he did, and we've got this record to
work with.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're looking at what
Texas law forced him to do.
MR. MARSHALL: I don't think that's the
issue before the Court, Your Honor. I think what we're
looking at is whether he -- the jury had a fair
opportunity here, regardless of what counsel chose not
to do or what the statute forced him to do. The fact is
when the State courts looked at these claims in 1994 and
1999, this evidence was much more like Graham than it
was like Penry, and it was reasonable for them to decide
that there was no Penry error in these cases because of
that fact. And I think it's worth mentioning that if
that's not the case, then I think we've arrived at the
point where Penry has swallowed the rule announced in
Jurek 31 years ago and it -- to which it was only
supposed to be an exception.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Jurek was a facial
challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see
that there are things that would fit into it. Good
character would fit into it. But Jurek said as applied,
we're not certainly not ruling on that. All we're
saying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases
come up the law is filled out. But Jurek doesn't say --
Jurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that
there are these two special factors, that everything can
be squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way
or another can be squeezed into them.
MR. MARSHALL: That is correct, Your Honor.
Jurek was a facial challenge. But in Johnson and Graham
the Court made it pretty clear, I think, that as long as
the evidence is relevant in some way within those
special issues, some mitigating way --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Johnson the
only question presented was age.
MR. MARSHALL: In Johnson, Your Honor?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. MARSHALL: Youth was the central point
of Johnson, but Graham involved youth and a distinctly
troubled childhood, much like we have in these cases.
And so if that evidence was relevant within future
dangerousness and did not amount to Eighth Amendment
error, then this evidence has to be just as relevant.
And in fact we have another layer of analysis on top of
this because we are looking at the State court's
decision under AEDPA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how this fits
in the Graham package. The Graham is, this child came
from a deprived background but managed to survive it,
and he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous.
Look at all the bad things that were done to him. He
turns out not to be dangerous. Apart from this one
murder, he's been a good boy. That's not the picture in
either of these cases.
MR. MARSHALL: That's essentially the
picture, Justice Ginsburg, in Brewer. That's exactly
the way counsel presented it to the jury. But not only
did counsel argue that he wasn't going to be dangerous
despite his childhood shortcomings, there was a
deliberateness definition submitted in the Brewer case,
which is what this Court suggested in Penry in 1989
might remedy this problem. And so the court submitted a
definition of deliberateness and counsel argued it to
the jury, that -- the definition was read to the jury,
counsel argued --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that charge?
MR. MARSHALL: It appears at page 90 of the
joint appendix, Your Honor, and that's the Brewer joint
appendix. Now counsel read that definition to the jury,
and the definition reads as follows: "A manner of doing
an act characterized by or resulting from careful and
thorough consideration characterized by awareness of the
consequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as
though allowing time for a decision." Now counsel read
that definition to the jury during his closing argument.
He argued that Brewer's crime reflected poor planning
and execution, that he was led into it by other actors,
by his girlfriend Christy Nystrom, and that his
commitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness,
depression in this case, were argued specifically as
cause for those faults. And so counsel related the
evidence within that deliberateness instruction to the
jury, and that provided them with a significant vehicle
to give effect to this evidence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what the Penry
Court was talking about, something like what you just
read?
MR. MARSHALL: I think so, Your Honor, and
the Penry Court was not specific about what that
definition should say, but this is certainly helpful to
the jury in this case and in taking account some of this
evidence that was before it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you see, in Johnson
the Court was confronted with the special issues and it
makes the assumption based on the State's representation
there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a
jury to fully consider this. What has happened in these
cases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep
reminding the jury you just must answer special issues
one and two as given. And in the Cole case they say,
even though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a
kid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your
mind, and just go by the special issues. And that's the
concern in these cases.
MR. MARSHALL: That may be a concern,
Justice Kennedy, but the Cole case provides a particular
example of how defense counsel countered that argument.
75 percent of his argument, which is between pages 141
and 144 of the Cole joint appendix, 75 percent of that
argument is that Cole will burn out as he grows older,
and that's based on the testimony of his experts. And
he says that burnout, that likeliness that he will not
be dangerous is a reasonable one.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's because the
issues confined him to that.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor,
but that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here,
and I think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind
anyway to determine that the State court in reading
Graham and Johnson could unreasonably determine that
that wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said,
you have a reasonable doubt about this man's
dangerousness because of the testimony that we presented
to you from his experts that said he wouldn't be
dangerous in the future.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: He's 30 years old, and
the testimony is 40, 50. It says, jury, for 10 years
this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and
he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years. And
that's an effective --
MR. MARSHALL: Justice Ginsburg, that's
easily as effective as the -- as youth was in Graham and
Johnson. Youth is evidence that -- I mean, we don't
know how long it takes people to grow out of youth, but
certainly 10 years wouldn't be unreasonable under the
circumstances in that case. And so I don't see any
difference between youth and burnout in this context.
We are talking about a finite amount of time, we don't
know exactly what that amount of time is, but it's
certainly reasonable for a jury to give mitigating
effect to it under that question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Marshall, I heard
what you read from this charge, and I don't have the
exact words of what the Court was talking about in
Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would
enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime
deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not
slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that
his background and diminished mental capacity diminished
his moral culpability, making the imposition of the
death sentence unwarranted.
So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's
deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them
even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse,
because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable
to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those
impairments. That's the instruction that Penry said
could be given and that would be okay under the
deliberateness. Quite different from the instruction
you read.
MR. MARSHALL: It's different, Your Honor,
but I don't think it's that much different, and the
reason is that this makes the crime a function of
awareness of the consequences of slow unhurried
consideration of those consequences. And then counsel
argues to the jury that Brewer is uncapable of engaging
in that sort of premeditation because of his mental
problems, and so that's what reduces his culpability
under the circumstances. And I think if you combine the
argument and the definition, which we were bound to do
under Boyde versus California, we're supposed to look at
the entire context of the trial here, that that meets
that suggestion in Penry for it. It's not exactly what
the Court suggested.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there something
about moral culpability in what you read?
MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. It's not
mentioned in this definition.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what Penry makes
clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors
that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't
act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide
that they reduce his moral culpability. And that's not
what this charge was?
MR. MARSHALL: This charge is different and
you're correct in that, Justice Ginsburg. However,
future dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this
case, just the same as it did in Graham, and so -- and
in Johnson. The Court said that this kind of evidence,
the evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect
within future dangerousness in some manner. And granted
we can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to
culpability, but the Court explained -- and this was
what the State court was working with at the time it
considered this claim -- this Court explained that just
because we can imagine other ways in which it might be
relevant doesn't mean that we have got Eighth Amendment
error. It's just important that the jury had some way
of getting to it. And I don't see how this is markedly
different than the evidence that the Court said fit
within future dangerousness in Graham.
Now, in -- I think another thing that I need
to mention about Cole is, is that my colleague noted the
expert testimony that Cole lacked impulse control. Now,
I think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in
this case becomes especially apparent when you realize
that, that Cole planned this crime 2 days in advance.
He planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days
before he did it. And so I don't think that an impulse
control problem mitigates his culpability for this crime
in any way and I don't think any reasonable juror would
ever see that. So I think that the mitigating
significance of that evidence in this case is severely
diminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury
heard in Penry, for example, which is that he'll never
learn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a
rape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a
murder and a rape. And so the mitigating relevance of
that evidence was only aggravating within future
dangerousness.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we, how does
that factor in on the issues that are before us, the
weakness of the mitigating evidence? In what way are we
supposed to assess it? We don't have a harmless error
question in these cases.
MR. MARSHALL: There is no harmless error
question, correct, Mr. Chief Justice. However, I think
when we're looking at the Boyde standard, which is --
and in Johnson -- a reasonable likelihood that the jury
was precluded from giving effect to the evidence, the
reasonableness of that likelihood, the reasonableness of
that possibility, depends upon the way the juror, the
jury, heard the evidence and the relative strength of
that evidence.
And so evidence of intoxication, for
example, while it does mitigate culpability in some
manner, would not create the reasonable possibility of
Eighth Amendment error in that sense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument is
that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by,
reasonable consideration was not precluded by the
instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there
wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
But in addition to all of that, the State court was
looking at Penry and Graham when they decided this case
and there was no Penry II yet. There was no Tennard or
Smith. And so it was reasonable for them to compare the
evidence, the weight of that evidence, the strength of
that evidence, to those cases and decide that it fell on
the Graham and Johnson side of the line rather than the
Penry side of the line. That's the only thing they
could do at the time.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you think the
case should have been decided differently should it have
been decided after those decisions?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Justice Stevens, if we
take into account the full effect language that gets
quoted in Penry II, we might well have a different
result. But that wasn't the standard at the time and
under AEDPA --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But those decisions didn't
purport to change the law.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, under Teague they did
not purport to change the law. But I think AEDPA is a
different inquiry here. We're looking at what clearly
established law was at the time the State courts made
their decisions and not necessarily what, you know, what
the Teague inquiry would be. And so at that point I
think it's pretty clear under Graham and Johnson we're
looking at some effect. Whatever "full effect" means
now, it doesn't apply to these cases.
And I think that gets to the main point
here. We're looking at an exceedingly ordinary fact
pattern in a capital murder case in both of these cases:
Dysfunctional childhoods, a small amount of abuse in
Brewer, undescribed --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct, your
position essentially is that, while it may well be true
that these instructions did not permit the jury to give
full effect to this mitigating evidence, that was not
clearly established law at the time of these decisions?
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Justice
Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's your view.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were these decisions
post-Johnson.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. In fact,
the Brewer case was decided the year after Johnson and
the, the Cole case was decided in 1999. So the Court
had not held forth on what Penry meant in a long time at
that point. Graham and Johnson were the last clear
statements the Court had made.
Now, I want to correct one misstatement by
my opposing counsel in Brewer. Brewer was -- there are
three distinct episodes of abuse that appear in the
record in that case: That he was struck with a pistol
by his father, he was struck with his fist, and struck
with a flashlight. He was never struck with a stick of
firewood, and that's on page 65 of the joint appendix.
That's pretty clear. This isolated abuse that occurred
late in life -- we don't know the exact time frame, but
it could be as late as age 18 or 19 -- surely has
different characteristics in a jury's eyes than the
evidence in Penry which, in which the defendant was beat
and beat severely from a very young age, from his
infancy, and that beating, that abuse, caused brain
damage or mental retardation. The ordinary nature of
this evidence in comparison to the exceptional --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting that
some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse
as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young
child?
MR. MARSHALL: I'm not suggesting that, Your
Honor. I'm just suggesting that this is a smaller
amount of abuse than what was in Penry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess striking a big
person is not quite as bad as striking a little person.
MR. MARSHALL: That may be true, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: If the question is one of
the evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error
question rather than a question of whether the jury can
give it effect?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, there is, there is that
reasonable likelihood standard built in under Boyde.
JUSTICE BREYER: The likelihood of?
MR. MARSHALL: Of constitutional error.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, constitutional error
is --
MR. MARSHALL: Is the reasonable likelihood
--
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. MARSHALL: Reasonable likelihood that
the juror was precluded from considering the relevant
mitigating evidence.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if the
evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent
you from considering it, then it's precluded. But if
the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.
MR. MARSHALL: Well, I think it's a
reasonable reading of Graham and Johnson, though, Your
Honor, that weak evidence does fit within these special
issues. That's what those cases held. They said the
jury could consider the evidence in some manner and
therefore there was no reasonable likelihood that they
were precluded from doing so.
JUSTICE BREYER: So imagine you're a juror
and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about
the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his
dangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think
he did it deliberately. And then you think to yourself,
well, could I consider it because it shows a bad
childhood and that is deserving of a life term? I'm not
sure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that
purpose at all? What's my answer under Texas law?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the State
court considering this case was looking at Graham, in
which the Court Stated that that evidence fit within
future dangerousness.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I have gotten --
I've finished considering it for future dangerousness.
No, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous. Now I say to
myself, can I consider it for the purpose of showing a
bad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like? Can I
consider it for that purpose? What's the answer under
State law?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is no.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Justice Breyer, the
answer is yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is yes?
MR. MARSHALL: The answer is yes because
this Court said it was yes. This Court said that in
Graham the jury was free to accept counsel's suggestion
that Graham's conduct was merely an aberration and that,
and that he wouldn't do it again. That's exactly the
way the case was argued to the jury by these two defense
lawyers.
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about
future dangerousness. I'm talking about -- I would be
repeating myself. You've taken that, I'm not talking
about future dangerousness. The jury's decided that
matter in your favor. I'm saying does Texas law allow
-- you understood what I said, didn't you?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right, and the answer
is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the Texas case
that says that?
MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, it's not a Texas
case. It's this court in Graham and Johnson. This
Court said that evidence of a troubled childhood, of the
particular dysfunction that comes with youth, can be
taken as an aberration, that the person will not repeat
--
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, did we say that in
the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of
childhood abuse and so forth?
MR. MARSHALL: The question is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or was it really applied
just in the context of the Graham evidence?
MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, in these
cases it's relevant for the same reasons it was in
Graham. This evidence is not enough like Penry to
warrant relief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. But the answer to
Justice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can
only consider it in the, in the context of
deliberateness or future dangerousness.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that depends on
the nature of the evidence, I take it? I mean, if the
evidence we were talking about was biological
predisposition to violence, that's only going to point
in one direction, right? I mean, if the evidence is
isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is
that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well,
that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated
it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be
regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.
MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Mr. Chief
Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so when you get
into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we
supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that
anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to
do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going
to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to
outgrow it? Do we make that determination in every case
based on the particular evidence and the particular
arguments that counsel made?
MR. MARSHALL: I don't think there's any
other way to do it, Mr. Chief Justice. This Court has
continually engaged in a case-specific analysis on a
case-by-case basis in these types, when granting these
types of claims.
If the Court has no further questions --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Unless you take the view
that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury
distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct
on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that
don't tie in at all to dangerousness.
MR. MARSHALL: That's because, Justice
Ginsburg, the Penry's evidence was relevant only in an
aggravating way to those issues. It suggested nothing
other than the fact that he would be a future danger,
and when the evidence is not so aggravating, when the
evidence suggests, suggests that there is a mitigating
answer to the future dangerousness question, that the
person won't be a future danger because they're going to
burn out or because this is an isolated incident, we
have a different situation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, if you
know, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases,
are pending that were decided before the legislature
amended the instruction?
MR. MARSHALL: Justice Kennedy, there are 47
inmates on Texas death row that were sentenced under
this statute that remain there. There are nine cases
which have litigated Penry claims all the way to
conclusion in Federal court. There are 25 more that are
somewhere in the pipeline either in State court or
Federal court. I've actually looked at the cases and 17
of those cases, 17 of the 34 that are still in the
system, have evidence that's almost identical to these
cases.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But that wasn't the
question. Your question was how many were before or
after the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it your answer
was that all these were tried before Texas amended the
statute. Was it 1991 when it amended the statute?
MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And all the cases you
mentioned were tried before 1991.
MR. MARSHALL: Yes. 47. 47 cases were
sentenced under this pre-1991 statute.
If the Court has no further questions, I'd
ask that they affirm the judgment of the court below.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Marshall.
You Mr. Owen, have you 12 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. OWEN: I'd like to make two points about
Graham since it's been a subject of some discussion.
First is to remind the Court that Graham was a Teague
case. Graham was a case about whether the law in 1984,
prior to Penry -- Mr. Graham's case became final on
direct appeal -- dictated the result that he was asking
for, which I think doesn't mean it has no persuasive
impact on these cases, but I certainly think it limits
its precedential value outside the scope of the question
of youth that Johnson later settled squarely.
The second thing I want to say about Graham
is this is the State's brief in Graham, 91-7580, and I
want to just note that at page 26, squarely. This is
the State's brief in Graham 917580 and I want to note at
page 26, footnote 8 the State says the insubstantiality
of Graham's evidence of a troubled childhood is readily
apparent, which certainly suggests that there is a fair
reading of the evidence in Graham of this background
evidence as not being substantial, not being evidence
about abuse or mistreatment. The fact that he was moved
from one relative to another because of the
circumstances in his family, in that case was not shown
to have any negative impact on him. Whereas I think in
Mr. Cole's case certainly there is expert testimony that
it had a very devastating negative impact on him. So
Graham really does not even give the Court much guidance
on the question of troubled background because there is
no indication that Graham actually had a, a background
of mistreatment.
By the same token with respect to the
State's comment or my brother's comment that the, the
record doesn't bear out that Mr. Brewer was struck by
his father with a stick of firewood, that is correct.
What the record actually says is, if I may quote from
the Brewer JA at page 90 -- 95 -- 65, excuse me: "He
tried to hit him with a stick of firewood. When he went
outside to grab the firewood I --" -- that's
Mr. Brewer's mother -- "slammed the front door and
locked it, and he smashed the glass out of the front
door with the firewood. That was the night I had him
arrested."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How old was Brewer
at that time?
MR. OWEN: I believe he was 15, Your Honor.
But I also want to, I also want to emphasize that I
think there, the fact is, the testimony is that
Mr. Brewer was hit numerous times. That's his mom's
word. Hit with objects only twice, but hit numerous
times. And I don't think the Court should also
underestimate the significance of the evidence that
Mr. Brewer saw his father brutalize his mother on many
occasions, because that evidence too contributes. It's
not just the difference between being hit and watching
someone else being hit. I think everyone understands
that there are enduring feelings of shame and guilt, and
that the teenage son feels --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the argument is
that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the
instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows
that he will be violent again. They will not feel that
they can take it into account in any way to determine
that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy,
or that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer
records confused here, but that this, the cause for the
violence will abate with, with age.
MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or that in, I guess
in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence
was caused by a particular bout of depression, that
would not necessarily recur.
MR. OWEN: I, I don't think that's -- that's
not our argument, first, Your Honor, for this reason.
The court's question was, as I understand
it, don't we have to show there is no way the jury could
have understood this evidence except as aggravating? I
don't think that's, I don't think that's the test. In
Tennard this Court said if the jury might well have
considered the evidence as aggravating, then --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that was after --
I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or
not it could be considered in some manner.
MR. OWEN: In some manner that is reasonable
and that gives effect to the relevant mitigating
qualities of the evidence. Yes, Your Honor. And I do
think that the, that the fact of Mr. Brewer's -- the
fact that the jury knew that he had endured this
mistreatment as a teenager could only have been given
aggravating effect. I don't think there is any way to
reason from the premise that he was mistreated
physically and emotionally by his father when he was a
teenager, to the conclusion that therefore he will be
less dangerous in the future. That doesn't seem to me
to be a reasonable connection.
And I think that what the Court was calling
for in Johnson was that there be some sensible link
between the proffered mitigating evidence and these
narrow questions, which as has been pointed out already
were the only options for the jury in this case. There
was no, there was no mercy option. There was no
mitigation instruction. The jury was told solely these
two -- these two special issues.
With respect to the Brewer argument that
there was a deliberateness instruction, I think Justice
Ginsburg has it exactly right in observing that in
Penry, what the Court said was that to satisfy the, you
know, to fix the deficit in the former Texas special
issues, a definition of deliberateness would have to
direct the jury's attention to the defendant's personal
culpability. And I don't think this instruction does
that. This instruction directs them to the sort of
quantity of forethought, how much did he think about it,
how long did he think about it, did he mull it over?
But I don't think that that captures the moral
culpability aspect that Penry says is required under the
Eighth Amendment.
If the Court has further questions I'm happy
to entertain them. Otherwise we would ask that the
Court grant our motions. In the alternative we would
ask that the Court reverse the judgments in both cases
with directions to reinstate the District Court's
favorable judgment in Mr. Brewer's case and to grant
habeas relief in Mr. Cole's case.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Owen.
