REDDING\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. REDDING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Federal Circuit's opinion is simply\nwrong. Enactment of Section 6404(h) did not repeal\ndistrict court and Court of Federal Claims refund\njurisdiction over interest by the Internal Revenue\nService. Both circuits have found that there was\npre-existing jurisdiction prior to the enactment of\nSection 6406(h). Nothing in Section 6404(h) expressly\nrepeals that jurisdiction, and there are many instances\nin the code where Congress when it does intend to\nexpressly limit jurisdiction, will state that in the\nenabling statute. Reference to the tax court, specific\nreference to the tax court in 6404(h) was mandated\nunnecessary by Section 7442 and the nature of the tax\ncourt. The tax court is only given jurisdiction over\nthose matters where it is specifically set out in the\ntax code.\nAnd the established framework of pay and sue\njurisdiction in the district courts and prepayment\njurisdiction in the tax court is a well established\nframework for tax litigation. That has been accepted\nand enunciated by this Court as far back as the Flora\nopinions. It's a well established pattern of duality of\njurisdiction in the two forums.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not with respect\nto abatement of interest in particular.\nMR. REDDING: Not with respect to abatement\nof interest, Your Honor, but as a general basis. The\navailability of a prepayment forum that was originally\nenacted to be complementary to the ability to pay and\nsue in order to protect smaller taxpayers, and avoid the\nhardships faced by having to pay in full before having\naccess to refund jurisdiction, and in fact perhaps to\navoid bankruptcy. That is completely consistent with\nthe way this section is enacted. Section 6404(h) even\nincludes the limitation that only taxpayers with a net\nworth below $2 million or corporations below $7 million\nhave prepayment access to the tax court. And abatement\nby itself is generally a prepayment remedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a -- on that\npoint, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this\ntripartite system, Congress would want only the tax\ncourt to be restricted in the people who could claim the\nabatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax\ncourt on your theory, if there is authority in the\nclaims court and in the district courts, they're not\nlimited to the net worth restrictions.\nMR. REDDING: That is correct, Your Honor,\nbut I do believe that it is consistent with the intent\nof the formation of the tax court to provide a\nprepayment forum to especially avoid hardship and the\npotential even of bankruptcy. It's very consistent with\nthat pattern to say that the larger taxpayer can afford\nto pay the tax and sue, whereas the smaller taxpayer may\nbe in greater need of a prepayment forum. It's also\nconsistent with imposing the very short limitation\nperiod for bringing an action in the tax court, because\nthere the government has a very vested interest in being\nable to proceed with collection of the tax.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why would you\nnot want some -- a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed\nin the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims\ncourt?\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor, I can't speak to\nCongress's reasoning behind that but I can understand\nthe logic behind saying we're going to create a special\nprepayment remedy that allows the smaller taxpayer an\nexpedited means of resolving these issues without having\nto first pay it and sue, whereas the larger taxpayer is\nnot put into a hardship position, is not inconvenienced\nas bad by having to follow the old well established\nprocedures of pay and sue.\nAnd I will note that 6404(h) does not apply\nonly to 6404(e)(1), which is the subsection we're coming\nunder. 6404(h) applies to all of the abatement grounds\nunder Section 6404. And if we were to repeal\njurisdiction in the district court and the Court of\nFederal Claims over all of those provisions, then we\nwould be completely taking away a remedy that has been\nthere all along to the larger taxpayers. But to create\na new remedy that is consistent with the pattern that\nallows a small taxpayer access to a prepayment forum, I\nthink is completely consistent with the entire history\nof this court. This court meaning the tax court. And\nits purpose.\nIn evaluating two statutes that appear to\neither conflict or overlap, I think it is, in reviewing\nwhatever doctrine you call it, whatever canon you call\nit of interpretation, it appears to me that what this\nCourt has always done is to look to see if the two\nstatutes can be harmonized rather than seeing if one\nsupersedes the other. And here considering the\nextension of prepayment jurisdiction to the tax court\nmerely an additional form of prepayment jurisdiction\nbeing granted to the tax court is completely consistent\nwith the long-standing pattern of pay and sue\njurisdiction in the district courts, prepayment\njurisdiction in the tax court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have no\nbasis for an abatement of interest action apart from\n6404(h), correct? That is the only place you get the\nactual cause of action to sue for abatement of interest?\nMR. REDDING: Abatement as a prepayment\nremedy, yes, Your Honor. Once the IRS has failed to\nabate the interest and you make payment then you have\nthe normal refund, refund provisions available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what would you\ncite to, in response to the prior cases that said you\nhad no cause of action for abasement of interest?\nMR. REDDING: Actually Your Honor I don't\nbelieve that's what the cases said. They said you had\nno cause of action that could be pursued under\n6404(e)(1) but even the seminal cases, Horton -- or\nSelman and Horton Homes compared a Section 6404(e)(1)\naction to a Section 6404(e)(2) action and basically said\nyou could have brought a refund claim. If you qualified\nunder (e)(2) there would have been no impediment to\nbringing that as a refund action because there was a\nclearly established standard. The (e)(2) provision is a\nmust standard.\nNow, under 6404(h) if it is exclusive over\nabatement jurisdiction, then any taxpayer who would have\nhad access to the courts, for example for an (e)(2)\nabatement case, unless they are a small taxpayer they\nwill be completely denied any remedy whatsoever.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is (e)(2)? Is it\nproduced in these materials. I got (e)(1); I don't have\n(e)(2). I don't really like talking about a section I\ndon't have in front of me.\nMR. REDDING: I believe all of 6404 was in\nthe appendix but I don't have it in front of me.\nYeah. It's -- it's immediate, in the code section\nit's immediately below (e)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah.\nMR. REDDING: But I mean -- I'm sorry, Your\nHonor. That doesn't help you --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REDDING: -- where it is in the\nmaterials.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's one thing about this\ncase I'm sure about.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REDDING: I apologize, Your Honor, but I\ndo not have that. It is in the appendix to the\npetition, the entire code section is set out.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the one that says\ninterest abated with respect to erroneous refund check?\nOr am I reading wrong?\nMR. REDDING: Yes, Sir, it is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the one I'm\nlooking at just has (e)(1). Did you have a page number?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At page 42 of the appendix,\nall -- all there is is a subsection 1.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. REDDING: Well, Your Honor, I have the\ncode section in front of me now but I still do not have\nthe reference in the appendix. I apologize but I simply\ndon't have it, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I go back to\nsomething you just said, that I thought you said that\nthe people would have no remedy if the tax court -- were\nthe only forum for abatement claims? And it would be\nthe exclusive forum but nobody -- it wouldn't deny\naccess to anyone.\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Abatement claim, if you\nread this as the Government does, is one place where you\ngo, and the tax court but everyone who has an abatement\nclaim could go there. So who's being cut out?\nMR. REDDING: Well no, Your Honor, everyone\ncannot go there. You can only go there if you're a\ntaxpayer, an individual taxpayer with a net worth of\nless than $2 million.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, yes. But -- yes.\nAnd I had asked you before well doesn't it seem, it\nseems strange that Congress would want to limit the\nauthority of the, of the court where most people go and\nhave no limit for the wealthier taxpayers.\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor, again, my, my view\nof that is the Congress intended to limit the special\nrelief of prepayment jurisdiction to the smaller\ntaxpayers. But the availability of a pay and sue remedy\nwas already in existence and continues in existence and\nthose wealthier taxpayers generally can afford to pay\nthe liability in full and sue.\nA prepayment forum which delays the\ncollection of the tax to the Government, you know, the\nGovernment has a special interest there in restricting\naccess to that relief so that it can proceed with\ncollection. And again, it just makes logical sense that\nas to a larger taxpayer the ability to pay and sue\nshould be a sufficient remedy. Generally speaking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Congress was\noperating on the assumption that no court could hear an\nabatement claim?\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor, that comes largely\nfrom the legislative history, the House Committee report\naddressing interestingly, subsection (h). And\nsubsection (h) since it applies only to prepayment\nabatement claims specifically, I think then you, then\nthat legislative history makes sense. Because in that\nsame page in the legislative history --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, give me a decision\nof the claims court or a district court that said courts\nhave authority to abate the interest before Congress\nenacted this legislation?\nMR. REDDING: I don't believe there is a\nspecific case out there that I can cite to you where it\nhas happened. It is, it is reflected in both Horton\nHomes and Selman that that availability existed with\nrespect to (e)(2) to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it fair to say that\nCongress acted on the assumption that there was no right\nto the abatement with, and to the payment unless it\nenacted the statutes?\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor, I don't believe\nso. Again, because that legislative history that's\nreferred to is restricted, the House Committee report is\nrestricted only to the subsection creating the tax court\nprepayment jurisdiction. It is not relevant to the rest\nof the amendments to Section 6404. And I note that in\ndoing so Congress also did not make the restriction on\nthe $2 million/$7 million net worth relative to the\nrights being granted under the other provisions of 6404.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's easy to see why the\nonly cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1).\n(E)(2) which we don't have in the materials, but I have\ngotten a copy of it.\nAnd (e)(1) says that the Secretary \"may\"\nabate the assessment of all or any part. And those\ncases that denied it said this is discretionary; he\ndoesn't have to. (E)(2) on the other hand, interest\nabated with respect to erroneous refund check, says the\nSecretary \"shall\" abate the assessment. So really,\n(e)(2) doesn't -- doesn't do you any good at all with\nrespect to whether there was a cause of action before\n(h) was adopted.\nMR. REDDING: Well -- Your Honor, I\nrespectfully disagree because 6404(h) applies to (e)(2)\nas much as it does to (e)(1). And any taxpayer that\nwould have met the net worth requirements or whether or\nnot they met the net worth requirements that are now in\nH, could have brought a refund suit under (e)(2)\npreviously.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure. But --\nbut that's just saying, if -- you used to have the\nentitlement under (e)(2) and you're saying well, you\ncould bring cases under (e)(2). But 6404(h) allows you\nto bring cases under (e)(1). It would follow a fortiori\nthat you could bring them for (e)(2) as well, but that\ndoesn't prove that you could prove them under (e)(1) in\nthe claims court or the district court.\nMR. REDDING: No it does not, Your Honor.\nWhat I'm trying to address is the intent to repeal the\npre-existing jurisdiction, again because 6404(h) does\nnot apply just to (e)(1), where the might be a question\nabout whether or not they could have brought the case\npreviously, although jurisdiction existed. Clearly they\ncould have brought their case under (e)(2).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. What you're say is\nthat cases that used to be bringable under (e)(2) would\nnow be bringable only under (h) which would in effect be\nan implicit repeal of (e)(2).\nMR. REDDING: Of (e)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At least as far as suits\nelsewhere than in the tax court.\nMR. REDDING: That's correct. And\nadditionally limit it solely to the small taxpayer. The\nlarger taxpayer who had a prior remedy would have none.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems to apply just to\nabuse of discretion.\nMR. REDDING: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER:: Doesn't the new statute\njust apply to abuse of discretion?\nMR. REDDING: No, Your Honor, it does not.\nIt creates the standard under which the tax court may\nreview any interest abatement claim under Section --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says you have\njurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive\ndiscretion. Maybe I'm reading the wrong place. 6404 --\nMR. REDDING: Yes, Your Honor, that is the\nstandard it applies to.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Well that standard\ndoesn't apply to the (e)(2). It has nothing to do with\nit; (e)(2) says if it's a refund, abate, if not, not.\nIt's not a question of abuse of discretion or not.\nMR. REDDING: Well I think it's the standard\non which they are to review the Government's action.\nAnd I believe I cannot cite the case but there are cases\nthat hold that a violation of law is a per se abuse of\ndiscretion. There are also other subsections --\nsubsections under 6404 which are made provisions in\nother 6404 subsections, which are must provisions.\nThere are about five different subsections under 6404\nthat provide for interest abatement.\nAgain, I come back to the long-established\npattern of having prepayment jurisdiction in the tax\ncourt and postpayment refund jurisdiction in the\ndistrict courts and Court of Federal Claims. It's a\nwell established system, and adding a new prepayment\nform of relief into the tax court in no way should be\nimplied to be a repeal of the long established refund --\npay and sue refund jurisdiction that normally exists.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you went into\nthe district court and claimed that the failure to abate\ninterest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely\non for the -- for the cause of action?\nMR. REDDING: If the failure to abate\ninterest was an abuse of discretion under (e)(1) you\nwould rely on (e)(1) for the cause of action. The right\nis created by the other subsections of (h) of 6404.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the prior\ncases consistently, consistently said that there was no\njudicial review because it was \"may abate\" and that it\nwas only with the arrival of 6404(h)(1) that there was a\ncause of action for abuse of discretion?\nMR. REDDING: Yes, Your Honor, but I believe\nwhat they actually said is that there was jurisdiction\nto hear it but there was not a justiciable standard that\ncould be applied with regard to (e)(1). However, once\nCongress came in and says to the tax court you're going\nto apply this standard, there is a standard of review.\nThat now indicates Congress did not intend it to be\nsolely discretionary, and that the district court or\nCourt of Federal Claims would look to the general common\nlaw; it would look to precedents, such as the APAA abuse\nof discretion standard is consistently used throughout\nthe court systems in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want to look\nat 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you\ndon't want the other stuff that goes along with\n6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to\nhave less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?\nMR. REDDING: That is correct, Your Honor.\nThe abuse of discretion standard is a common law\nstandard which has been carried over into -- into this\nstatute. But to create a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it didn't exist\nbefore this statute? I mean, the lower courts as I\nunderstand it said, routinely, yes, you can have\njurisdiction, but have you no claim for relief because\nthere is no, no law to apply. This is a totally\ndiscretionary matter of the Commissioner's grace. So\nCongress perhaps didn't grasp the subtle distinction\nbetween no jurisdiction, and you can walk in the door\nbut you go out the next door, because there is no\njusticiable claim. And it provided peculiarly in the\ntax court for relief that was not available anyplace\nbefore?\nMR. REDDING: I understand and that's\nbasically the Fifth Circuit's view, Your Honor. I do\nnot agree with that view. I think that the Congress was\nmerely expanding the existing structure of prepayment\njurisdiction for the tax court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Fifth Circuit -- I\nthought the Fifth Circuit went your way.\nMR. REDDING: Pardon?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Fifth\nCircuit went your way.\nMR. REDDING: It did, Your Honor. I'm\nsorry. The Federal Circuit analyzed it as you have. I\ndo not believe that that is the correct analysis. I\nthink the Fifth Circuit has this one right. What you\nhave is a grant of jurisdiction to the United States Tax\nCourt for a prepayment forum of relief which is\nconsistent with the existing pattern, and in no other\ninstance where that has been done has there been an\nimplied repeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Redding, let me\ncome back to the phantom (e)(2) which we have finally\ntraced down.\nMR. REDDING: I apologize, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am not sure that (h)\nwould impliedly repeal (e)(2), because (e)(2) is\nmandatory. There isn't any question under (e)(2)\nwhether there has been an abuse of discretion. There is\nno discretion. It is mandatory to the extent that the\nAdministrative Procedure Act would govern (e)(2), it\nwould be for a violation of law not for abuse of\ndiscretion.\nSo when (h) says the tax court shall have\njurisdiction to determine whether the Secretary's\nfailure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, I\nwould take that to apply only to (e)(1), which says the\nSecretary may abate and not to (e)(2) which says the\nSecretary shall abate. There is no question of -- of\ndiscretion in (e)(2) at all.\nMR. REDDING: I understand that argument,\nYour Honor. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was a pretty good\nargument, I thought.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REDDING: I agree, Your Honor. I would\nnote to the Court, though, that 6404(d) is also a\nmay-abate provision which is in the code. 6404(a) is\nalso a permissive abatement provision, and those\nprovisions would clearly be covered by it. I, when it\nsays it may, may review a failure to abate interest\nunder 6404, I read that as encompassing all of 6404 and\ncreating their standard for review. I do not review\nthat as a new standard that applies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about those other\nsections, (c) and (d), which say the Secretary is\nauthorized? Have there been cases which, which said\nthat you could sue for, for his failure to make use of\nthat?\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor, I've been able to\nfind no case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same as with (e)?\nMR. REDDING: Yes Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As with (e)(1).\nMR. REDDING: Yes, Your Honor. There's no\nclearly history of cases.\nI would also submit, Your Honor, that\nbecause of the established pattern of pay and sue versus\nprepayment jurisdiction and the necessity to make a\nspecific reference to the tax court in any grant of\njurisdiction in the tax code in order to enable the tax\ncourt to have jurisdiction, that if this is the ruling\nof this Court with regard to 6404(h), it is going to\nraise a question every time prepayment jurisdiction is\nextended to the tax court over any matter as to whether\nthat somehow now becomes exclusive of the conventional\npay and sue remedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, there's a\nfundamental difference on this particular question\nbetween pay and sue and sue --\nMR. REDDING: Prepay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- prepay, because\nif you -- in the district court if you're paying and\nsuing you're not really subject to the accrual of\ninterest, right?\nMR. REDDING: No, Your Honor, that is not\ncorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I owe the IRS,\n1,000 dollars and they send me a bill and I paid the\n1,000 dollars, they've got the money, I don't. So I\ndon't owe interest on that, do I?\nMR. REDDING: Your Honor, may I reflect it\nback to the facts in this case. The time period with\nrespect to which abatement is requested occurs many\nyears before the IRS ever sent the taxpayer a bill. The\nerrors and delays complained of in this case occurred\nduring the course of the partnership level examination\nand proceedings. The taxpayer at that time doesn't even\nhave a notice of what the adjustments are going to be,\nlet alone what his tax liability is. In a partnership\ncase, the partnership level determinations are made at\nthe partnership level. The Government then, without any\nfurther notice to the taxpayer, is free to make the\ncomputation of the taxpayer's liability and send him a\nbill.\nDuring the pendency of the proceedings at\nthe partnership level, there is virtually no way to\ntell, except as to what the outside maximum liability\nmight be if the Government prevails, what your liability\nis going to be. And if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The initial bill\nincludes the interest?\nMR. REDDING: Absolutely, Your Honor, that's\nbeing asked to be relieved of in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But still, in the\ntax court situation it's still accruing?\nMR. REDDING: Well, yes. It's accruing\nduring the course of the tax court proceeding. And\nagain, even there for an individual if the time period\ninvolved was prior to the assessment the pay, the being\nable to pay it and cut off the interest really wouldn't\nmake sense.\nBasically, Your Honor, I believe that, I\nbelieve that this case really rests on what I think the\nFifth Circuit summarized quite well when it says that it\nmakes more sense in this case to simply believe the\nCongress, quote, \"simply intended\" -- \"simply chose to\nextend concurrent jurisdiction to the tax court over a\ncertain class of claims.\" And that's all it really has\ndone here. It has implemented and expanded the\nconventional jurisdiction of the tax court as a\nprepayment forum before you do have to pay the liability\nto resolve a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.\nThere is no reason, I don't believe, to see\nthis as a major departure from the existing structure of\npay and sue jurisdiction versus prepayment jurisdiction.\nThis is just a well established plan that's been in the\ncode for many, many years.\nMr. Chief Justice, if the Court has no other\nquestions I would reserve my remaining time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Redding.\nMr. Marcus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MARCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals correctly held that the\ntax court has exclusive jurisdiction over actions\nchallenging interest abatement determinations under\nSection 6404(e)(1). The language, structure and history\nof the interest abatement review statute supports the\ncourt of appeals' decision as to principles of sovereign\nimmunity. Under Petitioner's theory the specific\nrestrictions on the remedy that Congress created may be\navoided by the simple expedient of filing a challenge in\nanother forum. Nothing in the interest abatement review\nstatute or this Court's precedent permits that result.\nThe place to start is the language of the\ninterest abatement review statute. Section 6404(h)\nprovides the tax court shall have jurisdiction over an\ninterest abatement action brought by taxpayers who meet\nthe net worth limitations set out in another part of the\ncode and who file their claim within 180 days of the\nSecretary's mailing of a final determination not to\nabate interest.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If, if the history of this\nissue had been such that before the enactment of this\nsection the courts of appeals were divided or the courts\nwere divided as to whether or not there was jurisdiction\nin the Court of Claims and in the district court, would\nyour position be different?\nMR. MARCUS: No, our position would be the\nsame. We would first look to the statutory language of\nSection 6404(e)(1) and that provision provides that the\nSecretary may abate interest when there is an error or\ndelay committed by an IRS employee in the performance of\na ministerial act, and that \"may\" language contrasts\nwith other provisions that have mandatory language that\nrequires the Secretary to abate. In addition, if you\nlook at the nature of the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's, so it's only (h)\nthat gives any court any jurisdiction at all?\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though in our\nhypothetical world some courts of general jurisdiction\nthought that they did have jurisdiction?\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice\nKennedy. Up until 1986 the IRS didn't even have ability\nto abate in these circumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as\nwell as to (e)(1)? Does it apply only to discretionary\nabatement provisions?\nMR. MARCUS: No, it's our position it\napplies only to discretionary abatement determinations\nby the Secretary. The language -- typically when abuse\nof discretion standard is imposed, it presupposes that\nthe decision being reviewed involves an exercise of\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what happens with\n(e)(2)? You use the pay and sue provisions?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes, you could use it, although\nit typically comes up when the Government has filed an\naction to recover an erroneous refund. It's usually\nraised as a defense. But you could bring it that way.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't it an abuse --\nisn't it an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to\nfail to do what the statute tells him he absolutely\nmust?\nMR. MARCUS: I think as a technical matter,\nJustice Kennedy, that's correct. But I don't think\nthat's the natural way to read the statute, and when the\nCongress imposed that abuse of discretion standard it\nassumed that the decisions that were being -- that were\nsubject to review involved the exercise of a discretion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, I don't even think\nit's technically correct. How is it an abuse of\ndiscretion? He has no discretion. He must do it. How\ncould you say he has abused his discretion? What\ndiscretion?\nMR. MARCUS: Well I think some cases --\nthere is some case law that has said that when there is\nan error of law committed by a lower court that can\nconstitute an abuse of discretion. But in our view\nagain it's not the natural reading of the standard that\nCongress put in. And also, if you look at the\nlegislative history, Justice Kennedy, you'll see that\nCongress was focused on the absence of a judicial remedy\nwith respect to determinations by the Secretary that\ninvolved an exercise in discretion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what the cases\nsaid prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest\nabatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to\nconsider that claim. They would just say there's no\nstandard to apply, so it's committed to agency\ndiscretion by law. Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes\nalong and gives you a standard, so that removes that\nobjection. What's wrong with that?\nMR. MARCUS: I think that's -- with respect,\nI think the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is too clever by\nhalf. The Fifth Circuit basically extracted one piece\nof Section 6404(h)'s integrated whole and held that\nthere now is a refund cause of action that's not subject\nto the specific restrictions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nof the way that Congress enacted the language. It\ndoesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court\nshall have jurisdiction. It says the tax court shall\nhave jurisdiction. That is a, in many respects a\npreferred forum and they're saying you can bring it\nthere as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction\nthat the prior courts had recognized.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think you need to look\nat what the state of the law was when Congress enacted\nthis provision and think about what Congress would have\nwanted to do. If Congress would have wanted to reverse\nthose decisions that had said there's no cause, no\nrefund cause of action for interest abatement, they\ncould have easily referenced the refund statute and said\nthere is a refund action available. They also could\nhave specified that the Court of Federal Claims or the\ndistrict courts can exercise jurisdiction over interest\nabatement issues.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you think it's\nkind of strange, though, if you have the interest\nabatement is available only for a particular category of\ntaxpayer and not others?\nMR. MARCUS: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have a net\nworth of two million and one dollar you can't get any\ninterest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.\nMR. MARCUS: I don't think, I don't think\nit's anomalous. I think if you consider the concept of\ninterest under the tax code, the way it works under the\ntax code is interest accrues on an unpaid tax liability\nfrom the time the tax is due until the time the tax is\npaid. So the amount of underpayment is the amount of\ntaxpayer is borrowing from the Government. The interest\nthat accrues on that underpayment is not a penalty; it's\njust a charge basically for the time value of money.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but you abate\nit in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.\nMR. MARCUS: Right. But I think, I think\nthe idea was that Congress was concerned that some\ntaxpayers, taxpayers that fall within the net worth\nlimitations, might be in positions where they are less\npositioned to pay the full tax liability up front.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what I\nthought, too. But then your friend explained that in\nthe initial bill is where the interest is contained in a\nlot of these cases and in this case in particular. So\nit's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in\nadvance to stop the accrual of interest. Just you get\nthe bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000\ndollars and 300 of it is interest.\nMR. MARCUS: I don't think that's correct,\nYour Honor. The way this is -- the interest that's\nabatable is, a taxpayer is in full control of whether\nthat interest runs or not. If the taxpayer pays his\nfull tax liability on time, interest doesn't accrue, so\nthere's no interest to abate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't even know\nwhat his tax liability is, especially in a partnership\nsituation.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, the taxpayer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA : He makes the\npartnership calculation, it goes to the IRS, and then\nthey figure out what the tax is. And meanwhile, you\nknow, the interest is running.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, Justice Scalia, first of\nall, the taxpayer is in the best position to know what\nthe tax liability is. If a taxpayer is going to make\ncertain investments, they should understand what the tax\nconsequences are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is quite a different\nargument. You're saying, you know, he should have paid\nthe full tax in the first place, not he could have paid\nthe interest that he knew was accruing.\nMR. MARCUS: Right. But he could have\nprevented that, the abatable interest, from accruing.\nThis abatable interest doesn't accrue until the taxpayer\nreceives notice from the IRS that there is a problem\nwith the return. So the -- in other words, that first\nperiod from the time the underpayment is made until the\nIRS notifies the taxpayer, that, that interest is not\nsubject to abatement. That automatically accrues and\nthere is no remedy. Congress has created no remedy for\nthat period, and there's just a period, there's a\nprovision in section --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I didn't\nunderstand that. Say that again? There's no abatement\nfor the interest that accrues until you're notified of\nwhat the --\nMR. MARCUS: Until you're notified, until\nthe IRS notifies you that they are looking further at\nyour return. They might not at that point tell you\nprecisely how much you owe, but you're on notice that\nthe IRS is looking into your return further and that you\ncan at that point make a payment or put down a deposit\nthat doesn't compromise your ability as a taxpayer to go\ninto the tax court, but it does stop the accrual of\nabatable interest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't know how much\nto pay, do you? I mean, when they send you the notice\nthey don't send a notice that says, we're looking into\nthis and we think you're going to end up owing $5,000,\ndo they? They don't give you a figure.\nMR. MARCUS: Again, they don't necessarily\ntell you exactly how much you owe, but it's the\ntaxpayers' --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do they name a figure at\nall --\nMR. MARCUS: They sometimes do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- when they give you the\ninitial notice?\nMR. MARCUS: They sometimes do, and then at\n18 months, at 18 months under subsection (g), under 18\nmonths under a provision that was acted in 1998, the IRS\nhas to at 18 months tell you how much you owe;\notherwise, the interest cannot continue to accrue after\nthat 18-month period. But you should -- but it is the\ntaxpayer's responsibility to know what their tax\nliability is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's true. That's true.\nBut you can make that argument. That argument, if you\naccepted it, would be an argument for having no\namendment to subsection (h) at all.\nMR. MARCUS: Right, but that's the idea.\nUntil 18 -- until 1986 there was no authority at all for\nthe Secretary to abate, and then Congress gave the\nSecretary that authority as a matter of grace in 1986,\nto extend this relief to forgive the accrual of\ninterest. I mean, after this is money --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the question is, why is\nthe grace confined to some taxpayers and not to others?\nMR. MARCUS: The short answer is because\nCongress has said that, said that, and the Congress\ndecided to impose the net worth limitation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They've said it if we\naccept your view of the exclusivity of the amendment to\n(h).\nMR. MARCUS: Right. And typically when\nCongress imposes restrictions on a remedy this Court\nreads that, reads that as an intentional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but is there any\nother instance in the law? I suppose there probably is,\nbut what surprised me about that is this: Imagine we\nhave two citizens and they are identical in every\nrespect in terms of their claim, they each believe the\ngovernment owes them $50,000. They each have\nidentically strong claims. And Congress passes a law\nand says one of you can come into court and the other\ncan't. Now suppose it said the poor person can't come\ninto court. Do you think there wouldn't be a\nconstitutional problem there? Remember, they have the\nsame claim for the same amount, with the same precise\nstrength of their argument. But we say rich people can\ngo in, and we'd say why did you do that? We say poor\npeople don't have as much stake in society. They don't\nhave -- now suppose you heard such an argument. How\nlong would it take you to feel there's a constitutional\nproblem?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think there has to be a\nrational basis for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. No. The rational\nbasis is that the poor person doesn't have the stake in\nsociety that a rich one does.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's worthless. Okay. Now\nI guess, if you can't keep the poor person out for such\na reason then you can't keep the rich person out for\nthat reason. So you tell me what the rationale is in\nkeeping the rich person out any more than the poor\nperson. They have the same claim, same amount, same\ncause. The cause, by the way, was that some bureaucrat\nin the IRS forgot to send a notice so nobody knew what\nwas happening. That was the cause. And the reason it\ndidn't get abated is because a different bureaucrat got\nmixed up, okay? Same claims.\nMR. MARCUS: Keep in mind, this is -- what\nyou're talking about is, this is interest that's running\non money that the taxpayer is borrowing from the\nGovernment. This is money that the Government is\nlegally entitled to as of the date it was originally\ndue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. MARCUS: And so this is money that the\ntaxpayer is borrowing. A large net, high net worth\ntaxpayer can invest that money elsewhere and may well\neven make out even better.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But at the end of the day,\nthe claim happens to be interest worth $5,000. The IRS\nabused its discretion under the statute in failing to\nwrite a check for $5,000 to both. What we do is we\nallow one of them to bring a lawsuit to get the 5,000,\nand we say to the other one, you can't bring the lawsuit\nto get the 5,000.\nNow my question is, what's the basis for\nthat distinction?\nMR. MARCUS: And the rational basis is that\nCongress believed that taxpayers of a high net worth,\nthere would be no hardship, but -- in them not having a\ncause of action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why would there be no\nhardship?\nMR. MARCUS: Because they can use the money,\ninvest the money.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so can a poor person.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, but they're not as well\npositioned as the wealthy taxpayer, so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The next thing you know,\nthey will enact a progressive income tax.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: By the way, this has\nnothing to do with the progressive income tax. What I\nhave not seen anywhere is the use of wealth, totally\ndifferent from the dollar value of a claim, to shut the\ncourthouse door. I'm just saying, is there such a case\nanywhere, and if there is no such case, then I'd say I\nwonder about this assumption. The assumption that the\nreason that you cannot keep the courthouse door open to\neveryone is because what?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, first of all, there are\nother examples. There's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What.\nMR. MARCUS: This is derived from,\nultimately derived from the Equal Access to Justice Act,\nthere are attorneys' fees provisions, but also\nassistance to taxpayers, and those net worth limitations\napply to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We know, attorneys' fees\nyou give to poor people more than to rich people. That\nmakes sense. That has nothing to do with having a\nformal rule saying you cannot enter the courthouse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a you cannot enter\nthe courthouse provision here, or is it -- as I\nunderstand your case, it is that it remains\ndiscretionary with the Secretary with respect to people\nwho have more money, but it is not discretionary with\nrespect to people who have less money.\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So one has a cause of\naction and the other doesn't have a cause of action.\nAnd the difference you're making between the two is\nyou're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest\nwith respect to the rich. You're requiring him to do it\nwith respect to the poor. Isn't that the difference?\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct. There is an\nadministrative claim that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. That might be the\nanswer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The poor do not have the\nincentive or even the ability to defer paying a tax,\nwhere the people that have large bank accounts may, and\ninvestments, may well profit by just paying the interest\nto the Government.\nMR. MARCUS: That's exactly right. And\nJustice Breyer, if you want, if you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Wait. There are two\nseparate things. I want to understand this. In other\nwords, the Secretary does not have the power to abate\nthe interest in respect to the rich person?\nMR. MARCUS: No. He does have the\nauthority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's permissive, not\nmandatory.\nMR. MARCUS: Yeah, the Secretary has the\nauthority to waive interest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He can do it -- in the\nfirst case with the rich person, he can abuse his\ndiscretion.\nMR. MARCUS: With respect to taxpayers who\nmeet the net worth limitations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, in the one\ncase Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person\nyou cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person\nyou can abuse your discretion. That's what the\nunderlying substantive statute says.\nMR. MARCUS: And there's another --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. They are\nnot really saying that. They're saying it's totally\nwithin your discretion. You can't possibly abuse your\ndiscretion when you have total discretion. They're just\nsaying, you know, do it if you want to do it.\nMR. MARCUS: That's right. It's a matter of\nadministrative grace for the Federal taxpayers who\nare --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. The standard of\ndiscretion is the same for the poor and the rich, isn't\nit? The only difference is that the poor can get into\ncourt and the rich cannot.\nMR. MARCUS: They have an enforceable right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a question of\nremedy, not standing.\nMR. MARCUS: Right. There's a judicial\nremedy in one case and only an administrative remedy in\nthe other.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that the poverty line?\nMR. MARCUS: And there's another provision\nin the tax -- I'm sorry, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is the net worth of $2\nmillion the poverty line now?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MARCUS: Not that I'm aware of.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what is -- so what's the\nrationale? This isn't treating the rich and the poor\ndifferently, is it?\nMR. MARCUS: It's treating exceedingly high\nnet worth individuals and corporations differently from\neveryone else.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Someone with a net worth of\n$1.5 million couldn't invest the money in the interim?\nMR. MARCUS: They could. Congress chose to\ndraw the line where it used this provision that was\nalready in place under the Equal Access to Justice Act.\nIt referred to that provision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This was for purposes of\nattorneys' fees?\nMR. MARCUS: Right, the provision that\napplies to attorneys' fees. Congress has also imposed\nthis provision in a burden shifting provision in the tax\ncode, Section 7491. If the Court wants to get a better\nidea of what Congress's concern for what it called the\naverage taxpayer, or the smaller taxpayers, it can look\nat the legislative history. There was a hearing in\nMarch of 1995 that's cited on page 98 of the\nsupplemental appendix to the cert petition, and that was\nthe Court of Federal Claims decision. It's footnote 19.\nIt refers to a hearing in March 1995. And if you read\nthrough that, you can see where that concern for the --\nfor average taxpayers and lower net worth taxpayers came\nfrom.\nNothing in Section 6404(h) gives rise to an\ninference that Congress intended to establish additional\nremedies in the district court and Court of Federal\nClaims. To the contrary, this Court has consistently\napplied the rule that when Congress creates a specific\nremedy, it intends that remedy to be exclusive. That\nrule is fully applicable here. Otherwise, the specific\nrestrictions Congress imposed on the remedy could be\ndefeated by bringing the claim in a different forum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't it have been\nsimpler if Congress just said the tax court shall have\nexclusive jurisdiction, instead of just saying\njurisdiction?\nMR. MARCUS: That might have made it\nsimpler, Justice Ginsburg, but it accomplished the same\nresult by imposing the specific restrictions that it\ndid. And again, it would have -- there's another --\nthere are two other provisions in the tax code where\nCongress -- where the tax court effectively has -- one\nof the provisions where the tax court has exclusive\njurisdiction under Section 6330(d), where also it\ndoesn't specify that -- the Congress didn't specify the\ntax court has exclusive jurisdiction but it does. And\nthere's another case where there's an administrative\ndetermination, it doesn't go to the underlying\nsubstantive tax liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The difference --\nthe difference is that the district court, the claims\ncourt already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims,\nif you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund. And so\nthis isn't as if we're looking at something that says\nthe tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as\na wedge to get other jurisdiction. There's already a\ngrant of jurisdiction. The problem was, there was no\nstandard of review for these may abate claims, and all\nof a sudden we find in this provision there is a\nstandard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that\nfills the void. Why can't they just use that?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice,\nI don't think it was just a matter of not being a\nstandard of review. I think it was a matter of just\nbeing, of intent by Congress to have this just be a\nmatter of administrative grace. And again, if you\ncontrast the language of the different --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought what\nyou had argued before when people would try to seek this\nrelease was that there's no standard of review to hold\nthe Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.\nMR. MARCUS: I think that was one of the\nreasons that the Government cited, but I think there was\nothers as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But one thing you\nnever said was that there was no jurisdiction, because\nthere is jurisdiction in the district court. If you've\npaid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can\nbring a refund action.\nMR. MARCUS: If you have a legal entitlement\nto it, and the point is you didn't have a legal\nentitlement to it before. That's what the courts held,\nand Congress responded to that, not by saying you do\nhave a legally entitlement to this through a refund\naction, which they easily could have said if they wanted\nto reject those prior decisions, but instead they\ncreated a limited remedy in the tax court. I don't see\nhow you can read that limited remedy in the tax court to\ngive rise to a broader remedy that doesn't have those\nrestrictions that Congress imposed on the tax court\nremedy.\nSo it should be -- I think 6404(h) should be\nread as an integrated whole and you can't just extract\none piece and then bring that over, as the Fifth Circuit\nsaid, to apply to a refund action. I don't think that's\nthe proper way to interpret the.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I now think maybe I don't\nagree on this point that there are different standards,\nbecause it does say in this abuse of discretion. And\nindeed that's a normal administrative standard, and so\nas you read this you would think that the IRS does not\nhave any legal power substantively to abuse its\ndiscretion in refusing to bring an abasement in refusing\nto bring an abatement -- excuse me, to abate the\ninterest. So far do you agree?\nMR. MARCUS: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer?\nThat Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Once they make clear that\nthe standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear\nwhat's there in the law anyway, that administrative\nauthorities do not have the authority to abuse their\ndiscretion. Now, sometimes we don't review that in the\ncourts. That doesn't make it legal. It just means you\ncan't catch them out in court.\nMR. MARCUS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there's a standard that\napplies to everybody. Then all that this does, to go\nback to it is it closes the courthouse door. Now I want\nto know what your rationale was for doing that? It had\nnothing to do with the standards that applied. It has\nto have something to do with why one class of people by\nwealth are kept out of court. I think if it were the\nother way around it wouldn't last for three seconds, and\nthe only reason maybe I don't think about it as hard\nthis way because I think, well, privilege is involved,\netcetera. But when you force me to think about it, I\nwant to know what the reason so.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I don't think it's right\nto characterize it as the closing of the courthouse\ndoor. Congress opened the courthouse door in a limited\nfashioning in 1996. That's what happened. There was no\ncourthouse door opened in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll accept that\ncharacterization. Now you give me the reason why we've\nopened the courthouse door to individuals who are alike\nin every respect but for their net worth? Now give me\nthat, the same reason? I always want to know what the\nspecific reason is, the specific rationale and. I'm not\nsaying there isn't one. I just want to know what it is.\nMR. MARCUS: Justice Breyer, I don't know if\nI can give you a better one than I gave before. But\nit's that high net worth taxpayers are better positioned\nto pay their full tax liability up front and to handle\nthe accumulation of interest in the event that there is\nsome delay in the processing of their return.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They're exactly alike but\nfor their ability to earn interest in different ways.\nMR. MARCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I would not concede, as\nyou seem to have, that the consequence of (h) is simply\nto open the door. I think the category of decisions\nthat are committed to agency discretion by law within\nthe meaning of the APA are agency decisions as to which\nthe term \"abuse of discretion\" makes no sense. There's\nno such thing. It is totally committed to agency\ndiscretion. It's only other decisions that are not\ncommitted to agency discretion by law where you -- where\nthe discretion can be abused. If you look at it that\nway, it isn't a matter of closing the door to one\ncategory and opening it to another; it's a matter of\ndifferent substantive laws applying to the two, to the\ntwo classes. Anyway, I choose to look at it that way.\nYou can talk --\nMR. MARCUS: That's a fine way of looking at\nit, Justice Scalia. The other, the other anomaly the\nFifth Circuit identified was the taxpayer, the taxpayer\nseeking a refund having to split off his claims. This\ntoo is not a significant anomaly. The vast majority of\ntaxpayers seek redetermination of their tax liability in\nthe tax court and those taxpayers must split their\nclaims because the interest abatement claim doesn't\nripen until the taxpayer's underlying liability has been\nassessed. Moreover, the interest abatement question is\ndistinct from the taxpayer's underlying liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can they bring it as\nadditional claim after they get the final determination?\nThey start a whole separate action for interest\nabatement?\nMR. MARCUS: That's -- if they, if they, if\nthey got relief on their refund claim, if they prevail\non their refund claim there would be no need to do that.\nThe interest would automatically abate. But if they\nwere unsuccessful they could still pursue an interest\nabatement on the grounds that the IRS committed an error\nin delay in performing a material act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it part of the\nsame proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, it would be, it would be\na proceeding that would follow the proceeding on the\nunderlying liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're making the\nclaim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the\ndistrict court to get your refund and then go to the tax\ncourt to get the interest abatement, which does seem\nlike a big deal to me. And you say, well, in the tax\ncourt you have to do it separately, too.\nMR. MARCUS: It's not as inconvenient --\nwell, it, it may be inconvenient but it's a necessary\nconsequence of the exclusive review scheme the Congress\nset up. And there is no reason -- to take that policy\nconcern and have that trump the statutory language and\nthe regime that Congress clearly established.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is no linkage\nbetween the two, with, it's one thing to split a claim\nwhen they have common elements, but the interest\nabatement has nothing to do with the substantive\nunderlying -- substantive liability?\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. It involves questions about administrative\nproblems that might arise during the processing of the\ntaxpayer's case. A ministerial act, the failure to\ntransfer a file when a taxpayer moves from one\njurisdiction to another, or after, or notice of\ndeficiency if the agent just delays in issuing the\nnotice because he forgot about it and it just sat on his\ndesk for a couple of days. Those are the kinds of\nissues that, that come up in interest abatement\nactions.\nIf the Court has no further questions the\ncourt of appeals should be affirmed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMr. Marcus.\nMr. Redding, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. REDDING,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. REDDING: If I may, there are a couple\nof brief points I would like to make. In the\nlegislative history of the 6404(h) it concludes with the\nstatement that no inference should be made from that\nlegislation as to other courts' jurisdiction. I think\nthat should be taken very seriously. As to the claims\ncourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who said that?\nMR. REDDING: That's in a House committee\nreport, Your Honor. As to claim splitting, it is\nactually a horrendous problem when you're talking\nespecially about partnership-related cases. I will note\nthat there are several hundred cases below waiting the\noutcome of this case. As in the Cramer and Weiner\nopinions that came out of the Fifth Circuit, the Court\ncan note that there are claims for interest abatement,\nabatement not under 6404, but that interest was\novercharged by applying the penalty rate of interest.\nThere is a refund claim for the penalty portion of the\ninterest.\nThere is also a refund claim that the tax\nwas assessed outside the statute of limitations; that's\nclearly a refund claim. None of those claims would be\nencompassed under 6404(h). These taxpayers would have\nhad to have completely split their claims, asked for an\ninterest abatement in the tax court for abuse of\ndiscretion on 6404(e)(1).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point that\nMr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on\ninterest abatement, and it involves mishandling within\nthe Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other\nquestions that have to do with the -- with the\nintricacies of the Internal Revenue Code --\nMR. REDDING: That's only relatively true to\n6404(e)(1), Your Honor. But I will note that under\n6404(a), where cases are now coming out of the tax court\nfor the first time, because it now has jurisdiction\nunder (h), it provides authority for the Commissioner to\nabate interest where the IRS has erroneously or\nillegally assessed the tax liability after the statute\nof limitations runs or whether it's simply an erroneous\nassessment. Those claims have nothing to do with\ndiscretion, and they are not really just ancillary to\nthe tax liability; they arise out of the substantive\nchallenge to the liability itself. The Woodrall case\nthat has come out, which is the, I think is the first of\nthe 6404(a) cases, was an assertion that the\ninterest had been charged after the tax had been paid.\nNow that's not a discretionary abatement; that's an\nillegal assessment of interest and that's a 6404(h)\nclaim now.\nPreviously it would have been strictly a\nrefund claim under 16 -- under 1346.\nI would also note that in terms of the being\nable to pay it to cut off the interest accrual, that in\nthese cases, these cases that are before the Court, the\nF quality -- the document the Government first sent out\nproposing adjustments to the partnership level, if you\nhad computed the liability based on what the\nGovernment's position was, the ultimate tax liability\nincluding interest to any point in time would have been\nat least three times the amount that results from the\ntax court decision.\nIt's just ludicrous to say that the taxpayer\nshould be expected to take whatever the Government's\nproposed adjustments are, compute what his maximum\nliability may be, and pay it in advance or post a bond\nin advance in order to cut off the interest accrual.\nThat argument just doesn't -- in my mind does not fly,\nYour Honor.\nThis, this Court in Bob Jones University did\naddress the pay and sue versus prepayment jurisdiction\nissue in terms of constitutionality and due process.\nAnd, and basically said that as long as there is a pay\nand sue remedy available, the taxpayer has no due\nprocess rights to a prepayment remedy, but that the\nCourt might have come down differently had there been no\nremedy available in terms of pay and sue.\nI would also note that both the tax court,\nthe district courts, the Court of Federal Claims and the\nappellate courts have long reviewed other discretionary\nacts within the tax code by the Commissioner where no\nstandard is set forth on an abuse of discretion\nstandard, such as the authorization of the Commissioner\nto abate certain penalties where the taxpayer has sought\nan independent appraisal on the overvaluation penalty\nunder 6659. Those cases have been reviewed for years by\nthe tax court and by the district courts in refund cases\non an abuse of discretion standard. It is the Federal\ncommon law standard for reviewing an abuse of\ndiscretion.\nThe determinations in Horton and Selman\nHolmes are unique in holding that it's totally\ndiscretionary.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
