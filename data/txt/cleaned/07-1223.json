        "content": "(11:15 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-1223, Bell versus Kelly.\nMr. Bress.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRESS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe problem at the heart of this case is\nconstruing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254\ntogether in a way that makes sense. The last time that\nthis Court construed those two provisions together was\nin Michael Williams. Michael Williams presented a\ndifferent issue.\nBut we believe that looking at how Michael\nWilliams would play out with a small change in the facts\nwill help frame the issue that's before the court today.\nNow, as the Court recalls, in Michael\nWilliams the Virginia Supreme Court denied Williams the\ninvestigative assistance he needed in order to help\ndevelop a claim based on his suspicions of jury\nmisconduct. He, therefore, didn't make the claim in\nState court.\nOn -- in Federal court he got investigative\nassistance; and, in speaking with the investigator, two\nof the jurors referred to the foreperson, Bonnie\nStinette, as Bonnie Minehart.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Bress, before we get\ninto that, could I just ask you a threshold question?\nWe took this case to decide a question, and one of the\nfactual predicates of the question is that the State\ncourt refused to consider certain evidence. And I'm\npuzzled about that.\nWhat was the evidence that the State court\n-- do you say that the State court refused to consider\nevidence that was proffered to it?\nMR. BRESS: No, Your Honor. The State court\ndid not refuse to consider evidence proffered to it.\nThe State court refused to permit the full development\nof the evidence. And it -- I mean it misled the court\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't hear the -- the\nlast part.\nMR. BRESS: The State court refused to\npermit the evidence to be fully developed, Your Honor.\nThey didn't refuse to consider evidence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you mean by that?\nWhat specifically did they --\nMR. BRESS: Specifically, Your Honor, the\nState provided 120 days to develop the State habeas\npetition. The Petitioners during that time developed 14\ndifferent claims, including the claim that's at issue\nhere today.\nIn the course of that they interviewed, I\nthink, 11 different witnesses. For the ineffective-\nassistance-of-counsel claim they got affidavits. They\nalso interviewed all 12 jurors for five different claims\nof juror misconduct. They interviewed five different\nwitnesses for Brady claims, et cetera.\nThey ran out of time, Your Honor, and they\nasked the court for more time on repeated occasions.\nThey asked the court to investigate --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that really does not\npresent the question that you asked the Court to decide.\nMR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor, if you read it\nthat way, it would not, but I don't read the question\npresented that way. I read the question presented to\npresent the question of when the district court properly\nhears evidence after a finding of diligence by the\nprisoner and holds that the State court didn't provide a\nfull and fair opportunity to that prisoner to develop\nthe facts in State court, that where the evidence is\nimportant the -- the district court may consider that\nevidence, rather than giving deference to the State\ncourt.\nAnd giving deference to the State court is\nnot even on the table any longer in this case. It was\n-- what the Fourth Circuit did, the Fourth Circuit took\nthe new evidence into account and deferred to the State\ncourt nonetheless.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he have\nbrought that new evidence to the attention of the State\ncourt first? Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the\nattention of the State court?\nMR. BRESS: He didn't have the new evidence,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he could have a\npost-conviction proceeding in the State court.\nMR. BRESS: Actually, no, he couldn't, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A State habeas.\nMR. BRESS: I'm sorry. The -- as the\nVirginia Commonwealth attorneys point out in their\namicus brief, there is a rule in the Virginia State\ncourt that any facts not set out in the habeas petition\nat the State level can't be brought in later. He wasn't\nable to bring the facts in afterwards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, weren't the\nfacts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was\nbefore the State court?\nMR. BRESS: No, they weren't, Your Honor.\nThere were three categories of new facts or new evidence\nthat came in on Federal habeas.\nAnd if I may, the first -- the first of them\nhad to do with facts that undermined the State's claim\nof aggravation. The State relied on only one\naggravating factor. That was future dangerousness. And\nin the course of that, in developing it, their number\none emphasis was on one adjudicated -- unadjudicated bad\nact, and this was a story told by Billy Jo Swartz about\nan alleged horrific assault on her and of Tracy\nNicholson, who was a girlfriend of the Petitioner.\nWhat the jury didn't know at the time was\nthat both Tracy and her mother, who were there, said\nthat the incident did not occur, that there was no\nassault there, and Billy Jo Swartz was a liar.\nNow, on State habeas, Joanne did submit an\naffidavit and, in that affidavit, said that Billy Jo\nSwartz had lied. That created a dispute of fact at the\nState level, but unfortunately rather than hear the\nwitnesses to determine the credibility and -- the\nVirginia Supreme Court instead decided against\nPetitioner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that\nsupports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was\ncumulative. There was a dispute on that issue. There\nwas evidence on both sides. And now you say, hey, we've\ngot more evidence.\nMR. BRESS: Well, it's not more evidence,\nYour Honor; it's just that a dispute over the facts\nwhere credibility is at issue shouldn't be decided on\nthe papers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Virginia Supreme\nCourt, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true\nall the facts as the Petitioner alleged them. They said\nspecifically \"all facts alleged in the petition will be\ntaken as true.\"\nMR. BRESS: And if they had done that, Your\nHonor, I think that we'd be in a different position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They said they did.\nMR. BRESS: They said, on the one hand, they\ndid, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking,\nfor example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said\nshe could have been effectively impeached by other\nstatements that she had made, that in their household,\nshe had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her\ndaughter. Now, Joanne Nicholson and Tracy Nicholson\nhave said throughout that he was never physically\nabusive to Tracy. The supposed impeachment would have\ncome from police court records that have never been\nintroduced in this case. So the Virginia Supreme Court,\nwithout a hearing, just said, on the one hand, we accept\nthese facts as true and, on the other hand, even though\nJoanne Nicholson would testify that this event never\noccurred that way, she would have been impeached so the\njury wouldn't have believed it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, your argument is\ndependent on the proposition that the claim that was\nadvanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different\nclaim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in\nthe State court?\nMR. BRESS: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if that's the case, I\ndon't understand why your adversary is not correct that\nit will always be possible in capital cases for an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been\nadjudicated on the merits in the State court to be\nadvanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where\nevery aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially\nfavorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation.\nYou know, when your firm with all of its expertise and\nresources comes into the case at the Federal habeas\nlevel, will it not always be the case that you will be\nable to find some additional mitigation evidence and\nthen, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it\nwell get de novo review?\nMR. BRESS: I'd like to answer that\nquestion, Justice Alito, in two ways: One very\npractical, which is that the Ninth and Tenth Circuits\nhave adopted the rule that we advocated for years. The\nSixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have adopted that\nrule for Brady claims, and we haven't seen the flood\nthat supposedly is going to come through the gates.\nSecondly, on a more theoretical level, for\nsomeone to be able to introduce this new evidence on\nFederal habeas, they have to first be able to\ndemonstrate that they were diligent in attempting\nformulate it in the State court. Second, they've got to\nbe able to demonstrate that it's important and\nimportantly changes the overall factual mix. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't get the diligence\npart because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel\nis the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's\ncounsel that's been ineffective.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, I'm referring to\nMichael Williams, which talks about diligence by the\nState habeas counsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it doesn't translate\ninto ineffective assistance of counsel because the\nclient is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not\nbeen diligent, but there is nothing that the client\ncould do. I just don't see how --\nMR. BRESS: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- how you could talk\nabout the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up\nthe ineffectiveness of his lawyer.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, we understand and\nappreciate the diligence of habeas counsel is not any\nkind of excuse and can't be -- statutorily it can't be,\nactually under 2554, but what we are talking about is\nwhether the prisoner and his counsel were diligent in\nseeking to develop the facts for their claim when they\nwere on State habeas. That's what Michael Williams had\nto do with it. Michael Williams equated diligence with\nreasonable efforts and said that the contrary would be\nnegligence.\nIn this case we've got a finding by the\ndistrict court that Bell and his lawyers were diligent\nin seeking to develop their ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim at State habeas. And that's what allows\nthem under (e), that's what says that they didn't fail\nto develop the evidence under (e)(2) and allows them to\ngo through the gate of (e).\nNow, in order to get here, you have to\ndemonstrate that diligence. You also have to\ndemonstrate that you're able to develop new facts that\nmatter, that are important, that are significant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you use the -- to say\nthat it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be,\nright, but it's such an extraordinary use of \"claim.\" I\nmean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a\ntort claim or a contract claim, but not additional\nevidence in support of the basic claim. The basic claim\nis ineffective assistance of counsel.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, I appreciate that\nit's not \"claim\" as it's used ordinarily in the Rules of\nCivil Procedure or when you're talking about making\nclaims in that sort of a complaint. However, this\nCourt, including an opinion -- Banks v. Dretke, for\nexample, talked about the two different Brady claims in\nthat case as separate claims, even though they were\nwithholdings by the same prosecutor. More closely even,\nin Michael Williams, there were two separate\nwithholdings of evidence to impeach the same witness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I'm trying\nto figure out how the statute works.\nMR. BRESS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it seems to me that the\nway it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way,\nthe facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen?\nNo? Okay. Forget that. I was going to shorthand that\nbecause it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking\nof.\nWhat happens is that the -- the State court\nnow says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and\nyou don't prevail. All right. Now, he goes into\nFederal court and he has some new facts. Now, either\nthey are such that they transform the claim and it's a\nnew claim. I mean, in that case there is an argument\nfor that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't. Now, if\nthey aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge,\nis go look and decide on the basis of what they\npresented to the State. That's the end of it.\nNow, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust.\nYou go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other\nnew claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see\nif there was cause and prejudice. And that's how it's\nsupposed to work. And if there was cause and prejudice,\nthen you have the hearing. Okay? That's how it's\nsupposed to work factually.\nI have no idea if that's what went on here,\nbut if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some\nconfusion about whether the procedures are adequate in\nthe State. Then there is some other thing that this\nmight be the same claim. I mean, I don't see how we get\nto the question we took this case to decide, frankly,\nwithout knowing what the basis was and whether it was\ncorrect for the district court to give him any hearing\nat all.\nMR. BRESS: Okay, Your Honor. I'd like to\naddress that. I think that that's essentially how this\nworks in this case. What the district -- what the\ndistrict court did here is it first made a finding of\nwas there diligence? Because it has to do that under\nMichael Williams to even take the next step. Did the\nPetitioner --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the first step. The\nfirst step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go\nahead.\nMR. BRESS: Right. But it had to take that\nstep. And it had to take that step, by the way, of\ncourse, with (d) in mind as well, because this Court in\nSchriro said there is no reason to have hearing if it is\nseparately precluded by another predicate. In Schriro,\nobviously, it was the refusal to -- to allow mitigating\nevidence. So it does that. Then it determines\nseparately under Townsend, was there a problem in State\ncourt that -- did you have a full and fair hearing, and\nif you can prove the facts that you state, would you\nwin, and so those allowed the court the discretion to\nhold a hearing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why wouldn't you say\nright off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State\ncourt, and exhausts it?\nMR. BRESS: Well this couldn't have been\npresented in the State court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. BRESS: Well as the State argued below,\nit would have been procedurally deficient.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Suppose we\nhave -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want\nthe facts where really, he couldn't have discovered\nthis, because the first time that the district attorney\nopened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after.\nSo we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have\ngotten; no one disputes it. Where, that kind of\nthing -- I think he would have to present it to the\nState court, wouldn't he?\nMR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor, according to\nthe warden at least, in this case if you took let's say\nthe facts of Banks v Dretke, which this Court decided,\nwhere when you were in front of the State court, what\nyou knew was that the girlfriend of the prisoner had\nsaid that one of the witnesses was particularly close to\nlaw enforcement, and on that basis they made a claim, a\nBrady claim in State court. It was denied because it\nwasn't factually developed enough, all right?\nSo they went to Federal court and in Federal\ncourt they got a lot more evidence that supported that\nclaim. They actually found out that in fact this person\nwas a Government informant, and on that basis this Court\nfound cause and prejudice and addressed that that\nclaim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you must have been\nassuming then that the State would not give that person\na -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.\nMR. BRESS: Well, that's absolutely true --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it were really new.\nMR. BRESS: The State statute is\nunequivocal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but so is it in\nTennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where\nyou could bring the thing up because you couldn't\npossibly have gotten over it.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, there is no\nexception here in Virginia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in Virginia a person\ndiscovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at\nthe D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the\nwhole trial was a farce -- I mean, something\nunbelievable, and there is no way for the person under\nVirginia law to bring that up in a State court?\nMR. BRESS: Not in this sort of a claim.\nNo, Your Honor, there isn't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bress, your --\nyou're argument that this can't be brought up assumes\nthat it is a new claim rather than the same claim,\nright? Because if it were just the same claim then the\nquestion would be it is simply cumulative rather than\nnew?\nMR. BRESS: If it's the same claim for\n2254(d) purposes, yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I guess\nit gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question. We usually\ndon't consider claims different if there is just new\nevidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily\ndetermine that this was the same claim in deciding to\ndefer to the State court findings?\nMR. BRESS: Yes, it did, Your Honor. The\nFourth Circuit viewed this as the same claim and that's\nthe root of some of our disagreement with them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if fact you got\nmore than you were entitled to, because it did look at\nthe new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference,\nbut it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor. We would agree that\nthat -- that interim solution is not a plausible\nsolution, so we would agree with that, on the new\nevidence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we think that\nthey were right -- and we are, I think we are getting\naway from the question presented -- if we agree that\nthey are right, that this is the same claim and it's\njust additional evidence, then you lose.\nMR. BRESS: No, not necessarily, Your Honor.\nWe also argued on separate grounds where the State's\nprocedure is inadequate, then the -- the State's\napplication of -- of Federal law would have been\nunreasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bress, may I ask you a\nquestion --\nMR. BRESS: And if that's true --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question\nwhich sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue\nhere, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question.\nBut --\nMR. BRESS: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- my understanding is that\nin the United States District Court on the Federal habe\n-- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based\non the evidence before it, no deference to the State\ncourt, that in fact your client did not demonstrate\nprejudice. And my understanding is that that --\nalthough the Fourth Circuit did not rely upon that, my\nunderstanding is that that -- that finding remains\nundisturbed. Is that correct?\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, what the district\ncourt found, as the Fourth Circuit saw it and as we see\nit, was that the State court's finding of prejudice was\nnot unreasonable. Now, I acknowledge that when you read\nthe district court's oral ruling you won't see a\nreference to 2254(d).\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. BRESS: However, when you look at what\nthe State court wrote in its written ruling, what it\nsays is there is a colorable claim that the State court\nwas unreasonable, on -- in application of law to the\nfacts and development of the facts, and then it said\nthat they will -- that the court would not decide this\nissue yet, until it has a hearing; and so the Fourth\nCircuit looked at what the district court wrote and\npresumed that consistent with what it had written, it\nthen confronted this issue, the issue of reasonability,\norally; and it didn't require that when a judge is\nsaying something orally, as opposed to putting it in a\nwritten opinion, that it dot every i and cross every t.\nIt assumed that it meant what it had said earlier. If\nthis Court has any doubt about that, however, it could\ncertainly remand with instructions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I that what it was saying\nis there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question.\nStrickland has two parts. Part A is were counsel\ninadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference?\nIt seemed to me the district court was just making a\nstraight out Strickland determination and not deferring\nto anything else. It was just saying no, I've looked at\nall the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they\nwere not effective. On the other hand, there is no\nprejudice because using the strict Strickland test,\nthere was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would\nhave come out differently.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, consistent with the\nFourth Circuit, we don't read him to say that. But even\nif he meant that, the Fourth Circuit certainly on --\nlooked at this from a reasonableness standpoint, and not\nfrom a de novo standpoint. So even had the district\ncourt meant a de novo review and engaged in it, we still\ndidn't get the correct standard or review on appeal.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, that may be. I didn't\nmean to imply you didn't have a Fourth Circuit question.\nI -- I guess I was raising a question to whether it is\nwise to make this the case to decide the Fourth Circuit\nissue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bress, this case\ninvolves Section 2254(d), right? Does that appear\nsomewhere in the briefs? It would be nice to have it in\nfront of me.\nMR. BRESS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's a central\nthing the case is about. I cannot find it in any of the\nbriefs. Appendix to the petition for cert; I got -- I\ngot to go back to that. Don't you think it's important\nenough to be in your brief?\nMR. BRESS: If I may return to the Chief\nJudge's -- Chief Justice's question from earlier, there\nare other new claims, new facts here that are equally\nimportant in deciding whether this is a new claim. For\nexample, physical child abuse first came into this case,\nand really was first discovered --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but they're\n-- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of\nnew evidence, that somehow changes the claim. And\nagain, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble\ngetting my arms around that, and particularly since it's\nproblematic in this area where there is always new\nevidence.\nYou're looking at someone's childhood. You\ncan always find a new anecdote, a new concern going\neither way, that you know, this was unusual because he\nwas a good child, or this is excused because he had such\na bad upbringing.\nMR. BRESS: Mr. Chief Justice, two responses\nto this. Number one -- and you know, as I've said\nbefore, this Court has used claim I think in similar\nways. It may have been colloquial but it at least\ndemonstrates that it can use it.\nI'm not saying it's the most normal, or the\nordinary course definition, but I am saying that it's\nthe definition that's necessary to read (d) and (e)\ntogether in a way that makes sense; and if I can just\nexplain why I think that's true.\nIf you look at (e), (e) says that you can\nget a hearing even if you weren't diligent in State\ncourt, if the facts that you need to develop were not\nreasonably available in State court and if they would\nprove by clear and convincing evidence that you are\ninnocent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, well\njust -- we've got two but just to stop you on one. The\nfact that they excuse your failure to raise and present\nthe evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you\nget the evidence you have a new claim. It just means\nthat they are going to let you raise a claim you could\nhave raised before.\nMR. BRESS: Well, if what they are talking\nabout is -- if that includes the ability when you are in\nState court -- assume, for instance, House versus Bell,\njust if can take that as an example.\nI'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I've gotten over it.\nMR. BRESS: I don't know, but if we can --\nif we can just look at the facts of that case briefly:\nAssume that in State court, despite diligent a effort,\nthey were able to come up with some of the evidence but\nnot all of the evidence that they later came up with in\nterms of the blood spattering, the DNA, and such.\nTheir claim is denied on the -- on the\nmerits because they weren't able to get much of the\nevidence in and denied in State courts. They couldn't\ngo to Federal courts where they were able to bring in\nall of that evidence, and let's say even more, enough to\nprove by clear and convincing evidence that they were\ninnocent.\nUnder the warden's view, you'd still go back\nto the State court opinion and decide whether it was\nintrinsically reasonable. And so long as it is, you\nwouldn't -- the State court gets affirmed, and none of\nthat new evidence of innocence comes in.\nNow, I guess it's a possible solution, but\nthe question is: Is that what Congress really intended\nhere?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I might say the new claim\n-- okay, so it's a new claim. I don't know if yours is,\nby the way, but suppose it's a new claim. Then what you\nought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust.\nSo now what you show is that that's futile.\nNow we get to your question before us.\nOkay. So it's an imaginary case. It's less imaginary\nin December than here. But, anyway, the -- the -- you\nget back to the State court. Now, what is supposed to\nhappen?\nAt that point I guess the statute leaves the\njudge free to develop the facts. It doesn't say you\ncan't. Okay. So then you do it.\nNow we have the question, which when we took\nthis we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we\ncan -- now we have the question: When the judge makes\nthe decision on the basis of those facts, if they have\nnever developed any of this in State court, fine. Then\nhave -- then just do it. If it is a regular case, don't\ndefer it.\nBut suppose some of the things have been in\nState court related to this but not others. Now what do\nwe do?\nMR. BRESS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean that's not an\nobvious answer to that one.\nMR. BRESS: I -- I think that in -- in that\ncase, by the way, you still have to defer to the State\nfactfinding. I think you always have to when the State\ndetermines particular facts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it's going to do is\nit's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain\nevidence. And what you will have gotten your new claim\ngranted on is the fact that you found some new evidence\nthat's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have\nfound it before.\nNow what do we do? Do we defer in part; do\nwe defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?\nMR. BRESS: Well, I think that, again, you\nhave to defer under (e)(1) presumably to particular fact\nfindings and find that by clear and convincing evidence\nyou've disproved those facts. But, otherwise, I don't\nthink you could find the application of law to fact. I\ndon't think you can under Holland, et cetera.\nNow, you know, just to make this a little\nbit clearer, hopefully, in -- in Keeney, upon which this\nCourt drew in Michael Williams, the Court looked -- the\nCourt did -- looked at a potential distinction between\nthe failure properly to make a claim in State court and\nthe failure properly to develop the facts for that\nclaim.\nNow, the Court looked at that distinction in\nthe context of seeing whether cause and prejudice, which\napplied to certainly the major claim in the State court,\nshould apply to the failure to fully develop it. And\nwhat it said is that distinguishing between those two\ncircumstances is irrational.\nNow, I would submit that it's similarly\nirrational to attribute to Congress the intent to\ndistinguish between the circumstances, or because of\nthese limitations you have in State court, despite your\neffort, you weren't able to fully develop the record.\nAnd the State decided the case on an\ninadequate record. It comes to Federal court. Do you\nsimply defer? I mean do you simply stop when you say\nthe State court reasonably decided this case based on an\ninadequate State court record, or do you allow that\nrecord to be fully developed and decide it on its\nmerits?\nThat's, I think, the issue that we are\npresenting today. I'd like to reserve --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I just ask one quick\nquestion? The -- the answer, I take it, on -- based on\nwhat you just said, the answer to the -- the need-\nto-exhaust point is you don't have to exhaust because\nyou already tried to exhaust in the State court, and\nthey didn't give you enough time to get your evidence\nin. That is --\nMR. BRESS: That's precisely it, Your Honor.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Bress.\nMs. Burnett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE BURNETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BURNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe claim in Bell's case is the textbook\nexample of a claim that the effective death penalty\nintended for 2254(d) to apply to. In the Virginia\nSupreme Court, Bell presented his claim with his\nallegations of what he says counsel didn't present and\ndidn't find at trial. And the Virginia Supreme Court\nassumed the truth of all of those allegations and did\nnot contest any of them. There were never any facts in\ndispute. The State never contested any facts.\nThe State court assumed them all true, and\nthen applied -- faithfully applied this Court's\nestablished precedent under Strickland and Wiggins, in\nparticular, and weighed that evidence that he had\nclaimed had not been found by his counsel against the\naggravating evidence in this case of a drug dealer who\nkilled premeditatedly a police officer in a small town\nand upon weighing that found as a -- as a matter -- as a\nde novo matter on the merits that he could not show\nprejudice. Because there was no reasonable probability\nthat a jury would have found a life sentence giving --\nassuming the truth of everything he alleged.\nNow, when he went to Federal court, the\nFourth Circuit faithfully applied 2254(d) to that after\naddressing all of the same evidence and also agreeing\nthat there was no prejudice, and then said that the\nState court decision was not unreasonable under 2254(d).\nNow, Bell comes to this Court and says for\nthe first time that I have a new claim, and that was not\nmade below, and this is not a new claim. Everything\nthat he presented in Federal court was presented to the\nState court. There is absolutely no difference. In\nfact, to the effect that there was some difference in\nthe district court and the State alleged -- we pleaded\ndefault because he presented a few new affidavits.\nThe district court resolved that and said:\nI'm not even going to look at those because they aren't\ncritical to my decision. I am only going to look at --\nand he described in particular the exact same record\nthat the Virginia Supreme Court had found. And then the\ndistrict court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the\npoint that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time\nin the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop\neverything that was later put before the district court;\nthat there was a very short time to get the petition in,\nand there were many issues other than ineffective\nassistance of counsel?\nMS. BURNETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, there\nwere approximately 12 issues in this case that the\ndistrict court disposed of in a very lengthy opinion.\nIt was only this one issue that the district court found\n-- believed that he needed to have a hearing on, we\nbelieve erroneously. But, nevertheless, he had the\nhearing and -- and listened to all the same evidence.\nNothing, Justice Ginsburg -- in our opinion\nnothing prevented Bell from presenting the allegations\nthat were presented to the Federal court and all the\nallegations that he presented to the State court. There\nwas no State court procedure or denial of anything.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did he make any request\nfrom the State court for more time?\nMS. BURNETT: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your brother is nodding\nyes.\nMS. BURNETT: He may very well have, but the\npoint is that there was nothing that he presented to the\nFederal court that he didn't also present to the State\ncourt. So he was not prevented from -- that -- that's a\nred herring in this case.\nNow, he had some very strong arguments that\nhe made in both the State court and in the district\ncourt on other claims; not on this claim but on other\nclaims, that he believed that he should have been able\nto develop certain evidence. And the district court\nactually on those other claims -- some of them, it found\nfaulted and some not. But not on this claim. On this\nclaim --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we had -- if we had --\nand I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is\nyour case. But if we had a case in which with respect\nto the disputed issue he had asked for more time -- I'll\nmake it easy. He had asked for more time and -- and had\n-- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be\nfollowed that couldn't be followed unless he got more\ntime and so on, and the State court refused. Could he\nthen come into the Federal court and say: My claim here\nis not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective\nassistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State\ncourts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my\n-- my ineffective assistance claim? And if he made a\ncolorable showing on those two issues, would he then\nhave an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and\nwould the findings that eventuated from that be subject\nto -- in effect, to -- to being short- circuited by\ndeference to the State court findings?\nMS. BURNETT: I think my answer to that has\nto be that it depends because the statute before the\neffective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what\nwe would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which\nwould you look at the adequacy of a State court process.\nThose were removed after 1996, so the statute does not\nprovide authority for a Federal court to go in and\ndetermine was the process adequate if the decision,\nitself, was reasonable. Now if we are talking -- this\nis why this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if you don't -- I guess\nwhat I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance\nrecognize that there is a legitimately different claim\nwhich is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress,\nnot subject to further exhaustion requirements because\nthey tried and the State court wouldn't let them do\nit -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a\nclaim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which\nwill not be subject to deference to State court\nfindings, then there is a very clear hole in the law,\nand I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it. I\nunderstand you're saying that is not this case. But\nisn't that a legitimate problem to-- to face at some\npoint.\nMS. BURNETT: Justice Souter, we don't\nbelieve so and here's why: Because it is true, Congress\ndid not change the procedural default doctrine. In the\nEffective Death Penalty Act Congress left that alone.\nIn fact, this Court recognized that in House v. Bell.\nSo when we are talking about new facts or new claims,\neither one, you're talking about unexhausted or\ndefaulted matters, which the district courts are very\nfamiliar how to handle that. Has he shown cause and\nprejudice? Has he shown diligence?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think you're right in the\nmain. I think that's generally correct. The case that\nI'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady\nclaim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I\nunderstand the cause and prejudice can only be\nestablished in the case we are talking about if there\ncan be shown a probability of a different verdict.\nThe Brady standard, however, does not\nrequire the probability of a different verdict. Brady\nuses the term \"reasonable probability that there would\nhave been a different result,\" but that has been clearly\ndefined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility. So\nthat in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e)\nis imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a\nhigher requirement than would have been applied before\nBrady. And that is the case, it seems to me, that we --\nit may not be this case, but that's the case that we've\ngot to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine\nhere. Isn't that a legitimate concern?\nMS. BURNETT: Justice Souter -- and I agree\nthat's not this case. But this Court's already crossed\nthat bridge. That was Michael Williams. Michael\nWilliams was where the individual comes to Federal court\nwith brand new evidence and he has no remedy left in\nState court. It is defaulted, and what do we do with\nthat? And this Court very clearly -- now, as the issue\nwas presented to this Court in that case it was whether\nhe gets a hearing or not, so that's what was addressed.\nBut this Court also addressed the fact that it most\nlikely was and was a defaulted claim and that it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I don't, I don't think\nthis Court understood the implication of it when you get\ninto the Brady issue. And my only concern is we've got\nto leave that door open because I don't think Williams\nconfronted that.\nMS. BURNETT: And I -- I agree with Your\nHonor that it's not this case. I think Michael Williams\naddresses it and I think that the current existing in\nplace cause and prejudice and actual innocence\nexceptions to default answer all of that. And I believe\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand your position.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm still trying to\nunderstand the statute. I think their point is we get\naround (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district\ncourt here, the Federal district court, found that it\nwas an unreasonable determination of the facts, not\nunreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because\nof the procedure. In other words, the State that barred\nthis evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and\ntherefore the determination of the facts is\nunreasonable. So you're saying that isn't what those\nwords \"unreasonable determination of the facts\" mean.\nMS. BURNETT: Well, what I'm saying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean you're saying that\n(d)(2), \"unreasonable determination of the facts,\" means\nthe factual outcome. In other words, if the factual\noutcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the\nprocedures are inadequate; is that your claim.\nMS. BURNETT: Well, no. I believe that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No? I thought you just\nsaid that in answer to Justice Souter.\nMS. BURNETT: I believe that (d)(2) very\nclearly -- yes, I think I'm agreeing with you that\n(d)(2) addresses the actual facts which underlay the\nState court decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And not whether their\nprocedures are correct?\nMS. BURNETT: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. BURNETT: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So that's the first\nthing we have to decide to get to the question. If your\nwrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it --\nif you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d). So\nthey say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within\n(a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay.\nThey say we are rid of (e) because of that. Now, how\nthey get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't\nin the case.\nMS. BURNETT: Justice Breyer, I'm not sure\nthey they've argued those exceptions (a)(2) at (i) and\n(ii). I believe they're simply arguing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're arguing due\ndiligence.\nMS. BURNETT: My reading of their brief is\nthey are saying: We are Michael Williams and all\nMichael Williams dealt with was the opening sentence of\n(e)(2).\nJUSTICE BREYER: (I). You mean of (e)(2) --\nMS. BURNETT: Of (e)(2).\nJUSTICE BREYER: (E)(2).\nMS. BURNETT: \"If the applicant has failed\nto develop,\" and Michael Williams interpreted that as\nsomeone who has not been diligent in developing the\nrecord.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we also get --\nthey get around that because they say the due diligence.\nYou also have an argument about how (2) applies. And if\nyou're wrong about both of those then we get to the\nquestion, which would be: If the -- if the hearing's\nproperly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also\nsaying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to\nbe exhausted. So under Virginia law, under Virginia\nlaw, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case,\nbut suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA\nsays, makes some remark. He couldn't have known about\nit. He goes to a special file. He couldn't have found\nout about. And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you\ncan imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones\nbut this is even worse. Now under Virginia law are\nyou -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say\nyou're out of luck, good-bye?\nMS. BURNETT: Yes, Your Honor, and this\nCourt has recognized that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter what, it's\ngoodbye?\nMS. BURNETT: Yes, and here's why: Because\nVirginia has twin statutes that would bar any further\napplications to State court. One is the statute of\nlimitations that is strictly applied and the other is a\nstatute which says in essence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No excuse? Even if --\nMS. BURNETT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. BURNETT: And this Court has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they are right about,\nthey are right about the exhaustion being futile.\nMS. BURNETT: It is defaulted, yes, Your\nHonor. In Virginia those are defaulted claims, and now\nwe are in Federal court with those claims. The Federal\ncourt judges are very familiar with how to do with them.\nHas he shown cause and prejudice?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The first time he discovers\nDNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't\nhave done it, there is no way to get relief under\nVirginia law?\nMS. BURNETT: Not in State court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not in State court.\nMS. BURNETT: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then they're right\nabout that.\nMS. BURNETT: That's correct. So now he is\nin Federal court and he has -- he has the thresholds of\ncause and prejudice or actual innocence. And that's a\nvery familiar thing, is what I'm saying, is that the\ndistrict courts are familiar with.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then let me ask you\non the merits. If he's right there and it's exhaustion\nand it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a\ndecision that does not defer to the State court, because\nafter all the State court never heard this issue?\nMS. BURNETT: That's not this case. But in\na hypothetical case where there are new facts,\nunexhausted defaulted claims or facts that are presented\nto a Federal court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. There is no real\nargument between the two of you as to the -- as to the\nissue that we thought was presented.\nMS. BURNETT: Well, I think not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there's certainly an\nargument --\nMS. BURNETT: The argument is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's really a new claim,\nyou're going to say they applied --\nMS. BURNETT: Well, our argument is that,\nCourt, don't use this case to say that, because if the\nCourt uses this case to say that it will be putting its\nimprimatur on what the district court did in holding a\nhearing when we don't think it was appropriate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Fourth Circuit\n-- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the Fourth Circuit\ndidn't decide that question either.\nMS. BURNETT: They did not. It was not\npresented to them, Your Honor.\nNothing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you want us to\ndispose of the case that doesn't, that doesn't do that?\nWhat do you want us to do?\nMS. BURNETT: I think the Court could\ndismiss this as improvidently granted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's it?\nMS. BURNETT: I think the Court could do\nthat.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, so I\nunderstand your position on the underlying question if\nwe don't dismiss. Am I correct that the granting of an\nevidentiary hearing was based on a showing by the\nPetitioner that he failed to develop facts which might\nchange the result?\nMS. BURNETT: Justice Stevens, there was\nnever any showing, there was never any showing of\ndiligence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why did the -- why did the\nFederal court grant a hearing?\nMS. BURNETT: The Federal court simply\nannounced that he was going to hold a hearing on this\nclaim and decide later --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't he only entitled to\ndo that on the basis of a showing that there was more\nevidence that the State court did not consider?\nMS. BURNETT: Yes, Your Honor. I believe\nfirst he had --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So maybe the district\ncourt was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made\nwhen we took the case was that there was a body of\nevidence that had not been available in the State\nproceeding that might be available in the Federal\nproceeding.\nMS. BURNETT: I think that was the\nmisunderstanding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if that were true -- I\nknow you disagree with that and I understand your\nargument. Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case. But\nif that were true and the Federal court then had to\ndecide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the\nstatute to say at that time he may only rely on the\nevidence presented to the State court?\nMS. BURNETT: The way I read the statute is\nthat that is the first thing that the judge was required\nto do. He had to first determine whether the State\ncourt's decision was reasonable.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right. Suppose he\nlooked at the State court evidence and he says, that was\nnot enough. The State court's decision on the merits\nwas reasonable based on that record. I have a different\nrecord before me. May he look at the different record?\nMS. BURNETT: He can -- I think -- I think\nthen we are talking about what I was just saying, new\nfacts, new claims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's what we're talking\nabout. May he look at it?\nMS. BURNETT: And then the judge has to go\nthrough the determination, before he can decide whether\nhe can look at it, of whether these new facts or new\nclaims meet cause and prejudice or actual innocence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right. Forget the\ncause and prejudice for just a moment. But if he looks\nat that new evidence and he decides that any neutral\njudge would have reached a different result from the\nState judge on that evidence, may he reach that result?\nMS. BURNETT: I don't think just -- I do not\nbelieve the judge can do that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then what's the point --\nMS. BURNETT: -- just simply to say I'm\ngoing to look at just the correctness of the decision\nfirst, and then decide whether it's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What you're saying is the\ncorrectness of decision based on the State court record.\nAnd if he decides there was a sound decision on that\nrecord, that's the end of the ball game; is that your\nposition?\nMS. BURNETT: Well, I think it is, unless --\nunless there are actually new matters that are presented\nto the Federal court that the Federal court now is going\nto --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's the same claim. It's\nthe same claim.\nMS. BURNETT: Yes. Even on the same claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me the\nstatute has constructed a pointless procedure.\nMS. BURNETT: Your Honor, I -- I don't see\nthat at all. It seems to me it's a very orderly\nprogression, that the -- that the -- the Effective Death\nPenalty Act is now telling district court judges, and\nhas made clear that it's doing this for judicial -- for\npurposes of judicial economy, for finality, for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't the district\njudge in light of the new evidence decide whether the\njudgment of the State court was -- would have been\nreasonable if it came out the same way, including this\nnew evidence in the -- in the consideration? Why\nshouldn't he do it that way.\nMS. BURNETT: It could do that, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know it could. But I'm\nasking whether it should.\nMS. BURNETT: I think -- I think that\ndoesn't really fit with the statute -- with the\nstatutory language.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me the\nstatute certainly contemplates that the States have the\nfirst --\nMS. BURNETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the first cut at this\nthing, right? How else do you give them the first cut?\nMS. BURNETT: Yes. Absolutely. And that's\nwhat I'm saying, and I think that -- to -- if the claim\nis going to in any way differ, it's going to change from\nwhat was presented to the State court. On one level,\nthat is all new matters that are defaulted, and in a\nvery literal sense how can -- and I don't believe\nCongress intended for Federal courts to look at new\nmatters, however they got to them, that were not\npresented to the State court, and on that basis\ndetermine whether the State court's decision was\nreached.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the Federal court is\nsupposed to do what?\nMS. BURNETT: The Federal court is supposed\nto first look at the claim that was presented to the\nState court, under 2254(d), and the claimants before it.\nIf it's the same claim, if it's the same matters that\nwere adjudicated on the merits in the State court, it\nhas to make the decision up front, was it reasonable or\nnot?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. BURNETT: Okay. Now it makes that\ndecision, and then after that, if the Petitioner says\nwell, I have new matters, that I never presented to the\nState court, the Federal court has a -- a road map.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now -- but the road map\nthat you are now saying could be followed is the same\nroad map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice\nScalia, your reference to the new claim as being a\ndefaulted claim.\nMS. BURNETT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we are concerned -- I\nthink we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in\nwhich it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at\nfault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal\ncourt -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now\ninto the State court then. So that it is not a\ndefaulted claim in the classic sense. It is not a claim\nin which he is at fault by having failed to present it\nin the State court.\nAnd in that case, if it cannot go back, if\nthe State court will not take it back, don't we have to\nfind at least implicit in the totality of subsections\n(d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the\nfully developed claim in the Federal court without a\nneed to defer to the State court findings?\nMS. BURNETT: If implicit in your question\nis -- yes, implicit in your question is that the\nPetitioner has demonstrated cause; and he may or may not\nhave depending on the facts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he -- I agree with\nyou on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this\npoint. He has got to demonstrate cause and prejudice or\nat least he has got to develop cause. Let me put it --\nask you this question. If he simply says look, I tried\nto get this in to the State court, and he shows that,\nbut the State court for whatever reason just would not\ntake the evidence that he wanted to put in, is that\nenough for him to have --\nMS. BURNETT: It may be. It may be. And\nonce again, that's certainly not this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not asking to\nyou stipulate --\nMS. BURNETT: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that it's this case.\nBut it's the case we are worried about around the\ncorner.\nMS. BURNETT: It may be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that is -- this Court --\nthat's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to\nwhat cause is, and external impediments. I mean, this\nCourt has many cases that describe that. The lower\ncourts are very familiar with determining that, and so\nthey can -- they are capable to making that\ndetermination as to whether the Federal court can now\nlook at a new matter whether it's a new claim or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But all we are -- I think\nall we are really getting at is that there are different\nkinds of new matters. There are some new matters of\nwhich he absolutely knew nothing at the State court\nstage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me:\ni.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice. This\nis new matter that he did or potentially know about and\ntried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State\ncourt says no, I'm not going to hear it, or I won't give\nyou the time, whatever the case may be.\nIn that case, isn't it -- don't we have to\nsay under the statute all he has got to show is cause in\nthe sense that he tried and the State court wouldn't let\nhim? In order to --\nMS. BURNETT: And that may -- and that may\nvery well constitute an external impediment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. BURNETT: -- to him being able to\npresent it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Having established cause,\nhe would then in your view not have the Federal court\ndecide the matter de novo. But the only question before\nthe Federal court was whether there was in addition\nprejudice.\nMS. BURNETT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is to say, whether --\nbut for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find\nby clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent --\nMS. BURNETT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?\nMS. BURNETT: Correct. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In that instance is there\nroom for the district court to hold an evidentiary\nhearing?\nMS. BURNETT: Well, I think then you get --\nthat's -- I think it's actually a separate matter. We\nfirst have to get to whether the Federal court can look\nat a new matter de novo. If it can look at it de novo\nthen I think we go to the pre-Effective Death Penalty\nAct law about when you have a hearing. Are there\ndisputed facts? Are they -- that make a difference?\nIs it something that actually, you know, needs to have\nresolution in a hearing?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you envisage\ncircumstances in which an ineffective counsel\nassistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nwas presented in the State court and then there is a\nsecond ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a\nfurther supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim based on new evidence that the district court\nmight hear? Does that ever happen?\nMS. BURNETT: I think it can happen,\ncertainly. I don't think it's restricted just to Brady.\nI mean, I think that it -- it is -- it is the same\nanalysis, no matter what the claim is, it's the same\nanalysis that the Federal court needs to go through to\nlook -- to see whether it can consider new matter.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think there could\nbe instances, we might imagine, in which there could be\ntwo ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second\nof which could be heard in the district court with\nevidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?\nMS. BURNETT: I think it's certainly\npossible. I think that the statutory setup and this\nCourt's established habeas procedures that it had in\nplace for decades permits that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess the State court can\nsay, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is\ndoomsday. No more new evidence. We are not going to\nconsider anything new after that, even if you find Brady\nstuff or anything else. Suppose that's\nunconstitutional -- but it isn't. I mean, is that\nunconstitutional?\nMS. BURNETT: Well, no, Your Honor, I don't\nbelieve it is. In fact, the State court -- we don't\nhave to provide for direct appeals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So if it's not\nunconstitutional, then you just provide what you say,\nthat the district court sees whether by clear and\nconvincing evidence the case would have come out the\nother way.\nIf it were unconstitutional, and I guess\nthis is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw,\nanyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me\nthere ought to be a way to make the State take the first\ncut at it. Make the State say oh, yes, even with this\nnew evidence we would still find this person guilty; and\nthen in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the\ndeference that 2254(d) requires. You'd ask whether that\nwas a reasonable determination.\nMS. BURNETT: Right. And all I can say to\nthat, Justice Scalia, is this Court has never held that\nthe Constitution applies anywhere after the direct\nappeal, and that's only the right to cancel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the fallacy in my --\nin my reasoning. Or you're saying I shouldn't be\ntroubled by what has been troubling me, namely that he\nhad no way to get this before the State court. They are\nentitled to close -- close the gates?\nMS. BURNETT: Yes, Your Honor. And as a\ncollateral review; that's where they are closing the\ngate, not on direct review.\nIf there are no further questions, I simply\nask to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BRESS: I'd like to start where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have three\nminute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRESS: I'd like to start where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have three\nminutes remaining.\nMR. BRESS: I'd like to start where the\nGeneral left off. In McNeal and Claudy, this Court did\nhold that, in certain instances, a State habeas court\nmust hold a hearing if there are facts in dispute and\nthey are not willing to assume them. I agree that a\nState doesn't have to have a proceeding at all, but if\nit has one, it has to be fair.\nI know that my time is short. I'd like to\ngo through some of the questions you've asked.\nThe State did deny us additional time,\nexpert assistance discovery, and a hearing in this case.\nThe Federal court specifically found that we were\ndiligent. That's at 84a. And in Michael Williams, this\ncourt said that the finding of diligence also\nconstituted a finding of cause for purposes of cause and\nprejudice, which makes sense because you've got a\nprisoner who has done the most they can and yet hasn't\nbeen able to fully develop the record. There was no\nexternal impediment. As you'll recall, in Michael\nWilliams, the information was there; it was just very\nhard to find.\nFinally, we presented very substantial new\nevidence on the Federal level here. It's simply not\ntrue that there is no new evidence. The new evidence\nincluded evidence undermining the sole aggravating\nfactor, both the live testimony of Joanne Nicholson,\nwhich allowed the court actually to determine whether\nshe would have been a credible person to undermine the\ntestimony. The State had held on the papers she wasn't\ncredible, which the State can't do on the papers.\nSecondly, the evidence said he was\nphysically abused as a child. He was beaten with\nelectrical cords, with planks, with a belt, leaving the\nscars on his body that he bears today. He saw his\nfather knock his mother's teeth out for trying to\nprotect him.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the test for\ndetermining whether the addition of new evidence is\nsufficient to make it a new claim?\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, I think the test\nreally ought to be whether an objectively reasonable\njurist could find it important in the overall mix of\ninformation. And it just strikes me that, if you're the\njudge in that kind of a case, what you're going to go\nthrough is -- if I accept that the State court was right\nwith the evidence that it had and I sort of put myself\nin that frame, would I, nonetheless, if I were that\nState court, have found this evidence important when I'm\nmaking this decision?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's a materiality\nstandard, really.\nMR. BRESS: Exactly, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's a new claim\nif it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's\nthe same claim if the result would be the same.\nMR. BRESS: I don't -- I don't think it\nnecessarily has to be that way, Your Honor. I think you\ncan have a case where the evidence that was before them\nwas absolutely nil; now they're offering a good bit of\nevidence that you would at least want to weigh as an\nobjective jurist, even though you decide against them.\nI think that's possible.\nI think the reason you've got to adopt this\nposition, however, is that there is no DNA -- I mean, no\ninnocence exception that the General has put forward.\nIf the General is right, it isn't a new claim just\nbecause you now have DNA evidence that proves you're\ninnocent. You made that claim of innocence earlier in\nthe proceeding, in your earlier ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim. What you have new now is you've got\nthe DNA evidence. In her view, it's the same claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, it does\nread -- 2254(e) -- it does read, \"a factual predicate\nthat could not have been previously discovered through\nthe exercise of due diligence.\" That sounds like\nexactly what you're describing, the discovery of DNA\nevidence you didn't know about.\nMR. BRESS: And I agree completely, Your\nHonor, that (e) says you can hear it, but the Attorney\nGeneral says you can't because under (d), she'd say,\nyou'd already be foreclose because the State court has\nalready adjudicated your claim on the merits --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think she said --\nMR. BRESS: -- and these new facts don't\ncount.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- she answered -- the\nanswer that I wrote is the same thing that you could\nhave on the Brady claim you could also have for\nineffective assistance of counsel. It's a wholly new\nmatter. I thought that's what she said.\nMR. BRESS: Your Honor, I think she said\nthat what you would have to look for, I think, is\nwhether \"wholly new matter\" means \"new evidence.\" If\nshe says it's new evidence, such as new DNA evidence, we\nagree completely. That's not what she said previously\nin this case. Previously, she had said that new\nevidence in that sense, like DNA evidence, can't make\nthat claim a new claim and, therefore, you're foreclosed\nunder 2254(d), so long as the State court's opinion is\nintrinsically reasonable based on its inadequate record.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bress, I want to\napologize to you for accusing you of not printing\n2254(d) and (e) in your brief. You indeed did.\nMR. BRESS: Well, thank you, Your Honor. I\nthought --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm grateful for your not\nthrowing it in my teeth.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
