PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS:: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nCongress in what is now Section 11501(b)(1)\ncrafted what this Court described as a straightforward\napproach to determining whether a State is unlawfully\ntaxing railroad property. Congress used a precise\nformula that is set out in a pictorial form on page 6 of\nthe Petitioner's brief, and I think it's probably easier\nto kind of follow along on that. What basically\nCongress said is that the court in making a\ndetermination as to whether there's an illegal tax\nconsiders the assessed value of rail transportation\nproperty as the numerator on the left side of the\nfraction, compares that to the true market value of rail\ntransportation property, and then compares that ratio to\nthe ratio created by examining the assessed value of\nother commercial and industrial property over the true\nmarket value. Fortunately, in this particular case\nthree out of four of those variables are agreed to by\nthe parties, so the only issue in this case is what\nconstitutes the true market value of the rail\ntransportation property within the meaning of that\nstatute.\nThis Court in Burlington Northern first\nevaluated the language of this statute and held, in what\nI think the Court later would describe as a\nstraightforward fashion, that 10501(b)(1) declares that\nthe district court -- for the district court, that it is\nnecessary for that court to determine what the true\nmarket values of the respective properties are.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it realistic to think\nthat you can calculate with any degree of precision what\nthe true market value of CSX's property is? The range\nof values that were calculated by both of these experts\nare really astonishing, from 12.3 billion to 8.1 billion\nfor Dickerson, from 9.3 to 5.9 for Tegarden. It's like\n$3 or $4 billion doesn't mean anything. What is the --\ncan this be done with any precision or is it more\nrealistic just to say that what the district court would\nhave to do is to figure out whether the State's\ncalculation is within some reasonable range?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think it's pretty clear\nthat Congress did not adopt that particular formulation.\nWhat Congress tasked the district court with doing was\ndetermining the true market value. And if you look at\nfootnote 8 of the district court's opinion, I think he\ndoes a fairly interesting job of explaining what that\nwould normally mean. He says: In an ordinary valuation\ncase I would take in all of the expert testimony from\nthe railroad, I would take in all of the expert\ntestimony of the State, I would evaluate them and I\nwould come up with a conclusion as to what I think is\nthe true market value.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you want the\ndistrict court to in addition determine which\nmethodology most accurately reflects that true market\nvalue?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to be able\nto challenge the state's chosen methodology for\ndetermining market value?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think every facet of\nthe question of, that goes into the determination of\nwhat is a true market value.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the, so if the\ndistrict court says this methodology, Methodology A,\nmost accurately yields true market value, that is giving\nrise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I think all it says is\nthat in this particular case under these particular\ncircumstances that methodology led to what was the true\nmarket value.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't see\nhow it varies based on the particular circumstances. If\nhe says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted\nvalue approach is the best way for determining market\nvalue, he's not going to in the next case or the\ndistrict court isn't going to be able to say, I think\nreproduction cost is the best method. You're going to\nestablish a Federal rule for what is the best way of\ndetermining market value.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nthat's not accurate. I think what will happen is that\nthe circumstances change every day. Let's just take a\npretty simple example. Let's assume that in year 1 the\ndistrict court decides to use discounted cash flow. In\nyear 2 it turns out that CSX or some other railroad\nproperty is sold, so that you have an actual direct\nsales comparison data available to you by which to make\nthe market value.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That happens, that\nhappens once every 25 years. If you prevail on a method\nthat you think is more favorable to railroads before a\nparticular district court, you're going to cite that\ndistrict court in the next case that you've got and you\nsay: Look a district court's already looked at this and\nthey said Method A is a better way of determining market\nvalue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I'm sure that's true\nthat we'll cite it, but the reality is that the district\ncourt in the second case is not bound by the decision of\nthe district court in the first case. And the truth is\nevery single one of these --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if a district\ncourt says in one case Method A is the best way to get\nmarket value and another district court says Method B\nand they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to\nhave to resolve that conflict, isn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, at the end of the day\nthe district court's going to make a valuation. It's\ngoing to say that this is the true market value. That\ndetermination is a question of fact and therefore, yes,\nthe court of appeals will evaluate that to determine\nwhether or not that fact is clearly erroneous.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think you said that CSX\nhas properties in 15 States that use the unit method of\ncalculation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I believe that's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if you challenge all of\nthose there could be 15 different district court\nfindings on true market value, and so within each\ncircuit the court of appeals would have to decide which\ndistrict court was correct as a matter of fact?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure, Justice Alito, that's\nexactly what could happen. But the reality is is that\nthat's exactly what's been going on since the statute\nwas enacted in 1976. 48 of the 50 States have railroads\nthat have to be evaluated and, as the AAR's amicus brief\npoints out, there have been 12 cases on this particular\nissue. It is not as though it is cost-free for the\nrailroads to challenge what the States are doing under\nthese circumstances. There is no cost shifting or fee\nshifting arrangement. And second, you're suing the very\nperson who's going to be making the decision next year\nas to the value of your property.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's\nalready been pointed out if the range is a variable of\n$4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to\nchallenge what they think is a low valuation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, blissfully, more\noften than not it turns out that the overvaluation are\nnot nearly that stark. But I think that goes to the\ncore point here, which is that if this Court concludes\nlike the Eleventh Circuit did, which is that there is no\nbasis for challenging the methodology, then it would\nhave been completely within the province of the State of\nGeorgia to say, we're going to adopt a stock and debt\nmethod, which virtually everybody recognizes is not an\naccurate way to determine true market value, that that\nnumber would have been $12.2 billion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if we were to\nadopt a different approach which said that you can\nchallenge the methodology, methodology, when different\nmethodologies are used, but if the State is using the\nsame methodology that's their choice? It seems to me\nthe only other alternative is to have the Federal\njudiciary develop a Federal rule about what methodology\nhas to be used.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think there's\never a reason why the Federal court has to adopt a\nsingle methodology and I don't think that's what\nCongress intended. I think what Congress intended is\nwhat happens in every run of the mine valuation case\nthat comes up in either State or Federal court, which is\nthat each side presents its best guess as to what the\ntrue market value is and the district court resolves\nthose differences and comes out with a number that the\ndistrict court believes constitutes the true market\nvalue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose there are a lot\nof valuation cases under the Takings Clause, aren't\nthere?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Scalia, there\nare.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a standard Federal\nrule for how you evaluate --\nMR. PHILLIPS: If you read footnote 8 of the\ndistrict court's opinion, the district judge says, if\nthis were a typical valuation case what I would have\ndone is I would have listened to the railroad, I would\nhave listened to the State and I would have made a\njudgment as to what I think is the right --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that how it\nworks in utility rate regulation? Isn't there in fact a\nstandard Federal method of determining what rates affect\nthe taking of property --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that's because there's\nusually --which rates affect the taking of property?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, if it's\nchallenged --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Or what the rates ought to\nbe?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The rate of return\nin a public utility.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that's because that's\nregulated by a Federal agency that formulates a very\nprecise approach typically. But there's nothing like\nthat -- and that approach governs every utility subject\nto the jurisdiction of FERC.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask this\nquestion. Is it -- would it be permitted for a State to\nsay that, with respect to utilities and certain\nindustries, including railroads, we use valuation Method\nA, with respect to commercial rental real estate\nproperty we use valuation Method B? Is that permitted?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's permitted for them to\nuse different methodologies because typically they do.\nThe reality is they almost never use the same\nmethodology for determining railroad property as they do\nfor other commercial and industrial property because the\ndata that are available for the two are never the same.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So is a large part of the\nargument you would make that other utilities are\ncomparable or not comparable to a railroad?\nMR. PHILLIPS: You would make that argument,\nbut you'd also make an argument as to sort of what data\nare available in any particular case to allow a\nparticular methodology to be used.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an accounting\njournal or some prestigious group of accountants and tax\nappraisers came up with a new theory for evaluating\nrailroad property and it was conceded by all to be\nhighly accurate. Could they use just that for the\nrailroad and different methodologies for all other\nutilities all over the country?\nMR. PHILLIPS: At the end of the day the\ntest here is purely a results-driven test. It doesn't\ntell the State what methodologies to use on either side\nof the equation. What it says is at the end of the\nprocess you end up with a ratio between assessed and\ntrue market value for each that's within 5 percent.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Phillips --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that if had the\nPlatonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could\nuse it only if it ended up with the right ratio?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State can use\nany -- the State can assess any way it wants to in\ndefense of its ultimate outcome.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the end it has to\nhave the right ratio.\nMR. PHILLIPS: At the outcome it has to have\nthe right ratio. That's clearly what Congress intended.\nI mean, this language could not be more straightforward.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Congress uses the\nword \"true market value\" and under this hypothetical I\ncome very close to true market value, and you say it\ndoesn't work.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, my guess is that the\ndistrict judge in that situation would probably say that\nthat is the true market value. The problem is when you\ndeviate from that methodology when you're evaluating\ncommercial and industrial property what happens in that\ncontext? Does that end up with a true market value\nthat's much higher or lower.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought your -- I\nthought your submission was that even if is true market\nvalue for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in\nline if the methodology is different.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, at the end of\nthe day that's right. The question here is the\ncomparison of assessed to true market value on both\nsides of the equation. It doesn't dictate the\nmethodology for get ting there in either situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, could I come\nback to this question of whether or not there's going to\nbe a uniform Federal rule or not. When the district\ncourt makes this finding of what the true market value\nis that's a finding of fact, I assume.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I believe that is, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it would be reviewed\nunder a clearly erroneous standard by the court of\nappeals?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if there were various\nmethodologies that were possible and this was one of the\nones that was ballpark at least reasonable, would the\ncourt of appeals have any basis for reversing the, how\ncould you say it's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: More often than not, my\nanswer would be no, there wouldn't be any basis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, more often\nthan not. But in fact it is an ultimate finding of\nfact, but it's based on valuation methodology and that's\nwhat's at issue here. No one doubts that the\napplication of a methodology can be challenged. The\nquestion is whether or not if you start out -- I reached\nthese facts because I used reproduction costs as my\nmethod of valuation, and your submission is going to be\nthat vastly overvalues our property and you should use a\ndifferent method. That's a legal question. That's not\na method -- question of fact.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the protection that we're\nseeking, Justice, to answer Justice Scalia's question,\nis to have the independent de novo assessment by the\ndistrict court. I mean, that's the real purpose of the\nstatute, is to provide a Federal forum.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the district\ncourt -- what if there is one methodology that gets you\nan answer within 20 percent margin of error, up or down,\nand there is another methodology that gives you an\nanswer with a 5 percent margin of error, up or down?\nCan you challenge the application of one of those as\nopposed to the other.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on what\nyou're asking me. Are you talking about how the\ndistrict court, or the court of appeals? If it's in the\ndistrict court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of course you\ncan challenge it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- because the question for\nthe district court is not with deference to how the\nState is evaluating this issue. The question is for the\ndistrict court, de novo, to make a determination of what\nthe true market value is. But asking on the court of\nappeals side, that's a different question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My question -- my\nquestion assumes that the methodology leads to a value\nthat is either 20 percent higher or lower in one case,\nand 5 percent higher or lower in the other case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: As I understand the way this\nstatute applies, this is not a statute that worries\nabout sort of how you get to the numbers. All this\nstatute worries about is when you get to a number at the\nend of the day, is it within 5 percent of the same\nnumber that you -- the same ratio you would have gotten\nusing whatever methodology you use on a commercial and\nindustrial side. If the answer to that is it's more\nthan 5 percent, then we are entitled to injunctive\nrelief; and if it's not, then we are not entitled to\ninjunctive relief. And that's why I think it doesn't\nmake sense to think about this in the context of --\nbecause you know, there's deference to the way the State\nanalyzes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I approach the same\nissue this way? When a State board in this case\ndetermines what method of valuation it is going to use,\nwhat does it consider? What are the reasons that it\nchooses method A rather than method B?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in some ways it's\ndifficult to know. In this particular case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what should the\nreasons be?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think they should be\napplying the professional standards of appraisal.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the professional\nstandards, I take it, are not simply rules that one can\ngrab out of thin air depending on one's mood. Doesn't\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: Trust me, having read them,\nyou can't grab them out of thin air.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't one have to choose\nthe methodology based on some factual determination on\n-- which would support a conclusion that this is a\nbetter methodology for this case and others --\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- for this case than\nothers?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And Justice Souter, that's\ndriven largely by what data are available and what do we\nknow about how these methods have been applied in the\npast to value this particular property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the end of the day,\nit's a determination which is based upon facts. There\nare good reasons in fact to choose method A rather than\nmethod B, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is also an element of\njudgment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would it make sense then\nfor a reviewing court to review the basis upon which the\nmethodology was chosen, and if in fact there is a\nreasonable basis for choosing methodology A rather than\nmethodology B, accept it and defer it to that extent?\nMR. PHILLIPS: In a different world, that\nwould make perfect sense. That's an approach Congress\nclearly could have embraced. The problem is Congress\ndidn't do that. Congress said choose the true market\nvalue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure what his\nquestion is. I think he is talking about reviewing the\ndistrict court's judgment on that basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm talking about reviewing\nthe judgment of the State authority in choosing one\nmethod rather than another.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And the answer to\nthat is that Congress didn't intend to set this up as a\nreview process of what the State does. Congress\nintended for the district court to do what this Court\nsaid in Burlington Northern, make the necessary\ndetermination of the true market value of that property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we don't -- we don't\nknow, there is no way of telling whether there is a\nvariation, or there isn't a variation under the\ncongressional formula, unless we first have a formula\nfor determining what the value -- what the true value of\nthe railroad property is. We know that can vary. That\ncan vary depending upon the methodology chosen. The\nmethodology chosen is dependent upon good facts, to pick\none or the other; and therefore, doesn't the very -- the\nvery criterion that Congress chose ultimately depend\nupon the methodology?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so. I\nthink what the Court said is that -- or what Congress\nhas said is that the district court can take all of that\ninto account; but at the end of the day, it is the\ndistrict court serving as a check on what the State does\nthat decides what the true market value. I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS\nAMICUS CURAIE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the court:\nCongress did not, in the 4-R Act, establish\na right to obtain in Federal court administrative review\nof State valuations. Rather, it established a Federal\nright against State discrimination in which the railroad\ncould bring a de novo suit in Federal court to vindicate\nthat right. Justice Alito pointed out the wide range of\nvalue that could be generated by generally accepted\nmethodologies -- 6 billion to 12.4 billion, in this\ncase. Clearly, if one were to accept the State's rule\nthat any reasonable methodology, by which they mean any\nmethodology that is reasonable in the abstract that may\nhave been approved by this Court in the 1800's, a State\ncould hide any variety of discriminations within that\nrubric. There would be very little, if any meat to\nFederal court review under the 4-R Act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if you take my\nvariation on it, and that is, we don't defer it to the\nState's choice in the abstract, i.e. if we -- if there\nare 10 methods, as long as it's one of the 10 it's okay?\nRather, if we defer at all, we defer it to the choice\nthat is made to -- to accept one or the other\nmethodology, and we look to the reasons that the State\ngives for making that choice? Would that take all the\nteeth out of the Federal act?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that\nit would, to a large extent, undermine the right and\nprotection that Congress intended. And partly, I think\nthat the -- Your Honor's question is based on a faulty\npremise, and that is that the State uses a single\nmethodology in carrying out its valuation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your point is well taken.\nIt has a variety, and then it makes some kind of a\njudgmental choice as between the results it gets. But\nthat I guess just makes my question more complicated.\nAs long as it -- as long as it has good reasons for\nselecting, let's say the three competing methodologies\nthat it uses, and as long as it has a rational -- gives\na rational basis for the ultimate resolution, should we\nnot or should a court not defer to the choices?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that\nto call the weighing of the three evidences of value\nthat might be generated by cost income, sales methods, a\nchoice of methodology to which the Federal court is\nrequired to defer is a misnomer, because it really is an\nexercise of judgment with respect to the facts of the\ncase and the reliability of the data available.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't the judgment\nget exercised in determining what facts are good reasons\nfor selecting this methodology, or this variant of\nmethodology, for this particular case?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think Your Honor\nis correct, that the -- because you're pointing out that\nreally, the choice among methodologies is more a\nquestion of what are the facts on the ground, what is\nthe reliable, available data that could be used in\ngenerating these different evidences of value. And the\ncourt's role, in our view, is to consider all of the\nevidences of value, not just the State's evidence. That\nwould be the proper approach in a suit for\nadministrative review -- of administrative determination\nby the State, but is a de novo proceeding in which the\ncourt is to consider all evidence of value to determine,\nto its own satisfaction, what the true market value of\nthe railroad is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if you don't agree\nwith Justice Souter's test for the district court review\nof the State, might you agree with it as applied to the\ncourt of appeals review of the district court's job?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I do believe that\nthe court of appeals review is reviewing a determination\nof fact by the district court. There may be subsidiary\nquestions of the law that the court of appeals would\nreview. For example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, are you going to\nanswer my question, yes or no?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I do believe --\nyes, that the review of the appellate court of the\ndistrict court's finding is different than the review of\nthe district court's review of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't ask whether it was\ndifferent. I asked whether a reasonable basis for plain\nerror -- for clearly erroneous review, by the court of\nappeals, begins with assessing whether the methodology\nused by the district court is reasonable.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, again, I\ndon't think that it's fair to assume that the district\ncourt would have used a single methodology. Rather --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a combination of\nmethodologies. I'm talking about -- when I say\nmethodology, I mean even if it uses a combination of\nfive different ones, okay.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it reasonable? How do\nyou propose to have the court of appeals review the\ndistrict court's selection of methodologies?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, it would be,\nas Justice Souter suggested, a question of whether those\nmethodologies -- whether the evidence in the case\nindicated that those methodologies were reliable\nindications of value.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- were reasonable? Do\nthey have to have been the very best?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It would have to be\nreasonable for the court to have relied on them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clearly erroneous if\nit may not be the very best, but it's ballpark and there\nis disagreement as to what the very best would be?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I do believe that's\ntrue, and that is in the nature of the appellate court's\nreview of the factual finding by the district court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nI understood you to be arguing that the district court\nmade an error of law in not receiving evidence of a\ndifferent methodology offered by the railroads. And\nalso, if they conceivably -- if I understood you\ncorrectly, you could send the case back, they could then\nreceive the evidence and come to precisely the same\nconclusion that they already came to. That would be\npermissible, wouldn't it?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It would be\npermissible. You're absolutely right, Justice Stephens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's something not\nquite right about that. Wasn't all the evidence\nsubmitted, but the district judge said, I have all the\nevidence, but I can't consider. It isn't a question of\nintroducing new evidence when it goes back. It's a\nquestion of looking at the body of evidence that was\nsubmitted.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. It's\nnot a question of whether it was excluded, in the sense\nthat Tegarden wasn't allowed to testify. It was\nexcluded by the court in its consideration.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were all of the\nvalues that were arrived at in this case within the\nballpark?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- whether\nthey are in the ballpark is not the test. Whether they\nare indications -- reliable indications of true market\nvalue. True market value is a fact that, as the Court\nrecognized in Burlington Northern, must be determined by\nthe Federal court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were all the\nvaluations used here reliable indications of true market\nvalue?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, they were --\nRespondent argues that they were all reasonable\nmethodologies. But no, I don't think that it's true\nthat the true market value of the railroad is either 6\nbillion or 12 billion. The determination the Federal\ncourt has to decide is what is the true market value.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no\nway to tell. Everybody agrees we're just making more or\nless educated guesses.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I don't think that\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so the district\ncourt has to engage in purely fictional enterprise, and\nsay yes, all the methodologies give you a range of 6 to\n12 billion, but I think the answer is 8.2 billion.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\ndo believe that there are bases upon which one can\ndistinguish the reliability of the stock and debt method\nin this case, and the income that the two parties used\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you disagree if had\nyou 10 totally disinterested experts, not paid by either\nside, and they engaged in this, that they would not all\ncome to the same number, that there would be a range and\nprobably a fairly significant range?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There would be a\nrange. I don't know that it would be a range from 6 to\n12 billion. But -- I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the district court\nappoint a special master to help her?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the district\n-- as in the Tyler Regional Planning case, the Court\nindicated that district courts frequently have to\nundertake complicated valuation questions, and they rely\non the testimony of experts. Appointment of a master\nmight well be permissible. But I want to go back to the\ntextual indications, that this is a question for the\nFederal court. There is no question that the statute\nrefers to the burden of proof in determining true market\nvalue. In Burlington Northern, the Court recognized\nthat the allocation of burden of proof demonstrates that\nit is a fact to be proved to the Court. In fact, in se,\nwith respect to true market value of the commercial and\nindustrial properties, it specifically says that it is\nto be proved to the satisfaction of the Court. Now in\nBurlington Northern, the Court remarked that it would be\nunreasonable to construe the statute to lead to\nstrikingly different approaches, whether the railroad's\nchallenge was based on the alleged undervaluation of\nother properties or overvaluation of the railroad\nproperty. Now, we know from the statute that the court\nis not to defer to any methodology, or amalgam of\nmethodologies, the State uses in valuing other\ncommercial and industrial property. Rather, the court\nis to look to the best evidence of value, which is sales\ndata. Now, if the court has sales data available to it\nin the case regarding the value of the railroad,\ncertainly the court should rely on that reliable\ninformation, rather than the State's chosen methodology.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nMr. Calvert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN R. CALVERT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CALVERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the court.\nSubsection (b)(1) constitutes a narrow\nexception to the normal rule of Federal non-interference\nin State tax administration that is designed to prohibit\na specific type of tax discrimination. What CSX\ncontends here is that Congress meant this\nanti-discrimination provision to secure for the\nrailroads what no other taxpayer to our knowledge\ncurrently has. And that is an -- an absolute right to\ncome into Federal court, and to have a Federal judge\nredetermine the market value of its property for State\nproperty tax purposes in whatever manner the Federal\ncourt finds to be appropriate, without regard to the\nState's choice of a reasonable valuation method.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to be what it says\nthough, isn't it?\nMR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I don't think\nthat's what it plainly says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the language?\nWhat's the crucial language?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, it requires the\ncomparison of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't require --\nwhat it say the district court is supposed to find?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, it has to find the\nassessed value of the railroad, the true market value of\nthe railroads --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's supposed to find the\ntrue market value of the railroads. It doesn't seem to\nme fuzzy language. District court is to find true\nmarket value.\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think in large part,\nthe railroad's argument is it places on the one word\n\"true\" and the term \"true market value\" a weight that it\ncannot bear. The complaint that the railroads filed in\nthis case, and this is confirmed by the legislative\nhistory, acknowledged that the word \"true market value\"\nmeant the same as \"fair market value\" or \"market value.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a very strange way of\nsaying the district judge is to -- is to ask whether the\nState has used one of a number of reasonable methods of\ndetermining the market value. To say, go find the true\nmarket value is a very strange way of saying that, and\nthat's what you, that's what you're saying it means.\nMR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I think if\nCongress had said the district court is to find fair\nmarket value or the market value it would seem -- it\nwould seem less strange. And we think there is going to\nbe a range -- any case like this as evidenced by the\nappraisals -- the appraisal prepared by the railroad's\nappraiser, as evidenced by the State's appraiser. There\nis going to be a range of possible market values.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would your position be\nany stronger if it used fair market value?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor I think in\nthe same way that CSX --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or any weaker?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, the way that\nthe railroad says you have to look for the one value\nthat's true, I would say that if the statute said \"fair\nmarket value\" the question is there could be many market\nvalues that are fair.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you mean, we have\nfalse \"fair market value\"? I never heard of such a\nthing.\nMR. CALVERT: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. But I think -- I think there is a range of\npossible market values that can be considered fair.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the point not that\nanyone is denying that there can be a range, that there\n-- everybody agrees that there is not here, simply\nbecause there is not one methodology, there is not an\nexact science which is operating? But isn't the real\npoint the point that Justice Scalia made, that when\nCongress uses the term \"true market value,\" when it has\na criterion of truth, the one thing that does seem to be\nclear is that, if you are looking for truth, you do not\ndefer to a party in interest? And isn't that the one\npoint? And if you accept that point, then doesn't it\nfollow that methodology is up to the assessment of the\ndistrict court.\nMR. CALVERT: I would say that's true, Your\nHonor, but I would say that the statute does not plainly\nlead to that result.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How could it say it more\nplainly than using the criterion of truth?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, again, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Truth -- whatever truth\nmeans, it doesn't mean deferring to a party in interest.\nIsn't that correct?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I don't believe, Your\nHonor, that it is possible to say with any type of\nabsolute certainty or precision that one --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We all accept that. The\nquestion is not whether we're talking about rocket\nscience in valuation. The question is whether we are\ndeferring to a choice made by the party in interest?\nAnd doesn't the criterion of truth imply that we do not?\nMR. CALVERT: No, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat it does. Again, if the -- if the statute had said\nwhat it easily could have said and what the legislative\nhistory says it could have said and what CSX complaint\nin this case acknowledged it could have said, that what\nthe district court had to find was the market value of\nthe property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So Congress in effect was\nengaging in Pontius Pilate's exercise, what is truth?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was expecting you to say,\nthat what is truth?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I would say that\nthe statute does not plainly require that if a State has\ndetermined the market value of the railroad by correctly\napplying a reasonable valuation method, that the statute\nan ambiguously allows the taxpayer to come in and\nchallenge that -- not just the application of that\nmethod but the -- but the methodology itself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you limit it to\nthe application and not the methodology, then Congress's\noverriding goal was there was a problem with\noverevaluation of the railroad's property, and Congress\nwas responding to that problem of overevaluating the\nproperty. But if you limit the challenger to just the\napplication, then you are not going to have as vigorous\na check on over evaluation as you would have if you\ncould -- if you could reach back to the methodology.\nMR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I think what CSX\nwould like in this case is to turn the Federal district\ncourt, the judge into a board of equalization who has to\n-- who has to consider every -- each and every objection\nto each and every decision that the State that is made\nin valuing its property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what you are saying is\nthat the -- that the court is simply being turned into a\ngrade school math teacher who looks to see whether the\nsums are added up correctly. That can't be what\nCongress had in mind.\nMR. CALVERT: Well, no, Your Honor. That's\nnot our position. In fact, the objections that CSX had\nspecifically to the State's application of the\ndiscounted cash flow were more than what could be fairly\ndescribed as checking the math. It wasn't a situation\nwhere one number had had the decimal point in the wrong\nplace but there was -- there was days of expert\ntestimony, for example, regarding whether the State's\nuse of a 6.3 terminal growth rate in the discounted cash\nflow was an appropriate number for this railroad.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, there was\n-- there was a contest about the judgment used by the\nState in selecting one point of datum in its\ncalculation, right?\nMR. CALVERT: That among other --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that kind of\njudgment -- if it makes sense under the statute to put\nthat kind of judgment in question, why doesn't it\nequally make sense under the statute to put other\nquestions of judgment such as the selection of the\nmethodology to which the data point in fact is relevant?\nWhere do you stop?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, we think it is -- the\ndifference, Your Honor, is, while we believe that a\nState should have -- should have the right to choose\namong the various reasonable types of valuation methods\nthat can be used in a case like this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know that's why you\nthink. My question is, if you agree that it's\nappropriate under the congressional statute to challenge\none issue of judgment, why isn't it equally appropriate\nto challenge other issues of judgment, i.e., selection\nof methodology?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, because it's one thing\nto say that the State can choose the valuation formula;\nit's another thing that the State is able to dictate how\nyou fill in the variables. If a State can say we're\ngoing to use the discounted cash flow analysis but\nhere's the way we're going to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Each one, as I understand\nit, is a question of judgment about what is appropriate\non the facts of this case, or these kinds of cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The trouble is you can't\nfind a -- it is a line, but it's not a line you can\nderive from true market value. I mean, you can do it,\nbut what in the statute suggests that that's what you\nshould do?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nwhat you have to find in the statute, because this is a\nlimited exception to the rule that Federal courts will\nnot interfere with the State's administration of its own\ntax system, is -- I think you need to find something in\nthe statute which plainly allows the Federal courts to\nget into the minutia of not just the way in which the\ndiscounted cash flow formula has been applied or not the\nway in which a stock-and-debt formula has been applied,\nbut its choice at the -- at the very beginning to use\nthose methodologies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason that they do\nthat is because none of these methods comes even close\nto working out what the company is really worth because,\nif we had, we wouldn't be here. We'd be out in Wall\nStreet. We'd make billions.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So they don't\nknow, and they use all these different methods sort of\nas checks one on the other. Now, the railroad simply\nwants to say: Look, you had an expert here and he went\nand used a method, and it comes up with a certain\nnumber, but if you look at a few other methods, you'll\nsee that's an outlier. Okay? Now, why shouldn't it be\nable to do that?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I guess -- Your Honor, I\nthink it's specifically because there is that range of\nvalue, that if Congress had intended to -- that the\ndistrict courts would examine each and every decision\nmade by the States deciding it's going to use this\nmethod --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're not going to do\nthat. The State has enormous leeway. Anyone who valued\na railroad running through the center of this city, of\nwhat it would be worth if the property were sold on the\nprivate market, you'd get an astronomical number. So\nthe chances of this number being higher than the sales\nvalue of private property is not great.\nSo, if you've come in with some method that\nputs it higher than that, well, why shouldn't they be\nable to come in and say: Look, look what they've got\nwith this method, which in our opinion is not a fair\nmethod. Now, why not? Because after all, if you're\ngoing to say they can't, then there is no check on the\nState working out a method that discriminates, as\nJustice Ginsburg said, seriously against the railroads.\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think -- I think the\nresult of that, Your Honor, is -- is you're going to\nhave a Federal court setting a Federal standard of\nvaluation for Georgia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they're going to do is\nthey're simply going to let people present the evidence\nas you've heard, which will have 15 valuation methods if\nthey want, all serving each as checks on the other.\nThere's no single method. So why would you end up with\nthat result?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, that's what\n-- that's what CSX is -- is arguing here today, but\nthat's not what they argued in the district court. They\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought\nyou conceded that that was what it would be, because you\nsaid that the Federal court would be turned into a board\nof equalization, and a board of equalization is not\nmaking grand law for setting precedent.\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nwhat CSX asked in this case is that -- they have taken\nthe position, and I believe they still take it for this\nCourt, that a stock-and-debt method will never give a\nreliable estimate of the value of the railroad. So they\nwant -- what they want to come out of this litigation is\nthe State of Georgia cannot use that at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think what they want is\nto be able to attack the methodology and not be limited\nto the application of whatever methodology the State\nprefers.\nMR. CALVERT: That's correct, Your Honor,\nbut the point I'm that trying to make is that what they\n-- what they want to see come out of this case is the\nState of Georgia -- not simply that the State of Georgia\ncouldn't use the stock-and-debt methodology for this tax\nyear; they want a ruling that basically says it can't\nuse it for any year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think they're\nnot going to get that from this Court, any more than\nthey could get it from the Court of Appeals. All the\nCourt of Appeals can say, it seems to me, is that the\nmethodology that the district court used was not clearly\nerroneous.\nI think another district court in a later\nyear could probably use a different methodology, which\nwould again be affirmed by the Court of Appeals because\nit was not clearly erroneous. We're not -- I don't\nthink either the Court of Appeals or this Court is\nplacing any stamp on a particular methodology.\nMR. CALVERT: But -- but Your Honor, that is\nwhat they tried to get from the district court in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they did, but they're\nnot going to get it here.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nabout your position? Supposing Dickerson had adopted\nthe stock-and-debt method and taken the $12 million --\n$12 billion figure and said that's really a reasonable\nbasis, and then he ended up with that value. Would you\nbe able to defend that decision with precisely the same\narguments that you're making today?\nMR. CALVERT: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just wanted to be sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that would\nbe part of your reply to Justice Breyer, that you had\nfive different methodologies here and you chose the\nlowest one; and the question really is how many more\nmethodologies do you have to look at if you're going to\nchoose the lowest one in each case.\nMR. CALVERT: Well, and that is what we did\nin this case, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it had been -- I'm\nsorry -- if it had been Dickerson's methodology at the\nlast step to choose the highest value, would that be\nreasonable?\nMR. CALVERT: Again, Your Honor, I think --\nI think a State could do that. You're still within the\nrange of value. I will say this. If the State had done\nthat in an effort to overvalue the railroads, or to\ndiscriminate against them or to treat them differently\nthan other taxpayers, I think you might have a problem\nunder the statute, but I don't think it's a problem\nunder (b)(1). I think that would be a problem under\n(b)(4) which is the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This State appraiser as I\nunderstand it had never done an appraisal before of --\nof this magnitude, right?\nMR. CALVERT: No, Your Honor. He's done\nwell over a thousand appraisals involving the\napplication of the unit rule. What he had -- what he\nhad not done before is provide a written narrative\nreport much like the railroad's appraiser did, but the\nvaluation work sheets that are attached as part of the\njoint exhibit basically set out the calculations. Then\nwhen he did his full appraisal report, it includes\ncertain narrative materials, certain explanation of the\nvarious methods he used. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking for the\nfootnote, but I -- I was, I was impressed by what seemed\nto me the -- the vast difference in -- in qualifications\nand experience of the -- of the State appraiser and of\nthe expert who was brought in by the railroads at the\ntrial. And it seemed to me quite absurd to say we have\nto defer to -- to this novice in the field, and -- and\nnot look at the -- at the testimony of -- of someone who\nhas done a lot of it before.\nMR. CALVERT: No. The State's appraiser,\nYour Honor, had done, had done well over -- well over a\nthousand of these types of appraisals. He has taught in\nnational schools on these issues. He has published in\nState and national journals on these issues, so we\ncontend that his -- his credentials are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you have a response --\ndid you have a response to that footnote? I didn't --\nMR. CALVERT: Yes. We do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I must have\nskipped that.\nMR. CALVERT: We have our own footnote.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A little footnote battle\nhere, right?\nMR. CALVERT: That is footnote 3, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of yours?\nMR. CALVERT: Of our brief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, if this\ncomes down as it probably will in every case, to a\nbattle of competing experts, are you aware of any other\narea where we say that a district court cannot look at\nthe methodology used by an expert in determining whether\nor not to give credence to the expert's opinion?\nMR. CALVERT: No, I'm not, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why should we\ncreate a special rule here for the State?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, this is a -- this is a\nspecial statute and again I think what CSX is asking for\nthis -- for this Court to do is create a special rule\nfor it which gives it, unique among taxpayers, as far as\nwe are aware, the right to come into Federal court and\nchallenge each and every decision that the State has\nmade in valuing property for property taxes and have the\nFederal court redetermine that value.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- I take it to\ndetermine how far you could go with that, I take it\nthough in your view if the State's appraiser had never\ndone an appraisal before in his life, if he were plucked\noff the street by the State and said, you know,\n\"appraise the railroad property; we are making you a\nState appraiser,\" on your view the district court could\nnot look behind that?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, the district court could\ncertainly thoroughly examine the way in which the -- the\nreasonable valuation methodologies that the State\nselected were applied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. But the selection\nof the methodology by the guy off the street could not\nbe examined.\nMR. CALVERT: Well -- well, Your Honor, we\nthink the methodology has to at least be reasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- it's one of\nthe recognized methodologies.\nMR. CALVERT: I think if the State has used\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It happens to be the one\nthat gives the highest number. But it's a recognized\nmethodology and there are certain -- certainly examples\nin which that methodology has been used, and I take it\nthat if the guy off the street picks one of those, and\nthat's all we know about it, the district court on your\nview cannot look behind it.\nMR. CALVERT: I'd say that's correct. If\nit's a widely used accepted valuation methodology like\nthe ones the State used in this case, that the question\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what you have\nhere. I've looked -- I've looked at your footnote and I\nsee that indeed Mr. Dickerson did have over 30 years\nexperience including well over a thousand valuations --\nperformed under the unit rule; performed under one\nmethod of evaluation, right?\nMR. CALVERT: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the whole issue here is\nthat that method of valuation, however expert he is at\nit, is not proper here. It doesn't work. That there\nare other ones that should have been brought to bear.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought both sides\nagreed that the unit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was one of the ones, yes;\nbut that's not the only one. That's the only one he is\nan expert in.\nMR. CALVERT: Both sides agree that the unit\nrule is appropriate in this case. The question then is\nhow to -- how to determine what the unit value of the\ncompany was; but there is no dispute in this case that\nthe unit rule is appropriate. So the appraisals that\nthe State's appraiser had performed under the unit rule\nare exactly the type of appraisals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's different\nmethodologies under the unit rule. He has used -- he\nhas used different methodologies under --\nMR. CALVERT: Than the railroad did.\nCorrect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I guess the term\nmethodology is confusing because you could think it\nmeans unit rule --\nMR. CALVERT: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: --or you could think how\nunder the unit rule, what is the --\nMR. CALVERT: That's right, Your Honor. If\nI could make -- if I could make one point about the unit\nrule and the choice between the unit rule and what we\nrefer to as the summation approach, the specific dispute\nin this case has been between the various methods for\ndetermining what the unit value of the company was for\n2002 under the unit rule -- but the argument that CSX is\nmaking in this case would also put -- put into play a\nState's most fundamental methodological choice between\nthe unit rule and the summation approaches, and CSX's\nreply brief admits as such.\nThe railroads had made -- had made such an\nargument in the Chesapeake Western case out of the\nFourth Circuit where -- where Virginia's courts had held\nthat the unit rule was not an appropriate valuation\nmethod under their statutes to arrive at fair market\nvalue, the railroads came in and said under the 4-R Act,\nwe are entitled to put on proof under the unit rule as\nto what our fair market value, that the Federal statute\nmakes all that open; the district court has to consider\nall that evidence. And what the -- and the Fourth\nCircuit rejected that argument, but that's the\nimplication.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if what if the\nState elected to use reproduction cost as its valuation\nmethod, which I guess everybody agrees vastly overstates\nthe value of the railroad?\nMR. CALVERT: Well I think the problem, Your\nHonor, with reproduction cost is -- is how to -- is how\nto accurately account for obsolescence. My\nunderstanding of the objection --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there are\nproblems with a particular methodology, the methodology\ncan be challenged?\nMR. CALVERT: It's possible, Your Honor,\nthat a reproduction cost methodology might -- might so\ninadequately deal with the issue of obsolescence that\nyou just have to say that's not a reasonable\nmethodology, as applied to railroads.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How could you say it on\nyour theory?\nMR. CALVERT: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How could you say it\nconsistently with your position here?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think, Your Honor, the\ncourt is allowed to examine whether you have a --\nwhether the State has used a reasonable methodology.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why doesn't the court\nhave an opportunity or the right to examine whether any\nparticular methodology is reasonable as applied to this\ntaxpayer and this kind of property at this time?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think that goes to the\nquestion of whether you have properly applied a\nreasonable valuation method, and there is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought -- I thought you\nwere saying that the reproduction method had such severe\nproblems associated with it that it simply would not be\na fair methodology to use and at least a reviewing\ncourt, a district court could -- could draw that\nconclusion. I thought that was your answer.\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think it depends, Your\nHonor, on if you have a reproduction cost method that\nyou have applied to property that -- property that has\nonly just recently been purchased, then I don't think\nyou're going to have a problem with it at all, even --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We are talking about the\nrailroads like CSX, and I thought your answer was that\na -- a district court could conclude that as applied in\na case like this, that there are so many problems that\nit simply would not be a reasonable valuation method.\nMR. CALVERT: I -- I think that is possible.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then well then\nhow do you draw a line?\nMR. CALVERT: Well again, Your Honor, I\nthink --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you can do that, why\ncan't it do what -- what your brother is saying it\nshould do in this case?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I think, Your Honor,\nthat in -- in -- in -- again, I don't think that is the\nargument they have made in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume I'm\nmaking that argument now in my question. Why -- why can\nyou draw the line that you want to draw?\nMR. CALVERT: Well again, I think that goes\nto whether the application is going to be -- is going to\nbe reasonable in the particular situation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And your\nargument is that it's not reasonable because it must\noverstate the value by a particular percentage or\nnumber.\nAnd I think Justice Souter's question is:\nWell, where do you draw the line?\nIf you say it's not reasonable because it\noverstates value by 50 percent, is a methodology that\noverstates value by 20 percent reasonable or not --\nMR. CALVERT: Well, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- keeping in mind\nall the methodologies here range from 8 -- 6 billion to\n12 billion.\nMR. CALVERT: And I -- I think, if you\nlooked at the mid- point of the ranges that each -- each\nof the appraisers had, you would have a variation,\nmaybe, of about 20 percent either way. Again, I\ndon't think that's going to be determinative as to\nwhether you've got a reasonable methodology, whether\nit's been properly applied, and what that range is. I\nthink that's the nature of the -- of the appraisal task\nthat States have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Calvert, can you tell\nme how this thing works, or how it may work in the\nfuture?\nDoes the State just whip up a number and lay\nit on the railroad, or -- or, in fact, is there some\ndiscussion each year between the railroad's experts and\nthe -- and the State's experts as to what the right\nnumber should be?\nMR. CALVERT: What happens, Your Honor, is\nthat the railroad returns are filed with the State; and\nthere is a period of time during which the State\nexamines those returns, takes the evaluation\nmethodologies that it has selected, applies it to the\ndata that it has for those particular companies, comes\nup with numbers. Those -- that information, typically,\nis shared with the railroads.\nFor them to come back and say: Well, we\nthink you've used cost of capital that's too low; we\nthink you've done -- done this; this number really, we\nbelieve, should be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So there is some\ngive-and-take discussion before the State comes down\nfirmly and says: Cough up the money?\nMR. CALVERT: Typically, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I take it this question\nabout the unit rule -- I take it Georgia is figuring out\nwhat the entire value of the railroad is throughout the\ncountry. Have other States had to make the same\ndetermination to apply their unit rules?\nMR. CALVERT: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let's say, do Tennessee\nand Mississippi have to also apply the unit rule to\nvalue the property of this particular railroad?\nMR. CALVERT: I think -- I think the\nmajority of States that value railroad property use the\nunit rule.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it admissible evidence\nto find out what other -- figures other States have come\nup with? Because you're all taking the same answer,\naren't you --\nMR. CALVERT: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if you all use the unit\nrule?\nMR. CALVERT: We are, Your Honor, though if\na State is using a different methodology to determine\nthe unit rule, I think you would probably expect --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the evidence shows\nthat 49 States have come up with a valuation of $5\nbillion, and you use a method that comes up with $8\nbillion? Would that be admissible evidence?\nMR. CALVERT: I think it probably would be,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And does the record\ncontain any such evidence in this case? Do we know what\nother States have found.\nMR. CALVERT: I think the evidence in this\ncase was that the State of Georgia's unit value, at\nleast within the southeast States, was -- was the\nlargest number.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was the highest?\nMR. CALVERT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't that raise some\nsuspicion about maybe they have a different approach\nthan is commonly applied seeking precisely the same\nanswer to precisely the same question?\nMR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, I think our\n-- our response is that we believe that in 2002 what the\nState did was not only to make some changes in its\nvaluation methodologies, but it also made a fairly\nsignificant change in the income numbers that the State\nwas using to apply its discounted cash flow analysis.\nAnd specifically what it did: It started\nusing -- instead of numbers from the regulatory report,\nthe R-1 report that the railroads filed with the Surface\nTransportation Board, it began to use income numbers\nfrom the annual reports to shareholders.\nThere is a significant difference in those\nnumbers, and the testimony in this case was that the 47\npercent increase that CSX saw in its assessment from\n2001 to 2002 was attributable to the difference in the\nincome numbers that were being used.\nI suspect that for many of the other States\nthat have low numbers for CSX, that they still use\nnumbers from the regulatory reports as opposed to the\nannual reports.\nSo that's one reason that I believe we've\ngot -- we had such a larger number for 2002 than many\nother States, because our appraiser was looking to the\ncorrect income numbers.\nIf I could, just in the remaining time that\nI've got, I'd like to mention a couple of points. The\nCSX has contended that this line between method and\napplication is simply unworkable; and, therefore, the\nCourt shouldn't recognize any -- any such distinction\nunder the statute.\nWe think there are a couple points where the\nlines are clear. One is between the unit rule and the\nsummation approaches. The brief filed by the\nAssociation of American Railroads acknowledges that\nthose are two different methods.\nIt's not -- one could not say that a stock\nand debt method is just an application of discounted\ncash flow, so there are certain places where those lines\nare clear.\nWe believe the fact that the line may not\nalways be -- or the boundaries may not always be\nperfectly distinct, or that the test may not always be\nwhat it might be easy to describe in the abstract -- it\ndoesn't mean that the distinction should not be\nrecognized at all under the statute.\nAlso, there is the way in which the Eleventh\nCircuit formulated the test where the Eleventh Circuit\nsaid a line bar between method and application was\nbetween nonfactual determinations used in constructing\nthe valuation process, however broad or narrow they\nmight be.\nThe Court said that constitutes the method.\nEverything else is an application.\nThe suggestion has been made by the\nSolicitor General in their brief that -- that that means\nas long as the State can announce or can set out its\nvaluation rule in general enough terms, make it general\nenough, then that will become part of the method and not\npart of the application.\nI think if the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is\nread in context, the Eleventh circuit didn't say that.\nSpecifically, the Eleventh circuit was\ndistinct -- was saying -- was rejecting the argument in\nthat case that only the distinction between the unit\nrule and the summation approach is -- was the only\nmethodological distinction. And the Court was saying:\nWe think that differences in methodologies include the\nstock and debt, the discounted cash flow, and the market\nmultiples approaches used in this case.\nSo the Eleventh Circuit did go and consider\nthe argument that the State had -- should not have used\na 6.3 percent terminal growth rate in the discounted\ncash flow analysis even though that it used that in --\nin all -- for all public utilities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Calvert. Mr. Phillips, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI will try to be brief. First of all,\nJustice Stevens, in response to your question on the\ncomparisons between Georgia and other States, on page 22\nof our cert petition we pointed out that in the 2006 tax\nyear Georgia and Florida had adopted unit values of\n$11.2 billion and $12.9 billion; whereas, every other\nState in those jurisdictions that used the unit value\nhad an assessment value of $7.1 billion. And the\nRespondent State did not question that.\nSo I mean the reality is there are wide\nswings, and it does make a difference what methodology\nyou do, and it's part of the reason why it's absolutely\ncritical that the Court should enforce the language of\nthe statute. As Justice Scalia quite properly\nrecognizes, it is the true market value.\nAnd this is not a statute like, for\ninstance, 28 U.S.C. 1254(d)(1) in AEDPA, which says the\nFederal courts should defer to any reasonable\ndetermination by the State courts in a judgment Federal\nlaw.\nThis is a statute that vests the district\ncourt with the exclusive authority to make the\ndetermination of the true market value.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean I assume\nthat's in the normal context of the adversary process.\nIn other words, the district court does not necessarily\nhave to come up with a number independent of what the\nparties present to it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It can decide which\nof the presentations is closer to true market value.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. And that's -- and\nthat's exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice. There\nisn't any single method that's out there. All we have\nare a series of evidences of value, and the district\ncourt needs to be able to evaluate them without regard\nto some kind of thumb on the scale of the State, in\nfavor of the State. And as you asked the question, you\nknow, is there any other valuation process that would\nwork this way, the answer was no. And the problem is\nthat there is nothing in this, in this statute that\nremotely suggests that Congress would have wanted to do\nanything other than the ordinary or typical valuation in\nthis context.\nJustice Souter, I think you made the point,\nwhich is the one I wanted to make in my opening\nstatement, which is how is it possible that Congress\nrecognizes decades of discrimination involving tens or\nhundreds of millions of dollars would have said and now\nwhen you get to the point of trying to correct that\ndiscrimination, what are you going to do? Defer to the\nentity that's been discriminating for all of those\nyears. It is at least passing strange, if not\nincredible to think that that's what Congress meant.\nIt is much more sensible to think that\nCongress wanted the district court to serve as a serious\ncheck on what the state did. That's what we didn't get\nin this case. That's what we are entitled to. I urge\nthe Court to vacate and to revamp.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips, the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n36:17 AEDPA 56:20 39:11 54:6 55:17 37:3\n38:16 affect 10:18,21 APPEARAN... appropriate Atlanta 1:22\n57:14 affirmed 39:9 1:14 28:21 34:5,25 attached 41:9\n58:17 agree 22:13,15
