The Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, and Case\n07-990, Alaska v. The Southeast Alaska Conservation\nCouncil.\nGeneral Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENTS,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe expert agencies charged by Congress with\nimplementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the\ndischarge of fill material, like the mine tailings at\nissue in this case, should be permitted by the Army\nCorps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are\nnot -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines\napplicable to permits issued by the EPA under section\n402 of the Act.\nThat interpretation is grounded on more than\nthree decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the\ncollective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of\nEngineers and the EPA in administering the Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the discharge comes\nfrom a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or\ncan it ever be both fill and --\nGENERAL GARRE: Justice Kennedy, it's always\none or the other. The Clean Water Act establishes two\npermitting regimes. And I think this is actually\nsomething where the parties agree. Either it's going to\nbe permitted under section 402 of the Act, which covers\npollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged\nmaterial, or fill material, which is covered by section\n404 of the Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a legal\nanswer to Justice Kennedy's question. What is the\nphysical answer? Can a pipe both emit sludge, fill, and\neffluent?\nGENERAL GARRE: As a practical matter, for\nexample, if you take the slurry in this case, which is\n55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid\ncoming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under the\ndefinition that the agencies administer of fill\nmaterial, this is fill material under that definition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fill material trumps\neffluent, in other words?\nGENERAL GARRE: Fill material trumps\neffluent. That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it does -- here's the\nproblem that I am having and I think others may have.\nWe start, number one, with a definition, as I understand\nit, of a pollutant that includes suspended solids.\nNumber two, there is an existing regulation to the\neffect that wastewater from this particular method of\nextracting gold shall simply not be released, shall not\nbe put into a water body. And then the two agencies\ncome along and in effect they say by regulation, if the\nsuspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the\nwastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going\nto call it \"fill\" and leave it entirely to the Army\nEngineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto.\nAnd on the face of it, it sounds as though\nthey are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant\nof pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number\ntwo, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up\nwith a contradictory determination about what should be\ndone with it.\nAnd it sounds as though, under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory\nand the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint\nregulation on the other, you've simply got a flat\ncontradiction, and query whether that can be anything\nother than arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Will\nyou address that?\nGENERAL GARRE: Sure, Justice Souter. First\nof all, I those concerns really go to the definition of\n\"fill material,\" and I don't think that the Respondent\nSEACC has squarely challenged that definition in this\ncase. And I would point you to two parts of the record.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume -- and I\ndon't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done\n-- I am at least raising it because I find it very\ndifficult to get a handle on this case without dealing\nwith that problem. So you may say, well, they didn't\nraise it well enough, but I still want you to deal with\nit on the merits.\nGENERAL GARRE: Sure. And let me just point\nto the two parts of the record: The JA at 541 note 12,\nwhere the Ninth Circuit acknowledged they didn't\nchallenge it; and also I would point you to the\ncomplaint, where the complaint is directed to the\npermits and does not seek a determination that the Fill\nRule definition is arbitrary and capricious.\nWe think that that definition reflects the\nsettled understanding and expertise of both agencies,\nthe Army Corps of Engineers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it be settled,\nbecause isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary\npurpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit\napplied?\nGENERAL GARRE: That is correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. By \"settled,\" I mean it was settled\nin 2002. They adopted this rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not in 30 years'\nexperience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was\nunder 402 until 2002.\nGENERAL GARRE: I think the EPA has always\nadopted and applied an effects test for determining\nwhether or not a discharge is fill material --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in fact, was there\never a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose\nwas disposal of waste? Was there ever a 404 permit,\nrather than a 402, for disposal of what they call\n\"processed wastewater\" or \"wastewater\"?\nGENERAL GARRE: There was a period, of\ncourse, Justice Ginsburg -- you are right -- where the\nArmy Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test.\nDuring that period -- you are right -- 404 permits were\nnot -- were not issued for the discharge of things where\nthe purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose\nof material.\nNow, during that period, though, those\ndischarges were not regulated under section 402 of the\nAct and under Section 306, the effluent guidelines, but\nfor a different reason. The reason why that they\nweren't regulated under 402 during that period is\nbecause of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception,\nwhich is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies\nexcepted from the definition of the \"waters of the\nUnited States\" discharges into an impoundment area.\nAnd what you have going on here is the\ndischarge of fill material into an impoundment area,\nwhich is dammed off with a 50-foot dam. Those\ndischarges, in this case, are governed by section 404 of\nthe Act. But any discharges from that impoundment area\ninto downstream waters of the United States are subject\nto section 402 of the Act -- there's a separate permit\nin this case -- and are subject to the effluent\nguidelines and the new source performance standards.\nSo you have those two. The agencies have\ncome together. They've reconciled the statutory\nregimes, and they have the 404 permit of dredged\nmaterial, material that's going to fill the bottom of\nthe lake, raise it by 50 feet, governed by section 404\nof the Act. That impoundment area then is sealed off,\nand any discharged material out of that impoundment area\ninto waters of the United States is going to be governed\nby 402 and the separate effluent guidelines there. That\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's pretty cold comfort\nwhen you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake. I\nsuppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're\ndoing here, then the lake in the middle of the\nEverglades is an impoundment area, or a Great Salt Lake\nis an impoundment area.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, any -- we're talking\nabout --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: This is a long way from a\nsettling pond.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, let me address that in\ntwo different ways: First of all, at the end of this\nproject, when the lake is going to be reclaimed, the\nagencies determined that it's going to be\nenvironmentally as sound, if not superior, for the\nhabitats in Alaska, fish and wildlife. So at the end of\nthe project, it is going to be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what's that --\nwhat's that got to do with the definition of\n\"impoundment area\"? My problem is that you are\ntreating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area\na whole natural lake as distinct from a settling basin.\nGENERAL GARRE: The statute refers to\nspecified disposal sites and what you have here, you are\nright, is a lake. But it's impounded by a 50-foot dam.\nThe other part I wanted to point to is the section 404\nguidelines are rigorous environmental guidelines that\naddress a number of different concerns, including the\nquality of the water, the fish and wildlife habitat, and\nat the end of that process you have got the EPA, which\nhas the right to exercise a veto over --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You keep saying they are\nrigorous. My understanding is -- and I didn't think it\nwas seriously disputed here -- is that during the period\nin which the deposits are going to be made, the natural\nlife of this water body is going to be destroyed.\nGENERAL GARRE: That's true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the Corps comes along\nand says, oh, when it's all over, it will come back.\nBut when you're destroying the entire living sort of\ncorpus of this lake, it seems to me that it's getting\nmore lenient to say that there are rigorous\nenvironmental standards.\nGENERAL GARRE: That's true, Justice Souter,\nbut it's important to keep in mind that the reason why\nthe lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to\nsurvive is because of the fill effect of the material,\nnot because of any toxics put into the water.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but as I understand it,\nand you correct me if I am wrong here, I thought\n\"suspended solids,\" I guess is the buzz word for it, is\na form of pollution. So you're saying, well, we're\ndestroying the fish with one form of pollution rather\nthan another form of pollution. And I don't know that\nthat advances the ball for your side.\nGENERAL GARRE: Any time you have fill\nmaterial going into the waters of the United States --\nof course, section 404 doesn't apply until you've got\nfill material going into the waters of the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but this comes back to\nmy initial question. You are simply, or the Corps is\nsimply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant,\nsuspended solids discharged into the water, by calling\nit fill material. And it -- in effect it's defining one\nsubject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the\nlaw of the United States by redefining it and saying,\noh, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine.\nGENERAL GARRE: I think what the agencies\nhave done to reconcile their definitions is to apply\nthis effects test. Now, if Coeur Alaska sought to fill\nthe entire lake --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But to apply the effects\ntest, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form\nof pollution as no longer existent so long as that form\nof pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers\ndefinition of \"fill.\"\nGENERAL GARRE: I don't think that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that correct?\nGENERAL GARRE: The legal effect is to\nregulate that pollution under section 404.\nJUSTICE ALITO: General Garre, I don't want\nto take up your rebuttal time, but what's the\nenvironmental alternative to what was done here?\nGENERAL GARRE: The primary environmental\nalternative considered was a dry tailings alternative.\nAnd that would be been problematic in two different\nways. One, it would have required the destruction of\nsome 100 acres of wetlands; and two, it would have\nresulted in enormous stacks of tailings, 100 to 200\nhigh, thousands of feet wide, that would actually dwarf\nthe Pentagon and be visible from nearby Berners Bay.\nNow, the Army Corps of Engineers, the State\nof Alaska, and the Forest Service determined that the\nwet tailings option, putting the tailings into a lake,\nand reclaiming that lake so that it would be\nenvironmentally superior, was the preferable option.\nI do want to emphasize that if this Court\nhas any doubt about the statutory text the regulatory\ndecisions here go back more than 30 years. In 1973 the\nEPA adopted a rule that said that the discharge of fill\nmaterial is not regulated under the section 402\npermitting system. In 2002, in the preamble to the fill\nrule, the agency made clear again EPA has never\nregulated the discharge of fill material under the\neffluent guidelines.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Weren't they then\nthinking of fill material as material that was used\neither to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction\nproject? I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a\nfill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place\nfor a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily\nthinks of as a filling operation.\nGENERAL GARRE: Not the Environmental\nProtection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency\nsince the passage of the Clean Water Act has taken the\nposition that discharge that has the effect of changing\nthe bottom elevation of a water is going to be fill.\nAnd that makes sense as a practical matter. The\nagencies with 30 years of experience determined that the\npurpose definition that the Corps had adopted for a\nperiod was unworkable, unpredictable and didn't make\nsense. And I think that if there's any judgment that\nthe courts ought to defer to here, it's the judgment of\nthe agencies based on their collective experience as to\nthe proper definition of \"fill material.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one question that\nJustice Souter raised and before you sit down I would\nlike to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any\nwater of the United States that the Corps of Engineers\ndecides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place,\ncan any waterway be a settling pond? That is, here we\nhave a lake. And is it just up to the Corps of\nEngineers? They say this is a settling pond, it's a\nsettling pond?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think as a practical\nmatter if you put discharge into a river and it may not\nchange the bottom elevation, that wouldn't be fill\nmaterial. But, Justice Ginsburg, there have been a\nnumber of hypotheticals raised by Respondents here. Let\nme address those. The section 404 process is a rigorous\nenvironmental process, the EPA does have veto authority.\nWe haven't seen these problems at all in the six years\nthat the fill definition has been in place and I think\nit's simply untenable to suggest that these standards,\nwhich in section 4 require water quality determinations,\nwildlife, aquatic determination, would result in the\nsort of environmental harm that Respondents have\nhypothesized, and the prospect of that harm is no basis\nfor this Court to override the statutory scheme that\nCongress created with two distinct permitting regimes,\none for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to\noverride the agency's pronouncements, interpretations\nfor more than 30 years.\nAnd the other agency document I wanted to\npoint to is very important. It's the 2004 mine tailings\nmemorandum, which is contained at JA-141 to 146. In\nthat memorandum, which is a 2004 memo by the heads of\nthe EPA water divisions, they explain the application of\nthe statutory and the regulatory scheme to these types\nof discharges, discharges that fill material into the\nimpoundment is going to be subject to 404 and the\nrigorous process there. Any discharges out of that\nimpoundment area is going to be subject to the rigorous\nrequirements of 402 and that agency interpretation is\nentitled to deference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court: Let me reemphasize one point. The\nClean Water Act itself, Congress created two distinct,\nmutually exclusive but complementary permitting regimes.\nOne is fill material, which is governed by, administered\nby the Corps of Engineers. The other is \"other, except\nas permitted under section 404,\" administered by the\nEPA.\nA discharge, in answer to your question,\nJustice Kennedy, may be governed by one program or the\nother, not both. Everybody admits that, including the\nRespondents.\nThe fill rule --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't the EPA have a\nveto power over the fill material permit?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it does, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So they're not totally\nmutually exclusive.\nMR. OLSON: It's mutually exclusive in terms\nof the issuing agency, and I think that's a very\nimportant point. We want to emphasize that, that the\nrules pursuant to which the Corps of Engineers\nadministers the fill permit are the 404(b)(1) rules\nwhich Congress specified to be enacted by the EPA. So\nthe rigorous rules governing the quality of the water\nthat's going to be affected by these fill permits are\nestablished by the EPA.\nFurthermore, the State is involved, the\nfisheries departments are involved, the conservation\narea of the State of Alaska. Many different agencies\nare involved in this permitting process. The permits in\nthis case followed 900 studies, the expenditure of $26\nmillion, an evaluation by the EPA, the Corps of\nEngineers, the department of conservation of Alaska,\nand, Justice Stevens' point, finally before the permit\ncould be issued it had to go to the EPA and the EPA had\nthe power to veto the permit.\nNow, Congress determined --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they veto it\ndue to its failure to comply with effluent limitations?\nMR. OLSON: No, they could not do that,\nJustice -- Chief Justice Roberts, because the --\nCongress made a choice under sections 404 and 402.\nSection 402, the EPA program, is governed by those\neffluent limitations under 301 and 306 and standards of\nperformance.\nCongress made a choice of applying section\n307, which are toxic effluent limitations that apply to\nthe 404 permits. That 307 regime which Congress\nselected, which is also endorsed by the EPA in the rules\nthat the -- that the Corps must follow in administering\nthe permit -- that 307 provision to which I just\nreferred to is in the 404(b)(1) regime rules. So all of\nthis, the permitting process, which Congress made the\ndecision to put into two baskets: Either it's fill\nmaterial or it's except permits under --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if the\nagencies disagree as to whether it's fill? If 404 says\nit's fill, EPA says it isn't, can the EPA then veto it\non that ground?\nMR. OLSON: The -- the -- yes. I -- I think\nthe answer to that is yes. But the better answer to\nthat, Justice Kennedy, is for a while, as -- as General\nGarre pointed out, the EPA had a different concept of\nwhat was fill than the Corps of Engineers. The EPA\nright from the beginning said it would be the effect on\nthe -- on the water.\nThe Corps for a while had that definition.\nThen it used a purpose test. Both agencies, the EPA and\nthe Army Corps of Engineers, agreed in 2002 that that\n\"purpose\" definition of the word \"fill\" was not\nworkable. It was too subjective.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there are still going\nto be cases, I would assume very close cases, even under\nthe present standard, where there could be disagreement.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there could be\ndisagreement, but I was just about to say that this rule\nwas jointly adopted by the Corps of Engineers and the\nEPA in 2002. To the extent there is any ambiguity as to\nwhat fill material is, both the Army Corps of Engineers\nand the EPA agree that it includes slurry from mines.\nSo that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The definition that was\nadopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition.\nThat was the effect. And it was the Corps that had the\npurpose test. And yet, until 2002, if I understand\ncorrectly, if the only reason of raising the elevation\nof the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a\n404 permit. That was not a 404 situation until 2002.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's -- except in\nthe early stage, as I understand it, the Corps and --\nthe Corps also used the \"effects\" test. Then there was\na period of time when it used a \"purpose\" test. The EPA\nconsistently used the -- the \"effects\" test. In --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in an application\nthat never included filling a lake, raising the\nelevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing\nof waste.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's -- until that\npoint, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But the two\nagencies that were involved in this process determined\nthat that was not a workable test. It didn't function\nwell. It allowed too much evasion and -- and\nmanipulation, and they both came together after long\nstudies and decided a reasonable interpretation that was\neffective, consistent, and workable.\nUnder the Clean Water Act, both agencies\ncame together and decided that the definition included\nthe placement of overburden, slurry, tailings, or\nsimilar mining-related materials.\nNow, to the extent there is any ambiguity in\nthe statute, this is the reasoned judgment, notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking by the two agencies given\nresponsibility.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I perhaps am missing\nthis. I -- this is in general what I don't understand,\nhow this works. My understanding is that under 404\nsomething is \"fill\" -- they have a definition. And it's\n\"fill,\" among other things, if it changes the bottom\nlevel of any portion of water in the United States. Is\nthat right?\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And somewhere I have the\nidea -- but I can't find it in the briefs now -- that it\nhas to raise the bottom level by 55 feet.\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't -- that does not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is some number of\nfeet.\nMR. OLSON: I don't know where you got that.\nThat is the result in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the result of this\ncase. But, anyway, it raises the level. I guess it has\nto raise it some significant amount. All right. So\nwhat happens in this situation?\nLet us think of the worst pollutant you can\nthink of. Think of that. I don't know what it is.\nMaybe it's saturated fat in potato chips, something\nabsolutely terrible.\nMR. OLSON: Cholesterol.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. We are going to\nthink of that pollutant. And now let's suppose that\nwith the agreement of the Army Corps of Engineers a\ncompany takes this pollutant, which is the worst one you\ncould think of, that the EPA would never let you go\nwithin 50 feet of it, and they take it, and they fill a\nlake with it up to the level of 55 feet, or 20 feet, or\nwhatever number of feet.\nI mean, it just can't be that simply because\nthey poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of\nthe lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any\nmore. Now, that -- that -- since that's so\ncounterintuitive, that all you have to do is take a\nterrible pollutant and fill the bottom of the lake with\nit and now it's up to the Army Corps of Engineers and\nnot up to the EPA -- that's so counterintuitive that I\nassume I don't understand the statute, and you will\nexplain it to me.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I will, Justice Breyer. If\nit's fill, the administrating, permitting agency is the\nArmy Corps of Engineers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMR. OLSON: But in granting that permit, in\nevaluating that permit, they must follow the 404(b)(1)\nguidelines that were drafted and written by the EPA. So\nthat -- and EPA has all sorts of provisions. It can't\nhave an adverse effect on the water. There cannot be a\npreferable environmental alternative. It must go\nthrough the Marine Fisheries. It cannot contain that\ntoxic material that you are talking about, that worst\nmaterial in the world.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it can contain it so\nlong as it is -- as it -- as it is not transitory.\nMR. OLSON: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, isn't it arguable\nthat the best place for -- for really toxic stuff is at\nthe bottom of a lake so long as it stays there and is\nnot carried --\nMR. OLSON: That -- that may be, but the\nRule 404(b)(1) guidelines address both that point, and I\nunderstand your point, too. But in -- on 11(a) of the\nGovernment's brief the -- the 404(b)(1) guidelines are\nset forth, and it includes a provision, number 2 on that\npage, \"violates any applicable toxic effluent standard\nor prohibition under section 307 of the Act.\" So the\nwater quality is going to be regulated according to EPA\nstandards.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is identical. So it\ndoesn't make any difference.\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I heard you say before\nthat it was not identical. That -- I mean if, of\ncourse, EPA takes all its regs and applies those regs\nwhen the Army Corps of Engineers considers a permit\nunder 404 so that you couldn't get an Army Corps of\nEngineers permit unless you complied with the 402\netcetera regs, then this all could come to nothing.\nMR. OLSON: Every -- every --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there must be something\nmissing in that.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, there is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. OLSON: The difference that a regulation\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the most important\nthing that is missing?\nMR. OLSON: The -- there is not -- it's --\nit's -- the most important thing that is present is that\nCongress decided that these regulations that the --\n\"fill\" is different stuff. It was for a different -- it\nhad different consequences and should be regulated in a\ndifferent way. The definition --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think what might be\nmissing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is nontoxic covered by 402?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nontoxic is covered by 402.\nYou -- you can violate the effluent guidelines by -- by\npouring into the waters of the United States even\nnontoxic materials, isn't that right?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And under 404 it'S only\ntoxic.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the big\ndifference.\nMR. OLSON: And -- and -- and I'm going to\nreserve the balance, if I might, for rebuttal. But let\nme just say \"pollutant\" includes sand and rock. And\nwhat's being put in this settling area, this lake, is\nthe sand, which is the same consistency of the bottom of\nthe lake. It's inert material. It does not changing\nthe chemical composition. It is not hurting the water\nquality of the lake.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's going to kill\nevery living creature in the lake, right?\nMR. OLSON: Putting sand or rocks --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wait a minute. It is going\nto kill everything in the lake.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it is, Justice Souter.\nPutting sand in the bottom of the lake is going to do\nthat. They are going to reintroduce the fish. It will\nbe a bigger lake with a better aquatic system when it's\nfinished. But, yes, you are correct, in the interim the\nsand at the bottom of the lake will kill those fish.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how do we know that\nlife will ever be restored? I mean, that's a guess.\nNobody knows.\nMR. OLSON: It's a -- it's a condition for\nthe permit, and every agency which examined this,\nincluding the Fisheries Department, the -- the\nconservation agencies of the State of Alaska -- and\nspecifically said in the administrative record that\nunder the worst-case scenario they believe that all of\nthat is going to take place, and there will be more fish\nin a bigger lake and more livable living conditions for\nthe fish and aquatic life after this process is\nfinished.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nOlson.\nMr. Waldo.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS S. WALDO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WALDO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn section 306(e), Congress enacted an\nunqualified prohibition against operating any new source\nin violation of any standard of performance applicable\nto the source. The standard of performance at issue in\nthis case is applicable on its face to the formula at\nthe Kensington mine. It says there shall be no\ndischarge of processed wastewater into navigable waters\nfrom mills that use the froth-flotation process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the\nprovision that authorizes permits begins by saying\n\"Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344,\" and 1344\nis 404. So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime\ncompletely out of what you were just talking about?\nMR. WALDO: Because that's only a statement\nabout whether section 402 applies. It means that if you\nhave a section 404 permit, you don't also need a section\n402 permit. It doesn't say anything about whether a 404\npermit is appropriate under any particular\ncircumstances, and it doesn't say anything about whether\nsection 306 is applicable. In fact --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The standard has to be --\nthe standard has to be applicable and this is an EPA\nregulation, isn't it?\nMR. WALDO: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the EPA has said this\nisn't applicable to this situation.\nMR. WALDO: But that determination was based\non a misinterpretation of the Clean Water Act. That\nprefatory clause that the Chief Justice was asking about\ndoesn't say anything about whether section 306 applies.\n306 does not have a prefatory clause like that, which\nstrongly suggests that it's not intended to apply there.\nIn other --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So your position requires us\nto determine that EPA's interpretation of those, the\nstatutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and\n402, is contrary to the statute?\nMR. WALDO: That the interpretation as it's\npresented in this case is contrary to the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If EPA were to amend the\nperformance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the\nsituation in which the fill rule applies, would that be\na valid regulation?\nMR. WALDO: Well, I doubt that EPA could --\ncould lawfully under the Clean Water Act enact such a\nthing, because the Clean Water Act requires EPA to\nregulate suspended solids and EPA has always regulated\nsuspended solids through effluent limitations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could the -- could the EPA\nallow a point source to discharge sand slurry -- there's\nnothing in it but sand -- into a river? Wouldn't you\nhave to -- wouldn't you need some permission from the\nEPA to do that? Wouldn't that violate the Act?\nMR. WALDO: If it -- I'm sorry, so it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I want to discharge. I\nhave a pipe and there is sand on my land which is being\nwashed away. I'm discharging all that sand into a\nriver.\nMR. WALDO: Yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would that violate --\nMR. WALDO: That's a discharge of a\npollutant, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Discharge of a pollutant.\nMR. WALDO: Yes. And so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if I do the same thing\nin a lake, because I want to fill the lake, of what\npossible application is the fill standard unless it\npermits what would otherwise be prohibited under --\nunder the earlier sections?\nMR. WALDO: Well, the Corps of Engineers has\nthe authority under section 404 to grant fill material\npermits --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it violates\neffluent standards.\nMR. WALDO: No, not when it violates\neffluent standards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say that\nif you discharge sand into -- into a river it violates\neffluent standards.\nMR. WALDO: Oh, that doesn't -- oh, I'm\nsorry. I didn't understand that part of your question.\nYes, if -- if there is an effluent limitation for a\nparticular source -- remember, effluent limitations are\nadopted for industrial sources, so you would have to\nlook at what the source of that discharge was.\nAnd if EPA had identified that source, a\nparticular kind of factory of some kind, a mill, you\nknow, a leather tanning facility or something like that,\nif EPA had adopted effluent limitations that were\napplicable to that source, then discharges have to\ncomply with those effluent limitations.\nIt's important to realize here that the\nClean Water Act, contrary to the way the Petitioners try\nto present it, is not just one big permitting statute.\nIt's not simply 402 and 404 and that determines\neverything. The effluent limitations under sections 301\nand 306 have independent applicability directly to\ndischarges. They are separately enforceable by EPA and\nthrough citizens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The discharges we\nare talking about have to be discharges of effluent,\nright?\nMR. WALDO: Something that is governed by an\neffluent limitation, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My question is, does\nit apply to solids?\nMR. WALDO: Absolutely. EPA is required in\nthe Clean Water Act to regulate suspended solids through\neffluent limitations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, I\nmean, does suspended solids mean there is some liquid\ninvolved?\nMR. WALDO: That implies some liquid, right;\nthat -- that the solids are present in the liquid, like\nthe discharge here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Like the discharge\nhere. Now, I think Mr. Olson said these are 55 percent\nsolid by volume.\nMR. WALDO: By weight. By volume it is 30\npercent solids.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a point at\nwhich it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than\na suspended solid? I mean, 90 percent by weight or by\nvolume, whichever it is, solid?\nMR. WALDO: Well, the standard in this case\nprohibits a discharge of processed wastewater.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. WALDO: And so, it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't think\nsomething that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?\nMR. WALDO: There might be some point at\nwhich the liquid content of a solid waste is so small\nthat EPA wouldn't regard it as processed wastewater\nanymore. But that's not the case here. In this case,\nthere is no dispute that the discharge is processed\nwastewater. The government has conceded that point.\nAnd -- and it's extremely important, because\nEPA is required to, as I said, regulate suspended solids\nthrough effluent limitations and to adopt a zero --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they were just\nputting whatever it is that doesn't have any water,\nconcrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would\nbe just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill\nprovisions that would govern that?\nMR. WALDO: As long as there is no effluent\nlimitation governing it, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, if they chop\nup the concrete and put a little water in so that it's\neasier to move, then all of a sudden it comes under 402\nand the EPA's jurisdiction?\nMR. WALDO: It depends on if EPA has adopted\nan effluent limitation for it. So if that waste stream\nthat you are describing comes from some kind of factory,\nconcrete -- for example, cement manufacturing is a\nsource category that EPA --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I'm just\ncurious how that makes any sense, since we are talking\nabout putting something into water. I mean, does it\nreally matter whether you add the water before it goes\ninto the lake or just the lake adds the water when you\nput in the solid?\nMR. WALDO: EPA --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT: Either way, I guess\nyour friends on the other side would argue, I assume,\nthat it's properly regarded as fill material, because\nthat is the effect of it, rather than as effluent\nsubject to 402.\nMR. WALDO: EPA has always regulated\nindustrial sources that -- whose raw processed\nwastewater contains high levels of suspended solids,\nhigh enough that it would have the effect of fill\nmaterial and can be considered fill. In fact -- and, in\nfact, EPA has always had a definition of fill material\nthat was based on the effects.\nSo for more than 30 years, EPA has been\nregulating sources like ore processing mills, cement\nmanufacturing plants, aluminum smelters, coal-fired\npower plants, all of which and many more require the use\nof settling ponds to remove the solids.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So do we decide -- we\ndecide this case on the assumption that this is fill?\nDo you agree that this is fill?\nMR. WALDO: It's both. It's fill material\nand it's processed wastewater that is subject to an\neffluent limitation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then the question\nthat we've put earlier is whether or not a single pipe\ncontained both, and you say that it can contain both.\nMR. WALDO: Well, it's -- it's one slurry.\nIt meets both definitions. The solids are part of the\nprocessed wastewater.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's one -- visibly, it's\none stream, but you say it consists of two things.\nMR. WALDO: Well, it is -- it is a slurry\nthat contains water, chemicals --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it both slurry -- is it\nboth fill and non-fill?\nMR. WALDO: It's -- it's fill and it's\nprocessed wastewater.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's both -- do you\nagree that there can be only one permit; there can't be\na 402 and a 404 permit?\nMR. WALDO: No. In this case there can't be\nany permit because there is a new source performance\nstandard that prohibits --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. So, let's change\nthat. What if the -- what if the new source performance\nstandard was not a total prohibition? What if there was\nan effluent limitation in there, so that a permit could\nbe issued, provided that there was compliance with the\neffluent limitation? Now, who issues the permit? And I\nrepeat, I understand it's your position that there can't\nbe both a 402 and a 404 permit.\nMR. WALDO: If there is an effluent\nlimitation applicable, it will end up having to be EPA\nthat issues the permit, and that's -- that's simply\nbecause the Corps of Engineers just doesn't have the\ntools available to apply effluent limitations in its 404\npermits, except for toxic substances.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where do you find that in\nthe statute?\nMR. WALDO: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where there's a situation\nwhere possibly there could be a 402 and a 404 permit,\nthe 402 permit trumps the 404 permit?\nMR. WALDO: Well, it's just that -- where we\nfind that is in section 306(e), which says -- which is a\nprohibition against offering -- operating sources in\nviolation of performance standards. And here --\nJUSTICE ALITO: This wouldn't be an\noperation in violation of a performance standard. There\nwould be a performance standard.\nMR. WALDO: The performance standard that\nsays --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That can be put into a 402\npermit.\nMR. WALDO: Oh, I see what you are saying.\nYeah. Well, even -- the -- what the problem is is that\nsection 404 doesn't make any provision for application\nof effluent limitations and performance standards under\nsections 301 and 306.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And 402 doesn't make any\napplication for -- for the 404 regulations.\nMR. WALDO: Yeah, that's correct. But it\ndoes provide the tool for EPA to apply those effluent\nlimitations that you were asking about. The effluent\nlimitations have to be complied with, and EPA is the\nagency under section --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does it make the --\nwhere does it make provision for application of the\nstandards that should apply to fill under 404?\nMR. WALDO: Well, those standards apply if\nyou have fill material that is not subject to some\neffluent limitation. Effluent limitations are only\nadopted for industrial sources --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does the statute say\nthat?\nMR. WALDO: Where does it say -- I'm sorry.\nCould you clarify the question?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does it say that? You\nsay that there can't be two permits and you say 402\ntrumps 404. And I'm asking where in the statute does it\nsay that?\nMR. WALDO: It is an absence of a provision\nin 404, but -- but the thing is, even if 404 has -- even\nif the Corps of Engineers -- and I should say, we agree\nwith the Government and with the agencies about this.\nThe agencies have never interpreted section 404 to\nprovide for the application of effluent limitations in\n404 permits. The 404(b) guidelines don't provide for\nit; it's not provided in the statute. And so, they just\ndon't have the ability to do it.\nThe problem is, they try to carry that a\nstep farther and take that absence of provision to say\nthat it's an exception from effluent limitations, to say\nthat they don't have to comply with section 301 and 306,\nbut it doesn't say that; and that's an implied\nexception, and the Court should only find an implied\nexception if it's necessary to avoid absurd results.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you go --\nMR. WALDO: No one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. Could you go\nback for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson? I'm\nthinking of it in very simplified terms. The simplified\nterms is, I think of a pipe and I think of a\ncircumstance where some terrible pollutant comes out of\nthe pipe that would be subject to 306; and if the pipe\ngoes up in a river or a lake, a regular lake, it could\nfill up the bottom. Seems possible.\nMR. WALDO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if it fills\nup the bottom, it's called fill and comes under 404.\nMR. WALDO: It doesn't even have to fill it\nup very much --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know, I know that.\nI see the point. But I mean, it seems to me if it fills\nup to the bottom to whatever point, it's fill, and now\nit's the Army Corps of Engineers. If it has effluent in\nit, it's effluent and so now it's under EPA. In other\nwords, you have both.\nMR. WALDO: That's the situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's only been going on for\n40 years. I'm sure this isn't the first time they've\nhad both.\nMR. WALDO: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I don't\nunderstand. What I would think of is if you have two\nsets of standards and it's both, they should satisfy\nboth. I'm not writing these statutes.\nMR. WALDO: Well, let me -- I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I heard from -- and I\nmight interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said\nthis, but the way I heard it was: Well, don't worry,\nbecause if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of\nEngineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard\nanyway. And now you are sort of saying: Well, or they\nare going to apply some standard. And then there was a\nquestion of well, what standard, and we got a little\nvague there.\nNow, what happens if it goes to the EPA as\neffluent? Justice Alito's question is, well, do they\napply the fill standard? And between my response to\nthese two answers, I still don't understand how it\nworks. It's -- help me.\nMR. WALDO: The Corps of Engineers only\napplies toxic effluent limitations. There are other\npollutants that are nontoxic --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now, if you lose\nthis case, what we are going to have is all the fish are\ngoing to be killed by some horrible pollutant, and the\n-- the Army Corps of Engineers can't do anything about\nit, and the only reason is we put enough of the\npollutant in there to fill it up to ten feet from the\nbottom. And then if you did it the other way, if the\nEPA regulated it, it might do something terrible under\n404, and they couldn't do anything about it.\nNow it's very hard for me to believe that\nthat's really how these agencies have been operating for\n40 years.\nMR. WALDO: Well, that's not; and let me\nexplain how they have been operating, because I think\nthat will help clarify it. For 40 years EPA has\nregulated sources like ore processing mills, aluminum\nsmelters, others that I have named, others that are\nlisted in our brief, and has applied effluent\nlimitations to those discharges. Now, you hear --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even when they --\neven fill -- even when they fill a lake?\nMR. WALDO: Yes, absolutely -- and let me\nexplain that, because you hear this statement a lot:\n\"EPA never regulates fill material.\" Well, that's\nbecause when you apply the effluent limitations, it's\nnot fill material anymore.\nThe effluent limitations require the use of\nsettling ponds that are not in navigable waters. The\nsettling ponds or other technologies remove almost all\nof the solids so that the discharge that is permitted by\nEPA in the section 402 permit might have a limitation of\n20 or 30 milligrams per liter, something that wouldn't\nhave a measurable filling effect on the receiving water\nbody.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when EPA\nregulates has regulated these for 40 years, which I\nassume is up until 2002, then it's -- it's because they\ndon't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling\nponds?\nMR. WALDO: Settling ponds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which are not\nnavigable waters of the United States.\nMR. WALDO: Exactly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the new\nregulation says the EPA does not regulate it when it\ngoes into -- I can understand why the Army Corps of\nEngineers doesn't care if it's an impoundment pond or a\nsettling pond, but they do care when it's a lake.\nMR. WALDO: When they adopted the new\nregulation, they were very clear that they intended to\ncontinue their past practice. The agencies never stated\nan intent to repeal or modify or change the\napplicability of any effluent limitations, and in fact\nthis question came up repeatedly: What happens if it's\nfill material but it's subject to an effluent\nlimitation; and every time they addressed it, they said\nthe same thing. Effluent limitations will continue to\napply and will be applied through section 402 permits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To fill material as\ndefined in the 2002 regulation?\nMR. WALDO: That's what it's all about, yes.\nThat's what they were talking about. That was addressed\nover and over again in the -- in the Fill Rule, and they\nnever --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which, which, which\n-- I'm sorry, which Fill Rule?\nMR. WALDO: The -- I'm talking about the\nFederal Register preamble and the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. You are\ntalking about the preamble. I'm looking at the\ndefinition of fill material in -- whatever -- it's\nreproduced at page 7a and 8a of the government's brief.\nMR. WALDO: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- definition --\nMR. WALDO: The definition of fill material\nis simply a definition. By itself it doesn't have any\noperative effect. It doesn't -- it doesn't authorize\nany particular kinds of discharges.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but do you have\na -- a case over these 40 years where a company was\ntrying to use the emission from the mine as a fill\nmaterial in a lake rather than in a settling pond, and\nwhere the EPA, despite the fact that it was using it to\nfill a lake, applied its effluent standards?\nMR. WALDO: No, it's been permitted --\nprohibited.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then --\nMR. WALDO: It's been prohibited. It's\nillegal for EPA to permit the discharge of the processed\nwastewater --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Evidently not. I mean, the\nEPA says not. Do you have a -- an instance where it was\nprohibited where a company wanted to -- to emit fill\nmaterial into a lake and the EPA said no, you can't do\nit, because of the effluent limitations?\nMR. WALDO: Well, if any -- I don't know if\nanyone ever asked to do that, but if they did the answer\nwould have been no. I can't come up with an answer\nbecause that's what the effluent limitations require.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your -- your 40 years\nof experience then really don't -- don't cover this\ncase. People have been putting it into settling ponds.\nLet me ask you another question. The other\nside says that the alternative to this would be even\nworse, or it sounds worse to me, anyway. What -- what\nis your solution, closing down the mine? Is there --\nMR. WALDO: No, no, no. We -- we agree with\nEPA on this point. There is a different of opinion\nbetween EPA and Corps of Engineers as to which was the\npreferred site. EPA preferred the dry land disposal\nsite, and -- and we agree that has much less adverse\naffect on the ecosystem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your description of\nthat effect? The other solution we were told would\ninvolve filling in a vast expanse of wetlands and then\nhaving these huge piles that could be seen by all the\ntourist boats.\nMR. WALDO: Yes, it has -- it does have\nadverse impacts, that is, some; but in EPA's view and in\nour view is not as bad as filling up a lake and killing\nall the fish and aquatic life in the lake.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the fish, there\nare a thousand fish in this lake, right?\nMR. WALDO: Yes. Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And those aren't\nendangered fish; there are millions of them somewhere\nelse, right?\nMR. WALDO: That's right. But it's -- it's\nalso an important point for us here that this is a\nnational rule, and EPA considered these kind of\nalternative land use requirements as an effect of its\nno-discharge rule. When the -- EPA specifically\naddressed the fact that if you prohibit discharges of\nprocessed wastewater into navigable waters, it's going\nto require using more land to dispose of all that solid\nwaste somewhere, and they determined that the benefits\nof keeping processed wastewater out of the navigable\nwaters was worth it. And so it's both site-specifically\npreferable, and it's a determination that was based\non --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there a decision in\nthe lower courts that the alternative was unacceptable\nas well? And would you represent that if the case were\nremanded, that would not be your position on remand?\nMR. WALDO: Oh, we've already taken that\nposition, yes. We've been working -- we -- we were\nworking with the mining company after the Ninth Circuit\ndecision to identify --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It was never your position\nthat that was unacceptable?\nMR. WALDO: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: It was never your client's\nposition that creating these permanently destroyed\nwetlands and creating a mound that was bigger than the\nPentagon was an unacceptable solution to the --\nMR. WALDO: I don't want to make any\nrepresentations about what a client may have said over\nthe last 20 years of this mine, but I can tell you that\nwe were working with the agencies and with Coeur to\nidentify an alternative site they -- or the Coeur\napplied for the permits to do that, and pursuant to this\nmediation we were having and then abruptly pulled out a\nfew weeks ago.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you said the EPA\npreferred the -- the solution of filling in the wetlands\nand creating an ash Pentagon?\nMR. WALDO: When -- when the Corps of\nEngineers proposed the draft 404 permit, EPA commented\non it and said, we disagree with your conclusion that\nfilling up the lake is the least environmentally\ndangerous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it really felt\nthat way, couldn't it simply have vetoed the permit?\nMR. WALDO: Yes, EPA can veto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it couldn't have felt\nvery strongly about it.\nMR. WALDO: Well, EPA -- the veto authority\nis a discretionary authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. WALDO: It's for unacceptable adverse\nconsequences. And for understandable reasons, EPA very\nrarely exercises that authority. But EPA never changed\nits position about whether the -- about which was the\npreferred alternative. The EPA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It couldn't have preferred\nit very much, or it would have vetoed this one.\nMR. WALDO: It -- apparently not enough to\ncome to the conclusion that it was one of those\nsituations where they wanted to veto based on\nunacceptable adverse consequences.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any aquatic\nlife in this lake other than a thousand fish?\nMR. WALDO: Well, sure. There's\nmicroinvertebrae and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Microinvertebrae?\nMR. WALDO: I mean, all sorts of the things\nthat fish feed on. Plant life and animal life, and all\nthat stuff.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Plankton and stuff.\nMR. WALDO: Yes. Whatever. I'm not an\nexpert on the ecology of this lake, but there is a\ncouple of different kinds of fish and other life that\nmake it possible for those fish to live there, and\nessentially --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it right --\nMR. WALDO: -- it would all be destroyed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it right -- now, I am\nback on my hobby horse -- but is it right that this\nslurry is pushing into this lake 50 feet or 75 feet\ncovering the bottom with some stuff? A lot of it's\ndirt, and some of it's the worst chemical ever, except\nit's not toxic? Okay. I guess cyanide isn't toxic.\nBut the -- the -- now I just heard that if\nthe EPA doesn't give the permit, but the Corps of\nEngineers does, the EPA has the power to veto the\npermit. Is that right?\nMR. WALDO: EPA can veto for unacceptable\nadverse consequences. It's not a way to enforce\neffluent limitations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? If they have a\nveto power --\nMR. WALDO: Because that's all 404(c) says.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know it comes under a\ndifferent statute, but in any instance where in fact\nthey see that some of their rules that they promulgate\nare being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers\nis not paying attention to those rules, they can veto\nit.\nMR. WALDO: Well, but then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they don't veto it, then\nthat would be a way of reconciling these two things.\nMR. WALDO: The -- the position that EPA has\ntaken in this case, unfortunately, is that, if the\ndischarge meets that definition of fill material, no\nmatter how bad the consequences are for water quality,\nit's fill material, and it's therefore exempt from\neffluent limitations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So couldn't they veto it?\nMR. WALDO: Only if it was for adverse --\nwell, if they found adverse -- unacceptable adverse\nconsequences --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And wouldn't an\nunacceptable adverse consequence be that it puts all\nthis effluent into the water?\nMR. WALDO: It's a different standard from\nwhether it violates an effluent limitation. That's all\nI'm saying.\nAnd I want to be clear that the effluent in\nthis case, although it doesn't necessarily violate any\ntoxic pollutant effluent, it is toxic. It's toxic with\nconventional pollutants. It has a pH of 10, which is\ntoxic to aquatic life. It's very high. It's about the\npH of ammonia, is what this slurry effluent is that's\nbeing discharged in this case. And the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that the pH at the\npoint where it's discharged, and not the general pH in\nthe lake?\nMR. WALDO: It will dilute in the lake.\nThey are using the lake as their diluting settling pond.\nThat's right. They're using a navigable water body --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the answer to the\nquestion, when -- once it's released into the lake,\nwhat's the pH of the lake as opposed to the --\nMR. WALDO: Oh, it will dilute in the lake,\nso it will revert to normal levels, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Within how long?\nMR. WALDO: Oh, I mean, that happens, you\nknow, in a -- some sort of a mixing zone just outside\nthe pipe. That happens pretty quickly.\nNow, for the lake to recover --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The pH that you just cited\nwas the pH --\nMR. WALDO: Of the slurry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- just at the point of the\ndischarge?\nMR. WALDO: Of the slurry. That's right.\nAnd -- now I want to talk about this allegation that\nit's like dumping wet sand in the lake. That's not true\nat all. They tested the tailings sediment from this\ndischarge with two organisms, and with one of them, it\nkilled 95 percent of the organisms in the test, which is\nway over the top for EPA's toxicity threshold. In the\nother organism they had, it -- the organism survived,\nbut their reproduction rate was significantly reduced,\nalso meeting the toxicity test standards that EPA\nestablishes. So this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up,\nthat's the same point, though, that Justice Alito made:\nYou're testing that right as it comes out, not as it's\ndiluted in the lake.\nMR. WALDO: No. No, Your Honor, that's not\nright. That's what the solids -- that's the affect of\nthe solids, and that's why, as a result of that, they\nestablished this rule that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I didn't\nunderstand you. I thought you said that the toxicity in\nthe slurry was tested and killed 99 or whatever percent\nof these invertebrates.\nMR. WALDO: They took that slurry, they let\nthe solids settle down in the bottom, and then they\ntested the solids for what effect it would have on some\nfresh water organisms, because they were trying to\ndetermine whether the lake would be able to recover from\ndepositing all these solids into the lake. And they\nfound that it had a very high toxicity level. And so\nwhat they did to try to remedy that was require\ndepositing native vegetation on the top of all of that,\nafter the mine closes. And they are hoping that that\nwill have the effect of letting the lake recover. But\nEPA concluded that it will take decades, if ever, before\nthe lake can recover from that.\nSo this is not some benign wet-sand kind of\ndischarge. It's a toxic slurry with a high pH level and\nwith effects that are going to last for decades. And if\nEPA -- if section 404 is interpreted to allow these\nkinds of discharges to be emitted exempt from effluent\nlimitations, it eviscerates key requirements of the\nClean Water Act. EPA is required to regulate sources of\nthis type through effluent limitations. EPA is required\nto regulate the suspended solids through effluent\nlimitations from industrial sources like this. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, you have this\nmix, and it satisfies -- it goes to an effluent part and\na fill part, in your view, what -- if the statute says\nboth agencies regulate, they have to meet both, one or\nthe other? How does it work?\nMR. WALDO: If there's an effluent\nlimitation, the effluent -- there's a performance\nstandard under section 306. The performance standard\nmust be complied with under section 306(e). And the\nonly way --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say this is 404; it's\nnot 402 --\nMR. WALDO: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It is 306?\nMR. WALDO: 404 is not appropriate here\nbecause there is an effluent limitation. With fill\nmaterial --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is fill.\nMR. WALDO: It's fill material, but it's not\nfill material that is available for a section 404\npermit. And EPA has always regulated discharges from\nsources like this, that meet that definition of fill\nmaterial. EPA has had an effects-based definition of\nfill material since virtually the beginning of the Clean\nWater Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So fill material is only\nthat material as to which no effluent standard applies?\nMR. WALDO: No, it's fill material. In this\ncase, it's fill material, but this fill material is not\neligible for a 404 permit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: 404 material is material\nsuch that it is fill material and there is no effluent\nstandard applicable?\nMR. WALDO: Yes, that's correct. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, it's 95 percent solid,\nbut there's an effluent limitation, and your position is\nthat there can't be a 404 permit; it has to be a 402\npermit?\nMR. WALDO: If it's covered -- if that\ndischarge is covered by an effluent limitation, yes,\nthat's correct. And I want to be clear about this\npoint, that EPA -- well, I guess my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. Finish\nyour thought.\nMR. WALDO: Okay. EPA amended its\nregulations in 1979 specifically to recognize the fact\nthat some discharges of fill material are not eligible\nfor section 404 permits and require NPDES permits. At\nthat time, the regulations said you don't need an NPDES\npermit if it's fill material. EPA amended that\nregulation to say you don't need an NPDES permit if it's\nfill material and it's subject to section 404 of the\nClean Water Act. And the purpose of that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nWaldo.\nMR. WALDO: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, you have\nthree minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: What the Respondents would wish\nto do is to have this Court disagree with the agencies'\ninterpretation of the statutes which they administer,\ntheir consistent interpretations of those statutes, and\nthe factual findings that a whole slew of agencies made\nwith respect to the subject matter of these permits.\nThe preamble of the 202 -- the 2002 fill\nregulations specifically says -- this is 31,135 of\nFederal Register Volume 67 -- EPA has never sought to\nregulate fill material under effluent guidelines.\nNever.\nThere was an agreement, a memorandum of\nagreement between EPA and the Corps of Engineers in\n1986. It is cited at the United States Government brief\nat page 27. The EPA and the Corps agree -- and this is\nin response to your question, Justice Breyer, and I\nthink something Justice Kennedy said and something\nJustice Souter said with respect to what if there are\ntwo things in the stream going into the water. Fill\nmaterial remains subject to 404 permitting even if they\noccur in association with discharges meeting 402\ncriteria. That's the answer to that question. And the\n-- and the EPA --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought -- I thought\nyour brother would say: But that does not respond to\n306 effluent.\nMR. OLSON: 306 provisions in the statute\nare not made applicable to 404 permitting, and the\nconsistent regulatory history from 1973 -- and it's all\nset out on page 27, or summarized on page 27 of the\ngovernment's brief -- are that 301 and 306 are not\napplicable under the 404 process.\nAnd if there was any doubt at all, there is\na -- the so-called mine tailings memorandum at pages 141\nthrough 145 of the joint appendix in which three top\nofficials of the EPA construe what they call the rules,\nthe regulations, and the statute. This is both\nagencies. Under the plain regulation language of the\nrule -- this is page 145a -- under the plain language of\nthe rule and the agency's interpretation of the\nregulation in its preamble, the mine tailings that are\nto be placed into an impoundment are covered by 404.\nAnd it specifically addresses this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why does that mean anything\nmore than you've got to get a 404 permit without\naddressing the question whether you can get a 404 permit\nif it has, in effect, the -- the -- if it has the\neffects which are supposed to be regulated by the\neffluent limitations?\nMR. OLSON: That precise question,\nJustice Souter, is addressed on pages 143, 144, and 145\nof this memorandum from top officials of the EPA,\napplicable to this particular mine and these particular\ndischarges --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where is -- where is that\nin the appendix?\nMR. OLSON: That's on pages 141 through 145a\nof the joint appendix.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But as I read that\nsentence, Mr. Olson, it says they are subject to both\npermitting.\nMR. OLSON: No, it doesn't. It says -- with\ndue respect, Justice Stevens, it says on the bottom of\npage 144: \"As a result, the regulatory regime\napplicable to the discharges under section 402,\" and so\nforth. What -- I think one thing that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You are talking about the\nlast sentence on --\nMR. OLSON: There is a 402 permit in this\ncase, too there is a 404 permit with respect to material\ngoing into the lake and a 402 permit for the material\ncoming out of the lake into the waters of the United\nStates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\n"
