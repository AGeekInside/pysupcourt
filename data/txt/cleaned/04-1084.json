KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court of Appeals decision in this case\ncarves out an exception to the categorical prohibition for\nthe Controlled Substances Act in order to permit\nrespondents to import, distribute, and use a Schedule 1\ncontrolled substance. The Court of Appeals believed this\nexception was justified by the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act in order to enable respondents to use\nhoasca tea, which contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, in\nthe substance, for religious purposes. The court of\nappeals was wrong. RFRA carries forward the compelling-\ninterest test, as set forth in prior Federal court\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I address a preliminary\ninquiry that I have? Are we reviewing here the issuance\nof the injunction by the trial court?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, a preliminary injunction.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And we have to find that, for\nthe trial court to have issued it, it was an abuse of\ndiscretion?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, with respect to certain\naspects of the preliminary injunction question, yes. For\nexample, whether a preliminary injunction should -- is the\nproper remedy if all the other criteria are satisfied.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You know --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the court found evidence\nin equipoise and so on and so forth, so I just wondered,\nat the bottom line, what our legal standard is here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We believe that the Court\nof Appeals erred -- or District Court and Court of Appeals\nerred, as a matter of law, in entering the injunction --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Abused its discretion.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, abused -- a court always\nabuses its discretion if it -- if it commits a legal\nerror. So, that is basically our position here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me your position\nis that you must -- we must give controlling determinative\nweight to the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1. And\nthe respondents say you don't give it any weight at all,\nit's all on a case-by-case basis. Is there a middle\nground that there -- which I think would allow you to\nprevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is\na compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule\n1? It's a rebuttable presumption, but it's a presumption\nthat, when it's in Schedule 1, it's a compelling interest.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- first of all, our principal\nsubmission is that Congress's designation in Schedule 1 is\nsufficient unto itself. But we also do include a further\nsubmission that, if the Court didn't disagree with that,\nthat Congress's -- Congress, in Schedule 1, has said that\nany mixture containing any amount of a listed\nhallucinogenic substance is barred. And there's no\nquestion that this substance contains that. But if the\nCourt was going to look beyond that to the facts of this\ncase, there's also no question in this case that\nrespondents' use of the substance produces the very\neffects that led Congress to put the substance on Schedule\n1. So, to allow the -- to allow the substance to be used\nwould be in direct derogation of Congress's judgment.\nThe disagreement, such as there is, goes not to\nthe -- not to that question. And that's on page 214(a) of\nthe joint appendix -- or the petition appendix. The\nDistrict Court specifically found that those effects are\nproduced. Respondents' argument in the lower courts was\nessentially that those effects shouldn't matter, or that\nthose effects should be ignored. But we think that that's\ninconsistent with Congress's judgment. So, my point is,\nif you go beyond the text of the statute, it shouldn't be\nfor anything more than to -- for the Court to assure\nitself that the effects that caused Congress to list the\nsubject, in fact, occur, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but part of the statute\nis Sherbert and Verner and the test that Congress says we\nhave to apply to its acts here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. But under -- the Act does\nsay carry forward the prior Federal court decisions. But,\nprior to Smith, this Court, on a number of occasions, had\nrecognized the compelling interest in uniform enforcement\nof important statutes that could not function under a\nsystem of individualized religious --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- exemptions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Mr. Kneedler, I think\neveryone would concede that there is a compelling\ninterest, governmental interest, to have the Controlled\nSubstances Act on that level, yes. But then, Congress has\npassed another statute that says all laws shall be subject\nto RFRA -- shall be subject to RFRA. So, we can't just\nlook at \"Is there a compelling State interest for the\ncontrolled Substances Act?\" in a vacuum. We have to take\nwhat was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled\nSubstances Act is made subject by Congress. And I thought\nthe argument was: Is there a compelling State interest in\nthat context? How can there be, given the situation with\npeyote and, \"We're just like the Native American Church in\nthat regard\"?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the argument is not that\nthe Controlled Substances Act is not subject to RFRA. It\nis subject to RFRA. But -- just as it was subject to the\nFirst Amendment's Free Exercise Clause -- and, in this\nCourt's pre-Smith cases, in which the Court -- at least\nCongress understood the Court to have been applying a\ncompelling-interest test, the Court was applying that\ncompelling-interest test to particular statutes under\nwhich individualized religious exemptions would not be\nfeasible, and held, as a categorical matter, that they\nwere not required. The Social Security Act, the tax code,\nthe laws against polygamy, the Sunday closing laws, all\nare -- all of those are ones in which the Court had\npreviously concluded that individualized exceptions were\nnot appropriate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I would understand that if\nthe Government had acted uniformly. But we do have two\nsituations that seem to be like -- the peyote and this\ncase. And if the Government must accommodate to one, why\nnot to the other?\nMR. KNEEDLER: In the peyote exception, Congress\nwas acting under its distinct constitutionally recognized\nauthority with respect to Indian tribes. The Indian\nCommerce Clause specifically authorizes Congress to\nlegislate with respect to Indian tribes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it still shows -- whatever\npower they were -- they were proceeding under, it still\nshows that it's not all that important that nobody be able\nto use a substance banned by category 1. I mean --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whatever power it was under,\nit's a demonstration that you can make an exception\nwithout the sky falling.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I, in no way, think that\nCongress believed that by enacting the special provision\nfor Indian tribes, it was thereby opening the Controlled\nSubstances Act to individualized --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- religious exceptions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe Congress didn't assume\nthat. They probably didn't think about it. But what's\nwrong with the argument?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think what's wrong with\nthe argument is that what Congress did with respect to\nIndian tribes was take a look at that distinct context and\nconclude that, for a variety of reasons -- and,\nparticularly, respecting the autonomous authority of an\nindependent Indian tribe to control its internal affairs\nthis exception applies only to members of recognized\nIndian tribes -- that, in that context, balancing all of\nthe relevant considerations -- not the sort of balance\nunder RFRA --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but balancing all the\nconsiderations under the -- its Indian power, concluded\nthere was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Justice Scalia's point is,\nno matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical\nevidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall. And\nif it didn't fall for the larger number of Native\nAmericans involved who use peyote, and the very small\nnumber using this drug, can't we, kind of, think that at\nleast, \"Well, maybe it's not all that compelling\"?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But that was -- that was a\nspecific judgment made by Congress itself, looking at --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, may I --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- all the factors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may I stop you --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there? Because, correct\nme if I'm wrong, but it was my impression that the DEA was\nallowing an exemption for peyote use by the Native\nAmerican Church before Congress passed the law.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's correct, but that\nwas understood at the -- at -- back in 1970, or back,\nactually, in '65, when that was first adopted, to have\nbeen consistent with Congress's original intent in passing\nthe statute, and the Controlled Substances Act, which\ncarried forward the schedules. But, in any event,\nCongress has now addressed the subject by statute,\nfollowing the enactment of RFRA, following this Court's\ndecision in Smith, and which has brought things into quite\ndifferent focus.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you take it that the\nGovernment was right -- before Congress passed the law,\nthe Government was right to give the exemption to allow\nthat ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you\nget mileage from a congressional act that was passed later\nthan Congress's is saying, \"Executive, we agree with you,\nyou did right.\" But it's not -- you -- I don't see how\nyou can rely on the congressional statute when the\nGovernment was doing this even without a --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- congressional statute.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the statute actually, you\nknow, now gives some firm statutory basis for that\nexception, which may not really have existed so\ncomfortably after this Court's decision in Smith. And\nthere was, it's true, nothing specific in the statute\nbefore. The critical point, though, to bear in mind for\nthe sort of claim that respondents are arguing for here is\nthat it would turn over to 700 district judges a\ndetermination based on particular records, particular\ncredibility determinations, the judgment as to whether --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- an exception --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't that exactly the --\nwhat the Act does? That's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- why they passed it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: With all respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's why we came out the\nother way in Smith, by the way.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but even when Congress went\nback to pre-Smith, again Congress recognized that there\nare certain statutes in -- that serve a compelling\ninterest that would be undermined by individualized\ndeterminations, and the Controlled --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it didn't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- Substances Act --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- say that, did it? I mean,\nit did seem to indicate, after the passage of RFRA, courts\nare supposed to examine, in each case, whether there is a\ncompelling State interest and whether it's closely enough\nrelated.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it -- but that was the test\nthat the Court was applying, as Congress understood it,\nprior to Smith, in which, I repeat, the Court said there\nwere certain statutes that categorical judgments could be\nmade about. And the Controlled Substances Act is such a\nstatute, as this Court recognized in Raich and in Oakland\nCannabis --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- where the Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to stay on this point,\nbecause it's important, but if this were a Schedule 2\nsubstance, would your argument be the same?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Our argument would be the same,\nbut for an additional reason there, and that is that even\nwhere Congress has -- or even where a substance may be\ndistributed and used, it is only for medical purposes,\nwhich is in furtherance of, not in derogation of, the\nhealth and safety purposes of the statute. And even then,\nit is done to very strict -- pursuant to very strict\ncontrols that are really incompatible with sacramental use\nof a substance. There is a requirement of prescription,\nor dispensing by a physician under physician control, with\nrecordkeeping -- identifying the dosage, the amount of the\nsacrament -- recordkeeping of the person who takes it.\nThere is -- there is an incompatibility and potential\nentanglement problem in how to -- in trying to apply a\nsystem like that, even under Schedule 2. But under\nSchedule 1, what you have is contraband, as this Court\nsaid --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose we --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in Raich.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I grant you that\nadministrative considerations are relevant. Of course\nthey're relevant. But that's far from saying they're\ndeterminative. And then we're back to what Justice Souter\nsaid, absolutely relevant in deciding the compelling\ninterest, but the fact that peyote seems to have been\nadministered without the sky falling in suggests that,\nhere, they're not determinative. That's all.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could go back to the\nway the Controlled Substances Act operates, it does not\npermit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on\nindividualized determinations made by individual Federal\nDistrict Courts making their own judgment about how\nserious the risk is. If a substance is going to be moved\nfrom Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, for example, to allow\nmedical use, that is done through a centralized\nadministrative determination involving coordination\nbetween the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the\nAttorney General, in which expert opinions are gotten and\na judgment is made, but the judgment is made only if there\nis an accepted medical use. In other words, there has to\nbe not -- a consensus, not simply an -- a determination by\none religious group or one judge --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that something may be so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- RFRA overrides all that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand RFRA to be -- to\nsay there can be an exception to all Federal statutes\nwhere someone makes a religious objection to compliance\nand, in the judgment of the court, there's not a\ncompelling State interest in the Government going ahead\nwith the statute. So, you know, whatever the scheme was\nunder the drug laws, it seems to me it's subject to this\nnew legislation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: We're not saying it's not subject\nto the legislation, but in deciding how the compelling\ninterest applies under the statute -- just as under the\nFirst Amendment itself, before RFRA was passed, and the\none is to replicate the other -- the court -- there were\ncertain statutes, when the court looked at the way they\noperated and what was necessary to their effectuation, the\ncourt said that individualized exceptions would not be\nfeasible. And there's no reason to believe, and every\nreason to disbelieve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you talk\nabout --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that Congress meant to put\nthat to one side.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reasons to believe\nand disbelieve, we don't have to make a once-and-for-all\ndetermination, do we? A lot of your concerns talk about\nwhat's going to happen if this exception is granted. Now,\nif some of those things come true, can't this issue be\nrevisited? I don't regard -- maybe I'm wrong, but, under\nRFRA, you're not saying it's a compelling-interest test.\nIt may be -- may not be satisfied in this case, but if it\nturns out there's a lot of diversion of the hallucinogen\nor the membership of the church expands in a way that\nleads you to believe it's being abused, I mean, then you'd\nlook at it again, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I have several responses to that.\nThat sort of approach, putting to the test basically a\ncongregation-by-congregation -- or denomination-by-\ndenomination, to use familiar terms -- test about whether\na -- an exception should be recognized for a particular\nreligion, itself, presents difficult questions. If you --\nif you have a particular religious sect that believes that\nit is -- that it is important to invite everyone to the\ntable -- not simply a closed group that has gone through\nscreening, but a -- but everyone to their table --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that would be -- but that\nwould -- that -- the -- a court would be in a judgment\nabout -- in saying that that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't have said it better.\nAnd that's what we said in Smith. But Congress didn't\nlike Smith and has enacted this statute obviously to undo,\nto the extent it can, the effect of our judgment in\nSmith.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, what -- it did not seek\nto undo the judgment in Smith. What the Court was -- what\nCongress was responding to was the -- what it understood\nto be the test. It reinstated the compelling-interest\ntest, but specifically said it was not disagreeing with\nthe outcome of any particular case under that prior test.\nAnd three of those cases -- Hernandez, concerning the tax\ncode; Lee, concerning the Social Security Act; and\nBraunfeld, regarding the Sunday closing laws -- were all\nones that adopted the approach that I have suggested.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- but your\napproach is totally categorical. If you had a group that\nhad, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved\nhere, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your\nposition would still be the same --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Our --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even applying RFRA,\nwhich sets forth a compelling-interest test.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- our principal position would\nbe the same. And I -- and I think that that approach is\nconsistent with Justice O'Connor's opinion in Smith, which\ngot a lot of prominence in the subsequent debate about\nRFRA, because, in that -- in that opinion, even though the\ncompelling-interest test was applied, Justice O'Connor\nconcluded that that test was satisfied because --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But Congress disagreed,\nultimately. They allowed the use of peyote.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And that's an important\npoint. Congress doing it does not open the Controlled\nSubstances Act to the individualized determinations by 700\nDistrict Courts. It makes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- a specialized judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may Congress, consistent\nwith the Establishment Clause, say that we will create an\nexception for peyote, but not for this other church, which\nhas far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has been\nfound to be a genuine religion? The problem of preferring\none religious group over another, it seems to me, arises\nonce there is an exception for the Native American Church.\nAnd I heard you say, \"Well, the Indian tribes are\nspecial,\" but is that -- that's it. It would have to be\n--\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, we think that -- we think\nthat's critical, because what -- just as in this Court's\ndecision in Laurel, what Congress has done is to act to\nrespect the autonomous, independent institutions of the\ntribe. That also meets certain law enforcement concerns,\nbecause you have the tribal government, you have tribal\nlaw enforcement personnel, you have tribal culture and\ntradition that is independent simply of the religion. You\nhave -- you have the entire tribal cultural structure that\nCongress could quite reasonably regard as being different.\nAnd respecting that distinct political attribute of\ntribes under this Court's decision in Morton versus\nMancari, we don't think, creates an Establishment Clause\nproblem. What --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask you one\nquestion about the procedural posture of this case? This\nis an appeal from a preliminary injunction. That's how it\ngot here. And we have been discussing, mostly, the case\njust as though it had been a permanent injunction. The --\nthere are pieces of this case, like the Treaty and what it\nallows and doesn't allow, that -- where the record is so\nthin. Is there a way of dealing with this case so there\nis the full airing that it never got, without resolving,\nat this point, other issues --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you've been debating?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- I -- on that limited point, if\nthe Court applied the usual standards for the granting of\na preliminary injunction, I think that the Court could\nquite readily reverse the preliminary injunction here,\nbecause that requires a clear showing of a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits, plus that the other\nfactors be decided. And with respect to the application\nof the Convention, that's really a question of law. And\nthe United States took the position before the District\nCourt in this case, that the Convention applied to the\ntea. We think it's unquestionably a mixture, and,\ntherefore, a preparation within the meaning of the -- of\nthe Convention, and the -- and the District Court's\ninjunction really puts the United States in violation of\nan international agreement that is critical to prohibiting\ntrafficking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in drugs.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do your briefs --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- indicate, or does the\nrecord indicate, that the Government was foreclosed from\npresenting any evidence it wanted to present? If you, for\nsome reason, go back, and this whole thing is done again,\nwhether they -- is there important additional evidence for\nyou to introduce, or do we essentially have the case in\nfront of us, so far as you're concerned?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- as far as our\nposition is concerned on our submission so far, we don't\nthink the Court needs any further evidence. On the\nquestion of the application of the Convention, as we say,\nwe believe that is a question of law. This Court has long\ndeferred to the position of the executive branch on the\ninterpretation of Conventions. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was a little\nunclear about your position on the Convention. I thought,\nat some -- one point, you said that it didn't really add\nmuch to your argument under the Controlled Substances Act,\nwhich implemented the Convention. Is --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there an independent\n--\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- argument?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, we believe that complying\nwith an international Convention designed to prohibit\ntrafficking in drugs is, itself, a compelling interest.\nAnd the -- under this Court's decisions in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that would be incorporated in\nRFRA. And it -- a -- an order that puts the United States\nin violation of that -- and the Court of Appeals didn't\nreally deny -- a majority of the judges, anyway -- deny\nthat this injunction requires the United States to violate\nthe Convention --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- by facilitating the\nimportation of drugs from outside the country.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you -- here's the\nproblem that I have, particularly at the stage of the\npreliminary injunction, with that argument. The --\nthey're -- the Convention also includes that provision\nthat its terms will be defined, enforced, and so on, in\nharmony, or conformity, with the domestic law of the\nsignatory. Our domestic law includes RFRA. That would\nseem to open the door for, in effect, a RFRA exception.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that exception is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me -- let me just\nfinish my -- let me get to my -- let me get to my question\n--\nMR. KNEEDLER: Sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- before you answer it.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SOUTER: My -- the particular concern I\nhave with that, at the preliminary injunction stage, is\nnot necessarily that that particular argument should, for\nall times, be assessed correctly by the -- by the District\nCourt. But it seems to me that if the District Court at\nleast plausibly reads that exception to negate your\nargument, isn't that good enough, at the preliminary\ninjunction stage, as a basis for the Court saying, \"Look,\nyou haven't -- you, the Government -- haven't carried your\nburden to show the affirmative defense here\"?\nMR. KNEEDLER: This is a -- the interpretation\nof the Convention is a legal question, not a factual one.\nAnd Article 22 refers --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is, there's no question.\nBut we're still at the preliminary injunction stage.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. But respondent would bear\nthe -- would bear the burden of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why does the respondent bear\nthe burden? You have the burden --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because this is to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- under the statute.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- this is a change of the status\nquo. And to require the Government to allow the\nimportation of a substance that's prohibited by the\nConvention. But if I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- if I could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- no, but I realize that --\ncould we pause on that for a second? Because you\napparently take the position -- the Government takes the\nposition that when -- under the governing law, the\nGovernment would have an affirmative burden, ultimately,\nto defend -- in this case, on compelling interest, least\nrestrictive, et cetera -- that, at the preliminary\ninjunction stage, the applicant for the injunction has the\nburden to negate the probability that the Government will\ncarry its burden on the ultimate issue. And I don't see\nwhy that should be so at all.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, at least with respect to\nthe interpretation of a Convention, where the -- where the\nGovernment has taken --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but let --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- just --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- I under- --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- go through --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- I understand the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Get to the Convention --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I understand the broader\npoint, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- later. Get to the general\n-- first get to the general issue. Does the applicant for\nthe injunction have the burden to negate the probability\nthat the Government will prevail in its affirmative\ndefense, ultimately?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that your position?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that is our position, and we\ncite cases in the -- in the brief that say that. But it\nis not critical to the outcome of this case with respect\nto the Convention issue and several other of the issues\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that I -- that I was going to\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Convention --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- issue goes directly to your\naffirmative defense.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It goes -- but it is a question\nof law. And the article of the Convention that you're\nreferring to is -- concerns the penal provisions. In\nother words, Article 7 of the Convention requires each\nparty to prohibit -- this is Article 7, on page 288(a) --\nrequires that -- each State to prohibit these substances.\nTwenty-two simply goes to the criminal provisions that\neach party's State will adopt internally to carry that\nout. But it doesn't -- it doesn't detract from the --\nfrom the categorical obligation under Article 7, which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- would prohibit it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- part of the Treaty question\nthat I had is also -- this is a root that you are -- and\nit contains DMT. And the Treaty doesn't ban everything\nthat contains DMT -- for example, pineapple and bananas.\nThe question is the ratio of the DMT to the entire plant.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that sounds like a factual\nquestion that ought to be developed.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think where you have a\nmixture that -- a mixture of two plants that are put\ntogether for the specific purpose of using them for the\nhallucinogenic purposes, that goes far beyond simply\nwhether a particular substance --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Pineapples, we -- what about\nthose?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I drank pineapple --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Plants --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- juice this morning.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- as such, are not covered. But\nwhen you make a mixture of something for the specific\npurpose of releasing its hallucinogenic purpose --\nqualities, we think that that's clearly covered by the\nConvention.\nIf I may reserve the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say -- I'm sorry.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I was just going to reserve the\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, you want to reserve your\ntime. Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\nMs. Hollander.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY HOLLANDER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMS. HOLLANDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Government's position here, that the Court\nshould completely defer to Congress's generalized finding\nto wholly exempt Schedule 1 of Controlled Substances Act\nfrom RFRA's mandate is fundamentally and structurally\nincompatible with RFRA.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you seem to give the fact\nthat it's listed in Schedule 1 zero weight. It seems to\nme, at the very least, there should be a presumption that\nthis is a compelling interest.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Yes, Your Honor, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when the -- and when the\nevidence is in equipoise, as the district judge thought it\nwould, that presumption, it seems to me, carries the day\nfor the Government.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, the District Court\n-- we give it deference, as did the District Court. Judge\nParker specifically found, contrary to what the Government\nsays, that he began by looking at Schedule 1, and he\nspecifically says -- I believe it's on page 212(a) of the\npetitioner's appendix -- that he had to begin there. And\nhe said, \"This Court must give due regard for the fact\nthat Congress put DMT into Schedule 1.\" But then he\napplied RFRA. And in applying RFRA, he went on to apply\nRFRA and to specifically find that applying RFRA, which\nrequires not only a compelling interest, but a compelling\ninterest to the person, that the Government did not meet\nits burden in this case of showing harm, any risk of harm,\nto these members, or any risk of diversion.\nAnd I'd like to go back, for a moment, to the\nissue of peyote, because, first of all, if you look at the\ncongressional record in 1965, for what that's worth,\nthere's not one mention -- and it's on page -- starts on\npage 480 of the joint appendix -- there's no mention of\nIndian tribes, there's no mention of sovereign issues with\nthe Indian tribes. There's a mention of the Native\nAmerican Church and the First Amendment and why this\nexemption has to be made. And, in fact, our record is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know whether you can be a\nmember of that church without being an Indian?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Yes, sir, we do, Your Honor. We\nknow that. And it is throughout our brief. There's many\nmentions of it, the fact that there have been non-Native-\nAmerican members since the beginning of the Native\nAmerican Church. I would direct the Court to the easiest\none, which is at the joint appendix at page 500, which is\na memo from a DEA legal counsel talking about this. And,\nin fact, at the hearing in our case, on the very last day\n-- it was on November 2nd, 2001, at page 1933 -- Mr. Adam\nZubin, representing the Government, specifically said, and\nI quote, \"The Federal Government places no restrictions on\nwho can participate in the Native American Church.\"\nSo, we have two things. We have the exemption\nin 1965 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your theory would be\nif you had a religious group that -- whose doctrine was\nthat you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want\neverybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that,\nand distributing hoasca, that the Government should be in\na position of saying, \"This religious group can use it,\nbut that religious group can't\"?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, it would depend,\nagain, on the facts of that case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they're the kind of\nthe -- the ones I just gave you. In other words, if\nthere's going to be a greater threat of diversion to --\nit's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and\nlimited group, but it's -- they're -- they aggressively\ntry to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious\nbelief, that we should, in applying RFRA, draw\ndistinctions between the group you represent and that\nhypothetical group?\nMS. HOLLANDER: The distinctions -- yes and no,\nand let me explain, Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice -- the\ndistinction is that if the Government could meet a\ncompelling interest and actually show a risk of diversion\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm assuming they\nshow --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- that they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that there is --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- showed it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- then they would have\ndifferent facts. And the different facts in that case\nwould mean that, in that case, the Government would win.\nNow, I'd like to point out, although I realize\nyou've just presented me with a hypothetical -- however,\nthere are 250,000 members of the Native American Church,\nand the record in our case is that there's never been any\nevidence of any diversion. And, although the Government\nhas --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- think that the Treaty --\nthe Convention entered into in 1971 -- makes clear that\nhoasca is covered, then does that provide a compelling\ninterest for the Government, because it requires the\nGovernment to prohibit the importation? If we think, as a\nmatter of law, the Convention covers hoasca.\nMS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it doesn't,\nbecause, again, the Government has -- we have to look at\nthe Treaty, just like we look at any other law -- RFRA\nclearly says --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we conclude, looking\nat the Treaty, that it prohibits hoasca, covers it, and\nthat it provides that nations that enter into the\nConvention must avoid importation of it, then is that a\ncompelling interest under RFRA?\nMS. HOLLANDER: It may -- yes, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It is?\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- it may be a compelling\ninterest, but it still may not satisfy RFRA, because RFRA\nspecifically requires that it be a compelling interest to\nthe person. And we -- the Government would have to put on\nevidence. And even though this is a question of law, that\ndoesn't preclude the District Court hearing evidence which\nhe has not heard at -- to this point -- put on evidence\nshowing that the -- that the compelling interest the\nGovernment has asserted in this case, which is that it\nwould lose its leadership position in the international\ncommunity, would really be a compelling interest, and that\nit could not be accommodating.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't the compelling\ninterest. The compelling interest is, we signed a Treaty,\nand you follow it. Now, how can you say that the\nGovernment wouldn't have a compelling interest in\nfollowing a Treaty where they -- where they promised to\nban the substance? I mean, they're not -- they're just\nsaying RFRA doesn't apply where that's at stake. Now,\nwhat's the argument against that? You're saying the\nargument against that is, maybe it really isn't a\ncompelling interest? Well, okay. Why not? I mean, it\nsounds to me as if it would be. They have a Treaty. They\nhave to live up to their word, period. What's wrong with\nthat?\nMS. HOLLANDER: There's nothing wrong with that,\nYour Honor. The -- what's wrong with that is that RFRA\nrequires the Government to go further than that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does? All right. That's an\nissue, I guess. I'd have to decide: Is a compelling and\n-- does it require the Government to go further? But you\nconcede that if it doesn't require the Government to go\nfurther, you lose.\nMS. HOLLANDER: If the Treaty does include\nhoasca, which we believe that it doesn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, that's a\ndifferent issue. Why doesn't it?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Why doesn't it? It doesn't.\nAnd the -- and, interestingly, the executive took the\nreverse position that it's taking here throughout the\nhistory of this Treaty until this litigation, and it\ndoesn't cover hoasca, because it doesn't cover plants, or\ninfusions from plants. And that is the position. And the\nreason why the U.S. would not lose its leadership position\nis that that's the position of Brazil, which allows\nreligious use --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whose position it\nis. The language does not admit of that exception.\nThere's nothing in the language of it that would suggest\nthat exception at all. What language do you rely upon for\nthat exception?\nMS. HOLLANDER: The Treaty -- we have to rely,\nYour Honor, on the Treaty as a whole. And what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a whole, anywhere in it --\ngive me language anywhere in the whole Treaty that --\nMS. HOLLANDER: What the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- suggests that exception.\nMS. HOLLANDER: The Treaty that the -- the\nlanguage that suggests that exception is, first of all, in\nArticle 32, that talks about the traditional use of\nplants. It is in the fact that plants are not covered.\nAnd so, a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but a --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- preparation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- solution that includes the\nsubstance DMT is covered, by definition, as I understand\nit. Tea is a solution, and it includes DMT. Isn't that\nthe end of the issue?\nMS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it isn't. And\nthe reason it isn't is, if we look -- several places, one\nis the conduct of our Treaty partners, none of whom agree\nwith that position -- we look at --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong -- can you tell\nme, on the face of it, what's wrong with it? I mean, I --\nif I have tea at 5 o'clock, I think I'm drinking a\nsolution that includes the little things that come out of\nthe tea leaves. And that's what we've got involved here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe our Treaty partners are\njust violating the Treaty.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well, Your Honor, if they are,\nthen we are, also --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Tell me what's wrong with the\nanalysis of the solution?\nMS. HOLLANDER: The --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have specific language from\nthe Treaty's commentary in front of me that supports you.\nAre you not going to read that?\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: I was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: She's not going to read it,\nbecause I asked her for language in the --\nMS. HOLLANDER: In the Treaty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- Treaty. In --\nMS. HOLLANDER: I was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Treaty --\nMS. HOLLANDER: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not in the legislative\nhistory of the Treaty.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: I was -- I was trying to answer\nJustice Scalia's question. But let me say this. And of\ncourse I would read the language of the commentary and the\nINCB and the opinion of our former ambassador, Herbert\nOkun, in Brazil and France. But let me also say, if I\nmay, that the position of the executive, until this --\nuntil this litigation, has been the same. And the reason\nwe know that is precisely what you said, Your Honor.\nMescaline is also covered by the Treaty. Peyote is not.\nThe Native --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- American --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- thought that's\nbecause we made a special reservation for peyote.\nMS. HOLLANDER: No, Mr. Chief Justice. We did\nmake a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet,\nbecause it's never been covered. That reservation, if you\ngo back and look at what the Senate said at the time, and\nwhat -- there are no plants. They're just not listed in\nthe Treaty. The purpose of the reservation was, in an\nabundance of caution, in case it would be -- in case it\nwould be added in the future, then plants, and solutions\nfrom plants, would be covered. But as it stands now,\nmembers of the Native American Church drink a tea\ncontaining peyote and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- mescaline.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying that there are --\nthere's basically an ambiguity in the Treaty, that\nsolutions derived from plants are not covered, but\nsolutions that include DMT are covered, and there --\ntherefore, there is a question?\nMS. HOLLANDER: The -- yes, the ambiguity arises\nbecause what the Treaty means is that if you were to\nextract the DMT and then add it to something, which can't\nbe done here and could have no religious meaning for the\nUDV, and we're not even sure if -- chemically, if it's\npossible. If you were to extract it and then add it, then\nyou would have a solution containing DMT. And that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But solution is defined by the\nnumber of steps in the process that gets the substance\ninto the water? Is that --\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- Your Honor, I didn't write\nthis Treaty, and I -- and I must say --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I'm not blaming you --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- for it --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but I --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: It's not the clear -- the\nclearest writing, but we know -- we know what its meaning\nis, and we do have to look at the travaux, which goes into\nlong detail about why they even mention plants, because of\ntheir fear, in the future, that plants might be covered.\nNow, other plants are covered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- in a different Treaty. But\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I make a suggestion as to\nwhy, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a\ncompelling State interest to comply with the Treaty?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Say yes. Let me him make that\n--\nMS. HOLLANDER: Yes.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: I'm just waiting.\n[Laughter.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was the right answer.\nMS. HOLLANDER: I'm just trying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because I haven't --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- to be polite.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it made. I -- I mean, isn't\nit well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if\nCongress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a\nTreaty, it may do so? Now, if this RFRA can trump a\nstatute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a\nTreaty.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Yes, it can, Your Honor. It can\ntrump the Treaty, and that -- and that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, compliance --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- with a Treaty is not\nnecessarily a compelling State interest.\nMS. HOLLANDER: It is not. And -- but we don't\neven have to go that far, because, if we do the RFRA\nanalysis, the Government must show a compelling interest\nto the person and, in addition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, surely --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- surely RFRA doesn't say\nthat you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in\ndetermining what's a compelling interest.\nMS. HOLLANDER: No. You don't disregard them,\nYour Honor, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And getting back to the first\nquestion that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off\non what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the\nTreaty does prohibit the importation of this substance --\nassuming that -- is there any evidence that the District\nCourt thought that this was a compelling interest?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well, the -- no, the District\nCourt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: None at all.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- analyzed the Treaty\ndifferently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to\nhoasca, for all the reasons that are -- that are in his\nopinion in our brief. And, therefore --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if we disagree with you on\nthe Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't\nreally even address the point whether or not this and/or\nthe statute, together, can be a compelling interest.\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. If you disagree\nwith the District Court on that, then the case should be\nremanded for it to -- for additional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if there isn't a\nfactual question here. I mean, I thought Justice Scalia,\nif it were to be up to him, did take into account official\ncommentaries to treaties. But maybe he doesn't. Anyway,\nI take them into account. And I -- and in respect to\nthat, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants\n-- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance\nclearly distinguished from the substance constituting its\nactive principal -- and the example they give is mimosa\nroot, which contains DMT.\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's true. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then, that's also true of\nthe bananas and pineapples, et cetera. And there's a\ncourt holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one\nin the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a\nTreaty. All right? Now, the Government has come in with\na counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess,\neven mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the\npurpose of extracting DMT. Now, what's the response to\nthat?\nMS. HOLLANDER: The response to that, Your\nHonor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case.\nAlthough the Government said that in their brief, there is\nno evidence of that, and it is contrary to the evidence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it has to be\nextracted at some point to be -- to get into -- I'm right\nhere -- to get into the tea, right? It's extracted by the\npreparation of the tea.\nMS. HOLLANDER: No, Mr. Chief --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The plants are not --\nthe plants are not imported, right? Just the tea.\nMS. HOLLANDER: The tea is imported. But the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- but the tea is made just like\nyou would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and\nthen --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- and then you took the leaves\nout. What you have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- in that tea is a collection\nof a tremendous number of alkaloids. And what the\ncommentary is saying is that you would have to pull this\nalkaloid out. And that would be a chemical process.\nThere's further -- there's further --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I -- if I could\njust go back to the point. You're emphasizing that the\nTreaty doesn't cover the importation of plants. But\nyou're not importing plants, you're --\nMS. HOLLANDER: That --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- importing a mixture\nthat must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't\nhave its effect.\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. However, under\nthe Treaty, it's not -- it's not covered by the Treaty,\nbecause it is not separate. If DMT were separated, then\nit would be covered by the Treaty. And, actually, if you\nlook at the 1988 Treaty, going even farther, and its\ncommentary, the commentary in the 1988 Treaty, which has\nto be read in connection with the 1971 Treaty,\nspecifically defines preparation as the extraction --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, under your --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- of the drug.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- theory, a marijuana\ntea would not be covered by the Treaty.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Not by this Treaty. But that --\nmarijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically\ncovered by the 1961 Treaty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but they're not\nbeing imported, they're transformed into this tea. And\nyou -- saying the active substance isn't there\nindependently, so it's not covered. And that seems to me\nto be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well, the difference, for\nexample, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 1961\nTreaty, it says \"the plant, all parts of the plant,\neverything from the plant.\" It's all covered. What the\n1971 Treaty did was different. And if you read the 1971\nTreaty and the 1988 Treaty and their commentaries, if I\ncan rely on their commentaries, and the International\nNarcotics Control Board, what they are expressing is a\nconcern for the traditional religious and mystical use of\nplants in religion, and that's what they were concerned\nabout, and that's why they didn't put this in, and that's\nwhy they specifically have, in the commentary, that the\nexample of mimosa -- and they also have an example of\npeyote in the same paragraph 12, where they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: About commentary or travaux, I\ndon't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't\ncontradict the Treaty. Do we have any case where we use\nthe -- les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict\nthe language of the Treaty?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Not to my --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what, it seems to\nme, is going on here.\nMS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it's not\ncontradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking\nthis one sentence preparation, and the Government has a\ndefinition of it, for this litigation only, that is\ncontrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is\ninterpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by\nthis executive, which means that the executive's position\nhere is really entitled to no deference; because,\notherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church,\nthe peyote tea, would also be covered.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, as -- I understand the\nTreaty. What the Treaty says is, you can't import\nsubstances listed in Schedule 1. Then you look at\nSchedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says \"DMT.\" And then it has\nanother -- and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if\nyou look at that list and it says \"DMT,\" means what it\nsays: You can't import DMT. It's a drug importation\nstatute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the\nsubstance DMT. Otherwise, we'd have -- throw out bananas\nand -- or mimosa, anyway. And we're not looking to intent\non that. Now, that's a possible interpretation that\ndoesn't contradict anything. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except that you\ndon't import the plants, right?\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. And we don't\nimport DMT. We import a tea that contains an enormous\nnumber of alkaloids. And it was clear in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're in trouble. That's\nharder, then, if it's --\nMS. HOLLANDER: It was -- it's clear --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, the reason you\nimport it is because it contains this particular\nsubstance.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat is correct. However, the Treaty wanted to be -- the\nTreaty writers were very careful to not impinge on\ntraditional religious use. And RFRA -- and there's one\nmore thing that I've been trying to say, and that is that\nRFRA requires not just a compelling interest, but a\ncompelling interest to the person, and it requires least-\nrestrictive means.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean by\nthat. You said that before, too.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Least --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you explain that again?\nYou said a compelling interest to the -- what person?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To the person. To what\nperson?\nMS. HOLLANDER: To the aggrieved person. To\nthis particular --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the compelling interest\nin enforcing it against the aggrieved person. Isn't that\nwhat you mean?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. HOLLANDER: That's right. That's correct.\nBut --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- but RFRA also requires that\nthe Government prove, if it proves a compelling interest,\nto enforce it against the person, and if it gets there, it\nalso must prove that it is furthering that compelling\ninterest by the least restrictive means. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the interest is\ndefined, as Mr. Kneedler did -- that is, these drugs are\n\"No, absolutely prohibited.\" -- then how can you have any\nless restrictive means? It seems to me that you can -- I\nunderstand your argument about a compelling State interest\nhas to be judged in context -- to the person, to this\nchurch. But if Mr. Kneedler is correct that the\ncompelling State interest is that this is a proscribed\ndrug, then there can't be any least restrictive means.\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well, I disagree, Your Honor.\nFor example, other countries that have domestic policies\nhave found ways to accommodate that have not violated the\nTreaty. For example, Switzerland provides needles and\nheroin to its -- to its drug users. And the United States\nhas not objected that this is a violation of the Treaty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about --\nMS. HOLLANDER: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I worry about the general\nproposition we would be adopting if we say, you know, one\nnarrow exception is not a -- doesn't contravene a\ncompelling State interest. What about -- I assume there\nis still a Federal law against bigamy that applies in\nFederal territories. Now, what if, you know, a small\nreligious group comes forward and said, you know, \"We --\nour religion requires bigamy. There are not a whole lot\nof us. We're just a little tiny group. So, we demand,\nunder RFRA, an exemption from this absolute law. Why does\nit have to be absolute? It's just a little tiny\nexception, only a few of us.\"\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At least for now.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: Until they reproduce.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, the analysis would\nbe the same. First, that religion would have to prove it\nwas a sincere religion and meet that burden. And then the\nGovernment could come forward with a compelling interest\nthat -- and the -- and perhaps find the same thing that\nwas found in Reynolds, which was not a strict scrutiny\ncase, but may come out the same way -- the sanctity of\nmarriage, the other issues. And those would be issues of\nfact for a district judge to decide, under his discretion.\nAnd it -- all RFRA does is give every religious\norganization, the minority ones and the majority ones, the\nopportunity to go into court as an aggrieved person and\nmake their claim and see whether the Government can meet\nits burden.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question? It's\na bit tangential just a little bit, but going back to the\nChief Justice's question earlier about diversion? And his\nsuggestion was, if they're -- proselyte the religion, you\nget all sorts of converts who will just use it in the same\nway as the small number use it now. Would that be\ndiversion, or would it be diversion -- diverting it to\nsome people who are not members of the religion?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What does the word \"diversion\"\nmean in this context?\nMS. HOLLANDER: \"Diversion,\" Your Honor, is a\nterm of art here. And I thought I answered it that way,\nbut maybe I was unclear. It means diversion from licit\nuse to illicit use. So, it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but then, getting more\nmembers to -- converted to the religion would not be\ndiversion.\nMS. HOLLANDER: No, it would not be diversion.\nThere would only be a problem if the Government, for\nexample, showed --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- that there was some diversion\noutside. And that's why I used the example of the Native\nAmerican Church; there's never been any diversion.\nI'd like to go back to one other issue that\nperhaps I didn't make clear. What the -- it's true that\nthe UDV does not import the plants. But it's those plants\nthat are sacred to the UDV. It can't substitute them.\nNot only is DMT in bananas and pineapple, but Phalaris\ngrass, for example, that -- and there's a picture of one\nin our joint appendix at about page 518, I believe --\ngrows in this country. A recreational user could just go\nand, you know, mix the Phalaris --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but --\nMS. HOLLANDER: -- grass.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I don't see -- I mean, I see\nI was not right. You do import drums of tea. And they\nsay, in the Treaty, that a preparation is a solution or\nmixture containing a substance. And it would seem to be a\nsolution or a mixture containing DMT. And the commentary\nthat I thought helped you does concern plants, but you're\nnot importing plants. So, now I'm rather troubled to see\nif there is any way that this Treaty is interpreted in a\nmanner that allows you to win. What is it?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well, the -- what the commentary\nsays is that it is not a covered preparation, that an\ninfusion or tea made from the roots of a plant is not a\ncovered preparation, and that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Hollander, may I just, on\nthis point -- it's the same question I raised with Mr.\nKneedler. We're talking about a preliminary injunction.\nYour side, I think, said, \"Go for the permanent\ninjunction. We have a lot more to put in.\" The\npresentation on the Treaty was rather thin, below. I take\nit from Mr. Kneedler's argument that he's saying the\npreliminary injunction, or not, is really the thing. If\nthe Government wins, no preliminary injunction. There's\nnot going to be any show for a permanent injunction. But,\non your side of it, what more would you be putting in?\nLet's say you prevail at the preliminary injunction stage.\nWould you then say, \"See, Judge, now you can enter a\npermanent injunction\"? Or you -- would you be putting in\nmore evidence? And if so, what kind?\nMS. HOLLANDER: Well, we certainly have a great\ndeal of more evidence, Your Honor, that we can put in. We\nhave substantial evidence on the Treaty, and evidence we\nhaven't even talked about here, proving that this hoasca\nis not covered by the Treaty. We have additional health\nand safety evidence. We have additional evidence to show\nlack of diversion. We have additional evidence that Judge\nParker talks about to show targeting of the religion and\nselective prosecution. We have a great deal more evidence\nwe can put on. But, of course, it depends on what the\nGovernment puts on. Because, at this point, the\nGovernment has not met any of its burdens.\nNow, you're correct about the Treaty. None of\nthat has gone on. The Government resisted any evidence\nabout the Treaty, resisted the very best evidence, which\nwas the International Narcotics Control Board's opinion\nthat hoasca is not covered by the Treaty. And we now have\n-- we now have more that we would put on.\nAnd, you know, what the church and its members\nseek is just the right to practice their religious faith,\nas Congress guaranteed them in RFRA. Because Congress\nguaranteed and recognized that religious liberty is a core\nvalue in this country. Two courts below found, on a\nlengthy factual record, that the Government had not met\nthe burdens Congress imposed. This Court should do --\neven if this Court believes that it's a close question --\nshould do then what it did in Ashcroft v. ACLU, affirm the\npreliminary injunction, remand this case for a trial on\nthe merits.\nIf this Court were to do anything less than\nthat, it's really to deny Congress's intent and Congress's\npolicy here, because Congress's policy is that religious\nfreedom, religious liberty, shall not be burdened unless,\nand until, the Government meets its burdens. The District\nCourt clearly found, and said, that the Government did not\nshow a risk of harm, did not show a risk of diversion;\nand, therefore, he found that the Government did not meet\nits compelling interests in this case. And we would ask\nthe Court to affirm the preliminary injunction, remand\nthis case to the District Court.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nHollander.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I may focus first on the question of\nimportation, no country in the world would permit the\nexportation and importation of preparations that contain a\nsubstance listed under the Convention, because the express\nwords of the -- of the Convention prohibit it. And the\ncommentary that is cited does -- all it says it that\nplants, as such, are not covered. The plants themselves\nare not included in the schedule. It then has footnotes\ndescribing how the plants may be used, how -- in a mixture\nor a solution that contain the DMT or some other subject.\nAnd that's precisely the sort of thing that the\nConvention was designed to prohibit. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what -- but what\ndoes that benefit you? I mean -- I guess this is Justice\nScalia's question he asked earlier -- the Treaty is -- it\nseems to me if you're willing to override a duly enacted\nstatute, the Treaty shouldn't have any greater status.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think RFRA does\noverride it. What RFRA does is take the compelling\ninterests that the Government already has in enacted laws\nor treaties, as they are, and then you apply -- you apply\nRFRA to them. And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think the Treaty\ngives you a more compelling governmental interest than the\nControlled Substances Act?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I certainly do. And the two\ntogether, I think, are doubly compelling, because the\nGovernment -- the United States has a compelling interest\nin encouraging this, and section 801(a) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More than doubly. It has to be\ndoubly, plus a little, if you said that one is even more\nthan the other.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's okay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But Congress itself, in the\nstatute implementing this Convention, said it is essential\nto have international cooperation in the protection of the\n-- of the drugs covered by the statute. So, you have a\nstatutory determination that this is critical, anyway.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we have to agree\nwith you, though, that our Treaty partners in this area\nhave, sort of, a zero-tolerance approach to enforcing the\nTreaty.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, not at all. First, the\nUnited -- as a general matter, of course, the United\nStates has a compelling interest in living up to its\ntreaties. But, under this Treaty, in particular, the\nUnited States has to be in a position to go to other\ncountries, maybe countries that are dragging their feet\nabout whether to take enforcement measures, and say, \"You\nhave an obligation to strictly construe this Convention.\"\nAnd if they are able to come back and say that you have -\n- you, yourselves, have not been doing that, that\nundermines the ability of the United States in enforcing a\nTreaty designed to prohibit international trafficking in\ncontrolled substances. And nothing in this Court's first\namendment cases would have suggested that there is a free-\nexercise right --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's actually why I've\nbeen looking. I'm bothered by it, because it -- if the\nTreaty is absolute, we reserve for peyote, which would\nmean the religious use of peyote by the Native American\ntribes is exempt, but other people who have identical\nreligions, use identical substances, they're stuck. And\nthat, it seems to me, is a rather rough problem under the\nFirst Amendment.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One religion singled out. And,\ntherefore, I'm looking for some way in this Treaty not to\nreach that conclusion --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for the constitutional\nreason.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- with respect to peyote, the\nConvention does not allow the importation or exportation\nor international trafficking in any substance that there\nis a reservation taken for. It is a reservation only for\nthe domestic use of plants that are native to that\ncountry. So, peyote cannot be exported or imported under\nthis -- under this Convention. And so, the idea -- so,\nthere's nothing inconsistent with respect to the\nfundamental threshold question of importation, but, even\nso, we think, in Congress's specific Indian power, that\nthat -- that that could be different.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --\nMR. KNEEDLER: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Kneedler, if you prevail,\nwould there be anything left over to be argued about in\nthe -- for permanent injunction?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. In our view, on the -- on\nthe legal -- now, on our principal submission, no, there\nwould not be anything further, because under -- in our\nview, there's a categorical prohibition against Schedule 1\nsubstances. That is the compelling interest. The\nquestion, then, is whether -- as this Court said in Lee,\nand as Justice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion in\nSmith, the question is whether an exception would unduly\ninterfere with carrying out that interest, or whether it\nwould be a least effective -- less effective means, in\nterms of being less effective. And we think there's no\nquestion that any exception to a categorical bar would\nviolate that standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\n"
