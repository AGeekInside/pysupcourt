PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-70\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis Court 32 years ago in Zahn v. International\nPaper affirmed that a class action could not proceed under\n28 U.S.C., section 1332, the diversity statute, if it was\nclear that some of the unnamed members of that class do\nnot satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement.\nThe question in this case is whether Congress in\n1990 overturned this Court's ruling in Zahn and its\ninterpretation of section 1332 not by amending section\n1332 but, instead, by enacting a supplemental jurisdiction\nstatute, section 1367. The answer to that question, Your\nHonors, is no.\nPlaintiffs in the lower courts that have felt\nconstrained to conclude that the language of section 1367\nrequires the conclusion that Zahn and, candidly, also this\nCourt's decision in Strawbridge were overruled by 1367 do\nso by gliding past the express language in 1367(a) that is\nthe primary basis upon which our argument stands.\nIn the appendix 246a to the petition, there's -\nthe central language is in (a). It says, in any civil\naction, of which the district courts have original\njurisdiction. That language by its terms and -- clearly\nindicates that Congress did not mean to make any\nadjustments in the background law that exists that defined\ndiversity jurisdiction or Federal court jurisdiction,\nFederal question jurisdiction as a condition to going\nforward. So what the Congress says is, look at the law as\nit exists in 1990, as it's been interpreted by this Court,\nand then determine whether or not there's Federal\njurisdiction, either for diversity or Federal question,\nand if there is, then you proceed forth from that point.\nAnd what we know is that there are two\nsituations that will not satisfy original jurisdiction\nunder those circumstances.\nThe first one is in the Zahn situation. Where\nyou have both satisfying and unsatisfying plaintiffs in\nthe unnamed -- who are in the unnamed members of the\nclass, this Court said you cannot proceed forth under the\ndiversity jurisdiction.\nThe second one is the classic sort of joinder\nsituation, and what the Court held in Strawbridge is that\nsimply because you have a plaintiff who satisfies the\namount-in-controversy requirement and satisfies the\ncomplete diversity requirement does not mean that you're\nallowed to join under rule 20 an additional plaintiff who\ndoes not satisfy both of those requirements. And if you\nbring someone in under those circumstances, that defeats\njurisdiction at the beginning before you ever took to\ntrying to decide what the scope of section 1367(a) and (b)\nmean from that point forward.\nSo then the question is, if that's the correct\ninterpretation of 1367(a)'s predicate language, then what\nwork does 1367(a) and 1367(b) do, and does our\ninterpretation do any violence to the structure of the\nstatute? And the answer to that is clearly no.\nHere we start by looking at what was Congress'\nclear intent, manifested primarily in the last language of\n1367(a), where it says supplemental jurisdiction shall\ninclude claims that involve the joinder or intervention of\nadditional parties. Here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, before you\nproceed to going on to (b), the -- you have set up a\ndichotomy between a Federal question case where, as long\nas you have a Federal question claim in the case, you\nqualify within those words, of which the district courts\nhave original jurisdiction. But you say that in a\ndiversity case, that's not so if you have people not of\nthe same citizenship -- of the same citizenship on both\nsides of the party line, so that you have to have a\ntotally qualifying action on the diversity side to come\nwithin -- to -- to be within 1367(a).\nBut we have had at least two cases where the\nstarting lineup did not satisfy the complete diversity\nrule. One was Caterpillar and the other was Newman-Green,\nand the Court said, yes, on the day one there wasn't\ncomplete diversity, but that's curable later on, in the\none case before the case was tried, in the other in the\ncourt of appeals. So don't at least those two cases\nsuggest that you can have a diversity case legitimately in\nthe Federal court even though at the outset you don't have\n-- fill all the requirements?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't think that's the\nright conclusion to draw from those cases, Justice\nGinsburg, because what happened is by the time that -\nthose cases got to this Court, the jurisdictional problems\nhad been solved and the Court was faced with a question -\nwith what I perceive to be purely a remedial question, is\nwhat do you do in terms of trying to put the omelette back\ninto the egg at that point when the litigation has gone\nforward. And the Court, as a matter of judicial\nefficiency, decided essentially to ignore the\njurisdictional problem.\nHere, by contrast, this jurisdictional problem\nexisted on day one, and the complaint was filed -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Court said\nthat -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and continues -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Court didn't\nsay they were ignoring it. I thought they said it was\ncurable.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it -- it's curable in the\nsense that you can eventually excise out portions of the\ncase, but what you cannot do is -- is allow the case to go\n-- it remains still jurisdictionally barred to proceed\nforth with parties who are not properly before the court.\nThat's -- that's what this Court said specifically in -\nin Zahn itself. It said the problem is that you cannot\nsimply go forward with the Federal claim and with the\nState claims in that -- in that format. You surely can\nexcise portions of them, but then you start over again.\nOnce you excise them, that's a new complaint. It's a new\ncase. That's the fundamental difference.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't start over in\nCaterpillar.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Caterpillar didn't start\nover and Newman-Green wasn't detected till appeal, but the\nappeals court didn't say start over.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I understand that the Court's\nultimate remedy in both of those cases was not to do a do\nover, but you also have to remember -- I mean, I think\nthere are two questions here. One is do you ignore the\njurisdictional problem. And what I'm proposing to you is\nthis Court has never ignored the jurisdictional problem.\nIt always solves the jurisdictional problem somehow,\nwhether it dismisses the case, as it did in -- in Grupo\nDataflux, whether it dismisses the case, as it -- as it\nproposed would have to happen in Zahn if they didn't\nexcise one of the parties, or whether it makes an\nadjustment. The Court always takes account of the\njurisdictional problem and finds a method of fixing it.\nSo that's the -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why can't it make an\nadjustment in this case, Mr. Phillips.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why can't it make an\nadjustment in this case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- well, the -- and the\nquestion is what adjustment should it make. And the -\nand -- and our argument is at a minimum you have to\ndismiss all of the class claims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why is that the minimum?\nWouldn't the minimum be just to dismiss those parties who\ndon't have the aggregate -- the necessary jurisdictional\namount?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And that takes you back to what\nthe district court ruled in Zahn and -- and, in effect,\nwhat this Court affirmed in Zahn, which is that there's a\nfundamental difference between sort of finding a single,\nindividual plaintiff and saying, you know, this person, if\nyou could just excise that claim, drop it under rule -\nthat person under rule 21, that fixes it. There's a\nfundamental difference.\nI mean, the question here is what's the civil\naction because there are res judicata, collateral\nestoppel -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you do have cases\nwhere a complaint is filed seeking to be a class action\nand then the district judge does not certify the class and\nthe case, nevertheless, goes forward. Now, why couldn't\nyou do that here?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that would -- one of the\nalternatives on the table -- I think it is appropriate -\nis for the Court to excise the class action allegations -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and dismiss the entirety of\nthe class and proceed forth solely in the name of the four\nindividual plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe. Why isn't it\npermissible just to dismiss those parties who don't have\nthe requisite jurisdictional amount? That's what I -\nwhere I stumble with this.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the Court has the\nauthority to do that. I think the practical implications\nof that are overwhelming and should be -- and should be\nrejected for that reason because in order to be able to\nhave res judicata/collateral estoppel effects, you have to\nknow what the civil action is. And with a class of\nunnamed members, who are, in many instances, unknowable in\n-- in some respects, we don't know what the res judicata\nor collateral estoppel effects are if your solution is to\ntry to excise those who do not satisfy the amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't -- I don't follow\nthat entirely, Mr. Phillips, because the -- Exxon lost at\n-- at this trial, and preclusion doctrines -- that means\nthat Exxon had one full and fair opportunity to defend.\nSo Exxon is going to be bound by that -- by the\ndetermination. Somebody who was not in the litigation and\nmight say, well, I want more, say, somebody who had opted\nout -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you'd have the\nsame issue of preclusion problems if you had done the case\nfrom the beginning the way you contend it ought to have\nbeen done.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the case\nshould never have been allowed to go forward except with\nthe named plaintiffs. Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean, Justice Ginsburg's\npoint is you -- you -- even with a -- a few properly named\ndefendants, you're going to have the same issue preclusion\nproblem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- but -- but it's a\nmuch more complicated issue preclusion problem because the\nquestion is, is there jurisdiction? This is a judgment\nthat's been entered without jurisdiction.\ndoesn't have proper jurisdiction here --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if it's under the\nlanguage of section 1367, I think it makes more sense to\nsay the court has original jurisdiction over the action,\nbut lacks original jurisdiction over the defective claims.\nI mean, that meets what 1367 seems to say on its face.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I would -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And I hope you will address\nthe fact that Congress very recently has enacted\nlegislation that makes all this in the future at least\nnon-objectionable.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it doesn't eliminate it\ncompletely, Justice O'Connor. The Class Action Fairness\nAct only applies to claims where there are plaintiffs who\nexceed the number of 100, plaintiffs over 100, and -- and\nthe $5 million amount-in-controversy -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right, and it's not\nretroactive.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it's not retroactive. But\neven prospectively, there will be situations where this\nprecise issue will arise in the future. So there is\nreason for the Court to go ahead and resolve this question\nthat has so badly divided the courts.\nBut, Justice O'Connor, to answer your first\nquestion, I would have -- I would have thought the\nconclusion was exactly the opposite, that what -- what -\nthe statute says you don't have jurisdiction over civil\nactions over which you didn't have jurisdiction prior to\n1990, but you do have jurisdiction over claims that then\ncan be appended to those for which you have jurisdiction\nin 1990.\nSo I would have thought the more sensible way,\nat least from my perspective, to read this case -- to read\nthis statute is to say, is this a claim that could have\nbeen brought in 1990? And the answer from Zahn is\nabsolutely no, it couldn't. And similarly with the -\nwith the joinder cases. They could not have been\nbrought -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Unless 1367 effectively\noverturned Zahn.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It was enacted later.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It clearly was enacted later, but\nmy point here is that I think the language -- when the\nCongress both in (a) and (b) harkens back to in any civil\naction of which the district courts have original\njurisdiction, it's clearly not trying to amend 1331 or\n1332.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's not -- the weakness\nin your point, I think, as I -- as I understand it, which\nis a very optimistic assumption, given the complexity\nhere -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I hope that's not a criticism of\nthe writing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is -- is that you want to\nread (a) as if it applies to arising-under jurisdiction\nand not to diversity jurisdiction. Very simple. Arising\nunder jurisdiction, you do maintain jurisdiction over the\noriginal action. You can add a claim, but as long as\nthere's one good claim arising under, there's original\njurisdiction. Diversity, there isn't.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you add that plaintiff, you\ndon't get the original -- that's not right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, that's not right, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the -- you know, the\ntraditional case. You're from one State, I'm from another\nState, I have a claim against you for at least $50,000, I\nsue you in diversity jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is a civil action of which\ndistrict courts have original jurisdiction.\nSo I've sued you. You have an insurer who's\ngoing -- who -- who lives in the same State I live.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: You bring in the insurer in a\nthird party -- in a third party claim under rule 14.\nOkay? That claim doesn't satisfy the $75,000, whatever\nthe amount-in-controversy requirement is that applies,\nbecause you've got a -- a retention. Okay? Then -- and\nso your -- your claim against them is only for $50,000.\nThat wouldn't satisfy the amount-in-controversy\nrequirement but it does satisfy the supplemental\njurisdiction over claims brought separately.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, in -- in other words,\nin that situation, it's a third party claim by the\ndefendant against another person.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That would be one easy -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's then -- that does\nfall within (a).\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely falls within (a).\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then (b) knocks it out\ninsofar as the plaintiff wants to assert a claim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that person can assert a\nclaim against a plaintiff.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly. That would be precisely\nhow it operates.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that, you say, is the answer\nto what I was going to ask -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Which is?\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which is why didn't they\njust use the word 1331. And the reason they didn't just\nuse the word 1331 is there is a subset of diversity claims\nthat also have to fall within (a).\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I picked one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There's another one that fits -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the other thing, of course,\nis if these three professors who wrote this had -- had\nfigured this out so well, why in heaven's name didn't they\nat least write an article about it so we'd know what we\nwere doing?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, my guess is if they did,\nyou probably wouldn't want to rely on it as the\nauthoritative source for interpreting the language of the\nstatute in any event.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying, Mr.\nPhillips, I think is that 1367 does nothing with regard to\nwhat was in the old days at least 1367(a), what was called\nancillary jurisdiction. It changed pendent jurisdiction\nto overrule the Finley case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Pendent party jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so you could have\nappendant parties, but what was once known as ancillary\njurisdiction, applicable in diversity case, was not\nchanged at all by 1367(a). I think that's what you're\nsaying.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. Actually what I'm\nsaying is that 1367(a), in effect, codifies both aspects\nof the Kroger -- of this Court's decision in Kroger. In\nKroger, the Court said you would have ancillary\njurisdiction over the third party claim that I identified\nfor Justice Breyer, and that that would fall within\n1367(a) under my interpretation of it, but that 1367(b)\nwould not allow the plaintiff then to bring a subsequent\naction against the third party defendant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But whether you -- whether\nyou call it codify or anything else, there would be no\nchange. 1367, as you read it, made no change. 1367(a) on\nthe Federal question side certainly did. It overruled\nFinley. Before, you could have pendent party\njurisdiction. Now you can. But Kroger was unchanged. I\nthink what you're -- you're telling us is that except for\nsome difference in (b), 1367(a) leaves ancillary\njurisdiction as it found it. It doesn't make any change.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The only way I would just -- you\nknow, the only point I would make with respect to that is\nthat I do think that in Finley this Court's opinion cast\nsome doubt on the entire pendent and ancillary\njurisdiction doctrines, and I think that 1367(a) is\nclearly designed to -- to eliminate that issue going\nforward because it says there is a role. There is now a\n-- an express provision from Congress to the courts of\nsupplemental jurisdiction. And then the question is under\nwhat circumstances does it apply.\nSo to go back to the Owen case, you know, we all\nassumed that there was ancillary jurisdiction over the\nthird party claim. This statute makes it absolutely clear\nthat there is jurisdiction over the third party claim\nbecause it -- it extends to that claim. And we know that\nby the express language of the provision.\nIt wouldn't have changed anything if you accept\nthe idea that the Court had inherent authority to do that.\nIf you question that, then this is the basis on which that\njurisdictional grant is provided. And so that is an\nimportant part of 1367(a) that affects -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what -- what is the\nlanguage in 1367(a) that effects any -- any change in\ndiversity jurisdiction, what was once called ancillary\njurisdiction? I don't see that there's any change.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I would go back -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You may -- you may say that\nthere's a confirmation of what was, but there's no change.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it just depends on whether\nyou accept as a given that the third party claim and other\nmulti-party litigation was clearly going to fall within\nthe Court's ancillary jurisdiction without the benefit of\nan express statutory provision granting that authority.\nIf you accept that, then this makes a fundamental change.\nIf I could -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that's what Kroger\nwas about. It said, yes, that you could do it -- that the\nplaintiff then couldn't turn around and sue the third\nparty defendant.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that you did not need\ndiversity between the defendant and the third party\ndefendant.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the -- the question is\nwhat was the statutory authority for that part of -- for\nthe first part of ancillary jurisdiction, which is the\nbringing in of the third party defendant. And that's what\n1367(a) does in the diversity context.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Long. Mr. Long, you\nrepresent the respondent in the second case. Is that\nright?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN 04-79\nMR. LONG: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJustice Stevens, and may it please the Court:\nI have three basic points.\nFirst, section 1367 does not alter the\nrequirements of section 1332 for original jurisdiction in\na civil diversity action, and therefore, the plain\nlanguage of section 1367 does not alter the complete\ndiversity requirement or the requirement that each\nplaintiff in a diversity action must have more than\n$75,000 in controversy.\nSecond, there is no sound basis for\ndistinguishing between the two jurisdictional requirements\nof section 1332, and therefore, if section 1367 alters the\nmatter-in-controversy rule of Zahn and Clark, it also\nalters the complete diversity rule of Strawbridge.\nAnd third, the best interpretation of section\n1367 and the one that causes the least harm is that it\noverturns the result in Finley and otherwise, with a few\nexceptions, codifies the pre-Finley understanding of\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nNow, our -- our primary argument has already\nbeen addressed, and I don't want to waste time on it but\nit is crucial, critical to our argument. And that is,\nthat the language of 1367(a) is that supplemental\njurisdiction is conferred but only in a civil action, of\nwhich the district courts have original jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then you say the civil\naction has to give -- be diverse as to all claims.\nMR. LONG: Well, yes. I mean, basically each -\nas to each plaintiff, they must be diverse from each\ndefendant and each -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Over every claim -- every\nclaim in the class.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, in -- in City of Chicago,\nwe did not give that meaning to the term civil action.\nNow, then you would say, well, City of Chicago is a\nFederal question case.\nMR. LONG: Exactly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then I would say then\nyou're asking us to interpret civil action differently in\ntwo statutes.\nMR. LONG: No, I don't think so. I think what\nthe plain language -- and -- and here we are, I think -\nwe can rely on plain language. What 1367(a) says is that\nin each case you must look to some other statute that\nconfers original jurisdiction. It can be 1331. It can be\n1332. And of course, although those statutes use the same\nterm, original jurisdiction, there are -- there's\ndecisional law that comes along -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but they also use the\nterm, civil action, and it seems to me that your\ninterpretation of the two differs if -- if the City of\nChicago -\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is -- is correct.\nMR. LONG: Well, but I think it's the same\nanswer. Original jurisdiction and civil action are found\n-- each of those terms is found in 1331 and 1332. And I\ndo think it comes out of this Court's decisions that if\nyou have a Federal question -- so you're claiming original\njurisdiction under 1331 -- then yes, that is sufficient to\ngive original jurisdiction over the action. That is what\nthe Court held in the City of Chicago case.\nBut it really can't be the same in a diversity\ncase if, for example, there's going to be complete\ndiversity. What -- what the courts have said that have\nthought that the plain language of 1367 compels this\nresult that Zahn and -- and also Strawbridge go, they say\nlook, the only way we can read this is if there's original\njurisdiction of -- of one claim by one plaintiff against\none defendant, then we've got original jurisdiction over\nthe civil action. Then we're into supplemental\njurisdiction and all we ask is -- is that within the same\ncase of controversy, and then there are some exceptions in\n(b).\nBut -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what you're saying is\nthat this statute, as far as class actions go, changed\nnothing.\nMR. LONG: Well, of course, our case is not a\nclass action, but -- but we would say that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or party joinder, which is\nyour case.\nMR. LONG: Or -- yes, exactly. It carries\nforward the rules of party joinder under 1332.\nStrawbridge is an interpretation of what is now 1332, the\nrequirements for original jurisdiction. There has to be\ncomplete diversity. You can't simply look at one\nplaintiff and one defendant -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Strawbridge has become less\nhallowed in light of the new congressional enactment.\nWhat's it called? The Sunshine in Class Action? What is\nit?\nMR. LONG: I didn't bring -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Class Action Fairness Act.\nMR. LONG: Class Action Fairness Act.\nWell, but I think that in -- in a way it -- it\nshows what Congress -- when Congress means to amend\nsection 1332 and make exceptions to these requirements for\noriginal jurisdiction under 1332 -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I understand in 2005\nCongress doesn't necessarily express what was before, but\nit -- it seems to me there's an institutional judgment\nthat Strawbridge is not that hallowed a -- a principle.\nMR. LONG: Well, I -- I think you could fairly\nsay the -- the new statute reflects a judgment by Congress\nthat in these class actions of national importance, which\nmeet certain requirements, minimal diversity should be\nsufficient. And, of course, that's constitutionally\npermissible. But I don't think there's been any\nsuggestion that in the -- the more run-of-the-mill cases\nthere ought to be simply minimal diversity.\nI mean, there -- there are millions, literally\nmillions, of civil actions filed in State courts each\nyear. About 60,000 end up in the Federal courts on the\ndiversity side of the docket. If even 1 percent of those\ncases moves over to Federal court, that's going to be a\ndoubling of the Federal courts' diversity docket, which is\nabout half the trials.\nSo -- and I don't think there's been any\nsuggestion by Congress -- and, of course, complete\ndiversity and matter-in-controversy are the two rules that\nkeep that from happening. Now, the -- the class actions\nwill be a sufficient -- a significant additional burden on\nthe Federal courts, and to my knowledge, there aren't any\nadditional resources to do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the -- can you\n-- this is something I should know, but I don't know. All\nright. It's very elementary. If you have two parties\nfrom different States, diversity claim, they're in court\nperfectly properly. Now, if somebody intervenes under,\nsay -- say, rule 24 or suppose it's rule 19, a necessary\nparty, and that destroys the diversity, does the -- does\nthe Federal court still have jurisdiction? It does, I\ngather, under rule 14 if the defendant impleads or brings\nhis own lawsuit -\nMR. LONG: Yes, but that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- against a third party. What\n-- what happens under -- that doesn't destroy it, rule 14.\nRight?\nMR. LONG: The way -- the way this was\nunderstood to work -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. LONG: -- and it's in -- and this is the\nanswer to the point that, well, there can never be any\nsupplemental jurisdiction on our view in a -- in a\ndiversity case. Yes, there can because in a variety of\nsituations -- and -- and you've named where there's a rule\n14 third party claim and that's by a defendant -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. What about\n19 and 24?\nMR. LONG: Well, before -- this -- this is\nexactly an excellent example because it's one of the few\nthings that was clearly changed by 1367, and it was\nchanged in the direction of narrowing the -- the\njurisdiction. The understanding was that you could -- if\na party came in on its own under rule 24, said I -- I can\nintervene of right -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. LONG: -- but they were coming in on their\nown -- that was allowed. I mean, this could potentially\nbe a problem under this rationale of Kroger.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you mean by allowed\nthat plaintiff is -- one -- he's from the same State and\ndestroys the diversity.\nMR. LONG: Yes. It would otherwise -\nJUSTICE BREYER: He can do it, though.\nMR. LONG: It -- it would be allowed. That was\nallowed before.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what about under rule 19?\nMR. LONG: Under rule 19, the rule was that you\ncouldn't do it even if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You could not?\nMR. LONG: You could not, and the idea was this\nwas getting too close to the Kroger problem -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And rule 20 you could not?\nMR. LONG: Could not. It was -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And rule 24 you could.\nMR. LONG: The Kroger problem is if you -- you\ncertainly couldn't put in these nondiverse parties in the\ninitial complaint. And of course, Kroger worried about,\nwell, the plaintiff leaves them out and then they come in\nin a second stage, and that's an evasion of completed\ndiversity.\nBut we can see very clearly from subsection (b),\nthis is -- this is one part of the statute that is clear\n-- that the -- it has now been changed so that claims by\npersons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under rule 19\nor rule 24 will not be permitted unless they can satisfy\nthe requirements of section 1332, that is, complete\ndiversity and matter-in-controversy.\nSo this was the kind of thing that was being\nthought about in the statute. The fact that this was\nactually not permitted, clearly not permitted, shows that\nthis statute is very concerned about preserving the\nrequirements of complete diversity and matter-in-\ncontroversy. So I think that's actually a good example to\nfocus on.\nAnother one -- sometimes examples help. In -\nin the Owen -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The difficulty, I guess, is\nthat I'm having is let's imagine rule 19 or 24.\nMR. LONG: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you're saying that is an\ninstance where, if you bring the party in and he destroys\ndiversity, you're out. That was true before this statute.\nMR. LONG: Well, what would happen is -- I mean,\nyou wouldn't get to that stage, Justice Breyer, because\nyou wouldn't let the -- the court would not let the party\nin.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. LONG: And sometimes you have to dismiss the\ncase --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there -- before this\nstatute, there never is going to be a circumstance in\nwhich you bring in a person under rule 19 and diversity is\ndestroyed.\nMR. LONG: Right, because you won't let them in.\nNow, sometimes you'll have to dismiss the entire case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now -- now, this is one\nof the things that mixes me up here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you\nmean, sometimes you'll have to dismiss the entire case.\nMR. LONG: If -- if it turns out that the party\nis indispensable under rule 19.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, is indispensable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then what's confuse -\nnow, we look at 1367(b) and it says the district court\nshall not have supplemental jurisdiction over a claim by\nthe plaintiff against a rule 19 person who is brought on\nthe defense side.\nMR. LONG: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where the inconsistent -- i.e.,\nit would be nondiverse, but you said there couldn't be\nsuch a situation.\nMR. LONG: Well, I -- I may have misspoken.\nWhat -- what is happening here in (b) is that it's\npossible for parties to come in under rules 14, 19, 20, or\n24. We think the reading of that is that Congress wanted\nto allow that. So it's not impermissible, but then if\nplaintiffs want to turn around and assert a claim against\nthem, it's got to be one that satisfies complete diversity\nand matter-in-controversy. And that's to protect the Owen\nEquipment rationale. But then -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Michigan plaintiff against Iowa\ndefendant, necessary party, Michigan defendant, rule 19.\nNow we bring him in. And you're saying before this\nstatute, not going to come in because it will wreck\njurisdiction. Right?\nMR. LONG: I think that -- well, I think that's\ncorrect, if the -- at least if the plaintiff was trying to\nbring it in. You may have got me to a point where I'm not\ngoing to be able to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then I'm\ngoing to stop asking -\nMR. LONG: -- give you the exactly right -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because it's very easy to me\nto reach the outer limit of my understanding.\nMR. LONG: Well, it would be easy for you to\nreach it with me.\nBut -- but the -- the gist of it is certainly if\n-- if the -- if the party is coming in under rule 19 as a\nplaintiff or you can come in as a defendant -- maybe\nthat's the answer. That's -- that's permissible. You can\njoin parties as to plaintiffs or defendants.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You could have before this\nstatute.\nMR. LONG: Right. Let me -- let me try another\nsimpler example. Maybe this one will work better.\nThere are a number of cases that are actually\ncited in the Court's opinion in Owen Equipment, and they\ngive a sort of brief summary of these situations in which\nyou could actually bring in extra parties and claims in a\ndiversity case and the extra parties or claims would not\nbe satisfying complete diversity or matter-in-controversy,\nand yet the original jurisdiction of section 1332 would\nnot be destroyed.\nFootnote 18 of Owen Equipment cites one of these\ncases. It's called Scott against Fancher. It was a Fifth\nCircuit case. There was an accident with three trucks.\nOne of the drivers was from Texas and the other two were\nfrom Oklahoma. So the -- their case was brought in Texas\nagainst the two. The Texas drivers sued the two Oklahoma\ndrivers, so there was complete diversity. It did meet the\nmatter-in-controversy.\nSo one defendant filed a compulsory\ncounterclaim. That was one of the examples, and this is\nall mentioned in Owen Equipment. And that was okay. Of\ncourse, the citizenship would be the same, but no question\nabout whether the amount in controversy was -- was up to\nthe required level.\nAnd they also filed a -- a cross claim against\nthe other defendant, and that was also allowed. And\nagain, no -- of course, now you have two citizens from\nOklahoma. So that would not be complete diversity, but\nthat -- that was allowed. And again, it's because the\ndefendants are bringing in -- this is the language that\nthe Court used in Owen Equipment, that when a defendant is\nhailed into court against its will, then some of these\nancillary claims are going to be permitted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not all. You couldn't\nhave a -- if I remember right, a permissive counterclaim.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The defendant -\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- can have a -\nMR. LONG: And I'm thinking again this all -- I\nthink this all traces back to Owen Equipment in this\nrationale that we're not going to allow evasion of the\nrequirements of complete diversity in matter-in-\ncontroversy by the plaintiff.\nAnd I think there's textual evidence in 1367\nthat this is what Congress was doing. I mean, if you look\nin subsection (b), you can find textual evidence for this\ninterpretation. I mean, first of all, it refers to this\nrule 14 situation, the impleader of a third party\ndefendant. That was exactly the situation that was at\nissue in Owen Equipment against Kroger.\nAnd then it uses this somewhat strange language,\nthis language of claims by plaintiffs against persons made\nparties under these rules. This is what Justice Breyer\nwas getting me tripped up on a minute ago. But the -- the\npoint here is that these people can come in. I mean, this\nlanguage doesn't make a lot of sense if they can't come in\nat all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. They could at least come\nin if the defendant --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- under rule 14 joined another\nperson.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then person X wanted to\njoin --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that part of the action -\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that could be a 19, 20, or\n24.\nMR. LONG: Exactly. Exactly.\nThat's -- and so there is work to be done in\nsubsection (b) even in a diversity case.\nThe only other point I'll make here is that\ncounterclaims and cross claims come in under rule 13 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and there is\nactually rule 13(h) which says very specifically that\nparties may be brought in -- additional parties may be\nbrought in under rules 19 and 20, once you get a\ncounterclaim or a cross claim going. So that is -- could\nexplain why there are these references to rules 19 and 20,\nas well as 14 and 24, in subsection (b).\nI do want to get to the argument that's made by\n-- or the petitioners in our case, which is really -- as I\nunderstand their argument, they accept that there must be\noriginal jurisdiction over the entire civil action, and\nthey accept that that means that there must be complete\ndiversity. But then they say, well, matter-in-controversy\nis really different. It should be treated differently.\nIt really doesn't go to whether the court has jurisdiction\nover the civil action. It only goes to whether it has\njurisdiction over a particular claim.\nAnd we don't think that's tenable. And -- and\nhere would rely on statutory language, and it's the\nlanguage of section of 1332, which sets out the two\nrequirements for original jurisdiction of a civil action.\nStrawbridge is an interpretation of that requirement. To\nhave original jurisdiction over the civil action, there\nmust be complete diversity. Petitioners agree with that.\nThe decisions like Zahn and Clark are an interpretation of\nthe other requirement to have -- to meet the matter-in-\ncontroversy requirement, and to have original jurisdiction\nover the civil action, each plaintiff must meet that\nrequirement. So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we descend from the level\nof parsing the -- the statute to what's going on in these\ncases, in your cases I take it there was an injury to a\nchild.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that qualifies under the\namount-in-controversy.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And her mother or sister and,\nI think, father wanted to come in and -- and bring claims\nthat were entirely derivative of the injured child's\nclaim.\nMR. LONG: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And on your reading of 1367,\nthere's the -- the -- there's no accommodation for that.\nSo you'd either have to have the whole lawsuit in the\ncourts of Puerto Rico or you'd have -- let the child sue\nin the Federal court and the parents would have to bring a\nseparate suit?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, it's not -- it's -\nthat is the rule of Zahn and Clark that has been the rule\nfor many decades. Yes, the problem can be cured by\ndropping some of the plaintiffs. That's a possibility,\nbut you cannot have this piggy-backing, bringing in\nadditional claims that are jurisdictionally insufficient.\nYou can't get around Strawbridge and complete diversity\nthat way, and you can't get around the matter-in-\ncontroversy that way either. They -- they are parallel in\nthe language of 1332.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what a legislature\nmight think, well, now this Finley has -- we've been -\ntaken care of that. And your case looks very much the\nsame in terms of breaking up a lawsuit into two when it\nmakes sense to try it all together. So we think that -\nthat old case should go just the way Finley went.\nAnd the same thing with Zahn because, after all,\nZahn doesn't fit very well with Ben Hur. If you're saying\nthat the Strawbridge rule -- I mean, what really counts is\ndiversity, and -- and Ben Hur says the only named\nrepresentative citizenship counts and yet the amount-in-\ncontroversy, the lesser thing in your view -- every single\nmember of the class has to meet that amount, but only the\nnamed representatives have to be of diverse citizenship.\nMR. LONG: Well, you've made a number of points.\nI wouldn't agree that the matter-in-controversy is the\nlesser requirement. I mean, indeed, in the class action\nsituation, because of Ben Hur, that's the only rule that\nkeeps out additional plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you -- does it make\nsense to have a rule that says we're going to ignore the\ncitizenship of the members of the class for diversity\npurposes, for diversity of citizenship? Only the named\nrepresentative counts. Well, then why shouldn't only the\nnamed representative count for amount-in-controversy?\nThat would have been a rational thing for Congress if they\nwanted to fix that.\nMR. LONG: Well, in -- in the class action\ncontext -- and again, my case is not a class action -- I\nfrankly can't explain how you reconcile Ben Hur and Zahn.\nI think those -- the cases -- for the same -- if -- if the\nrationale of Ben Hur is that the class members are not\nreally parties in the full sense and so we don't need to\nworry about their citizenship, I would think you could\nmake the same type of argument as to matter-in-controversy\nthat as long as the representatives satisfy it, they're\nthe parties in the full or true sense and so that's all\nthat counts.\nBut the Court decided Zahn. There was really no\ndoubt about that. Congress never indicated that it had\nany -- any difficulties with that decision, and it's now\nwell established.\nAnd I think -- the final point I'd just make\nvery briefly is that if you were to interpret 1367 to have\nthis broad effect of opening up diversity actions to\nunlimited joinder of plaintiffs, nondiverse plaintiffs,\nplaintiffs with -- who don't have the requisite amount in\ncontroversy, it -- it really would be absurd, not in the\nsense that doing that on its own is absurd. I don't\ncontend that. But it -- it is not -- it would not be\nrational for Congress to go to all this trouble that it\nwent to in subsection in (b) to rule out all these sort of\nindirect situations where the plaintiffs leave out a party\nin the initial complaint and then wait for the party to\ncome in some other way -- I mean, things that frankly are\nnot likely to happen in a lot of cases -- but then say,\noh, but the -- the doors are -- are wide open under rule\n20, bring in as many plaintiffs as you want right at the\noutset or later on if you'd prefer, don't worry about\ndiversity, don't worry about the amount in controversy.\nThose two things just -- just don't go together.\nThere are -- there are other things about\nsubsection (b) that don't make good sense under the\npetitioner's view. I mean, for example, this is just one\nof them. If you just look at the language of subsection\n(b), it says you shall not have supplemental jurisdiction\nunder subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against\npersons made parties under -- a list of rules -- and then\none of them is rule 20.\nWell, whenever you have more than one defendant\nin a case just named in the complaint, you use rule 20 get\nin more than one defendant. So read literally, that says\nif you had this broad view, plaintiffs can bring in as\nmany additional plaintiffs as they like under rule 20.\nBut on the defendant's side, as soon as you've got a\nsecond defendant in the case, suddenly all this\nsupplemental jurisdiction goes away. Now, that makes\nsense under our view because plaintiffs are not supposed\nto be asserting these kinds of claims anyway. Whether\nthere's one defendant or two, it's the rationale of Owen\nEquipment.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\nMr. Stearns, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE E.

STEARNS: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI believe what's at stake here is whether this\nCourt was serious in the Finley decision, and it's\ninteresting that it was a 5 to 4 decision, in which four\nof you concluded that pendent party jurisdiction was a\nlogical extension of Gibbs and five among you concluded\nthat it was not up for this Court to make that\ndetermination, that only Congress could make that\ndetermination, and in the 200 years of history of the\nFederal courts that had preceded Finley, that the track\nrecord of this Court and the lower courts in expanding\nFederal jurisdiction had been a rocky one. But you\nweren't going to do it anymore.\nNow, that wasn't the first time this Court had\nsaid those words, we're not going to do it anymore, but it\nwas said in a way that got somebody's attention. And if\nthere was a surprise, it was within a year Congress did\nprecisely what you asked them to do. They adopted 1367,\nand they did it in the way that Congress does things.\nIt's better not to watch. They don't necessarily explain\nit carefully. They don't do it in an organized and\ncomprehensive way. It is a matter that was of great\ninterest to a small number of people and of no interest to\nthe great body politic. Let's face it. Diversity\njurisdiction is of great interest to you and me; it's of\nlittle interest to the people until they're hauled into\ncourt and find that only part of their case can be there.\nAnd when we look at the history of Federal\njurisprudence, what do we see? We see that the history of\nthis Court has been largely to allow defendants hauled\ninto court to ignore rules that we once thought were\nsacrosanct, for example, the notion of destruction of\njurisdiction. And in law school we all learned about\ndestruction of jurisdiction. It doesn't apply. When a\ndefendant is brought into court, we ignore Strawbridge.\nWe did because this Court and other circuit courts said\nyou could. And incidentally, when they're brought into\ncourt, they're brought into the same civil action as any\nplaintiff or defendant in the original complaint.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you talking about a claim\nmover? I'm not -\nMR. STEARNS: Any claim, Your Honor, that's\nbrought in in a third party practice, any claim that's\nbrought in an additional party claim is part of the same\ncivil action. There's only one form of action. All the\nclaims are in that one form of action.\nThe importance of this, incidentally, is that\ntheir entire argument depends on interpretation of the two\nwords, civil action. Does the district court have\noriginal jurisdiction over a civil action if the civil\naction includes claims over which there's clearly original\njurisdiction and claims where there is not?\nNow, historically -- incidentally, Exxon has to\nbasically make new law, and they do it by saying that Zahn\nstands for the proposition that there's no jurisdiction\nover a class action which includes smaller claimants. I\n-- I dare you to read Zahn and find those words. They\ndon't exist. All Zahn says, all Snyder said, which\npreceded it, is that every class member's claim must be\nviewed individually. Now, that's a very interesting\nconclusion. In other words, it doesn't say there's no\njurisdiction over the class action. It simply says the\nclaims of the absent class members who don't meet the\njurisdictional amount should be dismissed.\nNow, interesting, look at the language in 1332.\nIt says the district courts shall have original\njurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in\ncontroversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000. Well,\nwhen we read that statute and we apply Zahn and Snyder, we\nsay civil action doesn't mean the aggregate of all claims.\nThere we say what it means is we must evaluate each\nindividual claim to determine if each individual claim\nwithin the civil action meets the jurisdictional minimum\nof the diversity statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I imagine that if you filed a\nclaim and the plaintiff was a class and the class\ncontained a number of people who did not meet the\njurisdictional minimum and they file a claim against a\ndefendant in a diversity suit, I imagine the first thing\nthe judge would say would be, I've read Zahn and we don't\nhave jurisdiction over this action.\nMR. STEARNS: Indeed. That was prior to the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that was prior to the\nstatute.\nSo -- so they say, well, that's what the judge\nwould have said, and moreover, if you had not a class\naction and you had three plaintiffs and one of them was\nfrom a different State than the defendant and the other\ntwo were not, the first thing the judge would say is, I'm\nvery sorry. There is not complete diversity. I do not\nhave jurisdiction over this action.\nAnd so I take it their point is by coincidence\nor not, that's what this statute says.\nMR. STEARNS: I'd -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And since that's what the\nstatute says, that's what it means.\nMR. STEARNS: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It means that this kind of a\nsituation does not fall within 1367(a) because there was\nnot jurisdiction over that action.\nSo I agree with you that those words are what\ntheir claim depends upon, but what is the answer to that\ncontention?\nMR. STEARNS: Isn't it interesting, Your Honor,\nthat what drove 1367 was this Court's decision in Finley?\nAnd what's interesting about the argument that Exxon makes\nhere is that Finley discussed the words civil action. And\nin fact, what Finley said in civil action is rejected, the\nvery argument Exxon makes here -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Finley happened to be\nan arising-under case, and in an arising-under case, as\nlong as there is one claim that arises under, there is\njurisdiction over the action.\nMR. STEARNS: Justice Breyer, I -- I agree\nthat -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, if you agree\n-- and I'm -- when I'm saying these things in such a\ndefinite tone of voice, they reflect deep insecurity\nbecause I -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEARNS: Let -- let me tell you -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- but I -- I want to know\nwhat is the answer to that point.\nMR. STEARNS: Well, I -- I was going to agree\nand disagree. I agree that Finley was a Federal question\ncase. That, however, doesn't go to the point of what this\nCourt said about the words, civil action. What you said\nwas the 1948 recodification came relatively soon after the\nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which\nprovide that there shall be one form of action to be known\nas civil action. Consistent with this new terminology,\nthe '48 revision inserted the expression, civil action,\nthroughout the provisions governing district court\njurisdiction. And what the Court held is there's no\nmeaning to those words, especially when the revision is\nmore naturally understood as stylistic. So the words,\ncivil action -- and when you look at 1332, which is what\nZahn is based on, if their interpretation of the words,\ncivil action, was correct, then Zahn was wrongly decided\nand Snyder was wrongly decided.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stearns, there's a\ndifference. It's not just style. There's a difference\nbetween a claim and a civil action. A civil action can\nbundle several claims.\nMR. STEARNS: Indeed, Your Honor, but if their\nargument was correct, that the civil action bundled the\nclaims, as they suggest, then Zahn was wrongly decided.\nThen the amount in controversy in Zahn was the totality of\nall the claims. In other words, to preserve Zahn, which\nconcluded that the civil action word means an individual\nanalysis of every claim within it, to preserve that\nconclusion, they have to argue the opposite conclusion\nthat the words, civil action, mean all the claims are\naggregated. The problem with that argument is that the\nhistorical practice of this Court -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think they -- what -- the\nargument that I heard was not that all the claims have to\nbe aggregated, but that they can't get in the door.\nMR. STEARNS: Their -- well, Your Honor,\nrespectfully, Congress created two doors. And they have a\n-- a door which is the door that existed under the\nConstitution, which is Article III jurisdiction. You can\ncome in as a diversity plaintiff into -- into the\ncourthouse. Now, Congress says there's another door.\nCongress went through and cleaned up 200 years of Federal\ncourt jurisprudence.\nAnd incidentally, it is anathema to law\nprofessors who have written books and tomes and lectured\nto law students, Your Honor, who don't understand what\nthey're reading. The notion that in 1367 in one page,\nCongress could write down everything you needed to know\nabout supplemental jurisdiction is horrifying to a host of\nlaw professors --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I don't see -- where I'm\nstarting from this -- because at some point I'd like you\nto get to the -- the virtue of their position in my mind\nat the moment is, one, it is consistent with the language,\nwhich says civil action, not claim. Two, it is consistent\nwith the only instruction I read that any legislator gave\nto the people who were writing this, staff, namely, write\nsomething that's noncontroversial. And third, I can, on\ntheir interpretation at least, I believe at least late at\nnight, make sense out of all the words in these three\ndifferent sections.\nMR. STEARNS: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So at some point, I would\nappreciate your addressing that.\nMR. STEARNS: Well, and I appreciate that, Your\nHonor, because let me start with the first premise.\nThree law professors didn't write this article\n-- didn't write this language. That's incorrect. The\narticle is written by a subcommittee of the Federal Courts\nStudy Committee that was chaired by Judge Posner. Judge\nPosner is the author of one of the decisions that affirms\nthe -- has the same view as the Eleventh Circuit. Judge\nPosner had a member of his subcommittee, Mr. Kastenmeier,\nwho was a Representative who just so happened to be\nchairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee that\npresented this language.\nWhat happened -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal -- the Federal\nStudy Committee was divided on Zahn issues.\nMR. STEARNS: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They -- they didn't make a\nrecommendation one way or another on it.\nMR. STEARNS: That's partially correct, but\nsignificantly incorrect, Your Honor. The subcommittee\nspecifically said Zahn was wrong and wrote language to\noverrule Zahn.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, and the whole committee\nsaid we do not want to take a position on Zahn.\nMR. STEARNS: Respectfully, Your Honor, you have\nto follow it through. The subcommittee said we intend to\noverrule Zahn. The words in this statute were written by\nthe people who said we intend to overrule Zahn.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought the --\nMR. STEARNS: It goes to the full committee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I thought the committee\nreport said we do not intend to overrule Zahn.\nMR. STEARNS: No. Actually the subcommittee\nreport said we did, of the Federal Courts Study Committee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did not the House committee\nreport say we do not intend to overrule Zahn?\nMR. STEARNS: What the House committee -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did it? Am I correct or\nincorrect?\nMR. STEARNS: The House report -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct or -\nMR. STEARNS: -- yes, said we do not intend to\noverrule Zahn, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right, and that was also the\nsame report that was filed in the Senate proceedings as\nwell.\nMR. STEARNS: Well, it is the report that was\nfiled in the Senate. It has a footnote that says we don't\nintend to overrule Zahn or Ben Hur --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. STEARNS: -- which I think everybody has\nconcluded are mutually exclusive positions, but that's\nwhat it said.\nBut, Your Honor, respectfully, we now know,\nbecause they've all written Law Review articles, that the\npeople that wrote the House report, because they've said\nit, wrote those law -- wrote those words because they knew\nthat the language did overrule Zahn and they didn't want\nto achieve that outcome.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think -- I think you're\noverstating what they say in the article.\nMR. STEARNS: Well, Your Honor, respectfully,\nwhat we do have is undisputed fact here because if you see\nJudge Weis' conclusion, for example, Judge Weis is one of\nthe people who has adopted one of the opinions opposing\nour view of -- of this position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He was the chair of the -\nMR. STEARNS: He was. And Judge Weis, even in\nhis own opinion, acknowledges that his subcommittee that\nwrote the language intended to overrule Zahn. And so what\nhe says is -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you sure he said that?\nMR. STEARNS: He does, Your Honor, and what he\nsays is -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where did he say that?\nMR. STEARNS: He says it in a footnote, and he\nsays he was -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In a footnote to what?\nMR. STEARNS: To his opinion in this -- in the\ndecision. It will take me a second to find it. His\nopinion in the Meritcare v. St. Paul. In a footnote, he\nacknowledges -- what he says is he was upset that -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's in an opinion written\nafter the statute was adopted. Right?\nMR. STEARNS: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. What\nhe says -\nJUSTICE BREYER: When he did this thing -- when\nhe was trying to write this statute, he seemed fixated on\none thing, Kroger, and -- and (b) seems to reflect an\neffort to make -- put in statutory form Kroger.\nMR. STEARNS: To put it in context, the\nsubcommittee of the Federal Courts Study Committee says\nZahn is bad law and doesn't make any sense, which by the\nway, respectfully, I think it is.\nSo then you go to the full committee. The full\ncommittee -- Judge Weis doesn't like diversity\njurisdiction at all. He wants to abolish all diversity\njurisdiction. They make no recommendations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but they do say in no event\nshould the enclosed materials be construed as having been\nadopted by the committee.\nMR. STEARNS: Precisely. That's the point he\nmakes in his footnote. He acknowledges what the\nsubcommittee did. But it's -- it's important to know\nRepresentative Kastenmeier was a member of this\nsubcommittee. The Federal Courts Study Committee is not\nCongress. It's merely an advisory body.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stearns, one of the\nthings that we do know was that Congress intended to make\na modest change. They had their eye on Finley. They\nwanted to overrule that. And if there's an ambiguity,\nisn't a court well advised to make the least change?\nMR. STEARNS: Well, let's take those points.\nThe answer is you make the change that Congress says in\nthe statute you should make. And so when you have an -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- if you have a\nstatute with a clear meaning, I agree with you, but this\nstatute seems to be a bit of a muddle. And if you could\nread it in two different ways, then why don't you say,\nwell, I'll pick -- if they're both plausible, I'll pick\nthe one that doesn't introduce any radical change, that\njust makes a minor change?\nMR. STEARNS: Your Honor, respectfully, if we\nlook at the changes that were adopted in 1367, not a\nsingle one of the ones you're hearing argued today anybody\ncan seriously argue are significant. For example, the\nZahn issue. Zahn has no material significance on\nlitigation in the Federal courts. And why is that? It's\nbecause most plaintiffs don't want to be in Federal court.\nThese plaintiffs are different.\nAnd incidentally, by the way, this is not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it does -- to the\nextent that Strawbridge is involved, it -- it is -\nMR. STEARNS: Your Honor, respectfully, this\nCourt has been looking the other way on Strawbridge for\n200 years, and what Congress did was ratify some of your\nprevious abrogations of Strawbridge and they made another\nminor adjustment. And you know what it -- what did they\ndid is, again, consistent with 200 years of friendliness\nto defendants in Federal court. The whole notion of\ndiversity jurisdiction -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. On your last statement,\nI -- you -- something that I hadn't focused on.\nMR. STEARNS: The whole -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you just -- you said it\ndoesn't make any difference. I thought it's the\ndefendants who want to be in Federal court.\nMR. STEARNS: Indeed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they can't remove the\naction unless it could have been there in the first place.\nMR. STEARNS: Precisely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, this\ninterpretation, if you're overruling Zahn, would have made\na big difference because it would have meant the\ndefendants could have brought a lot of cases into Federal\ncourt by the removal, and you would have seen the\nplaintiffs bar up in arms if, in fact, this provision\nwould have allowed for easier removal.\nMR. STEARNS: Your Honor, respectfully -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As -- as indeed they were in\nthe Class Action Fairness -\nMR. STEARNS: Yes. I was going to get there,\nYour Honor, but in fact, Your Honor, respectfully, I hate\nto disagree with Your Honor, but I believe you're\nincorrect. Is that what you see in the Class Action\nFairness Act, for example -- and we filed it in our brief\n-- the House and Senate committee reports which discussed\nthis case and the fact that the majority of circuits of\nthe circuit courts have agreed with our view -- there has\nbeen no class actions of any materiality filed. In fact,\nthey made the note in 1999 or '97 more class actions were\ncertified in one county in Illinois than filed and\ncertified in the entire Federal system.\nAnd the reason they said that is because most\nplaintiffs lawyers, notwithstanding Zahn -- it isn't -\nZahn isn't the issue. Snyder was the issue. It's\naggregation that's the issue. All plaintiffs lawyers had\nto do to avoid removal is simply put named plaintiffs that\ndon't meet the jurisdictional standards for diversity,\ncreate imperfect diversity, have amounts in controversy of\nless than the amount in controversy required, and then\nthey could never be removed. So Zahn is simply a\nfootnote, and it got it -- all the billing of Zahn, Zahn,\nZahn -- the reality is the predecessor to Zahn, which is\nSnyder that says that you can't aggregate under 1332 the\namount in controversy, that was the significant decision.\nAnd what Congress has now done a few weeks ago\nis to take up the Snyder case and has overruled Snyder.\nAnd what they've done is to say, when there's an aggregate\nclaim of more than $5 million, it goes into Federal court.\nBut look at what Congress has said. Look at -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They haven't overruled\nSnyder. They said in this class action context if you\nmeet the standards that they set, you can aggregate.\nMR. STEARNS: But Snyder was a class action case\nthat says you cannot aggregate claims under 1332. And so\nwhat Snyder says is because -- because the Class Action\nFairness Act is restricted to diversity cases or diversity\ntype cases, what it says is that -- and, therefore, is an\namendment to 1332. What it does is add a new section to\ncreate original jurisdiction in diversity cases involving\nclass claims.\nAnd incidentally, the significance of that in\nthis case is -- Justice O'Connor, you said is it\nretroactive. The answer is yes and no. It's applicable\nto all cases filed after its effective date, which is\nalready effective as of a couple weeks ago. If Exxon gets\ndismissal of this claim and gets it refiled, we will be\napplicable to the Class Action Fairness Act and be right\nback in Federal court where we started. And so what\nyou're left with is all they're really looking for here\nnow is a new trial, and this is just a procedural game to\ncome back.\nBut there's very -- one important point I want\nto make to you. You said in Finley we're going to not\nmake -- do this with jurisdiction anymore. We're going to\nask Congress to do it. And Congress did it. And so you\nread 1367 and, respectfully, it is clear. Every court\nthat read it at a certain point said it was clear, and the\nonly ambiguity is created by a House report that says,\nnotwithstanding what it says, we meant something else.\nThat's -- the ambiguity is not created by the statute, but\nby an -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not a direct quote of\nthe House report, I might find out.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEARNS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I say that's not a direct\nquote of the House report.\nMR. STEARNS: I paraphrased, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STEARNS: What we're left with here in this\ncircumstance is that -- that what -- by the way, what you\nclearly have in the legislative history is -- for example,\nthey obviously made a comment, a joke about what this\nCourt will do when you look at the plain language of the\nstatute and the history that they put in it.\nAnd by the way, these three gentlemen did not\nwrite the statute. It should be perfectly clear. They\nwere there observing what was going on when it was going\non.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think they were being\nintellectually honest in their Law Review or do you think\n-- accuse them of something other than honesty in what\nthey said?\nMR. STEARNS: Justice Stevens, I think whether\nit is or not, it demonstrates the mistake of relying upon\nsomething other than what's in the plain language of a\nstatute because once you begin to encourage that kind of\ngame to be played, then how would you have a trial over\nwhether these professors were being honest or not? What\ndo we know? They did write Law Review articles and they\ndid pretty much admit what they did. Now, I may have a\ndifferent take on it than someone else.\nBut what are we doing here? These -- these\nplaintiffs filed this lawsuit in Federal court. They\ndidn't go to Madison County, Illinois to sue one of the\nlargest companies in the world. They didn't go to a\nfriendly State court forum. They read 1367 to say, okay,\nwe got original jurisdiction here under 1332 of the civil\naction, and we read civil action, because we just read\nFinley and Finley says civil action are just words of art.\nIt doesn't mean what they say it means. So we filed in\nthe Federal court and through the second door come these\nsupplemental claims.\nAnd the supplemental claims are -- are -\nincidentally, so it's perfectly clear, in a class action\ncontext under rule 23, the named plaintiffs represent\nthemselves and they assert their own claims, all of which\nwere within the jurisdictional minimum, and they represent\nthe claims of unnamed class members who they have\njurisdiction over those claims through the exercise of\nsupplemental jurisdiction.\nAny way you cut it, this case -- all it is is\ncome back again and try it again. It's been in the\nFederal courts for 14 years. 14 years. Enough. It's\nover. They were found guilty. Judgment should be\nentered.\nAnd incidentally, that last point. They want to\nreverse a judgment. There is no judgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you agree that if\nthey're right on the interpretation of 1367, the judgment\nhas to be reversed?\nMR. STEARNS: There is no judgment, Your Honor,\nbecause the district court was well aware of the issue\nthat existed here, notwithstanding his disagreement with\nsome other courts, and he refused to enter judgment until\nthe claims process went through where it was determined\nwhether each claimant was above or below the\njurisdictional amount. And so what he did in doing that\nwas to -- there is no judgment entered and he said, I'm\nnot going to enter final judgment until this process is\nover. And every single case -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me modify the question.\nDo you agree that if they're correct, the entire action\nhas to be dismissed?\nMR. STEARNS: There's no case that is -- that\nwould support that outcome, including the cases they cite.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your answer is no, I gather.\nMR. STEARNS: The answer is no.\nNewman-Green doesn't say that. Caterpillar\ndoesn't say that. No reported case says that. No\nreported case has ever found jurisdiction destruction in a\njurisdictional amount case ever in the annals of Federal\njurisprudence.\nAnd when people -- you invite people to look at\na statute, you invite Congress to write one, and people\nlook at it and read it, they ought to be able to rely upon\nit and not what some staff person put in the back door in\na legislative report that's inconsistent with the words of\nthe statute itself.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Stearns.\nMr. Ayer, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-79\nMR. AYER: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWe have a little bit different view I think of\nthe statute than the other counsel arguing this morning.\nWe -- we believe that the statute actually makes quite a\nlot of sense, and we also believe emphatically that it\ndoes not reverse the complete diversity requirement.\nI think the clearest indication of the\nincorrectness of Mr. Phillips' and Mr. Long's position is\nthe comparative treatment under their reading of the\nFederal question case that is in Federal court and the\ndiversity case. Under their reading, it's perfectly clear\n-- and I think everyone agrees -- that -- that when\nadditional claims, as in the City of Chicago case, are\njoined with a Federal question case and they are -- they\nrelate to the same subject matter, that it will, in fact\n-- they will be within the supplemental jurisdiction.\nMost importantly, for purposes of this comparison, they\nwill not destroy the original jurisdiction over a civil\naction even though they are claims that are not themselves\nwithin the original jurisdiction.\nSomehow or other, the argument is advanced that\nwhen you have a diversity case in Federal court where all\nparties are diverse and there is the jurisdictional amount\nsatisfied and you bring in other parties who do not\ndestroy complete diversity and therefore do not destroy\nthe jurisdiction of the court over the initial matter that\nwas before it -- somehow or other the argument is advanced\nthat the jurisdiction over the civil action in that\nsituation is destroyed even though it is not destroyed in\nthe Federal -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't know what you mean\nwhen you say they -- they don't destroy complete\ndiversity. You mean that the original plaintiff and the\noriginal defendant are still who they used to be?\nMR. AYER: No, no. No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nI -- I must have misspoke. What I mean to say is that -\nthat in the case where a -- a diverse additional plaintiff\ncomes in to bring a claim -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're talking about\ngeographical diversity -\nMR. AYER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- not jurisdictional.\nMR. AYER: Correct. I'm -- I'm drawing -\neffectively what -- the point I'm making is that this\ndistinction between the Federal question case joined with\ncases that are not within the original jurisdiction and\nthe diversity case, which is clearly within the original\njurisdiction, because all parties are diverse, but it is\njoined with claims that are below the jurisdictional\namount, so that they are not within the diversity\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't understand the\ndistinction that you're making between diversity of\ncitizenship and amount in controversy since 1332 includes\nboth. To qualify for diversity from the very beginning,\nyou have to be of the opposite -- you have to be from a\ndifferent State than your opponent and the matter in\ncontroversy must be X. And that's always been part of the\ndiversity -- diversity jurisdiction. There were two\ncomponents. One was the citizenship of the parties. Two\nwas the amount in controversy.\nMR. AYER: Correct, Your Honor. The -- the\nquestion -- I think the difference is that the concept of\ncomplete diversity, which this Court for 200 years has\narticulated as in the statute that grants diversity\njurisdiction is a relational concept. In order to\ndetermine whether you have jurisdiction over any parties\nin a case, you must look at all of the parties in the\ncase.\nWith regard to amount in controversy, it's\nperfectly clear, and -- and 1367 changes nothing about the\nfact that 1332 jurisdiction requires meeting the amount in\ncontroversy. But if 1367 has conferred, as it has,\nsupplemental, additional jurisdiction, then the question\nthat has to be asked is, does the fact that a party coming\nin with what is otherwise a supplemental claim -- does -\ndoes the presence of that party destroy the original\njurisdiction that exists where the new party coming in is\ndiverse but doesn't meet the jurisdictional amount?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they're saying what's\nsauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If it does\nin the amount, it does so in the -- if it's -- if -\nyou're trying to drive a wedge between the geographical\ndiversity and amount.\nMR. AYER: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they say you can't do that\nunder the statute. If you're prepared to say that\nbringing in a new plaintiff from the same State as the\ndefendant does destroy diversity over the original action,\nyou must also be prepared to say that bringing in a new\nplaintiff who only has $3 at issue destroys the original\njurisdiction because there's no way, in terms of the\noriginal jurisdiction and the wording of 1332, to make\nthat distinction.\nMR. AYER: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you respond to that what?\nMR. AYER: I -- I will. Well, I will. I'll\nrespond in terms of the City of Chicago. City of Chicago\nis a case where you have issues, claims within the Federal\nquestion jurisdiction. Additional claims in the case\narise under State law. They are not within the Federal\nquestion jurisdiction, but they are related to the same\ncase or controversy. The Court said, with no difficulty,\nboth for purposes of 1367 and for purposes of 1441, that\nis a case within the original jurisdiction. It's a civil\naction. In both statutes, the same language. It's a\ncivil action within the original jurisdiction. And -- and\nif that is the case, in a Federal question case -- I think\nI want to -- I'm going to get to the important point here.\nThis Court has many, many decisions and many\nother courts have many decisions saying emphatically that\nwhen you add a party or when there is a party in a case\nwho destroys complete diversity, the court loses\njurisdiction over the entire matter. To my knowledge, the\nlast time the Court said it as a holding was in the\nSchacht case a few years ago. There are, I think, dozens\nof cases from this Court. We cite about five of them on\npage 24 and 25 of our blue brief.\nThat is a fundamental principle and it is\nbecause the concept of complete diversity is a relational\nconcept. It depends on who the parties are in the case.\nAs has been said many times, the requirement of amount in\ncontroversy is individual. The fact that a party submits\na complaint and the complaint has one party, as in our\ncase, whose claim comes within the diversity jurisdiction\nand includes other parties who we agree their claims do\nnot come within the original jurisdiction -- does the fact\nthat those claims are all put on the same piece of a\npaper, put on a complaint, does that mean the court, the\ntrial court, lacks jurisdiction over the first claim as to\nwhich all the requirements are met?\nThere are no nondiverse parties here. We have\ncomplete diversity. We have a claimant who meets the\njurisdictional amount. We have a civil -- a civil action\nwithin the original jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you could say the\nsame thing about -- about a -- a second claim that\ndestroys diversity. You could say the same thing. Does\nthat -- does that -- does the absence of diversity in this\nsecond claim destroy the diversity that existed in the\nfirst claim?\nMR. AYER: Well, it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, no, I doesn't. I mean,\nthe diversity that existed in the first claim is still\nthere.\nMR. AYER: Well, I'll -- I'll give you an\nexample of a situation that is often trotted out as a\nproblem under our reading of the statute, and we think -\nthe irony of it is, I think, none of the parties actually\nthink it's a problem, and I certainly don't, and that is,\nthe problem of a rule 20 plaintiff who is not listed in\n(b).\nBut let's just say a -- a plaintiff comes in and\nfiles a -- a complaint. There is complete diversity.\nClever plaintiff says, aha, here I am. I've gotten\nthrough (a). We're in court. Now, I'm in (b) and I am -\nI'm a rule 20. I'm going to add some rule 20 plaintiffs,\nand I've got these folks who are not diverse and we're\ngoing to bring them in.\nWell, we -- we have cited cases, I think on page\n33 of our brief, where it's perfectly clear that no court,\nI think, in its right mind is going to turn around 2 weeks\nlater and say, oh, you got me. You know, we're going to\nhave to let these nondiverse plaintiffs in. We're going\nto have to go forward with this case because you did it in\nthe right order. If you had filed it all in one\ncomplaint, you'd be out of court, but you're a clever guy\nand you filed it in two different steps. So supplemental\njurisdiction. You come in.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly, but that's the reason\nfor saying that -- look, as I understand it -- and this is\n-- the -- the thing that got me thinking they may have a\npoint here is A, B, and C are dealing with three separate\nproblems. The first problem is how to overrule Finley\nwithout affecting anything else like Zahn or any of the\nothers.\nMR. AYER: Well, we -- we disagree with that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The second problem B is simply\nKroger. B is how to make statutory Kroger.\nAnd C is United Mine Workers v. Pennington to\nmake sure they have discretion to get rid of supplemental\njurisdiction.\nNow, once you see it as three separate problems\n-- I know they wanted me to see it this way, but once you\nsee it as three separate problems, the words fall into\nplace as long as you do interpret that word, civil action,\nto mean, well, there is no jurisdiction over the civil\naction where what's happened is you've simply added as a\ndefendant a nondiverse party or you've added as a\nplaintiff a nondiverse party or a party that doesn't meet\nthe jurisdictional amount.\nNow, I spell all that out because I hope in the\nnext 15 minutes you will tell me why that's wrong.\nMR. AYER: Well, I -- we agree entirely with the\nfirst part of what -- what Your Honor has said. We -- we\nagree completely that the complete diversity requirement,\nwhich has been articulated so many times, means that when\nyou bring in a -- a nondiverse party, it destroys\njurisdiction. There is not a single case from this Court\nor that I know of any other court that states that the\njurisdiction over the original action is destroyed.\nOne of the things that was said here very -\nsomewhat cleverly this morning is that in Zahn the -- the\ncase was not allowed to go forward because of the presence\nof these other parties. That isn't what they said. Three\ndifferent times in Zahn the Court said these parties must\nbe dismissed. There is no jurisdiction over these parties\nwhose claims are small. They are out. No one ever said,\noh, my goodness, we're going to lose jurisdiction over the\ncase. Every time this issue arises in the context of -\nof complete diversity, the court says, oh, my goodness, we\ndon't have jurisdiction. We can't hear any part of this.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Ayer, let -- maybe I'm\ngoing to oversimplify to the point of the absurd but let\nme try it.\nThe argument that you're answering is the\nargument that there is no textual basis in (a) to\ndistinguish the geographical diversity requirement from\nthe amount-in-controversy requirement. Your answer is, I\nthink, that when the drafters in (a) refer to action and\njurisdiction, those terms have to be understood\nhistorically as we have understood them, and the\nsignificance of a -- a geographical problem, which does\ndestroy jurisdiction traditionally, is different from an\namount-in-controversy problem which is -- which does not\nand is dealt with more simply. Is that your -\nMR. AYER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. AYER: That is correct.\nAnd -- and I would just like to go on and say\none other thing, and that is, this Court has written how\nmany hundreds I don't know, but hundreds of cases\narticulating nuances -- and -- and I've learned how\nremarkable they are, the nuances -- of law under 1332 and\nunder what amounts to a case within -- it's incredible how\ncomplex the law that this Court has spelled out is under\n1332.\nOur view of the statute is that that body of law\nhas been preserved and it's been preserved in two places.\nIt has been preserved in the first clause of 1367(a),\nwhich is really all that's at issue right here, and it's\nalso been -- been preserved in the last clause of 1367(b)\nwhich says that -- that as to the list of enumerated\nexceptions -- in essence, (b) says if you've got a case\nwithin the original jurisdiction, then it says, with\nregard to plaintiffs' claims against parties joined under\n14, 19, 20, and 24 and with regard to claims brought by\npersons to be joined under 19 or 24, then you don't have\nsupplemental jurisdiction if to do so would be\ninconsistent with the requirements of jurisdiction under\n1332.\nWhat does that mean? That means that those\nexcepted claims may not come in if they could not have\nbeen brought in the case originally without destroying\noriginal jurisdiction under 1332. It can't possibly mean,\nas our opponents I think read it, that the only time you\nhave supplemental jurisdiction over these claims is when\nyou already have 1332 jurisdiction over these claims.\nThat isn't supplemental jurisdiction. It would make\nabsolutely no sense to read the statute that way.\nSo how do we read it? We read it to say if\nthese are claims whose presence in the case at the\nbeginning would have destroyed the anchor that gets us\ninto court, which is a case under 1332, then the whole\nthing goes out the window.\nAnd furthermore, I would say -- and again, this\nis not an easy point to spell out in all of its nuances,\nbut at any point in the case, which will not be many and\nwon't be often -- but at any point in the case where this\nCourt's cases would say that you just lost jurisdiction\nunder 1332 -- and I say that's not often because basically\nthere's a time of filing rule and there are many, many, as\nyou all know better than I -- there are many nuances as to\nwhat exceptions exist to that and what don't. But the\nbottom line is if the case falls out of 1332 jurisdiction,\nsuch as when the clever plaintiff tries to join a rule 20\ncompadre to come in and bring a nondiverse claim, goodbye.\nYou're out of court because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: See, that -- that's what I\nthought was their view of -- of (b). To go to (b), you\nunderstand (b), you have to go back before Kroger. And\nKroger was worried about some clever plaintiff, as you\nsay -\nMR. AYER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- getting a defendant. He\nknows this defendant is going to bring a third party\ncomplaint against Smith from the same State, and he says,\nha, I'll sue this defendant.\nAnd analogous things happen with rule 19 and 24,\nnot really with 20 they said, but 19 and 24. And then\nKroger says, hey, you can't do that.\nMR. AYER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so (b) was Judge Weis'\neffort to make sure that was codified. It wasn't really\nmeant so much as some kind of exception from (a).\nMR. AYER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was meant to have an\nindependent basis there.\nSo I didn't see, if you give it an independent\nbasis, how anything odd happens -\nMR. AYER: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- by giving it their reading.\nMR. AYER: Well, I -- I just think that the\nwhole statute makes a very great deal of sense. I mean,\none question is, does the first clause of (a) -- is -- is\nthat a gate you have to get through and once you get\nthrough it, you're done? I think the answer is no. I\nthink -- I think clearly you've got to have a case within\nthe original jurisdiction under 1332, and if you lose it,\nthe supplemental jurisdiction is a tail that falls off.\nIt -- it goes away.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Ayer, may I ask\nyou a question on your interpretation? I think you were\n-- your position is that Clark against Paul Gray has been\noverruled, and whatever one may say about the attention\nthat was focused on Zahn, Clark against Paul Gray has been\non the books since 1939. And it seems unlikely that\nCongress would have overruled that without even making a\npeep to that effect.\nMR. AYER: Well, Clark, of course, is a Federal\nquestion case. Clark is a case at -- at the time when\nthere was an amount-in-controversy requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It's about an amount\nin-controversy rule.\nMR. AYER: Right. I -- I understand, Your\nHonor. I -- I think -- I mean, I -- I would -- it seems\nto me that at the end of the day, we have to say that the\nstatute did what it did, and -- and if -- if it reversed\nZahn, it seems to me that it certainly reversed -\nreversed Clark, and frankly, we think the conclusion is\neasier for all of the reasons based in the statute.\nOne thing I would like to do before -- before\nthe light goes off here is -- is talk a little bit about\nthe legislative history. And of course, our position\nfirst -- in the first instance is that there really isn't\nany reason to consider it because this is not a statute\nthat destroys complete diversity. It doesn't do anything\nradical. It actually is quite sensible and limited and\nclear when you read it. So we don't think you need to go\nto it.\nBut if the Court is going to go to it, we would\nsubmit that there is a far more sensible way of thinking\nabout the legislative history than grabbing one sentence\nout of the House report, which I'll talk about in a minute\nas to what significance it really has anyway.\nBut essentially the sequence of events here -\nand I'll try to go through it quickly -- is that you -\nand as Mr. Stearns said, you have basically three versions\nof this -- of this enactment. The last one got tweaked a\nlittle bit at the end.\nThe first version is the -- is the subcommittee\nreport. And as he indicated, the subcommittee report,\nwhich actually appears at page 14 and 15 of our brief, of\nour yellow brief -- if you read the text of (a), which\nappears on page 14, what you see is language which on its\nface clearly does reverse Zahn, and then you have the\ncommentary that went with it in the working papers to the\nsubcommittee, and that commentary could not have been more\nemphatic of -- of the intent to reverse Zahn.\nThe second enactment, which we have put in an\naddendum to our yellow brief because it, frankly, plays\nlittle role in the case in -- in thinking through the\nstatute, is the section 120 of House Resolution 5381. And\nessentially when Congress -- it's quite correct that the\nFederal Courts Study Committee did not specifically\nendorse the subcommittee proposal. It passed it along,\nsaying it wasn't taking a position. When it got to\nCongress, from somewhere a new enactment came forward onto\nthe floor or onto the committee that was addressing it,\nand that's this provision in the addendum of our yellow\nbrief. And all I'm going to say about that is that when\nyou look at that, number one, it looks entirely different.\nNumber two, it actually does a much poorer job of\npreserving complete diversity, and it does, in fact,\nexplicitly overrule Owen Equipment v. Kroger.\nJudge Weis came in and testified and said,\nthat's bad, don't do that. You know, you've got to show\nmore respect for complete diversity, and -- and you\nshouldn't do that. That got put into the ash can. So\nthat's the end of 120.\nAnd the next thing he did, attached to his same\ntestimony, was -- was submit a proposal, which is in our\nyellow brief at page 16. And this -- this is what we said\nwe think you should enact. If you compare the language of\n(a) with the language of (a) in the enactment on page 14,\nyou will see that it's a couple lines longer. It has a\nfew more embellishments and words, but it is substantively\nindistinguishable, the provision in (a). And so what we\nhave is Judge Weis putting forward a proposal that can't\nbe substantively distinguished from the one that the\nsubcommittee said, clearly correctly, would reverse Zahn.\nThe last question here is what happened then,\nand what happened then to provision (a) -- there are\nessentially three things that happened to this whole\nprovision that I'm aware of. One is they took out the\nwords, on a claim, and that's the argument that's\nprincipally advanced here. They took those. So it's\ncivil action on a claim. They took out on a claim. They\nalso changed the last clause of (b) and they also changed\nthe reference in the supplemental jurisdiction from case\nor -- from -- what is the -- the transaction or occurrence\nto case or controversy. And those are all the changes.\nWe would submit that there is no basis to infer\nfrom any of those things, and particularly not the first\none that dealt with (a), that they meant by dropping on a\nclaim to somehow say, oh, my goodness, you've got to have\njurisdiction over all of the claims before you.\nAgain, that is inconsistent with the Court's\nopinion in City of Chicago. You can't come out the same\nway in City of Chicago if the presence of a\nnonjurisdictional claim destroys original jurisdiction\nover the civil action.\nThe last thing I -- I want to say about the -\nthe jurisdiction which the other side relies upon -\nessentially it's a sentence that says there was no intent\nto, quote, affect the jurisdictional requirements of 1332\nin diversity-only class actions. And then there's a cite,\na footnote to Zahn and Ben Hur. That's pretty much what\nthere is that they talk about.\nWell, number one, as has been said, the authors\n-- apparently the authors of that language, the ones who\nput it in conceded that this legislative history was an\nattempt to correct an oversight in the statute, which it\nwould have been better to have corrected in the statute.\nWe think that's significant.\nBut I would go beyond that and say that if you\njust look at this language, no -- no intent to affect the\njurisdictional requirements of 1332 in diversity-only\nclass actions, number one, most importantly, we don't\nthink there's been a change in the requirements under\n1332. As I've said before, this statute engrafted this\nCourt's entire body of 1332 jurisprudence in the first\nline of -- of clause (a) and in the last line of clause\n(b), and so it's all there. No one has changed 1332.\nThis is supplemental jurisdiction additional to it.\nAnd secondly, this is not a class action.\nThere's nothing in our case that relates to a class\naction. That's an issue, if you think this is relevant,\nyou have to deal with in -- in the other case, but you\ndon't have to deal with it in our case.\nI guess the last thing I would say about\nlegislative history is that we think probably the most\nimportant legislative history here, other than the\ntracking of these provisions, which we think is quite\nindicative, is -- is that the -- the House report, among\nother things, also said that what they were trying to do\nwas to provide, quote, a practical arena for the\nresolution of an entire controversy. And we think that in\nthe context of our case, as -- as has been pointed out\nhere already by Justice Ginsburg, it makes very little\nsense to resolve our case by splitting it in two and\nsending it to different courts.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Ayer.\nMr. Phillips, you have another 4 minutes, and I\nsee that will be adjournment time, I will let everyone\nelse know.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-70\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank -- thank you, Justice\nStevens, and I'd just like to make a few points.\nFirst of all, Justice Kennedy, you asked about\nthe City of Chicago case, and Justice Ginsburg said this\nsort of feels like a Finley type case in the -- in -- in\nhow it applies in the diversity context. But the\nfundamental point here is that there is a very different\napproach and there has always been a very different\napproach to Federal question jurisdiction and to diversity\njurisdiction. Federal question jurisdiction has always\nbeen claims-driven. Diversity jurisdiction has always\nbeen party-driven. And the Congress that enacted 1367 in\n1990 had to have understood that. It's been the law for\nas long as -- as we've had -- for the 200 years that\nStrawbridge has been around, that distinction has -- has\nexisted.\nAnd so we're not asking the Court to interpret\ncivil action differently in this particular statute.\nWe're asking the Court to focus on civil actions of which\nthe district court has jurisdiction. That incorporates\nall of the requirements of 1331 and 1332.\nSecond, Justice Breyer, I'm a little reluctant\nto get into this rule 19, rule 24 to try -- but I think I\ncan help at least clarify at least some aspects of it.\nRule 19 by its terms excludes situations that\ndefeat jurisdiction. So it says in the rule that if\nyou're bringing in a necessary party -- remember, this is\nthe defendant who is bringing in a necessary party -- if\nit would defeat jurisdiction, you can't do it, and if it\nstill is indispensable, you have to dismiss the entirety\nof the case, which is precedent for the notion that\nsometimes you have to dismiss the entirety of the case in\nsituations where you don't have jurisdiction over a\nparticular party.\nBut the -- the second question, rule 24. I\nthink the standard is that you could bring in a rule 24\nparty within supplemental jurisdiction that doesn't defeat\nanything with respect to the original civil action. I\nthink that was the rule prior to 1367. But to the extent\nit was or wasn't, I think 1367(a) and (b) combine to allow\nthat to happen. (b) then says that if someone intervenes\nas a party, the plaintiff cannot bring a claim against\nthat -- that intervening party.\nJustice Souter, you asked about the different\ntreatment between the amount-in-controversy requirement\nand the geography requirement. If there is a distinction\n-- and I don't think this provision allows any kind of\nmeaningful distinction between the two as it applies in\nthe 1367 context -- it is that the amount-in-controversy\nrequirement is more important. That's what Zahn held.\nYou can dispense with the geography requirement in Ben\nHur, but you cannot dispense with the amount-in-\ncontroversy requirement. And the reason -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This didn't make a whole lot\nof sense.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, except it does because the\n-- the amount-in-controversy requirement keeps a lot of\nsmaller cases out of Federal court that otherwise would be\nin there. It is a protection of this Court's docket and\nall the Federal courts' dockets, and that's important.\nAnd that's also a distinction between the Federal question\ncases and the diversity cases.\nIf you resolve diversity in favor of driving\ncases to State court, you are promoting federalism\ninterests because State courts should decide law. If you\ndrive more cases into Federal courts under Federal\nquestion, that's right because you think Federal courts\nare, in general, better suited to resolve Federal courts\n-- Federal questions.\nAnd then finally, with respect to the remedy,\nJustice Ginsburg, Newman-Green says you can simply excise\nsome parties if there is no prejudice. And what I submit\nto you is we have a case that has been litigated from day\none without jurisdiction involving more than 1,000\nplaintiffs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- this point was not -\nwould be you're asking us to decide it in the first\ninstance. You, I would expect, make argument to the\ndistrict judge when you go back.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, except that this Court in\nDataflux didn't send it back. This Court in Dataflux\ndecided that the right -- in Grupo Dataflux that the right\nanswer is that the remedy for this mistake is the\ndismissal certainly of the class, but I think frankly the\ndismissal of the entirety of the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's because the\nCourt conceived of there -- there being one entity, so you\ncouldn't -- you couldn't change -- split that one entity\ninto two fictitious persons.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's -- and that's what\nthe district court held in Zahn, which is the reason the\ndistrict court didn't allow this case to come -- didn't\nallow this to go forward as a class action. And that's\nimportant to remember. This Court didn't say you dismiss\nout anything in Zahn. Zahn came up without it being a\nclass action. The district court dismissed the class\naction. It came up trying to reinstate it. This Court\nsaid you can't reinstate it.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nThis -- these cases are submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
