LERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about the plain text of the\nFAAAA express preemption clause and the continuing\nvitality of this Court's decision in Castle v. Hayes\nFreight Lines.\nI'd like to start by showing why the Port's\nrequirements here fall within the text of the statute\nand cannot be saved by any market participant exception.\nThe FAAAA provides that no State or\npolitical subdivision of a State may enact or enforce\nany law, regulation, or other provision having the force\nand effect of law related to rates, routes, and services\nof a motor carrier. The only statutory language at\nissue here is the force and effect of law requirement.\nAnd the Port's actions have the force and effect of law\nunder any reasonable interpretation of the phrase.\nThe Port is imposing binding standards of\nconduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a\nchannel of interstate commerce. The Port is enforcing\nthose requirements through criminal penalties -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the Port\nsaid we don't apply criminal penalties which come from\nthe tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor\ncarriers. They made that representation, so I think we\nhave to accept that as being so.\nMR. LERMAN: They -- they did make that\nrepresentation and we could accept that, but it's\nirrelevant because the Port is still imposing the\ncriminal penalties on the terminal operators. And when\na State is imposing criminal penalties, that is classic\ngovernmental action, the State acting in its sovereign\ncapacity, regardless of whom the penalties are imposed\nupon. And in this Court's decision in Roe, it made\nclear that States could regulate trucking activity\nthrough penalties, in that case civil penalties, imposed\nonly on people who do business with truckers.\nHere, the State's requirements are coming at\nthe truckers from both ends. On the one end, you have\nthe criminal penalties imposed on the terminal operators\nto coerce their conduct and exclude truckers. On the\nother hand, you have the tariff which puts conditions on\naccess to the Port of Los Angeles, which is a key\nchannel of interstate commerce.\nSo the Port's requirements here have the\nforce and effect of law in spades, because using -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I break down your\narguments into two components, if you might? Whether or\nnot the market participant exception exists at all; and\nif it does, how far does it go?\nSo, let's get to the first question in my\nmind. Seems almost impossible for me to believe that\nthe States couldn't require someone to put a little\nplacard like you get at the -- at almost any building\nthat you go into to park your car. They ask you to put\na little placard in the front of your window so they\nknow who you are and where you're going in the Port,\nokay?\nWhy is the placard requirement here any\ndifferent than that requirement generally? Because if\nyou enter property, you have -- most people tell you put\na placard in the window to tell us you got permission to\ncome in.\nMR. LERMAN: It's -- it's different in this\ncase, Your Honor, because -- in addition to the overlay\nthat 14506 specifically targets identification\nrequirements, and -- and for purposes of this case,\nit's -- but I understand -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But even if that, if we\ndidn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State\nsay: When you come into the terminal, you just got to\nput a little placard in so we know that you're not\nparking here overnight when you've already been unloaded\nor something else?\nMR. LERMAN: I think you need to look to the\nparticulars of this case, and the -- and the fact is\nthat the placard requirement here is codified into an\nordinance, it's backed by criminal penalties, and it's\nrestricting access to a channel of commerce. Because we\nhave all those factors here, it has the force and effect\nof law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the terminal say,\nwe have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can\ncome and unload here?\nMR. LERMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they have to take\ntrucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift?\nMR. LERMAN: Heavy is a different scenario,\nJustice Sotomayor, because there's an express exception\nto the FAAAA for weight and size restrictions. So\nCongress carved out a series of exceptions for the FAAAA\nfor safety requirements, which gets to part of your\nquestion, for height and weight and size limits, for\nrequirements pertaining to the transport of\nnonconsensual goods and the like. It did not create a\nproprietary exception. So a lot of Your Honor's\nconcerns may well be covered by one of these other\nexceptions.\nBut there is no exception for a proprietary\naction. If it has the force and effect of law and it\ndoes not fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to\nthe statute, then it is preempted under the terms that\nCongress used.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though -- even though\na related statute did -- did make an exception for\nproprietary action, isn't that right? The FAAAA?\nMR. LERMAN: The ADA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The ADA.\nMR. LERMAN: Yes, that's quite right, and\nprecisely because that statute contained an exception\nand this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted\nthe FAAAA, it copied the ADA, and it copied the express\npreemption clause, but it -- Congress chose not to\ninclude that proprietary exception.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why, why\nCongress had a different regulation for ports and for\nairfields?\nMR. LERMAN: I don't believe the record -\nthe legislative history doesn't show why. But Congress\nthought, clearly copied the statute and made the\ndecision not to include it.\nSo by the terms of the statute, Congress\nwrote a statute that preempts any action with the force\nand effect of law, and it chose not to carve out an\nexception for proprietary action which, as you say, Your\nHonor, was included in the Airline Deregulation Act.\nSo that just lends added force to the\nargument that the Act here does not contain an unstated\nexception, an exception that Congress has created not\nonly for the ADA, which is the express model for this\nAct, but in a host of other statutes where Congress\ncarved out specific exceptions for proprietary actions.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except in Boston Harbor,\nwe said that there was a presumption in favor of it\nunless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary.\nMR. LERMAN: Well, Boston Harbor spoke to\nexpress or implied indication of congressional intent.\nHere there is express indication of congressional\nintent, which is an express preemption provision\ndictating the term -- the scope of preemption. And\nBoston -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Boston Harbor was implied\npreemption, right?\nMR. LERMAN: That's correct, Your Honor, it\nwas implied preemption. There was no express preemption\nclause to construe, and that language is in the context\nof an implied preemption case. Here, as Justice Scalia\nnotes, we have an express preemption clause, and we have\na clause that has carveouts for a lot of things, but it\ndoes not have a carveout for proprietary action. And\nthat is -- that is the best evidence as Congress has\nintended.\nThis Court has stated, when there's an\nexpress preemption clause, the plain language of the\nclause defines the scope of Congress's intent. And here\nthe plain meaning of the clause covers actions as here\nthat are backed by criminal penalties and impose\nconditions of access to a key channel of interstate\ncommerce.\nThat is the very definition of force and\neffect of law. The Port is invoking the full coercive\npower of the State to impose conditions on motor\ncarriers, and that is exactly what Congress sought to\nprevent. Congress sought to prevent State actions that\nimpede the free flow of trade or that would result in a\npatchwork of requirements from jurisdiction to\njurisdiction.\nThat is what the Port's doing here. It -\nit conflicts with Congress's objectives and it falls\nwithin the text of the statute. And it cannot be saved\nby virtue of a market participant exception that, by\nRespondent's own admission, is untethered from the text\nof the statute itself for the reasons that we've\ndiscussed. Congress made quite clear what it wanted to\nexcept from the broad scope of preemption, and this\nCourt has reinforced the breadth of preemption, and did\nnot include -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we need to get into\nthe market exception if we find that this is -- has the\nforce or effect of law rather than being a private\ncontract?\nMR. LERMAN: No. If this has the force and\neffect -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's one or the other -\nor both, but we could choose.\nMR. LERMAN: It either has the force and\neffect of law or it doesn't. If it has the force and\neffect of law, it falls within the scope of the express\npreemption clause and this Court does not need to\naddress any of that.\nI'd like to turn my -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some -- some of the rules\nare okay, though, as you acknowledge, and I guess\nthere's a second question in the case.\nMR. LERMAN: There is. Thank you -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You were about to get into\nthat anyway.\nMR. LERMAN: I was going to, but thank you,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. LERMAN: I was going to get to the\nsecond question in the case, which is this Court's\ndecision in Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines. In Castle,\nthis Court held that -- that a State cannot enforce\notherwise valid requirements through a partial\nsuspension of a motor carrier's federally granted right\nto operate in interstate commerce.\nThat is precisely the authority that the\nPort is claiming here. The Port is claiming the\nauthority to suspend or revoke motor carrier's access to\nthe Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in\nthe United States and a key channel of interstate\ncommerce. That would affect -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That matters -- that\nmatters in your view whether it's a key component of\ncommerce or not. If it's -- if it's a particular\nhighway, a particular street, you think Castle doesn't\napply in that case?\nMR. LERMAN: Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,\nCastle spoke to partial suspensions of a motor carrier's\nright to operate interstate commerce and I think it\ncannot be denied that in this case, because of the\nnature of the Port, it is -- it would affect a partial\nsuspension. I don't think this Court needs to get into\nsingle roads and I don't think there's any reason -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you\nhave to get into it since I asked you a question about\nit.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LERMAN: You're quite right,\nMr. Chief Justice. I don't see any reason to let that\ncamel's nose under the tent. If it's a partial -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or maybe you should stop\nreferring to a key component of interstate commerce. It\ndoesn't matter whether it's key or not, does it?\nMR. LERMAN: That's quite correct. It would\naffect the partial suspension of interstate commerce, it\nwould seriously disrupt their interstate commerce\noperations. This falls within Castle's exact terms.\nAnd Congress has not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they say there's\nthis particular road, through a State park or something,\nthat's scenic, and sometimes the trucks drive on the\nside of the road and it causes damage to what the\nState's trying to preserve, and they have a rule: Look,\nif you do that three times and we warn you, the fourth\ntime you can't use this road. That is preempted?\nMR. LERMAN: That is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is another\nroad not too far away. You've got to use that one.\nMR. LERMAN: That is preempted under Castle.\nThe conventional forms of punishment might include the\nthree times and we fine an individual truck. But that's\nwhat the situation was in Castle. You can't punish a\nviolation of an otherwise valid regulation through a\npartial suspension of interstate commerce. And I think\nthat would qualify.\nAnd Castle is -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Castle's didn't say that,\nMr. Lerman. What if the Court is just saying, we want\nto keep unsafe trucks off the road, but we're not\nprohibiting you for past violations that you've cured.\nAll we're doing is keeping unsafe trucks out of our\nport.\nMR. LERMAN: Justice Kagan, the conventional\nforms of punishment include, as we acknowledge, taking\nan unsafe truck out of service or denying access. If -\nif the truck is leaking hazardous material, the port can\ndeny access to that particular truck.\nThe key -- the key problem here is the\ncarrier-level suspension of access. And so saying,\nbecause that one truck of the carrier might be leaking\nhazardous material, we are not going to let any trucks,\neven perfectly safe trucks that don't present any\npresent -- clear and present safety risk -- into the\nport until you fix that unsafe truck.\nAnd that's the authority reserved by the\nState in this case, and that is what Castle said is\npreempted. And so we are not denying the authority to\ninvoke what Castle called conventional forms of\npunishment, which we would concede includes the -- the\ntype of punishment Your Honor's contemplating, but what\nit doesn't allow is a -- a suspension of access to a\nmotor carrier as a business entity.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But why does that -- why\ndoes it have to be truck by truck rather than operator\nby operator? Why can't the port say, you know, when we\nfound a couple of trucks that this company uses that are\nunsafe, we're just going to keep the company off our\npremises until the company can show us that they've\ncured all their trucks, that they are a safe operator\nnow.\nMR. LERMAN: Because that's what Castle\ndealt with, Your Honor. And I was going to turn to the\nstatutory scheme in Castle, which is Castle's decision\nwas predicated on a statutory scheme that gave the\nFederal Government exclusive authority to grant\ninterstate commerce permits -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the Federal Government\ninspect trucks for safety and -\nMR. LERMAN: It has regulatory -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- leaking hazardous\nmaterials and such?\nMR. LERMAN: I don't know that it inspects\nit directly, and it has provisions for States to do\nthat. But the Federal Government still under 49 U.S.C.\n13905 has exclusive authority to revoke a Federal -- a\nmotor carrier's Federally granted operating authority.\nAnd so there are significant rights that States have to\nimpose -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has it ever done that?\nMR. LERMAN: I don't know if it's ever done\nthat, but what it has done is -- is what Castle said,\nwhich is -- is -- there was no reason to -- to deny that\nthe conventional forms of punishment are sufficient to\nprotect the State's safety concerns, and then if they\nare not sufficient there was then and there still exists\na remedy, which is to go to the Department of\nTransportation and ask them.\nAnd that remedy exists to this day under 49\nU.S.C. 13905. The same statutory scheme that was\npresent in Castle and animated this Court's decision in\nCastle is present today. So if they have a safety\nconcern, there are ways to deal with it.\nThey can do what Justice Kagan suggested,\nwhich is to deny access to a particular truck. They can\ngo to the Department of Transportation and ask for -\nfor some type of action. But what they can't do is\nassert the veto power that this Court held was precluded\nin Castle and in the city of Chicago cases, and that is\nprecisely the veto power that they are asserting here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I make a somewhat -\nthis is how I'm seeing the case and there is some\nmystery in it to me and it would affect how I might\nwrite this thing or consider it.\nLook, what they want to do is to not have\ntrucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they\nwant to put a tag on it. All right. So the second -\nyou seem to have said what they should have done: You\ngo to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it. They\napprove it or they don't.\nAnd their -- their problem is that they\ndon't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different\nsticker, all right? So then the whole back fills up\nwith stickers and that's the problem. That's the\nproblem. You go explain, et cetera, okay.\nBut the first part, the parking, it seemed\nto me of course they should be able to do that. And\nthere seems to me to be a tailor-made exception: The\nauthority of the State to impose highway route controls\nor limitations. And if that isn't tailor-made for this,\nI don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's\ndoing there. And so why has nobody done that?\nWhen I read the lower court on that, they\nsaid: Oh, it affects fares and it affects services.\nEvery route restriction affects fares and services, you\nknow? So here I see an exception which seems\ntailor-made for what they want to do. I see all kinds\nof problems with the proprietary thing. What am I\nsupposed to do? What -- what I see as the exception\ntailor-made for this isn't in the case.\nMR. LERMAN: I think that's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what do you suggest?\nAnd it's a question for both sides.\nMR. LERMAN: You're right that it's not in\nthe case, Your Honor. It's not in the case because the\nonly issue here was whether it has the force and effect\nof law, because that's what the court below held. The\ncourt below held that these could escape preemption\nbecause the port was acting arguably in part by a\nmotivation for community goodwill.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you agree with\nthat -- that that provision would apply? I don't see\nthat it applies.\nMR. LERMAN: I don't know if it applies.\nThat was going to be the second answer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Route restrictions?\nMR. LERMAN: I don't think this is a route\nrestriction. I don't know if it would qualify, and that\nwould be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you can't say,\ndon't drive our truck through the neighborhood? This is\nresidential area, no trucks over such-and-such. If you\ncan say that, why can't you say do it part of the time?\nWhy can't you say -- we're arguing a different question.\nI agree it is not -\nMR. LERMAN: Not only are we arguing a\ndifferent question, I think that gets to -- and I would\nlike to answer this question and then reserve my time\nfor rebuttal if I might.\nBut that gets to the \"related to\" question:\nIs that in fact related to rates, routes, and services\nwith respect to the transportation of property? That\nsometimes is a more factual inquiry. But that is not at\nissue here. The only issue here is whether it can\nescape preemption because the Port was arguably\nmotivated in part by a proprietary concern such as\ncommunity goodwill.\nNone of those words are in the statute,\nwhich preempts all actions that have the force and\neffect of law, and they are preempted on this basis.\nAnd I would like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bash, welcome.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. BASH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think the city\ncould pass a regulation like as Justice Breyer\nsuggested, that says, stay off residential streets?\nMR. BASH: Well, if the city were to pass\nthat regulation, they'd have to make out a record that\nit either -- it comes within one -- one of the\nexceptions. Now, it could have been the safety\nexception. The Port argued for that here and the\ndistrict court rejected it on the record after hearing\ntestimony about the alleged safety and hazardous cargo\njustifications.\nThey didn't make an argument under sizes and\nweights. Presumably, they could make that record.\nYou'd have to see about the strength of their\njustifications. I'd note that I -- it would probably be\nthe case they would have to apply uniformly to trucks of\na given size or weights. Here, they were only going\nafter drayage trucks, which are a particular category of\ntrucks. I don't know if they could make that showing\nwith respect to all trucks or if that was their intent\nhere.\nI would like to turn, if I could, to Justice\nGinsburg's question about the criminal penalties in this\ncase. We accept the Port's statement in their brief on\nface value that the criminal penalties would only fall\non the marine terminal operators. But, like Petitioner,\nwe don't think that makes a difference.\nIf, for example, the State Highway\nCommission said, okay, certain trucks can't use our\nroads unless you sign a certain agreement, but don't\nworry, if you don't agree to abide by that agreement we\nwon't do anything to you, but we will throw every person\nwho does business with you in jail.\nWhatever else you could say about that\nscheme, I think it would be pretty clear that it would\nbe the act of a sovereign and so it would have the force\nand effect of law within the meaning of this statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, what would you\nthink of this case if the criminal penalties were taken\nout of it? In other words, if the Port did this all\nthrough contract, basically said to each terminal\noperator, look, if you contract with truckers that don't\nhave this concession agreement, we are going to charge\nyou a higher price.\nSo -- so if the criminal penalties were not\nin the case, is there enough here to still make this the\nforce and effect of law?\nMR. BASH: Yes. We think not only is there\nenough here, but there's another sort of a bright-line\nrationale before you get into the Boston Harbor sort of\nunderstanding of if this is regulatory or market\nparticipant. And that's the second factor we cite in\nour brief, which is we don't consider the Port the\nequivalent of the cement factory in Reeves, like a\ncommercial enterprise that you might see in the private\nmarketplace.\nThis port authority, like I think virtually\nall other port authorities in charge of these massive\ncontainer ports, hold land much like a highway\ncommission in trust for the public.\nThis is not private property ownership. If\nyou look at all the different metrics of success the\ncourt of appeals pointed to and the district court\npointed to and I think the port points to in their\nbrief, they are not bottom line business metrics like\nshareholder value and dividends and so forth.\nIt's economic vitality of the region. It's\nthe number of jobs it brought to the L.A. area. That is\nnot the mark of a commercial enterprise. It's the mark\nof a regulatory body. It's something a mayoral\ncandidate might point to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not\ntrue. I mean, a commercial enterprise might want to\nattract customers because of its reputation as a -- as a\ngreen company, because of its reputation of hiring local\nworkers.\nI think you have too confined a notion of\nwhat's good business.\nMR. BASH: I think it's true that Wal-Mart\nmight say: Hey, we don't do business with labor law\nviolators, or we adhere to certain environmental\npractices, as part of a marketing campaign. But I think\nwhat this Court said in Boston Harbor was that, yeah, a\nprivate business could boycott labor law -- law\nviolators too, and, in a sense, the private business\nwould be engaged in quote-unquote regulation.\nBut when the Government does that, when the\nGovernment uses its special place in society and its\nenormous economic power to effectively leverage its\npower to impose regulation, that's -- that's\nfundamentally different, and that is not the Government\nacting in a market capacity even though, sure, Wal-Mart\nor Starbucks could do a similar thing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it part of your\nargument that the city contracts with the port and then\nthe port contracts with the truckers, but at that point,\nthe ports are -- are confined in what they can do?\nThere can be really no bargaining between the ports and\nthe truckers based on what the city has already told the\nport?\nMR. BASH: Justice Kennedy, that -- that's\nlike our third order argument. I mean, our first order\nargument is criminal penalties and just the nature of a\nport and -- the Port doesn't contract with the city.\nThe Port is a department of the city, and its members\nare appointed by the mayor and its revisions to the\ntariff are codified in city ordinances. So it's in\nevery way a part of the city, it's not just a\ncontractual relationship.\nWe think just the criminal penalties here\nand the nature of what a port is. A port -- a\nregulatory body that governs a critical part of public\ninfrastructure is enough to resolve this case. If you\nthink no, the criminal penalties don't matter and this\nPort is more like the cement factory in Reeves, it's\nreally just a plain vanilla commercial enterprise, we do\nthink the fact that it's leveraging significant economic\npower, that it's the only place in L.A. to do this\nbusiness, is part of this sort of Gould market\nparticipant analysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bash, how then do you\ndeal with the problem that precipitated all of this?\nHere is a port that's getting lots of complaints from\nthe neighborhood people. It wants to expand the port,\nit's being thwarted by environmental suits, so it wants\nto go green and it wants to do something about the\npollution and the traffic and the hazards from the\ntruck. You're saying that it can't do that?\nMR. BASH: We're -- we're not saying it has\nno recourse. And I just note parenthetically that the\nsame could be true of any state highway commission\nthat's contemplating an expansion of a highway project.\nThey could face similar suits based on environmental\ncomplaints. They could face similar community\nopposition: We don't want these huge trucks coming\nthrough our neighborhood. That doesn't make the decrees\nand acts of a highway commission, particularly if backed\nby criminal penalties, acts that lack enforcement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how could a port\nrespond to the complaints if you're making this -- this\nneighborhood around the Port an environmental hazard?\nAnd so we're going to make sure that our representatives\nvote against any expansion of the Port.\nMR. BASH: To -- to deal with that sort of\neffectively political opposition, community opposition,\nI think the Port retains a lot of flexibility under the\nstatute to address them.\nIf you look at page 90 through 93 of the\nPet. App, it discusses the extensive incentive programs\nthat the Port established. 35 percent of the drayage\ntrucks currently serving the Port, or at least at the\ntime the district court's opinion was written, are new,\nclean trucks that don't have the same emissions problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But wait. Why isn't the --\nI mean, I thought that the purpose of these\nexceptions -- of course cities can have parking\nregulations. Of course States and cities can have\nregulations involving trucks as to how and where they\nuse the highways and which ones they can't use and which\nroutes, et cetera. That's the purpose of that\nexception, isn't it? I mean, I -- I thought that's what\nit was.\nAnd, of course, you're quite right in saying\nthey should have to do it uniformly. It says based on\nsize and weight. Okay. Fine. What's the problem with\nthat, that I'm not seeing?\nMR. BASH: I took Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion to be addressing a slightly different point.\nThe exceptions are for things like safety, hazardous\ncargo -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it says, \"The\nauthority of a state to impose highway route controls or\nlimitations based on the size and weight of the motor\nvehicle or the -- or hazard -- or hazardous nature.\"\nAnd it's size and weight, hazardous nature. I mean,\nisn't there room in those words to include environmental\nconsideration?\nMR. BASH: There -- there may be. It's\nobviously an issue that hasn't been briefed in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there is.\nYou think there is? He's saying that you can answer\nquestions.\nJUDGE BREYER: I -- I myself don't know.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Seems to me the answer is\nno.\nMR. BASH: But I -- I just wanted to\nemphasize for Justice Ginsburg, though, that there are a\nlot of things that ports and other -- other municipal\nentities can do to address environmental concerns. And\nthey've been done in this case.\nIt is the replacement of these trucks, which\nwas done through a subsidy and incentive program that's\nremarkably similar to the one this Court blessed as\nmarket participation in Hughes that allowed these\nextensive emission reductions that the Port's seen.\nThat sort of direct participation in the market has all\nthe hallmarks of what we don't have here. It's not\nenforced through criminal penalties. It's not the -\nthe Port acting as a regulator of this public\ninfrastructure. It's actually entering the drayage\nmarket and purchasing trucks, effectively becoming a\npart owner of the truck.\nSo I do think that the Port has extensive\nauthority to address environmental concerns within the\nconfines of this preemption statute.\nThe Chief Justice asked about the Castle\nquestion, whether it matters or what if you just didn't\nwant a road or what's the size of it?\nI will say that the court in Castle seemed\nto think it made a difference, the sort of size of the\nimposition, but I don't think it needs to make a\ndifference anymore because we have a direct preemption\nstatute.\nWe think that the logic of Castle applies\nnot only in the context of the licensing scheme that has\nchanged but was effectively in place during Castle, but\nunder Section 14501(c) itself. 14501(c) says States\ncan't pass regulations that relate to prices, routes,\nand services, but it also gives States safety exceptions\nand so forth. And there needs to be a reconciliation of\nthose two provisions.\nI think we'd all agree that if a State -- if\na truck committed two safety infractions, you couldn't\nsay, well, now we're going to regulate your prices,\nroutes, and services as punishment for that infraction.\nThis -- the framework we've set forth in the Castle\nportion of our brief I think is a reasonable\nreconciliation of the State -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- do you think\nthat a statute that says if you're trucking company\noperator and you have three violations of X safety\nregulations, you just can't use our highways because we\ndon't trust you, is that okay?\nMR. BASH: No, that's certainly not okay.\nWe think that fails under both the holding of Castle and\njust under the current expansion provision, which is\nmaybe the easier way to do it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? Why isn't it a\nstandard fact that States and cities use to stop people\nfrom repetitive violations to tell them, if you keep\ndoing this and don't remedy what you've done, we're just\nnot going to let you do X, Y, and Z? Why wouldn't the\nsafety violate -\nMR. BASH: Well, it should be clear at the\noutset that we're not talking about people; we're\ntalking about motor carriers as an ongoing enterprise.\nSo we're not saying an individual can't have their\nlicense revoked.\nAre you finished with the question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your answer.\nMR. BASH: But more broadly, we think the\nFederal regulatory scheme in combination with this\npreemption provision just bars States from taking\ncertain actions that would affect the interstate\noperations of motor carriers.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rosenthal?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN S. ROSENTHAL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nAt issue today are two provisions contained\nin a contract between commercial actors. They set forth\nconditions under which drayage trucks can enter the\nnonpublic portions of the Port, and they are\nindistinguishable, indistinguishable from contract\nprovisions that private parties routinely impose on\nthose who seek to enter their property. In our view,\nthe FAAAA does not deal with contracts, and it doesn't\ndeal with the right of landowners to condition those\nseeking entry into their Port.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What exception do you\nappeal to? There are a number of exceptions there.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: What -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What exception are you\nappealing to from the -- from the preemption provision?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Your Honor, my first -- my\nfirst exception is the actual force and effect of law.\nWe do not believe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different\npoint, but -- but you're -- you're talking about, you\nknow, an exception for private contract operations as\nopposed to public matters.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: We're -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are exceptions to the\npreemption and that is not one of them. And other\nstatutes do have exceptions for -- for commercial\noperations or private operations. This one doesn't.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: With -- with due respect,\nthe statute says \"law, regulation, or provision having\nthe force and effect of law.\" That's a -- that's\nsomething which applies to the general public. We\nsubmit that what we are calling the market participant\nexception, what it is generally congruent with, what is\nmeant by Congress by the term \"force and effect of law.\"\nThe Sixth -- the Fifth Circuit in Cardinal said that the\nmarket participant analysis should inform what is meant\nby force and effect of law. We're not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do market participants\nimpose civil and criminal penalties?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Ah. I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. Yes.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: The answer is no, but I\nthink the criminal penalties is a red herring in this\ncase, and if you will --if you'll just indulge me a\nmoment, the concession agreement everyone concedes does\nnot include any criminal penalties. The tariff which\napplies to the marine terminal operators, yes, it\ncontains a criminal penalty, but the criminal penalty is\nnot included in this tariff against the marine terminal\noperators. It's intended for other purposes.\nWe have no recollection of a cargo operation\never having had a criminal penalty. Yes, it's in there,\nthere is a misdemeanor penalty but it applies to people\nlike trespassers, people who perform traditional\ncriminal acts.\nThere is evidence in the record. I asked\nthe director, the deputy director of the Port, how do\nyou enforce these requirements, and his answer was,\nprimarily through our lease contract. Obviously, we\ndon't want to do away with the -- with our lessor, but\nthere is no indication, and there is no fact on the\nrecord that these criminal penalties which our opponents\nkeep dredging up are ever used against MTO's.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that how we decide these\nthings? When there is on the books a criminal penalty\nthat can apply to everybody, do we let the State come in\nand say: Oh, you know, no harm, no foul because it's on\nthe books but we -- we don't really use it. Well, I\ndon't know -- I don't know that we do that. If it's\nthere, it's a criminal penalty, and if -- if the\ncondition of -- of -- of you're being able to impose\nthese limitations is that you not have criminal\npenalties, there is a criminal penalty.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Justice Scalia, first of\nall, the direct criminal penalty doesn't apply to the\ntruckers at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: So the argument is, this is\nan indirect effect, and what I'm trying to argue is the\nindirect effect is not criminal in nature. Yes, there\nis a criminal provision. But I'm saying as a practical\nmatter, criminal penalties aren't used indirectly to\nenforce this prohibition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but like a lot\nof criminal penalties, that's the whole point. They\nkeep people from doing crimes. It doesn't seem to me to\nbe very probative to say we've never had to throw\nanybody in jail or we never had to prosecute anybody\ncriminally. They have a coercive effect that a private\noperator cannot avail itself of.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But, Mr. Chief Justice,\nusually criminal penalties apply to the public. The\nreason I'm bringing this up is we have an entirely\nseparate and much more robust relationship with our own\ntenants through the lease. The lease is the way this is\nenforced. Criminal penalties -- no MTO thinks for a\nsecond about the criminal penalty. They think about the\ncontractual relationship.\nAnd that's an important point here because\nwhat we're talking about and what's central here is the\nmanagement of land which we own, which we will not,\nunderscore \"not,\" be able to grow and develop unless we\nhave some modicum of control. And we are not talking\nabout expansive control here, but some modicum of\ncontrol over who enters our land.\nLet me make one additional point which I\nthink is terribly important. The owner of land -- the\nowner of land has to have some control of the type which\nATA and the Government says we can't have control over.\nI will give you a simple example where we cut a hole in\nour fence and say the trucks can come in, you can come\nin on Navy Way but you can't come in on Prospect Street.\nThat under a strict definition of the statute would be\nprohibited to us. But you can't prohibit a landowner\nfrom saying: You've got to identify yourself.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why the route\nregulation thing is the exception. But the State of\nCalifornia decides -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But we're not acting -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Pardon me. I know you're\nnot. The State of California decides: Here's what we\nhave: A State public utilities commission which issues\na tariff, and what the tariff says is anyone who\ncontracts with a person in this State, a property owner,\nto move his goods and services, cannot charge less than\n$30 a pound. All right? Plainly preempted.\nAnd your case differs because?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: My case differs because we\nare not dealing directly with rates, routes or services.\nWe are not regulating. We are -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying it falls\noutside the definition of \"routes.\" Well, that argument\nis not in front of us. I mean, I thought we were\nconceding here it falls within the definition of routes\nor rates or services.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The parking regulation -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: That question was -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it doesn't fall\nwithin, then I'm not sure what we're talking about,\nbecause I thought the problem was that it does fall\nwithin the rates, routes and services, and then the\nquestion is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, the -- the answer -\nour position is that even if it is rates, routes and\nservices, that what we are doing is not regulation, that\nthis is proprietary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I asked you, and\nhow does it differ from the hypothetical I just put.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I think -- I think -- it\ndiffers from that because we're not prescribing any -\nif we are describing -- if we are prescribing it, it's\ninherent within our ability to access our particular\nland.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are saying that you\ncan do by contract what you cannot do by regulation.\nAnd I don't understand that argument when there are\ncriminal penalties that attach to the breach of the\ncontract.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But, Justice Kennedy, let me\nsay again, there are no criminal penalties that attach\nto the breach of the contract. It is purely a contract.\nThe remedies are purely civil. Even our other side in\ntheir argument has conceded there are no criminal\npenalties to the breach of the concession agreement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that's\ncrucial. You think a state can say nobody's going to\ncome on our highways until it signs a contract? Okay?\nThese highways belong to us, they are State land, and\nanybody who wants to ride on the highways, you have to\nenter a contract with the State. And that's going to\nget around this Federal statute?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, no, no. Justice Scalia,\nthere is a critical distinction here. The roads, the\nbridges, the parks are open generally to the public.\nThere is a difference between that and the private part\nof the city hall. For example, we restrict who comes\ninto the garage under the city hall. We restrict who\ncomes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. It's a highway only\nfor trucks. It's a truck highway. Okay? It's\nspecially reinforced and everything, but you have to\nenter a contract with the State in order to drive your\ntruck on this highway. And that's okay?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But we're not -- we're not\ndealing with that hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know we're not. That's\nwhy it's a hypothetical.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But there's a difference,\nand let me give you the difference, Justice Scalia. And\nthat is in this particular case we are dealing with a\nbusiness, a commercial enterprise. And I think the\nappropriate standard which we would contend controls\nwhether force and effect of law, market participant\napplies, is whether this was an action taken, reasonably\ntaken to deal with a genuine commercial interest of the\nPort.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. The State makes\nmoney on this truck highway. It's a money-maker, okay?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, no, we're not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that makes it okay?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No. We are not prepared to\nconcede that making money is sufficient, taxes are\nsufficient. We have findings in the district court here\nthat this was undertaken to advance a commercial\nobjective, that commercial objective being to allow the\nport to grow. This -- the city undertakes regulatory\nactivities.\nIt runs a police department, it runs -- it\nruns a fire department, public works. It does, in the\ncase of the city of Los Angeles, run three enterprises:\nA port, an airport, and a power and water department.\nThat is substantively different than running the public\nroads and the bridges.\nAnd we believe what's critical to this\nanalysis and what we have extensive findings from the\ndistrict court is that this was run as a business, like\nthe cement plant, like the Boston Harbor. Boston Harbor\nI think I would posit is far closer case, it seems to me\nthan what we're dealing with here, which are marine\nterminals.\nBut nonetheless, in Boston Harbor this Court\nheld that the regulation of who could work in Boston\nHarbor, the circumstances fell within the market\nparticipant doctrine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was implied preemption\nin Boston Harbor. Here you have an express preemption\nclause which contains exceptions, and among those\nexceptions is not the running of a commercial\nenterprise, even though that is made an exception in a\nnumber of other Federal statutes, Federal preemption\nstatutes. That's a very high hill for you to climb,\nrelying solely on the fact that you are a commercial\nenterprise.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: It's not the only thing,\nJustice Scalia, I'm relying on. I'm also relying on the\nlanguage which Congress put in, which are words of the\nlimitation, which is force and effect of law.\nIf Congress had not -- had said any\nrequirement by the Port, any requirement by a city\nwhatsoever, I believe we'd have a closer case. But\nthey're only talking about things which have application\nto the general public.\nWe submit that force and effect of law\nalmost invites a market participant analysis.\nLet me also respond to your point about the\nADA, the Airport Deregulation Act. The reason there is\na limited exception for airport proprietors, as this\nCourt has held, is because there was a longstanding\nissue about airports being able to impose restrictions\nabout noise pollution on surrounding communities.\nCongress was well aware back in the 1970s,\nwhen this statute was enacted, of that controversy and\nthey wanted to preserve of the existing rights of\nairports. There is no comparable controversy with\nrespect to truck ports or ports or the Government that\nwas ongoing in 1994 when this particular statute was\nadopted.\nBut let me point out that what did -- did\noccur in 1994 was that Congress was writing against the\nbackdrop of this Court's decision in the Boston Harbor\ncase, in which Congress was told that in the absence of\nsomething express, which says that a city or State can't\nmanage its own property when it pursues its proprietary\ninterests, that there would not be inferred -- not be\ninferred -- a restriction on a State's power to manage\nits own property.\nSo, unlike the situation when the ADA was\nadopted, when the FAAAA was adopted in 1994, there was,\nwe submit, a background principle, which this Court had\nenunciated earlier, that there was a presumption that\nour proprietary powers were to be preserved.\nIf -- if I can, I'd like to go on to the\nCastle argument as well. Our point -- we make three\ndifferent points in Castle. First of all, our position\nis that the Castle decision was predicated upon a very\nspecific statutory regime that existed in -- under the\nFederal Motor Carrier Act of 1935.\nJustice Black specifically noted the details\nof that statutory regime, which included certificates of\nconvenience and necessity, very precise rules under\nwhich trucks were to operate within -- within the United\nStates.\nThat regime has died. Died several decades\nago. And we would submit that the Castle doctrine as it\nexisted died with that regime.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rosenthal, could I\ninterrupt you for a second and just make sure I\nunderstand what your policy is? Who do you exclude from\nthe Port? What trucks -- what trucks or what trucking\ncompanies do you exclude?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, in fact, we don't\nexclude anybody from the Port. We simply ask that those\ntrucks that come on to port property sign a nonexclusive\nconcession agreement which agrees to certain conditions.\nSo drayage trucks that come on, on a regular\nbasis, have to sign these conditions. We would point\nout that people who operate at our Port intermittently\ncan get day passes. And generally speaking -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if they\nviolate those conditions? I mean, that's -- that's\nwhere the -- that's where the shoe pinches. What if\nthey violate those contractual conditions? Then do you\nexclude only the truck that violates it, or do you\nexclude the whole trucking company?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, we -- we -- there's a\ngradation of remedies. We don't -- we have -- we have\ngenerally not excluded or revoked. Generally, what\nwe've done is tried to get compliance. There are -\nthere are penalties, there are mechanisms of a\ncontractual nature which are used.\nThose are the principal -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the ultimate?\nWhat's the ultimate? You've tried everything else and\nyou whack them with a big penalty.\nWhat is that?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: In -- in cases involving\nfraud, criminal penalties of a continuing nature, we can\nsuspend or revoke their right to come on to the\nproperty. That's the ultimate. But -- but -- and this\ndeals with the Castle argument -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and not just the\nnoncompliant trucks, but the entire operator who are\nhaving some noncompliant trucks, is that correct?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Again, we -- this -- there\nhasn't been this experience of -- of having to revoke\nand -- and suspend in cases like what you're describing.\nThere are -- for example, there has been revocations\nwhen an LMC has not had the insurance it's required, but\nthat applies to all of their trucks.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you're saying there\nisn't that experience, I mean, could -- are you in a\nposition actually to represent that you would not\nexclude anything except noncompliant trucks?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: There -- there hasn't been\nthe experience. What we said before is that the\nseverest penalties are intended for severe continuing\noffenses. And our position is that, given the fact that\nthere are reasonable applications of the revocation -\nof the suspension requirement, given the fact that ATA\nhas launched a facial attack on our regulation, that it\nwill be sufficient time to deal with an as-applied\nCastle.\nIf Castle survives and this Court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are three reasons,\nand the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't\nsurvive in a policy of deregulation if it seemed to\napply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue\nthat with you.\nI want to be sure I have the second and\nthird.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes. Let me -- let me give\nyou -- let me give you my -- the three.\nFirst, we don't believe Castle continues.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what is the second and\nthird?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Second -- second argument -\nsecond argument is that even under the Castle regime,\nall Castle talked about is going -- allowing a truck to\ngo up to a customer's property line, that -- that a\ncertificate of convenience and necessity never gave\nanyone permission to go into Wal-Mart or anything else.\nAnd that's what we're talking about here.\nAnd thirdly, our position is that given this\nis -- this being a facial attack, given the fact that we\nbelieve that there are lawful applications of -- of the\nrevocation to ongoing continuing violations, which is,\nfrankly, the only -- I can't make a representation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I've never heard of this\ndoctrine. This is a facial attack to a contract? Is\nthat it? I mean, you -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, but -- it's a -- it's\na facial attack to -- it is. It's a facial attack to a\ncontract. We don't believe that it applies to our\ncontract at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have to attack this\ncontract provision by provision, or application by\napplication?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But -- but they're arguing\nthat our contract is tantamount to a law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I've\nheard of facial attacks to criminal statutes.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Right. And -- but they are\nattacking this remedy to -- they've -- they've -\ntalking -- they are attacking this on -- on its face and\nsaying that no application of this provision is -- is an\nexception.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's the one that\nwould be? Give me the example that you're thinking of\nwhere, given Castle -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and its applications, it\nwould be -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Where -- where a truck is in\ncontinuing violation, a company is in continuing\nviolation of a safety restriction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, how\ndoes -- how -- how would that differ from Castle?\nBecause what Castle was concerned about was a State that\nhas a perfectly lawful regulation, and it's violated,\nthen the State as the remedy excludes the truck from the\nState.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it's concerned\nabout. And it didn't say anything about accepting very\nserious violations, i.e., continuing ones. The reason\nwas the need for interstate regulation of an interstate\nenterprise. And that was the reasoning. Leave it to\nthe ICC, a fortiori, where it's deregulatory policy, but\nleave that to the side.\nI want to know your best case in that one,\nand I don't see the example yet.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Let me -- let me try to\nrespond, Justice Breyer.\nI think if one reads the opinion in Castle,\nCastle dealt with a past violation, not a continuing\nviolation. The record in that case didn't deal with\nthe -- and I think the words of the -- Justice Black\nsaid that would be a different case, that there would be\na right to exclude a continuing violation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just go back,\nbecause -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: You certainly may.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the theoretical\nquestions. The agreement requires the operators to have\noffsite parking.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? It has to do\nthat for a reason. It means that if its trucks don't\nuse that offsite parking, that the operator is in\ndefault? Is that the City's position?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: If -- if it does, it submits\nan off-street parking plan for all of the trucks which\nare registered to go onto the property, and it has to\nagree to keep those trucks in the off-site parking.\nIf it breaches that agreement, it's treated\nas a breach, and we -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just wanted to make\nsure. What you're saying is if trucks park anywhere\nelse, then the operator's in violation of the agreement.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: That -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. With respect\nto the placard, as I read the provision it says you have\nto have the placard coming in and going out. Is this\nlike one of those parking placards that people can affix\ntemporarily or does it have to be a permanent?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, it does not have to be\npermanently affixed to the truck.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how does that help\nyou? Meaning to -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, there were -- we -- we\nprovide them if they want a sticker they can put on\ntheir truck, but we don't require it. We just give them\nthe words. And most trucks, in fact virtually all\ntrucks of this type, have a -- have a frame on the\noutside where they temporarily put plaques, for example,\nat times when they are carrying hazardous materials.\nYou probably have seen that color design on the side.\nThose are temporarily affixed.\nSo if a trucking company, an LMC, wished to\njust put the plaque on as it's crossing the gate and\ntake it off when it's leaving the gate, it's -- it's\nfully lawful to do that under our restrictions.\nMost of them just leave -- leave it on, but\nthat's not required. The plaque is only required as it\nenters, while it's on Port property, and when it leaves,\nas it leaves.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is the public\ngoing to use that plaque?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: What?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is the public going\nto use that? The public hangs around the Port as it's\nloading to call in complaints?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: There are -- there are -\nthere are members of the public include also the people\nwho are on -- at the MTO, also other truckers. The\npurpose of it is essentially to provide a -- a remedy to\nnotify from people who are on the Port, and -- and also\nto act essentially as a notice to the drivers in the\ntrucking company that if they are violating the rules,\nthere -- people know there's a phone number they can\ncall. So it acts -- it has a certain enforcement\neffect.\nMy point -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you clarify -\nwould you clarify what the -- what happens when there is\nan infraction? Say three trucks. Is it right that you\ncan suspend until the infraction is cured, that you can\nsuspend all of that operator's trucks?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: We -- we are -- there has\nbeen very little practice, Justice Ginsburg, under that,\nbut basically our enforcement where there have been\nviolations has been to ban the particular truck in\nquestion, not the entire LMC.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could do the\nother. See, I'm -- what -- what are -- is it -- is it\njust a matter of grace that you will say: Well, we'll\nrequire them to fix those two trucks and all the others\ncan travel? Or could you say: Until you fix those two\ntrucks, none of your trucks come through?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: We -- we have built in a\ngradation. I mean, it's not purely a matter of grace.\nWe classify things as minor violations and major\nviolations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's say it's a major\nviolation.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: If it were a major violation\ninvolving something we believe was systemic within the\nLMC, the -- the -- not the regulation, but the\nconcession agreement would leave the possibility that we\ncould revoke or suspend until the problem was corrected.\nBut -- but -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about after it's\ncorrected? The Government then says there's some\nuncertainty about that, whether you -\nMR. ROSENTHAL: We have -- we have never\nenforced it that way. I mean, the enforcement -- we\nhaven't used revocation; we haven't used suspension.\nAnd generally speaking, our intent has been, as we\nstated in the lower court and as we stated repeatedly,\nto use this for continuing violations. But we are\nreally talking about future actions because revocation\nand suspension have not been common.\nLet me conclude by making two points here.\nNumber one, this Port undertook these actions as a\nreasonable and genuine response to the needs to build\nand grow a port. If we are prohibited from taking what\nare substantively limited actions to control trucking,\nthen essentially we're going to be in a posture in which\nthis Port will be disabled by its surrounding community\nfrom doing what it needs to do to compete.\nSecondly, we submit you cannot be the\nowner-proprietor of property without having some control\nover the conditions under which owner -- under which\ninvitees, business invitees, come onto your property;\nthat this statute of Congress was not intended to\nconstrain that property interest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Make -- make this argument\nprecisely and substitute for \"port authority\" the words\n\"city of San Diego,\" okay? And -- and you'd be still\nright. I mean, what's bothering me is, I -- I don't\nknow you've got the right one. So -- so if we decide in\nyour way, what we've done is distinguish precisely the\nsame situation, you from the city of Los Angeles, simply\nbecause of the method they have of governmentally\nregulating the port.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No. I disagree -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: -- Justice Breyer. It's not\nbecause we're -- we have support as the proprietorship.\nIt's because these actions were commercial in nature.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I see.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: These -- the port is\noperating as an enterprise not because it has the label\n\"enterprise,\" but because this is a business and as a\nbusiness we should be entitled under even-handedness to\ndo what a Wal-Mart or any other company could do to\nenable us to prosper, grow, and nurture our business\nenterprise.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Lerman, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL N. LERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LERMAN: Justice Scalia, the criminal\npenalties are not a red herring. Rowe makes clear that\nyou can't circumvent the Act by -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't say they were a\nred herring.\nMR. LERMAN: I know you didn't, Your Honor.\nI was referring to Mr. Rosenthal's argument that -- in\nresponse to a question. You did not say they were any\nkind of herring and they're not.\nJustice Breyer, in response to your\nquestion: Rates, routes and services are not at issue\nin this case. The only issue is whether they have force\nand effect of law. That's the only issue before this\nCourt. The court below said they lack -- they fell\noutside the scope of the statute because of the\nproprietary nature.\nMr. Rosenthal talked a lot about the\ncommercial motivations, but the statute doesn't speak to\ncommercial motivations. The statute speaks to actions\nwith the force and effect of law. These have the force\nand effect of law and are preempted on that ground.\nMr. Rosenthal said Castle has died. Castle\nis still alive. The statutory scheme that formed the\nbasis of this Court's decision in Castle remain to this\nday in Title 49 of the U.S. Code, and that was the basis\nfor the decision then, and it's the basis today.\nJustice Ginsburg, the concession agreements\ngives the Port unfettered discretion to determine\nwhether or not to suspend or revoke access. In this\nCourt's city of Chicago cases, the fact that the city\nclaimed at least some power to deny a license or access\nto interstate commerce was sufficient and it's\nsufficient in this case.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought there -\nthere was a representation made that they toe the line\nthat the government draws. That it, they can say: No\naccess as long as you have trucks in your fleet that\ndon't comply. But once you've gotten your fleet in\norder and you are in compliance, then we can't punish\nyou for having wrongs in the past by saying you're -\nyou're suspended.\"\nThat -- that's the position that the\ngovernment is taking, and I take it you don't agree with\nthat.\nMR. LERMAN: I don't agree and I think\ncounsel said right here that they reserve the authority\nto suspend access for past or ongoing violations, and\nthat runs afoul of Castle under its plain terms.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
