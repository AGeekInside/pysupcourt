KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\n14 years ago in the Duro decision this Court\nheld that under the state of Indian law, as it then stood,\nand Indian tribe could not prosecute an Indian who was not\na member of that tribe. The Court recognized, though,\nthat its decision might create a jurisdictional gap on\nmany reservations, but the Court concluded that if the\npresent jurisdictional regime proves insufficient to meet\nthe needs of reservation law enforcement, the proper body\nto address that concern is Congress, which has plenary\npower over Indian affairs.\nCongress responded immediately to this Court's\ndecision. It -- it conducted an extensive inquiry and\nheard hearings about the consequences of the Court's\ndecision and heard strong expressions of concern by many\nIndian tribes, by the Federal Government, and by numerous\nStates about the law enforcement vacuum that would be\ncreated over many misdemeanor offenses on Indian\nreservations. And there was widespread support for\nCongress to restore the power to Indian tribes to exercise\ntheir sovereign power to prosecute non-member Indians.\nQUESTION: Why didn't -- why didn't they extend\nit to non-Indians? I mean, if it's a problem when a -- a\nnon-member Indian commits an offense on an Indian\nreservation, why isn't it an equivalent problem when a --\na white man commits the same crime on an Indian\nreservation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think the answer lies in -- in\nthe longstanding jurisdictional regime on Indian\nreservations. Going back to 1817, the general Indian\ncrimes statute has authorized prosecutions by the Federal\nGovernment over crimes committed by non-Indians, including\nmisdemeanor crimes, and so there was not a jurisdictional\nvoid. The difficulty came -- the -- the most acute\ndifficulty came from the fact that that statute, again\nsince the earliest times, had -- has exempted crimes\ncommitted by one Indian against the person or property of\nanother.\nQUESTION: Well, why couldn't they have changed\nthat? They could have solved the problem by simply\ntreating non-member Indians the same way they treat non-\nIndians.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Congress could have done so, but\nCongress, with the plenary power over Indian affairs,\nchose -- decided that the proper course or the most\nappropriate course was to have that jurisdiction exercised\nby the Indian tribes. And Congress heard considerable --\nconsiderable evidence that that power had long, in fact,\nbeen exercised by Indian tribes over other Indians who\nwere not members of the particular tribe.\nQUESTION: What's --\nQUESTION: There's some ambiguity about what\nIndian refers to. Is it -- must it be someone who is\nenrolled in an Indian tribe or can it be anyone who is the\nchild of Indian parents?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- generally, it has been\nunderstood to require a tribal affiliation. First of all,\nthe definition under -- under the Indian Civil Rights Act\nfor tribal power, Congress adopted the same meaning of\nIndian that is applied under the Federal criminal statutes\nfor the purpose of having the two mesh completely.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what is that? What is that\ndefinition?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And under that, obviously,\nsomeone who is an enrolled -- formally enrolled member\nwould be an Indian, but as this Court pointed out in\nfootnote 7 of its Antelope decision, the -- that provision\nhas not been construed to require that strictly, that\nordinarily someone who is an Indian and has a tribal\naffiliation and is recognized by the tribe is also\nregarded as an Indian.\nIn this case, though, we have a situation where\nsomeone who is an enrolled member of another tribe. So\nquestions about the -- about the -- how the statute should\nbe construed or applied in situations where there's not\none -- someone who's formally a member are -- are not\npresent in this case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, is it the case that the\nBill of Rights is -- has not been thought applicable to\ncriminal defendants who are members of the tribe in a\ntribal court or to non-tribal Indian -- non-tribal member\nIndians?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Under this Court's\ndecision, this --\nQUESTION: In -- in tribal court.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. This Court's decision in\nTalton v. Mayes said that the Fifth Amendment did not\napply to the exercise of powers by Indian tribes, and\nthat's been understood to apply to --\nQUESTION: Would that be perhaps one reason why\nCongress didn't go ahead and subject non-Indians to tribal\nprosecution?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it -- it may be, but -- but\nit's important to recognize what -- what Congress has also\ndone here was to enact the Indian Civil Rights Act which\nextends to Indian tribes many of the requirements of the\nBill of Rights.\nQUESTION: But not all.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not all of them, but Congress in\n1968 examined the question of the -- of the rights of --\nof Indians and others subject to tribal jurisdiction and\n-- and applied the -- the provisions of the -- of the\nIndian Civil Rights Act. So there -- the -- the --\nQUESTION: Should we consider in this case the\ndue process and equal protection arguments that are --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't believe they\nare before the Court. What was before the -- those --\nthose questions go to what restraints are on the tribe\nitself when it's exercising its own power. That was not\nthe basis of the court of appeals decision in this case.\nThe court of appeals decision was really on the separate\nground of what happens when you have, first, the tribe\nexercising its sovereign power and then the United States\nexercising power after that under the Double Jeopardy\nClause.\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose under one view of the\ncase -- and it's -- it's not your view -- if this were\ndeemed to be a delegated power, then the absence or the --\nthe presence of obligations under the Bill of Rights would\nbecome very important.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- it depends what one\nmeans by delegation. The word delegation is -- is used in\na variety of ways. I mean, for -- for example, it's\ncommon to speak of Congress delegating power to an\nexecutive agency to carry out a certain function, but when\nthe executive agency does this, it's not exercising\ncongressional power. It's exercising power that Congress\nin its plenary authority has -- has conferred on the\nexecutive branch to --\nQUESTION: But -- but it --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- to then execute those laws.\nQUESTION: But it is exercising the power of the\nUnited States as distinct from the power of some other\nsovereign. And -- and the issue in this case is whether\nthe -- as I understand it, is -- is whether the tribe is\nexercising its own power or the power of the United\nStates.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I was using that by\nanalogy to say that the word delegate is -- is often used,\nincluding in this Court's opinions I think, in a -- in a\nsomewhat looser sense in terms of -- of authorizing\nsomeone else to act. But I think -- I think --\nQUESTION: Well, if it's authorized --\nexercising its own power, how then can Congress make the\nBill of Rights applicable. As -- as a condition to the\nexercise of sovereignty? Is that the way it works?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And that's -- I think\nthat's exactly what Congress did in the Indian Civil\nRights Act. It -- it require -- and -- and this Court\nsaid in Wheeler and has said in numerous other decisions\nthat Congress has plenary power over the exercise of a\ntribe's own sovereign powers. And what Congress did in\nthe Indian Civil Rights Act was precisely to regulate\nthat.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, may I raise the -- the\npoint that is -- is the greatest trouble for me so -- so\nyou perhaps could address that? Because it follows from\nwhat Justice Kennedy has raised.\nAs I understand what we held -- forget our\nlanguage about delegation for a minute. As I understand\nwhat we held in Oliphant, which we followed in Duro, was\nthat the very concept of -- of this dependent or\nsubordinate sovereignty that tribes are -- are understood\nto have, the way we look at Indian issues, is inconsistent\nwith the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over a -- a non-\nmember. Whether that notion of subordinate or -- or\ndependent sovereignty is constitutional or common law\ndoesn't really matter. As long as we're going to have\nthat concept, that concept is inconsistent with the\nexercise of the tribe's own sovereign jurisdiction over a\n-- a non-tribal member.\nIf we are going to stick with that concept then,\nit seems to me that we have got to understand the statute\nin question here as a statute that confers Federal power\non the tribe as distinct from one that restores the\ntribe's sovereign power because the tribe can't have the\nsovereign power as long as we are going to understand that\ntribe to have this subordinate sovereignty. And\ntherefore, for me the concepts that we're using pretty\nmuch force the conclusion that the -- that the power\nthat's being exercised is Federal not Indian.\nCould you comment on -- on that analysis?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I think there -- there\nare several responses to that point.\nFirst of all, I think it matters a lot whether\none views the limitations on tribal power as mandated by\nthe Constitution or as a product of Federal common law.\nAnd in -- and --\nQUESTION: Well, it may have a great deal to do\nwith whether we can change our conceptualization about\ndependent sovereignty, but as long as we keep that\nconceptualization, it seems to me we've got to accept the\nconclusion that -- that I suggested.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I -- I -- with respect, I\ndon't think that's correct because I think if it -- if it\nis not -- if this conception is not constitutionally\nmandated, then Congress has the authority, the plenary\nauthority, over Indian affairs to regulate, to modify\ntribal jurisdiction. And -- and in fact, I think that --\nthat --\nQUESTION: Okay, but if it does so, we have to\naccept the -- if we're going to follow that route, we will\nhave to accept the conclusion that the whole concept of\ndependent sovereignty has -- has been modified in -- in\nsome way because you can't have it both ways.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I -- I believe that's --\nthat's an expression of the dependency or a manifestation\nof the dependency, not in derogation of it, because\ndependent means that your ability to exercise authority --\nin this case, the Indian tribe is always subject to the\noverriding powers of the Federal Government. And what\nthis Court said precisely in the --\nQUESTION: Well, if that -- if that were all we\nmeant in Oliphant, we would have said the -- the Federal\nGovernment could take away this power by statute. We\ndidn't say the Federal Government could take away the\npower by statute. We said it is gone by virtue of the --\nthe sovereignty relationship.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it -- if -- if one looks back\nat the Oliphant decision, what the Court there described\nits -- its undertaking was was essentially a -- a -- an\narticulation of what it called Indian law which is a -- a\ncombination of judge-made law but against the backdrop of\ntreaties and statutes. Those treaties and statutes are\nnot themselves embodying constitutionally mandated rules.\nThey are the product of the political branches. They\nsometimes don't answer precise questions, and this Court\nis required to articulate judicial principles as best it\ncan against the backdrop of those principles. But because\nthose principles themselves are traced to treaties and\nstatutes, it must be up to -- Congress must have the\nauthority to modify those rules, and that's consistent\nwith its plenary power over Indian affairs.\nWhat this Court said in the Montana decision,\nwhich -- which has been identified as the path-marking\ndecision over -- concerning jurisdiction over non-tribal\nmembers, was what tribes lost by virtue of their dependent\nstatus was the power independently to determine their\nexternal relations.\nThis is not what we have here --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't that what we're\ntalking about --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No, it isn't --\nQUESTION: -- when we talk about sovereign\npower?\nMR. KNEEDLER: This is not a unilateral\nassertion of tribal power. This Court held in -- in\nOliphant and Duro, by looking at the -- at the backdrop of\n-- of statutory enactments, that its power had been\nlimited, but -- and the tribe did not unilaterally\novercome that. What Congress did was lift the limits so\nthat the tribe -- the tribe would then be authorized to\nexercise sovereign power that it previously had -- had\nhad.\nAnd it's in that -- it's directly analogous to\ntwo important examples that I think are very instructive\nhere. One is that Constitution itself in the Commerce\nClause has been held to, of its own force, preempt State\nlaws in the interstate commerce and also in the Indian\nCommerce Clause area. But Congress can, in the exercise\nof its authority over commerce under either one, lift\nthose restrictions and authorize States to regulate in\nareas they otherwise could not do.\nQUESTION: And that has always been thought to\nbe a great anomaly that a constitutional requirement could\nbe eliminated by a Federal statute. I -- I hope you're\nnot urging that as -- as a rule which should be followed.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but the point is that\nin that situation, even when the Constitution itself has,\nas a matter of constitutional law, limited State\nauthority, Congress can lift that.\nThe other -- the other example --\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- let's apply that\nacross the board then. I guess Congress can lift the\nFifth Amendment?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. It's --\nQUESTION: Clearly you're not going to urge --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. It's --\nQUESTION: Congress can lift the Double Jeopardy\nClause?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I'm -- I'm not speaking of\nBill -- Bill of Rights provisions. I'm speaking of\nCongress' Article I power.\nQUESTION: There's -- there's a distinction\nbetween the Bill of Rights and the rest of the\nConstitution.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, under -- under this Court's\ndecision -- decisions, Congress has been authorized to\nallow States to regulate in areas it -- it would otherwise\nnot be able to, and when it does so, it's exercising its\nown sovereign power, not power delegated by the Federal\nGovernment.\nThe other -- the other instructive example is\nPublic Law 280. Since the outset of the Constitution,\nreally by the -- by carrying forward arrangements of -- in\nIndian law prior to the adoption of the Constitution,\nStates have not been able to exercise jurisdiction over\nmatters involving Indians in Indian country absent an\naffirmative authorization by Congress. In Public Law 280\nCongress lifted those limitations and authorized tribes to\nexercise jurisdiction over Indians and others in Indian\ncountry.\nQUESTION: Authorized States.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: Authorized States.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me. Authorized States.\nAnd in doing so, those States are not exercising\ndelegated Federal power. Congress lifted a barrier to the\nexercise by States of their own sovereign power to\nprosecute according to their laws.\nQUESTION: So in saying that, what you're doing\n-- is what you're doing taking the word dependent in\ndomestic dependent nation and saying that Congress has a\ndegree of leeway to define what is and what is not\nencompassed by the word dependent so that if Congress\nwants to, it can say that whereas previously an exercise\nof pre-1650, your Indian jurisdiction, because they could\nhave, you know -- which was removed by the word dependent\nis not removed --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- because Congress -- Congress can\nredefine the term dependent?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I agree with your result.\n-- I think conceptually what I would say is dependent\ndefines the relationship between the tribe and the\nNational Government --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in this case Congress. And --\nand Congress in the -- in the exercise of its superior\nsovereignty is -- is defining the contours of the\ndependent sovereign's authority. So it -- it is a\nmanifestation of the dependent relationship.\nQUESTION: So when you look at Duro, it -- it\nsaid that what it found the exercise of criminal\njurisdiction inconsistent with was the notion of\ndependency in the phrase, domestic dependent nation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And --\nQUESTION: And -- and therefore -- and -- and\nthere -- so Congress has the authority to say no, at least\nas to future, it is not inconsistent.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nQUESTION: And -- and since this has nothing to\ndo with prior Indian tribal power but simply with\narrangements that Congress chooses to adopt, it\nnecessarily follows that Congress could provide that\nanyone in this room, whether an Indian -- whether an\nenrolled Indian or not, could be subjected to trial by a\n-- a tribal court and then subjected to a second trial,\ndespite the Double Jeopardy Clause, by a court of the\nUnited States. Right? Congress could provide that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I think that's right.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: I -- I find it hard to think that\nthat's all that the Double Jeopardy Clause means.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- this Court held in\nWheeler that prosecution by an Indian tribe of a -- of a\nmember of the tribe in that situation, followed by a\nprosecution by the Federal Government for what would --\nthe same conduct, was not the same offense because the\nultimate authority to prosecute derived from different\nsources. And we think the same --\nQUESTION: But derived from inherent tribal\nauthority, which had not been taken away. What's\ndifferent here is that it had been taken away and was\ngiven back, and it's hard to decide -- it's hard to\nconsider that inherent tribal authority, even though the\n-- the statute refers to it that way.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it -- I -- I think by\ninherent what the Court meant in both Oliphant and -- and\nin Duro was original sovereignty that has continued\nunlimited or unrestricted down to the present day. In\nother words, it -- it has been -- it has been allowed to\ncontinue, and in that sense it's inherent in being --\nQUESTION: That provides a limitation. That\nprovides a limitation to -- you know, to jurisdiction over\nthe -- over the tribal members, and that was a very\nimportant limitation. Now you're saying that limitation\ndoesn't exist.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I --\nQUESTION: It doesn't matter what has been\nallowed to -- to continue down to the present day.\nCongress can change all of that and permit jurisdiction\nover non-tribal members and, it necessarily follows,\npermit jurisdiction over non-Indians without violating the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- if we -- if we look at the\nreality of the nature of the prosecutions here, this was a\nprosecution brought by tribal officials in a tribally\nconstituted court enforcing provisions of tribal law, not\ntitle 18, under a tribal constitution. That --\nQUESTION: Are you saying that Congress could\nrequire the trial of non-Indians before a -- an Indian\ntribal court?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I believe the -- this\nCourt's decision in -- in Oliphant says so in several\nrespects. What the Court -- in several locations. What\nthe Court said in Oliphant is that the -- the tribes\nnecessarily lost their dependent -- excuse me -- by virtue\nof their dependent status, lost their ability to prosecute\nnon-Indians except in a manner acceptable to Congress. So\nthe -- the Court necessarily assumed that Congress could\nrevest this authority in the Indian tribes.\nQUESTION: This is maybe -- it's very\ninteresting. Suppose -- I would think on your approach\nthen that the rights that the individual tribe gets is a\nfunction of the Due Process Clause. And -- and is there\nany basis? After all, Indian tribal members are persons\nwithin the United States to whom the Due Process Clause is\napplicable. Imagine a tribe that does not give you\ncounsel in a criminal trial. That could happen. All\nright? Now, is there a basis under the Due Process Clause\nfor distinguishing between whether the defendant in such a\ncase is, A, a member of that tribe; B, a non-tribe member\nbut an Indian; C, a non-Indian?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things. First of\nall, the -- the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nunder this Court's decision in Talton probably would not\napply of its own force to the tribe. But what does apply\nis the Indian Civil Rights Act. What -- Congress filled\nthat void by -- by -- as a statutory matter requiring that\ncertain rights be --\nQUESTION: Well, the statute isn't going to help\nin terms of my question because I'm interested in\nCongress' power.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I think --\nQUESTION: And -- and maybe we don't have to\nreach that in this case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think --\nQUESTION: And maybe the answer to this case\nmakes no difference in respect to that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think -- I think in asking\na due process question, you might be asking -- a\nprocedural due process question, you might be asking an\nequal protection type question.\nQUESTION: I'm asking a question in respect to\nright to counsel, for example.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right -- right to counsel is not\n-- is not expressly guaranteed by the Indian Civil Rights\nAct. If there is a particular prosecution that is found\nto violate fundamental fairness because of the absence of\ncounsel, the Indian Civil Rights Act would -- would\nprovide a vehicle for that argument.\nQUESTION: Well, except -- except with respect\nto the Indian Civil Rights Act, you can -- you can -- and\nI think this solves due process problems. You -- you can\nassert the maxim of volenti non fit injuria. You -- you\nare not subject to -- to this kind of trial unless you\nchoose to be an enrolled member of the tribe. You can\nwithdraw from that at any time.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: But to now extend the Government's\npower to subject people to this kind of trial beyond\nmembers of the -- of the tribe that -- that has the tribal\ncourt to members of other tribes and, as you necessarily\nacknowledge, even to non-Indians, that's a -- that's a\nstep I'm -- I'm not prepared to contemplate.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, with -- first of all, with\nrespect to members of tribes other than the prosecuting\ntribe, Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority\nover tribes we think certainly should have the power to\nregulate the relationship among tribes, tribes with each\nother, and relationships of tribes and their respective\nmembers with each other.\nQUESTION: Well, would it --\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's what Congress has done\nhere.\nQUESTION: Would it be a defense, say, to\nsomeone charged with a crime in Wisconsin to say volenti\nnon fit -- you move to Minnesota. They don't treat you --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, it would not. And that's --\nthat is another -- there -- there are really two different\nquestions. One, can someone be subjected to the\njurisdiction of a court when he's not participating in the\n-- in the process there? And that happens all the time\nwhen people are prosecuted in another jurisdiction.\nThere's a separate question of -- of what\nprocedural protections would be afforded in such a trial,\nand that's where the Indian Civil Rights Act steps in.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, just to bring it back\nto this case, as I understand it, there was no due process\nor equal protection challenge by Mr. Lara. He's\ncontesting the second proceeding.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's correct. In\nfact, it's a necessary -- he has to accept the validity of\nhis -- of his prior prosecution and -- and leave it\nstanding in order to --\nQUESTION: Because if it's not valid, then he's\nbeing prosecuted for the first time.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. That -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: Yes, but all these questions are very\nrelevant to whether we should accept your -- or -- or the\nGovernment's assertion of what Congress can do. Those --\nif -- if your -- your proposal raises all of these serious\nconstitutional questions, we're less inclined, it seems to\nme, to adopt that proposal.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there -- there's I think\nanother important point to be made about the nature of\nCongress' powers in this area. To say that an Indian\ntribe could only prosecute a non-member -- a non-member\nIndian through the exercise of delegated Federal power\nwould itself be a -- a substantial constitutional anomaly.\nI think it's important to -- to consider the\nscope of Congress' plenary powers within the framework of\nthe structure of the Constitution itself. The --\nQUESTION: But -- but -- so -- so what you're\nsaying is that if the Court has very substantial concerns\nover the Government's proposition that within the\nterritorial United States a non-constitutional entity can\nbe allowed to try a United States citizen, if we have\nconcerns about that, you're giving us no ability to draw a\nline so that you can prevail in this case. You are -- it\nseems to me that you are conceding, by your last\nstatement, that if we rule in favor of your position, it\nmust necessarily apply to non-Indians.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- I --\nQUESTION: And this is an astounding\nproposition.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I did not -- I did not mean to\nsay -- to say that. I mean, first of all, I think\nOliphant contemplates that. What rights would attach is\n-- is a separate question.\nBut I -- but I do think that there is a distinct\nauthority for Congress to regulate or to permit a tribe to\nexercise jurisdiction over members of other tribes. This\nis a power that has historically been left to tribes by\nthe Federal statutory regime in Indian country since 1817\ndown to the present time. There is still an exception --\nQUESTION: Yes, but that was before Indians were\ncitizens of the United States.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- no. That has continued up\nto the present time. There is still an exception in the\nstatutory regime for tribes to --\nQUESTION: Yes, but one wonders if you go beyond\nmembers of the tribe itself to outsiders, whether that\ndistinction between citizens of the United States is\nvalid.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I believe it is. In -- in\nDuro itself, the Court said that citizenship does not\ndetract from Congress' plenary power over Indian affairs.\nThe -- the last point I wanted to make and then\nI would like to reserve the --\nQUESTION: But that was -- that was not in the\ncontext of regulating non-Indians.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Here we're talking about --\nthis case involves non-member Indians, and as I said, the\nability of Congress to regulate relationships between\ntribes and -- and their members would seem to be at the\ncore of the power.\nAnd as this Court has said in its federalism\ncases, it would be a -- a mixing of sovereignty to regard\nthe States as mere agents of the Federal Government. They\nare separate sovereigns, and we think the same is true --\nQUESTION: Yes, but they are also not dependent\nsovereigns.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's --\nQUESTION: I mean, there's an entirely different\nconceptualization involved.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But again, in our -- in our view,\nthe dependency describes Congress' power to regulate and\nlimit and prescribe the rights available in tribal courts.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Reichert, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER F. REICHERT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. REICHERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen Congress amended the Indian Civil rights\nAct in response to this Court's invitation in Duro,\nCongress exceeded its power by overruling this -- this\nCourt's determination on the limits of tribal sovereignty.\nThe tribal power that Congress can give and take away\ncannot by definition be a sovereign power. The tribal\ncourt, acting without its own sovereign authority,\nprosecuted Billy Jo Lara using this Federal authority, and\nhis subsequent Federal prosecution, therefore, double --\nviolated the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nQUESTION: If we take your approach then in\ntrying to carry out what was the will of Congress, I think\nwe'd have to say that the first prosecution doesn't count\nbecause the one thing is -- seems to me pretty clear from\nthis record, that Congress did not want to have a\nsituation where there was a delegation of Federal\nauthority. The whole idea was that you would have the\nFederal -- the possibility of the Federal prosecution and\nthe tribal prosecution. I -- I think that it's -- it's\ninescapably clear that that's what Congress wanted to do,\nto preserve the possibility of a U.S. attorney\nprosecution.\nSo if you're right, then I think making the --\nthe bottom line what would Congress do if it couldn't\naccomplish what it set out to accomplish, one would say,\nwell, all bets are off and not adopt your position that\nCongress chose to delegate Federal authority when it seems\nto me pretty clear that it didn't.\nMR. REICHERT: Your Honor, I believe that\nCongress' intent was clear on two points. The first point\nwas that they were attempting to restore tribal\nsovereignty, which they cannot do by its definition. But\nthey were also clearly trying to close a jurisdictional\ngap, a jurisdictional loophole.\nUnder the Government's contention, the entire\nstatute should be thrown out and neither one of those\nclear intents from Congress can be saved. But under the\n-- under what the Eighth Circuit did and under what I'm\nasking this Court to do, the -- one of those intents can\nbe saved and that is --\nQUESTION: But you can't do that. You can't --\nyou can't achieve the end by a means other than the means\nwhich Congress provided to that end. It did, indeed,\nintend to close a gap, but the means which it selected to\nclose that gap was the reconferral -- the attempted\nreconferral of inherent sovereignty upon the Indian\ntribes. There's no delegation language in that. They\nclearly chose the means to the end of -- of covering the\ngap, the means of reconferring sovereignty. And if that\nis invalid, then the statute is invalid. We -- we have no\npower to transmogrify it into a -- a delegation when it\nclearly is not that.\nMR. REICHERT: And if this Court was to\ndetermine that this is a -- that this is not a delegation\nand that this Court determines that the statute cannot be\nsaved, then Mr. Lara still was prosecuted in the tribal\ncourt. He was still prosecuted under color of law. He\nserved 90 days in the tribal jail on this offense, 155\ndays total.\nThe tribal court believed it was acting\nproperly. It was told by Congress. Congress is the body\nwhich tells the tribe what to do.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you have authority for\nthe proposition that if you're tried by a court without\njurisdiction, it's nevertheless sufficient to invoke\ndouble jeopardy, if we have to reach that here? Do you\nhave authority for that or is that a novel proposition?\nMR. REICHERT: I don't believe that it's novel.\nThere is -- this Court has not ruled that a court without\njurisdiction can, therefore, subject some -- can subject\nsomebody to initial jeopardy in the double jeopardy sense.\nBut the Fifth Amendment clearly -- the Fifth\nAmendment does not protect against dual investigations or\ndual prosecutions. It protects against dual punishment,\nand Mr. Lara has been punished. He served 90 days in\njail. Congress can't now --\nQUESTION: What if -- what if he'd been\nprosecuted in France and served 90 days there and then he\nwas tried here? Would that be double jeopardy?\nMR. REICHERT: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, and -- and furthermore, you\nhave a habeas remedy after the first -- after the first\ntrial to -- to object to the sentence.\nGetting back to the -- to the point, why is it\n-- let's assume for the moment -- it's just an assumption\n-- that the -- that the tribes had as a historical matter\nthe sovereign authority to try non-member Indians and that\nCongress took that away. Could Congress then give it\nback?\nMR. REICHERT: Congress can -- could always give\nit back under a delegation. Congress always has the power\nto --\nQUESTION: Why -- why would it be a delegation?\nWhy couldn't they say we -- we define the scope of Indian\nsovereignty and we -- we ratchet it up and we ratchet it\ndown?\nMR. REICHERT: What Congress takes away and\nCongress gives back is a power of Congress. It can't be a\nreaffirmation of a tribal sovereign power. That which --\nQUESTION: May -- may I interrupt you on that?\nSupposing they had a -- a procedure for electing their\nchiefs and Congress said that's unfair to women or\nsomething, so you can't do it anymore, and then 10 years\nlater just repealed the statute. Would they then have\ndelegated the power to elect the chiefs the way they did\nit for 100 years?\nMR. REICHERT: I think technically they would,\nbut in that situation it's -- it's not so important\nwhether they're using a delegated power or a sovereign\npower because this case presents unique facts where\nsovereignty becomes of paramount importance because of\nthis Court's adoption of the dual sovereignty doctrine.\nIn many instances, Congress delegates authority and it --\nthe importance of whether it be a delegation or whether it\nbe a -- a re-recognition or a restoration of inherent\ntribal sovereignty is not nearly as important. And in\nthat case, I think it would be a delegation of Federal\npower, but I don't think it would affect the election of\nthe tribal chairmen.\nQUESTION: Mr. Reichert --\nQUESTION: They could do it with Puerto Rico,\ncouldn't they? Sorry. With Puerto Rico, can't Congress,\nfor example, define the sovereign relation between the\nUnited States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I\nwould have thought it had considerable power there. And\nif it can do it there, why can't it do it here?\nI mean, you could enter into a treaty changing\nthe nature of the sovereign power and the House of\nRepresentatives and the Senate have basically taken to\nthemselves through statute the treaty-making authority.\nAnd so what's -- why is this any different from -- from\nredefining the nature of the sovereign relationship\nbetween, say, Guam, Puerto Rico, a whole -- you know,\nthose entities that are not States?\nMR. REICHERT: When Congress acts with -- as it\nacts towards Puerto Rico, it can use its treaty powers and\nnot be conferring sovereign power on Puerto Rico. And\nPuerto Rico is considerably --\nQUESTION: Suppose it does. Suppose it says the\ncommonwealth, which is a totally uncertain concept,\nhenceforth means A, B, C, D, and E. All right? Now --\nnow, whether that's wise or not wise I have no idea, but I\ndon't see anything in the Constitution that would stop\nCongress from doing that. And if there is nothing there,\nwhy is there here where, in fact -- I don't want to repeat\nmyself.\nBut my understanding of this is that over the\nyears Congress has, through legislation -- or Congress has\nchanged the making of the treaty to define the\nrelationship into a situation where we define the\nrelationship with the Indian tribes through legislation.\nQUESTION: What about Philippines?\nQUESTION: At least I don't see why they --\nQUESTION: I assume we did precisely that with\nthe Philippines, and I -- I guess Justice Breyer is\nsuggesting that we can simply revoke Philippine\nindependence, which we -- which we graciously gave them,\nand now, since it was all done through the treaty power,\nwe can just revoke it.\nQUESTION: But this is the opposite. I suppose\nwe could --\nMR. REICHERT: To address that, Puerto Rico is\ndifferent than a State and Puerto Rico and States are very\ndifferent from tribes. Tribes are dependent nations.\nThey are a unique body within our constitutional\nframework.\nAnd when Congress acts in relation to tribes,\nthey can act in a number of different ways. In fact,\nCongress can completely take away a tribe's sovereignty,\nbut it cannot restore that sovereignty once it's -- it has\ntaken it away. The reason that this -- the reason that\nthis is --\nQUESTION: Can I just -- it seems to me that's a\ncritical part of the case where the -- supposing the tribe\nhad a -- a criminal statute and saying you cannot cut\ntrees above 5,000 feet on the mountains because that's\nsacred land or something like that. And Congress decided\nthey wanted to build a road up there, so they preempted\nthe -- the Indian statute and said we cannot enforce that\nstatute. Then after they built the road, they decided,\nwell, they'd let them go back to the way they did, and\nthey said we repeal the preempting statute. Now, would\nthat be a delegation of power to -- to protect those\nreligious grounds, or would that be just a restoration of\na preexisting sovereign power?\nMR. REICHERT: I believe that that would be a\ndelegation of Congress' power. Once it has taken\nsomething away, it cannot give it back. And powers which\nare -- which are sovereign cannot be defined as sovereign\nwhen --\nQUESTION: Where -- where do you get the\nauthority for that one-way ratcheting when we've said that\nCongress has plenary power over the tribes? What opinion\nof this Court do you look to for that proposition?\nMR. REICHERT: I would look to Oliphant or to\nUnited States v. Sioux Nation or the Alcea Band of the\nTillamook Tribe wherein this Court said Congress' plenary\npower is not absolute. Congress -- this Court has often\nsaid Congress has plenary power, but that plenary power is\nnot absolute. And one of the -- one of the most important\nlimitations on Congress' power with regard to Indian\ntribes is that it must be subject to the limitations of\nthe Constitution.\nQUESTION: Okay. Mr. Reichert, may I interrupt\nyou there? Because I -- I think -- I think there are two\ndifferent arguments in play in -- in what's going on here,\nand I thought you had started out with one and now you\nseem to be going to a different one.\nOne argument is Congress didn't take away this\npower over -- the tribal power to -- to prosecute non-\ntribal members. There's no act of Congress that said they\ncan't do that. The reason they can't do that is there's a\nsovereignty relationship. There's no act of Congress that\narticulated that sovereignty relationship. It's just the\nway we understand things. The tribes are dependent\nsovereigns.\nAnd on that theory -- that's where I -- I\nthought you were coming from originally, and -- and on\nthat theory, Congress can't restore it because it can't\nchange that relationship, or at least it hasn't changed\nthat relationship of -- of dependent sovereignty.\nA second way that -- that is being explored here\nis -- is on the assumption that Congress by some act took\naway the sovereignty to prosecute non-tribal members and\nnow wants to give it back.\nI'm not sure what the answer should be in the\nsecond case, but I thought your argument depended on the\nfirst case or the first example. Is -- is that correct?\nMR. REICHERT: The --\nQUESTION: In other words, it's -- it's the\nsovereign relationship rather than an act of Congress that\ntakes away that is crucial for understanding the issue\nhere.\nMR. REICHERT: If I could just -- it's this\nCourt that said that that -- that recognized -- and its\nrole is to say what the law is -- looked at the dependent\nnature of the Indian tribes and said this does not exist.\nThis power to prosecute --\nQUESTION: We said that in Oliphant, among other\nthings.\nMR. REICHERT: Correct.\nQUESTION: Yes, okay.\nQUESTION: So it's a power always to take away,\nbut never to give back that's --\nMR. REICHERT: Yes, but Congress can always give\nback using their plenary power. Congress can always\ndelegate powers back to the tribes. It simply cannot make\nsovereign that which is not. That which is --\nQUESTION: But do we -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Can I interrupt --\nQUESTION: Do we -- we have to get --\nQUESTION: What transformed the tribes from\nindependent sovereigns to dependent sovereigns was not a\ndecision of this Court and the act of Congress. It was\nthe acts of the legislature and they took over a lot of\nthings that were previously independent sovereignty of the\ntribes. And if you go back a couple hundred years, they\nclearly had their own inherent power to try non-members.\nMaybe they lost it in the change in the relationship\nbetween the United States and the tribe, but that's not as\na result of an act of Congress or a decision of this\nCourt. It's the result of historical events.\nMR. REICHERT: It's a result, Your Honor, of\ntheir accepting the dependent -- accepting the protection\nand the benefits and the burdens of the United States.\nAnd that boils down to the essential question which is who\nhas the -- who has the final authority on what the limits\non inherent sovereignty are. Is it this body or is it\nCongress? And --\nQUESTION: Essentially the trouble I have with\nyour case is that it depends on making a distinction\nbetween the status of -- of Indian sovereignty which\nhasn't yet been taken away but which exists totally the\nwhim of Congress. And that, you say, is not -- is -- that\ndoes not allow the Double Jeopardy Clause to be invoked\nbecause -- I don't know what. You call that sovereignty,\nthat dependent sovereignty? But you say, however, if\nCongress acts to take it away, then it can't give it back.\nIt seems to me in both cases whatever power the\nIndian tribe has is power that exists at the pleasure of\nthe United States, and I don't know why in -- the one case\nis any better than the other as far as the Double Jeopardy\nClause is concerned. Whatever power they exercise, they\nexercise because we let them exercise it. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. REICHERT: That's right, and --\nQUESTION: Well, why shouldn't the -- I mean, I\n-- I -- if the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't apply in one\nsituation, it seems to me it shouldn't apply in the other.\nMR. REICHERT: And Billy Jo Lara was prosecuted\nusing Federal power, and that's -- and that's the premise.\nHe -- when he was prosecuted by the tribe, he was\nprosecuted using Federal power. And then his subsequent\nprosecution in the Federal court --\nQUESTION: Why -- why doesn't Gideon v.\nWainwright and all the other provisions of the Bill of\nRights apply?\nMR. REICHERT: To Billy Jo Lara as a non-member\nof the tribe? I think that it should apply.\nQUESTION: To -- to any Indian tribal\nprosecution of its own -- even of its own members.\nMR. REICHERT: Because this Court said in United\nStates v. Wheeler that the -- the member of a tribe has\naccepted the benefits and the burdens of being a member of\nthat tribe, and one of the burdens is that the Bill of\nRights does not apply. And at any time that tribal member\ncan decide to leave his or her tribe and no longer be a\nmember, no longer accept the benefits and no longer accept\nthe burdens, which is the fundamental unfairness of either\nplacing a non-Indian or a non-member Indian before a\ntribal court which does not give that person their full\nconstitutional rights.\nQUESTION: So -- so the answer then to the due\nprocess problem, which you've just given, is that the --\nthe member -- the tribal member, the non-tribal Indian,\nand the non-Indian are all persons subject to the Due\nProcess Clause, but what counts is due process may vary\nbetween whether you are a tribal member or not because of\nthe argument you just gave. Now, if that's so, that\nsolves that problem.\nThen we're back to the question of why not allow\nCongress to define sovereignty. I thought Justice\nScalia's point was a very good point to mention the\nPhilippines. If you reverse it, don't we have the\nauthority in the United States to give the Philippines\nindependence? And if in fact, we get into the habit of\nmaking that kind of decision through a congressional law,\nwhy could we not do the same to the Indian tribes?\nAnd if there is a boundary there, it must have\nto do with the nature of a Constitution of the United\nStates, not some language. And I can't find anything here\nthat would suggest that in doing this, that boundary is\npassed.\nSo what's -- what's the answer to that kind of\nargument?\nMR. REICHERT: Your Honor, as I understand your\nquestion, you're looking for where in the Constitution\nCongress has the power or this -- or this body has the\npower.\nQUESTION: To the contrary. I'm saying\nnaturally Congress has the power to take, let's say,\nsomething that is not a State -- it is like Puerto Rico or\nthe Philippines -- and to say we are changing the status\nof that entity.\nNow, I would think you'd start from the\nproposition that they do have the power to define the\nrelationship of entities that are not States to the United\nStates. Now, if there is a limit on that, it must be\nfound either explicitly, which I can't find, or implicitly\nin the nature of the constitutional document itself. So I\nam looking to you to tell me any kind of limit like that\nwhich might prevent what Congress tried to do here.\nMR. REICHERT: Congress has specific enumerated\npowers in the Constitution. Nowhere in those specific\nenumerated powers -- and the Government has pointed to no\nspecific enumerated powers that allows Congress to take\nthe action they did.\nQUESTION: I want to turn the question then.\nWhich is the power that allowed us to give independence to\nthe Philippines? Which is the power that allowed us to\npass the Federal Relations Act or the Commonwealth\nRelations Act that defines the relationship with Puerto\nRico? Which is the power -- where -- where are these\npowers in the -- I'm not saying they're not there. I'm\nsaying that I'm not an expert in this area and I -- I'd\nlike you to make this argument of where they are.\nMR. REICHERT: In the Treaty Clause. And\nCongress and the executive branch can have relations with\nother nations through the Treaty Clause and can define\ntheir relation.\nBut this Court has said that dealings with the\ntribe is more than treaties and more than statutes, that\nit also depends on the relationship of the tribes to this\ndependent nation. And in giving their -- in -- in\naccepting the protection of the United States, the tribes\naccepted the burdens and necessarily gave up certain\naspects of their sovereignty.\nQUESTION: Now, my impression is that we used to\ndo this through treaty, but at some point the House of\nRepresentatives was somewhat unhappy about not having a\nrole in this and therefore it became changed such that the\nrelationship with the Indian tribes is defined through\nagreement ratified and enacted into law by both houses of\nCongress. Now, was that unconstitutional to do that?\nMR. REICHERT: I'm not sure that it was -- if it\nwas unconstitutional or not, but I don't think that's the\nimportant distinction, Your Honor. What the important\ndistinction is is where does this power to now deal with\nIndian tribes and to -- what they're trying to do is\ndefine sovereignty and take any role that this Court has\nin defining sovereignty away. Under the Government's\nanalysis --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose that if this\nCourt said that the nature of sovereignty is such that it\nhas certain limits and that this is imposed because of the\nConstitution and because of long use, perhaps Congress\ncouldn't change it. But we haven't said that.\nMR. REICHERT: But Congress --\nQUESTION: We have not said that. Duro didn't\nsay that. Duro said we'll look at the statute. Congress\ndidn't give this power. End of case. That's all.\nInsofar as the territories, because that's under\nArticle IV of the Constitution, it has nothing to do with\nthis case.\nMR. REICHERT: And Congress is already\nattempting to -- with the Hicks fix to overrule Hicks,\nMontana, and Oliphant. And if this Court gives to\nCongress all the powers that the Government is asking them\nto --\nQUESTION: That may well be a different case\nbecause then we're concerned with the powers of -- of\nIndian tribes as a historical matter of their sovereignty\nover citizens of the United States who have direct\nrelations, responsibilities, obligations, and rights both\nwith their States and with the National Government, and\nunder the insular cases, the Constitution applies with\nfull force to the territory of the United States. So\nthat's a very different -- that's a very different case.\nMR. REICHERT: But Mr. Lara owes no allegiance\nwhatsoever to the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe. He's a member\nof a different tribe. Using -- he is a citizen of the\nUnited States just like any other Indian. He receives no\nbenefits from the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe.\nQUESTION: Then you're making a -- then you're\nmaking a constitutional argument and it's an appropriate\nargument. But I -- I don't think it follows from that\nthat within the realm where Congress does have authority,\ni.e., the relations of Indian tribes with their own\nmembers, that it can't give in one year and take away the\n-- the other year. I -- I just don't think you need that\nargument to prevail in your case.\nMR. REICHERT: In -- and thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REICHERT: The -- and it is -- it is\ncritically important to look at what a tribe -- what\npowers a tribe exerts over its members and what -- what\nsomebody who is a member of a tribe traveling across the\ncountry, traveling across an interstate highway and is not\na member of that tribe, comes onto a reservation for no\nreason other than to get through that reservation --\nQUESTION: What about someone who lives on the\nreservation, marries a woman who is a member of the tribe?\nWhy doesn't the tribe have at least the sovereign\nauthority -- it's always at the sufferance of Congress,\nbut to say when things go wrong on our reservation, when\nour people are hurt, we are entitled to prosecute the\nwrongdoer?\nMR. REICHERT: Because if the Court were to\nadopt that position, then there would be no reason not to\nsubject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction as well.\nThat's a contact --\nQUESTION: Well, how do you distinguish Brendale\nwith a zoning ordinance and so forth? Is criminal\njurisdiction different?\nMR. REICHERT: Criminal -- criminal jurisdiction\nis significantly different than civil jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: And -- and what's -- what's the\nauthority for that?\nMR. REICHERT: I believe that that's in my\nbrief, Your Honor. I don't have that cite in front of me.\nThe -- but in -- in Duro this Court said that in\nthe criminal -- that the criminal context is unique, and\nthat in the -- in the realm of criminal law, we must first\nlook -- no matter what we think of history, no matter what\nour interpretation is of history and statutes and\ntreaties, this must be examined under the guise that Billy\nJo Lara, or in that case Albert Duro, is a citizen first\nand foremost of the United States.\nQUESTION: But then you've given the answer to\nyour own question. If you're right -- if you're right\nthat this does -- is absolutely, you know, a violation of\ndue process to subject the non-tribal member, say, to a\ntrial without a lawyer, well, then you would win, but not\nthis case. What you would win is a case where there was\nan appeal from the tribal prosecution, and under those\ncircumstances, they had raised the question just as you\nphrased it, say it may not violate due process, for the\nreasons you gave, not to give the tribal member a lawyer,\nbut it does violate due process for Congress to pass a law\nwhich subjects me to this criminal trial without a lawyer\nbecause I am not a tribal member. So if you are right,\nthere is a vehicle to make that claim and you will win or\nyour client will. But he didn't take advantage of that\nvehicle in this case.\nMR. REICHERT: And -- and it's interesting. The\nGovernment says in numerous instances that habeas relief\nis an appropriate remedy. This Court recognized in Duro\nthat habeas is not an appropriate remedy, and it's not for\ntwo reasons, the first being habeas relief requires an in-\ncustody -- has an in-custody requirement. Mr. Lara is\nquickly out of custody.\nAnd without a lawyer, how can one be expected to\nraise complex Federal rights such as habeas? When one\nwalks into a courtroom, one does not walk in and say --\nQUESTION: Well, we do it all the time. We have\na lot of pro se applicants that make very complex\narguments. That's not new.\nMR. REICHERT: But it's not required to step\ninto a courtroom in the United States and say before this\nproceeding starts, I want to invoke all of my rights.\nThose rights must be waived. And at no point were these\n-- were these rights waived by Mr. Lara.\nQUESTION: Of course, he'd be subjected to the\nsame thing on his own reservation, on the reservation of\nhis own tribe, and you say that's okay.\nMR. REICHERT: This Court has said that -- that\nprosecuting a member on his own tribe is okay because he\nhas -- he has consented to that.\nQUESTION: Mightn't there be such a thing as,\nyou know, when -- when you enroll in any tribe, you\nsubject yourself to what might be call Indian law --\nMR. REICHERT: No --\nQUESTION: -- the law of your tribal council and\nthe law of -- of other tribal councils? And just as\nyou're not entitled to an attorney before your own tribal\ncouncil, you're not entitled to an attorney before another\none. Why -- that -- that would be a sensible resolution\nit seems to me.\nMR. REICHERT: It would be wonderful if tribes\nwere the same, but tribes are not. Tribes are distinctly\ndifferent. To say that the -- that somebody in -- an\nIndian in Alaska is going to know what the criminal laws\nin the State of Florida are going to be is simply not the\ncase. He's not going to understand the customs. He --\nthis person would not have had any input into the tribal\ncouncil, what the laws were, who the judges --\nQUESTION: How does that differ from somebody\nfrom Virginia who caused some trouble in Louisiana and\ndoesn't want to go to the Louisiana courts because they\nhave this mixed civil/common law system?\nMR. REICHERT: Because a criminal defendant in\nLouisiana under your -- under your example would have the\nfull benefit of the Bill of Rights which a -- which an\nIndian does not have in tribal courts. And that's the\ndifference. They would -- he would -- that person would\nhave a Louisiana lawyer who understood Louisiana law and\ncould speak on his behalf. Gideon v. Wainwright is --\nthere is wonderful language in there, talking about how\nimportant it is to have a lawyer.\nQUESTION: But this is --\nQUESTION: Yes, but if -- if --\nQUESTION: -- this is so hypothetical because\nthere's nothing in this record to show that he asked for a\nlawyer, was denied a lawyer. We have to assume that --\nthat's -- that's not an issue in this case. You're --\nyou're not forced to have a lawyer.\nQUESTION: But even beyond that, if you convince\nus that the other -- the other conviction is void, what's\nthe basis for double jeopardy?\nMR. REICHERT: Because Mr. Lara was prosecuted\nunder the color of law. He was prosecuted. He went to\njail for 90 days, and he --\nQUESTION: Yes, but there's no valid judgment if\nyou're right.\nMR. REICHERT: And Mr. Lara never attacked his\n-- his judgment. The Government is attacking his\njudgment, coming in -- he -- he never attacked his\njudgment. Now the Government is coming in attacking his\njudgment collaterally in order to exact a more harsh\nsentence in Federal court.\nQUESTION: No. They're relying on the dual\nsovereignty doctrine. And you -- you don't seem to me to\nchallenge that either, do you? You're not asking us to\nreexamine the basic double jeopardy doctrine.\nMR. REICHERT: No, I am not, Your Honor. No, I\nam not.\nAnd -- and the tribe, acting under the direction\nof Congress which has control over the Indian\nreservations, acting under what they thought was a valid\nstatute, acting under a statute that would not be invalid\nuntil this Court speaks, was placed in jail and has\nsuffered the constraints of being in jail, then was\nsubsequently prosecuted by that same body by Congress and\nwas indicted and now is going to be prosecuted a second\ntime. The Government can't rewrite the logs of the jail.\nHe was there and he -- and the fact that he was punished\nis clear.\nFor these reasons, I ask this Court to affirm\nthe decision of the Eighth Circuit and to find that Billy\nJo's -- Billy Jo Lara's subsequent Federal prosecution\nviolated double jeopardy. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Can I ask just one question? Of what\ntribe is Lara a member?\nMR. REICHERT: The -- the --\nQUESTION: Well, it will be in the record.\nDo you know if there is a -- any kind of an\nagreement between his tribe and the prosecuting tribe?\nMR. REICHERT: No. In fact -- no, there is not.\nAnd historically there wouldn't have been. They are two\ntribes that were bitter enemies throughout history and --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Reichert.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe first point I'd like to make is that this\ncase only involves the question of whether Congress can\nauthorize tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians who\nare members of other tribes or affiliated with other\ntribes, not non-member Indians. And that -- that point is\nsignificant because it calls into -- into play additional\npowers that Congress has in this area particularly\ndefining the attributes of membership in a tribe.\nCongress has -- among those attributes are the eligibility\nfor special benefits, educational benefits, health\nbenefits, housing benefits. So someone from another\ntribe --\nQUESTION: And I take it tribal membership is\nalways consensual in the context that we're talking about?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think -- I think it would\n-- yes, it would be. Someone always would have the -- the\nability to disavow his -- his Indian affiliation. I think\nthat would be an important part of it.\nBut -- so what Congress has done here is simply\nto identify another attribute of membership or affiliation\nwith a tribe, which is that if you're on another tribe's\nreservation, you will be subject to that tribe's criminal\njurisdiction. And that is important to law and order on\nmany reservations, as Congress itself realized when it\nenacted this statute in 1991.\nQUESTION: Is it correct that a defendant in the\ncase right before the trial starts could disavow his\nIndian status?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. He could not -- I -- I think\nhe -- as long as he was affiliated at the time of the\nconduct, I think -- I think the -- the consequences would\n-- would flow from that.\nQUESTION: I wonder if that -- why that would\nfollow? If he had that absolute right, it seems to me\nanytime before judgment he should -- he could say I'm\nstopped being an Indian.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I -- I think -- I think\nCongress at least under the Necessary and Proper Clause\ncould allow a tribe to maintain jurisdiction over\nsomething that happened while the person was tribally\naffiliated.\nThe -- another fundamental point is the one that\nJustice Breyer mentioned is that there is nothing in the\nConstitution that prohibits, the places a limit in this\nsituation on Congress' exercise of its plenary power over\nIndian affairs. And in fact, there's much in the\nConstitution that points to the contrary. The\nConstitution refers to the Indian tribes, and as this\nCourt has said, that reference to tribes and to the\ntreaty-making power recognizes tribes as sovereigns, not\nsimply voluntary organizations, but in the Constitution\nitself recognizes them as sovereigns. And the Court has\nsaid that because of those powers and implicit from that\nis the power of Congress to exercise protective authority\nover Indian tribes. And here that protection includes\nprotection of tribal -- tribes from crimes committed by\nother tribal members.\nIn solving this serious law enforcement problem,\nCongress was entitled to be guided by the Constitution\nitself which recognizes the tribes as sovereign and to\nvest authority in them as sovereign rather than act in\nderogation of the Constitution by deeming the tribes to be\nagents of the Federal Government when a tribal prosecutor\nis bringing a prosecution under tribal law in -- in tribal\ncourt.\nAnd Congress could rationally reach this\nconclusion for another important reason, and that is the\nlesson in history. History is very important in Indian\naffairs, and Congress throughout history, since 1817 under\na jurisdictional regime that remains in effect, has left\nto tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction over members\nof other tribes, as this Court said in United States v.\nRodgers where it construed the Indian against Indian\nexception as intended to allow tribe matters not -- and it\nexpressly said, not only with -- with their own tribe but\nother tribes, to be left to the tribe.\nQUESTION: Could the Congress define a -- a\ncriminal offense between one Indian as another Indian and\nrequire that the trial be in a tribal court?\nMR. KNEEDLER: A title 18 offense?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think that --\nQUESTION: Because my next question would be if\nthey did, could there then be double jeopardy if there was\na second trial.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that would -- that --\nthat might present a -- a separate problem, but if the --\nbecause there -- it might be the same offense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\n"
