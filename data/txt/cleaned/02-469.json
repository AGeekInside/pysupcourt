Kenneth Nord.\nMr. Paterson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PATERSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a treating\nphysician rule in ERISA cases which requires the plan\nadministrator to either accept the opinion of a treating\nphysician or to reject that opinion by specific legitimate\nreasons based upon substantial evidence.\nCircuit says that this rule gives special weight,\ndeference, and a presumption to the opinions of treating\nphysicians.\nThe failure to follow this rule has two effects.\nFirst, a finding that the plan administrator has a\nconflict of interest which mandates de novo review, and\nsecondly, on de novo review, that the plan administrator's\ndecision was not reasonable.\nThe Ninth Circuit's --\nQUESTION: Now, the Secretary has adopted some\nrequirements of explanation of reasons where the\nphysicians differ in their views. Has -- has the\nSecretary done something of the sort?\nMR. PATERSON: The Secretary has adopted\nregulations, which were effective in January 1 of 2002,\nwhich require a plan administrator to obtain the opinion\nof an expert medical professional to -- to advise him\nregarding medical opinions and to be able to provide an\nexpert medical opinion to the claimant if he requests it.\nThat would not apply, of course, to this case since this\nclaim was filed in 1997.\nQUESTION: And is there a requirement to give\nreasons if there is a difference of views between the\ntreating physician and the expert?\nMR. PATERSON: No.\nprovide reasons to -- or between the two physicians'\nopinions. There has always been a requirement under ERISA\nand the regulations that a plan administrator explain the\nreasons for his denial of a claim.\nQUESTION: And this claim was denied?\nMR. PATERSON: This claim was denied.\nQUESTION: Were the reasons given in this case?\nMR. PATERSON: Yes, they were, Your Honor. They\nwere given by the plan administrator in writing to the\nclaimant. He told the claimant that he was, in fact,\ndenying the claim based on the opinion of Dr. Mitri.\nHe told them he was denying the claim because he\ndid not meet the plan definition of total -- I'm sorry --\ncomplete inability to perform the job of a material\nplanner.\nHe told them that part of the reason for denying\nthe claim was the fact that the plan administrator had\nasked the claimant to please have his treating physicians\ncomment on the opinion of Dr. Mitri. He did that twice.\nHe did it in writing. And in neither case did the\nrespondent respond with any -- from the treating\nphysicians -- with any response from their -- the treating\nphysicians.\nAnd he also did it on the basis that Janmarie\nForward's opinion, who was a human resource\nrepresentative, was not -- did not change his opinion. So\nthere were those --\nQUESTION: And -- and under the Secretary's\nrules, if there is in fact a conflict of interest, it can\nbe weighed in making that ultimate resolution by the\ncourt?\nMR. PATERSON: No. There's -- there's nothing\nin the -- if you mean the Secretary of Labor's rules,\nthere's nothing in the Secretary of Labor's rules which\nrelates to any weighing of a conflict of interest by the\nplan administrator. There is a -- a provision in the case\nof Firestone v. Bruch in which the Court in that case said\nthat if the plan administrator --\nQUESTION: This Court has suggested that a\nconflict of interest can be weighed.\nMR. PATERSON: This Court said that in Firestone\nv. Bruch.\nAnd -- but the question in that case that has\nbeen not -- it has not been decided in that case and which\nhas created a conflict of interest of -- I'm sorry -- a\nconflict among the circuits is the question of what does\nit mean to weigh. Does it mean to weigh the conflict of\ninterest, or does it mean to conflict of interest against\nthe reasonableness of the decision?\nThe Second Circuit has said it means to weigh\nthe conflict of interest as provided in Restatement 187,\nand after you weigh the conflict of interest, you then\nmove on to the reasonableness of the decision.\nThe Ninth -- the Ninth and the Eleventh Circuits\nhave said it means that you weigh the decision, and if you\n-- the conflict -- and if you find there is a conflict,\nthen you find that the decision of the plan administrator\nis presumptively void.\nAnd the remainder of the circuits have adopted\nsomething called the sliding scale test where you weigh\nboth the conflict and the -- the reasonableness of the\ndecision at the same time.\nThis Court commented on that issue, I believe,\nin Rush v. Moran when the Court said, how can you give\ndeference to the opinion of a treating physician -- I'm\nsorry -- of a plan administrator at the same time that you\nare looking for conflict of interest?\nWe would submit, if I may, Your Honor, that the\nway to do that is to first look for conflict of interest\nin -- in the -- the way that Restatement 187 does that.\nYou first test for conflict of interest. If there's no\nconflict of interest, then this potential conflict of\ninterest, what this Court called a potential conflict of\ninterest, goes away. It is a nothing. It has no effect\nwhatsoever.\nQUESTION: You didn't tell us -- you didn't --\nQUESTION: As to your case, what -- what\ndifference does it really make? The Ninth Circuit in a\nportion of -- of its opinion which is not being reviewed\nhere --\nMR. PATERSON: I didn't mean to --\nQUESTION: -- and -- and in Regula seems to set\nup a two-tier system or a dichotomy of an administrator\nwho is a fiduciary and an administrator who's not. I\nshould think -- tell me, maybe I'm incorrect -- that your\nposition is that the treating physician rule is an\ninappropriate approach in either instance.\nMR. PATERSON: There's no question about that.\nI didn't mean to argue for a difference in -- in the\nstandard of review. We haven't -- we haven't brought that\nto this Court on a petition. I merely meant to respond to\nJustice O'Connor's question.\nQUESTION: But I take it your point is that in\n-- in either context, the treating physician rule is\ninappropriate.\nMR. PATERSON: Absolutely. There's no question\nin our -- in our position to this Court that the treating\nphysician rule is an inappropriate rule under either -- of\nany of those tests.\nQUESTION: Am -- am I --\nQUESTION: If you are correct in -- in that\nregard, it would go back to the Ninth Circuit and there\nwould still remain the question on which you didn't seek\nreview, and that is, just how do you handle this conflict\nof interest? I presume the Ninth Circuit would go back to\nwhere it was.\nMR. PATERSON: I believe that that's correct,\nYour Honor. What would happen is we would go back to\nwhere we would have been if the treating physician rule\ndidn't exist. The Ninth Circuit would be using its\npresumptively void test, would look to see if the -- the\nclaimant had produced any probative material evidence of a\nconflict of interest, which actually affected the decision\nas opposed to just a potential conflict of interest. If\nthey found that, they would find that the decision of the\nplan administrator was presumptively void. If they didn't\nfind that, then that issue would drop from the case and\nthey would then test the -- the decision of a plan\nadministrator based on abuse of discretion standard.\nQUESTION: But their analysis would be different\nin one respect, I take it, and that is in -- in the case\nas they considered it first, the -- the refusal to follow\na treating physician rule was taken itself as evidence of\nconflict. Is that correct?\nMR. PATERSON: Yes.\nthe refusal to follow a treating -- the treating\nphysician's opinion or to fail to rebut that opinion by\nspecific legitimate reasons was a material probative\nevidence of a -- tending to prove an actual conflict of\ninterest which -- which affected the --\nQUESTION: So the result might be different.\nMR. PATERSON: I -- we would certainly -- we\ncertainly intend it to be different if -- if we can.\nQUESTION: Did -- did they say presumptively\nvoid? I -- I had thought that what they -- what they said\nwas if they found an actual conflict, they simply would\ngive no deference and would review de novo as though the\nquestion was up to them.\nMR. PATERSON: The -- the test in the literature\nis called the presumptively void test. I don't believe\nthe Ninth Circuit calls it the presumptively void test.\nThey -- they call it the Atwood test, the Atwood v.\nNewmont Gold test.\nQUESTION: I don't care what they call it. I\nwant to know what the consequence is. I thought the\nconsequence held by the Ninth Circuit was that if they did\nfind the actual conflict, they would give no deference to\nthe plan administrator's decision and would review the\nquestion de novo as though it was up to them.\nMR. PATERSON:\n-- they would be void. I think the presumptively void\nissue comes in this sense, Your Honor. When the -- if the\nclaimant comes forward with material probative evidence of\na conflict tending to show a conflict of interest under\nthe Ninth Circuit's test, the Ninth Circuit says that\nthere is a rebuttable presumption created and that the\nburden is then on the plan administrator to come forward\nwith evidence and to rebut that material probative\nevidence that there is an actual conflict of interest.\nQUESTION: But we take the case on the theory\nthat that's governing in this case? I mean, you didn't --\nMR. PATERSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- seek -- seek review of it. It's\njust the treating physician rule that you want us to talk\nabout.\nMR. PATERSON: That's correct. I -- I don't --\nI've been asked these questions, but we're not arguing the\nissue of standard --\nQUESTION: It is difficult for me to get to the\nthing when I have a kind of basic confusion in my mind,\nwhich I have. I don't understand this conflict of\ninterest thing from start to finish. That is to say, why\n-- why is it -- why is it any different to have a trustee\nin -- in this kind of a case who hires an insurance\ncompany to look to see whether the people are disabled or\nnot than to have a trustee who hires an insurance company\nto run the whole plan?\nAnd anyway, why is that different from a trustee\nwho, say, runs a classical trust and has to decide -- call\nit a spendthrift trust -- whether to give the beneficiary\n$1,000 this month and have less in the -- in the corpus or\nto give him $800 this month and have more in the corpus,\nwhich might, by the way, grow to help other beneficiaries?\nSo I -- I don't understand it basically and I've\nread enough to know that I really don't.\nMR. PATERSON: Thank you, Justice Breyer. I --\nI hope that I can -- I can help.\nIn section 187 of the Restatement of Trusts, it\ntalks about a potential conflict of interest, the\npossibility of a conflict of interest. And this -- this\nCourt talked about that in Firestone v. Bruch. That\npotential conflict of interest is not a conflict of\ninterest. It's just the possibility. And any court\nreviewing any trustee, ERISA or not, if they thought there\nmight be a conflict of interest, would look for that\nconflict of interest and see if there was --\nQUESTION: What could it consist of?\nMR. PATERSON: It might consist in an ERISA case\nof some direction from the president of the company to the\ntrustee to cut back on benefit costs.\nQUESTION: I see. I see.\nMR. PATERSON: That would be -- then he would\nnot be representing the -- the members of the plan and he\nwould be breaching his fiduciary duty.\nQUESTION: What if there's no such directive,\nbut the plan is set up in such a fashion that it's\nemployer-funded and the higher the benefit costs are, the\n-- the more the employer pays, and hence the less profits\nthe employer has?\nMR. PATERSON: That's -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Is that just a potential conflict of\ninterest or is that an actual conflict of interest when\nthe plan administrator is -- is an agent of the employer?\nMR. PATERSON: Under this Court's rule -- or\ndecision in Firestone and in -- under the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision, that is only a potential conflict of interest.\nThere has to be material probative evidence of an actual\nconflict of interest which affected his decision.\nQUESTION: It's using conflict of interest in a\n-- in a strange sense, it seems to me.\nMR. PATERSON: It -- well --\nQUESTION: There's certainly a conflict of\ninterest there. He's supposed to represent the employees,\nbut he's an agent of the employer, and the more he gives\nto the employees, the less there is for the employer. I\nwould call that a conflict of interest, but -- but that is\nnot, for purposes of these cases, a conflict of interest.\nThat is a potential conflict.\nMR. PATERSON: That is a potential conflict of\ninterest.\nQUESTION: It seems to me they're not really\ntalking about a conflict of interest. They're talking\nabout -- what should I say? Evidence that -- that the\ntrustee was not acting in the -- in the employees' best\ninterest.\nMR. PATERSON: And I think that should be the --\nthe criteria that the court has to look for in each of\nthese cases to decide whether the trustee is actually\nconflicted or not.\nQUESTION: Can we get back to the question that\nyou did raise? Why should there be a difference in the\nSocial Security standard, which does apply this treating\nphysician rule and disability? Both -- the question in\nboth cases is whether this person is unable to work.\nMR. PATERSON: There is a -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PATERSON: There's a tremendous difference\nin the Social Security standard as formulated by the\nregulations of the Social Security Administration and the\nNinth Circuit's treating physician rule in Social Security\ncases as formulated by the Ninth Circuit and ERISA cases.\nPerhaps I can point out a couple of those things.\nFirst, the Social Security Administration has a\nregulation, which it has adopted, which provides for a set\nof criteria to be reviewed by the administrative law\njudge. Those criteria include the -- looking at the\nphysician's -- the treating physician's opinion,\ndetermining whether that opinion is well supported by\nclinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, seeing if\nit's not inconsistent with other substantial evidence,\nlooking at the length of the treatment relationship and\nthe frequency of the examination, and other criteria.\nOnce the administrative law judge goes through\nthose criteria and determines each one of those positively\ntowards the treating physician, he then may, or she may\nthen, if they wish, provide conclusive weight to the\nopinion of the treating physician.\nThe Ninth Circuit's rule is completely different\nthan that. The Ninth Circuit's rule says that if a person\nis a treating physician, then the plan administrator\neither has to accept that rule -- that -- that opinion or\nhas to rebut it. A treating physician under the Ninth\nCircuit rule could be a -- somebody at a local well care\ncenter and you walk in and get a shot. That makes you a\ntreating physician.\nwhich, under the Ninth Circuit's rule, gives you a -- a\npresumptive weight.\nQUESTION: But I take it, you would not be happy\nwith -- if we said, well, the Ninth Circuit went too far,\nbut it should be set up just like the Social Security\nbecause, as I understand it, this employee did get Social\nSecurity disability.\nMR. PATERSON: Well, we don't know that for a\nfact, Your Honor. There is a statement in the -- in the\nstatement of facts by the respondent in their opposition\nbrief. There is no evidence in front of this Court. The\nfirst time I ever knew about that was when I read the\nrespondent's brief. If that is true, he should file -- he\nshould refile with the administrator and attempt to use\nthat evidence to get his claim reopened. But there is no\nevidence that I'm aware of in front of this Court on that\nissue.\nQUESTION: So that's -- that is open to him to\nrefile and say, look, I've got Social Security?\nMR. PATERSON: Yes. He may go back to the --\nthe plan administrator -- this case is still open because\nit's on appeal -- and tell the plan administrator I have\nthis new evidence. It shows that I have been disabled\nsince July the 15th of 1997 and I would like you to\nconsider that evidence.\ndo that.\nQUESTION: I suppose there's something to be\nsaid for the proposition that if you have this private\nsystem, you don't necessarily want to bring in all the\nbureaucratic trappings of the Social Security review\nprocess.\nMR. PATERSON: Well, I think that's absolutely\nright, because one of the congressional purposes in ERISA\nis to encourage employers to adopt voluntary disability\nplans. And the Social Security administrative regulations\nwere -- are regulations which have been adopted by the\nSocial Security Administration. In this case, the\nDepartment of Labor which is the correlative to the Social\nSecurity Administration for ERISA plans is opposed to the\nERISA, or to this --\nQUESTION: But -- but you -- you would\nacknowledge that the Social Security determination is\nevidence for the plan administrator to consider even\nthough it's using a -- a mandated standard of respect for\nthe treating physician's determination which does not\nexist under the plan?\nMR. PATERSON: I think it is evidence. I think\nthe first thing the plan administrator would do is to look\nat the medical opinions which were submitted along with\nthat report and look at the actual decision of the\nadministrative law judge.\nQUESTION: But he'd make -- make the same\ndecision. I mean, if he didn't believe the treating\nphysician and didn't have to believe the treating\nphysician, as the Social Security Administrator has to, to\na greater degree anyway, he'd come out the same way. I\njust don't see how it's evidence in a -- in a proceeding\nthat does not give the same weight to the treating\nphysician.\nMR. PATERSON: It might or might not be. But it\nif -- if it is -- if it does show that there's a\ndifference in the condition of the -- of the claimant, it\nshould be presented to the plan administrator to give him\na chance to make the decision.\nQUESTION: It's a different record before the\nSocial -- the ALJ.\nMR. PATERSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It's later in time.\nMR. PATERSON: With the permission of the Court,\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Paterson.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nQUESTION: Ms. Blatt, did the Secretary consider\nadopting a rule like CA9 has imposed?\nMS. BLATT: No, Justice O'Connor. What the\nSecretary has done has -- is -- has not opposed -- imposed\na treating physician requirement or otherwise constrained\nplan administrators in the way --\nQUESTION: Yes. I know the Secretary has not.\nDid the Secretary consider alternatives?\nMS. BLATT: They didn't consider a treating\nphysician rule, but what the Department of Labor did do\nwas impose a series of requirements to ensure fair and\naccurate decisionmaking. So plans must conduct a full and\nfair review of a claim, and they have to consider all\nevidence submitted by the claimant. And before making any\nmedical judgments, they have to consult with a health care\nprofessional with the relevant training and experience.\nQUESTION: The question was when they did that,\ndid they even think of the treating physician rule? Did\nanybody say to the Department, maybe we should have one?\nNo, I don't think we will.\nMS. BLATT: No. There's no evidence that they\nconsidered it. But they did overhaul their regulations\nfor 2002 and did impose a lot of requirements, and they\ntook a very different approach. They didn't do anything\nthat constrained plan administrators in weighing evidence.\nInstead, they said, you have to consider all the relevant\nevidence and make an independent judgment. And then they\nfinally required that the specific reasons have to be\ngiven for any denial in a manner that's calculated to be\nunderstood by the claimant. And in the Department's view,\nwhat that means is it has to be in sufficient detail to\npermit meaningful judicial review for an abuse of\ndiscretion.\nBut the Ninth Circuit takes a very different and\ncategorical approach that singles out treating physician\nevidence and has a requirement that reasons have to be\ngiven if the administrator is not going to defer to that\nevidence.\nQUESTION: Maybe the Ninth Circuit was trying to\nspark for ERISA the same thing that the courts did for\nSocial Security. The Social Security -- whatever the rule\nis, the treating physician rule -- that started with the\ncourts and then the -- the Commissioner said, okay, we'll\nadopt it as part of our regulations. But didn't it begin\nwith the courts?\nMS. BLATT: It began with the courts, and they\n-- most of them did impose some requirement and some\noutright rejected it because they thought Congress had\nentrusted the ALJ as the finder of fact with the\nresponsibility to weigh conflicting evidence. And the\nCommissioner, in order to bring uniformity in this massive\nnationwide Government program, adopted a less aggressive,\ndeferential rule in its regulations.\nBut the Department of Labor has not adopted any\nsuch rule. Rather, the Department of Labor's regulations\nare consistent with the background presumption that the\ntrier of fact has the responsibility in each particular\ncase to weigh conflicting evidence based on her judgment\nof the relative merits of the evidence. And -- but the\nDepartment of Labor, as I said, has a very different set\nof requirements that don't -- that leave -- that are\nconsistent with that background rule and don't constrain\nplan administrators.\nQUESTION: Does the -- do the Department\nregulations have some sort of a threshold test for whether\nthere's a conflict of interest or is that just not\naddressed?\nMS. BLATT: No. The Department of --\nregulations don't speak to the question of a conflict at\nall. What this Court said in Firestone was that a\nconflict must be weighed as a factor in determining\nwhether there's been an abuse of discretion.\nQUESTION: And Firestone, as I recall, just\nrecognized that the plan administrator can wear two hats,\nbe employer some times and -- and a fiduciary at others.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. But under Firestone,\nif the employer both funds the plan and administers the\nplan, we think that's the type of conflict that can be\nconsidered as a factor in whether there's been an abuse of\ndiscretion.\nQUESTION: So Firestone was using conflict of\ninterest in -- in a different sense from the sense in\nwhich it was used here.\nMS. BLATT: The courts have differed widely, in\nthe wake of Firestone, of what this Court meant in\nFirestone. The majority of the lower courts have not\ntaken the Ninth Circuit's approach. They have said it's\nstill an abuse of discretion review, but there's a more\nsearching inquiry into whether there's been an abuse of\ndiscretion if the plan administrator is operating under a\nconflict.\nNow, that is not --\nQUESTION: By which it means not evidence that\nhe was instructed to -- to keep down costs, but the mere\nfact that the employer is both the funder of the plan and\nresponsible for administration of the plan.\nMS. BLATT: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That alone is a conflict.\nMS. BLATT: That's the type of conflict that can\nbe considered as a factor in conducting whether there's an\nabuse of discretion.\nNow, however that plays out in a given case, our\npoint is that you shouldn't have a special rule that's\nlimited to treating physician evidence. And we think it's\ninappropriate under ERISA for three reasons, and I think\nI've already said two of them --\nQUESTION: What does treating physician evidence\nhave to do with a conflict? That's -- that's what I\nreally don't understand.\nMS. BLATT: Nothing.\nQUESTION: How does it show a conflict at all?\nMS. BLATT: Nothing. If there was some failure\nto defer or inadequate explanation -- first of all,\nthere's something wrong with the treating physician rule.\nBut even if there was some inadequate explanation such\nthat the court could not conduct meaningful judicial\nreview, the standard consequence of that, Justice Scalia,\nis a remand back to the administrator for further\nexplanation, not a de novo standard of review.\nBut that's not the question presented in this\ncase. It's rather the propriety of a judge-made rule that\nsingles out treating physician evidence and elevates that\nevidence over other evidence.\nNow, again, it's inconsistent with the\nbackground presumption about the trier of fact -- the\nresponsibility of the trier of fact to weigh conflicting\nevidence. We think it's in significant tension with the\nregulations that the Department of Labor did promulgate\nwhich do not constrain plan administrators.\nAnd finally, the third reason, is that ERISA\nleaves to employers, private employers, the decision\nwhether to provide benefits and, if so, the discretion to\ndevise the form and structure of plans. And a judge-made\nrule is inconsistent with these discretionary and\nvoluntary aspects of ERISA because it tells plan\nadministrators across the board how to weigh conflicting\nevidence in claims arising under varying and separate\nplans.\nQUESTION: Would it be relevant evidence, as Mr.\nPaterson suggested it would be, that this man now has\nSocial Security disability benefits?\nMS. BLATT: The regulations require the plan\nadministrator to consider all evidence submitted by the\nclaimant, and it -- it would be relevant if -- depending\non what it said. But this Court in Cleveland has\nexplained that the Commissioner of Social Security applies\na variety of evidentiary presumptions, not only the\ntreating physician rule but the most prominent one is the\nlisting of impairments such that the Social Security\nAdministration may make a finding of disability even\nthough the person in fact may be able to perform the\nessential functions of the job when judged under different\nlegal settings. And I think the issue in -- in Cleveland\nwas whether there was reasonable accommodation, and the\nCommissioner doesn't consider that when -- when she makes\nher determinations under the Social Security\nAdministration. But it's just -- it's one piece of\nevidence that would be before the administrator.\nAnd if there are no further questions, we would\nask that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Rohlfing, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE D. ROHLFING\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROHLFING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn answer to Judge -- Justice Scalia's question\nabout conflict of interest, the lower courts, in the wake\nof Firestone Tire & Rubber Company v. Bruch, have grossly\nconfused the concept of conflict of interest, dollar-for-\ndollar conflict of interest, with actual bias. And that's\nthe problem with the Ninth Circuit's approach, the\nEleventh Circuit's approach and the other circuits'\napproach, is when we have evidence of conflict of\ninterest, the courts are requiring evidence of actual\nbias. And I don't believe that that's the standard that\nthis Court intended in the Firestone Tire & Rubber case.\nNow, the other --\nQUESTION: In Firestone -- is -- is it a\nconflict of interest if I set up a trust for my children\nto pay their college education, and then I have to make\ndecisions. Suppose I hire a trustee and that -- or I hire\nsomebody to run it, and I'm going to put more in if they\nneed more, less, if they need less. So the trustee has to\nsay whether to pay for the $80 a month or a week or\nwhatever, a day's spending money or not, and the more he\npays, the more I'm going to have to put in. Is -- is that\nconsidered, under -- under traditional trust law, a\nconflict of interest?\nMR. ROHLFING: Only if the trustee's continued\nemployment is -- is contingent upon your satisfaction.\nQUESTION: But if it is, if -- if I say you're a\ntrustee, I can fire you when I want, then the courts, just\nin that -- like Scott on Trusts and so forth, would say\nthat's a conflict of interest?\nMR. ROHLFING: Because you retain too much\ncontrol over the -- the disposition of the trust corpus.\nIn these voluntary plans, a plan administrator really has\na choice. The plan administrator can elect to retain\ncontrol --\nQUESTION: No, I understand that. I'm just\ntrying to figure out what classical trust law would have\nbeen. So you're saying it's the same. It should be\ntreated the same.\nMR. ROHLFING: The more egregious case, Your\nHonor, would be the facts of -- that would be similar to\nthe facts of this case is if the balance of the trust\nreverted to the trustee if they didn't spend all the money\non your children's education. That would be an even more\negregious --\nQUESTION: And then -- then classical trust law,\nScott on Trusts, says that's a conflict of interest and --\nand what happens? Then courts review it all if you set up\na trust like that?\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, Scott on Trusts, the\nRestatement of Trusts, all refer to those decisions as\nvoidable at the election of the beneficiary, and the court\nwould review that decision de novo.\nQUESTION: Mr. Rohlfing, the -- the petitioner\ndidn't raise any question about the -- the conflict of\ninterest. And so we're here on the petition which raises\nonly the treating physician rule, and as Justice Kennedy\npointed out, you could have the treating physician rule\nwhen you have a separation of the trustee and the -- the\ncompany.\nphysician rule, I think it would be helpful --\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- since it's the only question\nthat's raised.\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes, Your Honor.\nThe Ninth Circuit did articulate the Ninth\nCircuit rule in the context of conflict of interest. So I\nthink it's important to keep that focus in mind.\nBut the treating physician rule that was\narticulated by the Ninth Circuit in both this case and in\nthe Nord -- and in the Regula case was not a weighted\nrule. There was not a thumb on the scale as petitioner\nhas put it. Rather the rule that the --\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why isn't it a thumb on\nthe scales when it requires substantial evidence to -- to\nrebut? That sounds like a thumb to me.\nMR. ROHLFING: It -- it doesn't require\nrebuttal, Your Honor. It requires rejection for\nsubstantial reasons.\nQUESTION: Well, whatever term you want to use\nit, unless you've got substantial evidence to override the\ntreating physician's opinion, the treating physician's\nopinion is supposed to control, and that sounds like a\nthumb.\nMR. ROHLFING:\njurisprudence and the jurisprudence of other courts in\nother contexts have stated that concepts of abuse of\ndiscretion, arbitrary and capricious, and substantial\nevidence, are really very similar concepts and there are\nvery fine, thin lines between those concepts.\nFor instance, a decision that was made without\nthe support of substantial evidence, I would submit, would\nbe an abuse of discretion. If no reasonable person would\nconclude, as the plan administrator did conclude, i.e., it\nlacked substantial evidentiary support, that would be an\nabuse of discretion. The court would readily reverse that\ntype of determination.\nAnd that's exactly what the Ninth Circuit said\nin -- in reviewing the record as a whole, as this Court's\njurisprudence in Universal Camera, for instance --\nQUESTION: Is it clear that that's what the\nNinth Circuit means by substantial evidence? I mean,\nthat's what substantial evidence means in administrative\nlaw under the Administrative Procedure Act. It means just\nthat minimal amount of evidence that's necessary to get a\ncase to the jury in a -- in a civil trial. But is that\nwhat the Ninth Circuit means by -- or do they mean\nsubstantial evidence? You know what I mean?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROHLFING:\ncourt didn't bold-face or italicize its -- its use of the\nterm, substantial evidence.\nQUESTION: Yes. I'm under the impression that\nthey mean substantial evidence.\nMR. ROHLFING: I think the -- the court in\nreviewing a rule 56 motion practice, reviews the decision\nof the district court de novo, and it's entitled to\nsubstitute its own judgment. The parties at the district\ncourt agreed --\nQUESTION: But rule 56 judgments, summary\njudgment, that is purely a question of law.\nMR. ROHLFING: Correct.\nQUESTION: So the -- the fact that it is\nreviewed de novo doesn't have much bearing on this sort of\na case, it seems to me.\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, the -- once the Ninth\nCircuit concluded that the district court had erred in\nrejecting the procedural treating physician rule, the need\nto articulate specific and legitimate reasons, and had\nconcluded that Black & Decker operated under a conflict of\ninterest, and Black & Decker represented to the Ninth\nCircuit that it not -- it need not even consider\nplaintiff's evidence, the Ninth Circuit exercised its\ndiscretion to reverse and pay the case. And that is a\nquestion that petitioner clearly did not seek cert on.\nQUESTION: But what about the treating physician\nrule itself, which he clearly did seek cert on?\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes.\nQUESTION: What is your position on that?\nMR. ROHLFING: Your Honor, section 1133 of the\n-- of the statute and the regulations that were in effect\nwhen Mr. Nord filed his claim required the statement of\nspecific reasons in order to reject a claim.\nQUESTION: This -- we're now talking about an\nERISA claim, not a Social Security claim.\nMR. ROHLFING: An ERISA claim. The statute and\nthe regulations require a statement of specific reasons.\nAnd the lower courts have described the statement of\nspecific reasons as encouraging a meaningful dialogue\nbetween the person claiming benefits and the plan\nadministrator. And it would seem that a mere statement of\nconclusion, we've accepted Dr. Mitri and we've rejected\nyour physicians, is not a meaningful dialogue. It's\nnot --\nQUESTION: I don't even think they have to say\nthat. The reasons for rejecting the claim is we're\nrejecting the claim because you are not disabled or\nbecause your disability does not -- you know. Isn't that\nthe reason for rejecting the claim? It isn't a\nrequirement that they -- that they review the evidence in\nthe case.\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, they are required to review\nthe evidence. That's the petitioner's position.\nQUESTION: Yes, but do they have to give a\nstatement? I mean, you know, the Administrative Procedure\nAct requires a -- a statement of -- of reasons for the --\nin some detail. But I don't know that this requirement is\nanything -- I am rejecting your claim because you filed it\ntoo late. I am rejecting your claim because in my\njudgment you are not disabled. Why isn't that an adequate\nstatement of reasons?\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, too late would be a -- a\nspecific reason for rejecting a claim.\nQUESTION: Well, but you wouldn't have to review\nthe evidence of why it's too late. Well, you know, so and\nso said he got it then. So and so said you got it earlier\nthan that. We believe so and so. You didn't have to say\nthat. You say we're rejecting it because in our view you\nfiled it late. And it seems to me it's the same thing\nwith a disability. We're -- we're rejecting it because we\ndo not -- we do not believe that -- that the disability\nyou have claimed in fact exists.\nMR. ROHLFING: And the problem with -- with that\nparticular analysis, Your Honor, is that we don't know\nwhether Black & Decker in this particular case put the\nsame thumb that it's complaining about the Ninth Circuit\nput on the scale, that they didn't put the thumb on the\nscale for Dr. Mitri. And for all of the reasons that\npetitioner and its eight private amici have argued and\nalso the Solicitor General's office has argued, putting\nthe thumb on the scale and not weighing evidence evenly\nwould be just as bad if it was done the other side\nsilently.\nQUESTION: But I don't understand what that has\nto do with the question that's -- that's presented to us.\nCase A, that there's a treating physician who's a longtime\npersonal physician and his opinion is given to the\nadministrator. Case B, the employee says, you know, I'm\ngoing to see a back specialist and he goes to a back\nspecialist who's never seen the man before. Should there\nbe a difference in those two? I mean, that's -- that's\nwhat you're here to argue.\nAnd -- and Dr. -- was it Dimitri or Mitri?\nMR. ROHLFING: Mitri.\nQUESTION: Mitri was a specialist in this area.\nThe treating physician was not. It -- it seems to me that\nit's -- it's perfectly plausible to say that we give the\nspecialist even greater weight. So what -- the treating\nphysician rule, it seems to me, quite arbitrary.\nMR. ROHLFING:\nsimply putting weight on the scale. But the Ninth Circuit\ncast the treating physician rule as merely a statement of\n-- of specific reasons that are legitimate under the\nstatute and that are supported by substantial evidence in\nthe evidentiary record before the Court.\nBut the -- the treating physician rule doesn't\ndistinguish between -- strike that. I'm sorry. The --\nthe treating physician rule does distinguish between\nphysicians that have different levels of probative\nevidence. The physician with more information, the long-\ntime treating physician, has a greater source of\ninformation upon which to express an opinion than does the\none-time consultative examiner.\nAnd that's really illustrated in the facts of\nthis case where Dr. Mitri stated that Mr. Nord should be\nable to perform a certain level of work. And his\nintentional use of the word should implies that most\npeople or a substantial number of people with this level\nof impairment can engage in this level of activity, in\nthis case sedentary work interrupted by standing and\nwalking.\nQUESTION: So you are now saying, it seems to\nme, the opposite of what you were contending earlier.\nYou're saying that substantial evidence means more than\njust the amount of evidence that would enable a jury to\nfind a particular fact. Because if that's all that\nsubstantial evidence meant, you wouldn't need a -- a\ntreating physician rule. That rule would exist for any\nphysician that the -- that the plaintiff brought in. If\nhe brought in a non-treating physician and there were no\nsubstantial evidence on the other side in the -- in the\nAdministrative Procedure Act sense of substantial\nevidence --\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- the plaintiff would win. Right?\nMR. ROHLFING: That's correct.\nQUESTION: So the treating physician rule is a\n-- is a useless rule. You should call it the any\nphysician rule. If the plaintiff comes in with some\nevidence and there's no evidence on the other side, the\nplaintiff wins. That's certainly not what the Ninth\nCircuit means. And -- and as you were just describing it,\nit's not what the Ninth Circuit means.\nIt means that if you have a treating physician,\nyou need substantial evidence on the other side before\nwe're going to -- we're -- we're going to let you overturn\nthe treating physician's determination. Isn't that really\nwhat's going on here?\nMR. ROHLFING: I think the Ninth Circuit did use\nthe -- the phrase that the opinion of Dr. Mitri was\noverwhelmed by the other substantial evidence of record.\nSo you're right.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but that characterizes\nit on a very fact-specific basis. It also referred to the\n-- is it -- Regula case in which it -- it said there is\nthe treating physician rule. I think you have to defend\nthat rule as a rule, if applicable, in the generality of\ncases.\nMR. ROHLFING: The general application of the\ntreating physician rule that's reflected in both the --\nthis case and in the Regula case is that the court used\nthe rule only at the conflict-of-interest level of\ninquiry. It didn't instruct -- in Regula, it did not\ninstruct the lower court to weigh the evidence in any\nparticular manner. Rather, it instructed the lower court\nto allow Delta Air Lines in that case to come forward with\nevidence that the conflict of -- conflict of interest did\nnot infect its decisionmaking process. Again, it allowed\nrebuttal evidence of actual bias rather than the pure\nconflict of interest that the Ninth Circuit found to\nexist.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the connection between\nthe treating physician rule and the concept of actual\nbias? The -- the two don't seem to have a lot in common\nso far as I can see.\nMR. ROHLFING: I think that the courts are\nconfused below, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm confused too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROHLFING: The courts have created this\nhybrid animal that's asking whether conflict of interest\nexists and then using actual bias to -- to animate its --\nits decisionmaking process. And that's the problem.\nQUESTION: I think I can explain the confusion.\nIt doesn't make any sense, but I think I can explain it.\nThe Ninth Circuit is simply saying, look it, any\nreasonable person would give the treating physician's\nopinion substantial weight over somebody who's not the\ntreating physician, and if the plan administrator does not\ndo that, and since he's presumably a reasonable person, he\nmust biased. Isn't that what's going on? The Ninth\nCircuit has simply said, obviously the treating physician\nwins in the -- in the usual case. And any plan\nadministrator who says he doesn't win must be biased.\nMR. ROHLFING: I think --\nQUESTION: And that's not true in my view.\nMR. ROHLFING: I think what the Ninth Circuit is\nsaying is that when we have expert opinion and all else\nbeing equal, given the fiduciary status of the plan\nadministrator, that the treating physician should receive\n.001 percent and tip the scale slightly in favor. It's\nthe fiduciary status. It's the conflict of interest\nanalysis that really animates the court's inquiry into --\ninto this --\nQUESTION: So -- so why doesn't this just --\nQUESTION: What -- what if you have a -- a\ntreating physician who presents a paragraph to the plan\nadministrator saying, you know, I've treated this fellow\nfor 6 months and I think he's incapacitated? Then you\nhave an expert, you know, another physician weighs in on\nthe other side and puts in about six or seven paragraphs.\nI put him through some tests, this and that, and I think\nhe is -- he's not disabled. How does that come out in\nyour view under the treating physician rule?\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, the question then would be\nwhether the -- the tests that the independent medical\nexaminer, the one-time examining physician, either\nmirrored the test results of the treating physician or\nprovided an independent clinical basis. And under the\nmature treating physician rule, every court has held that\nindependent clinical findings that are divergent from\nthose of the treating physician is always a basis for\nrejecting the treating physician's opinion.\nBut that's not the facts of this case. Dr.\nMitri agreed --\nQUESTION: Well, does -- does the Ninth Circuit\nrecognize that the treating physician rule can be rebutted\nin that manner?\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes, it does.\nQUESTION: You say other courts have. Does the\nNinth Circuit?\nMR. ROHLFING: In the -- in the treating\nphysician rule that exists in the Ninth Circuit in a\nSocial Security context, it is absolutely clear that\nindependent clinical findings are an independent basis for\nrejecting the treating physician's opinion.\nQUESTION: But it can't be rejected in this\nfashion. The treating physician who's a general\npractitioner doesn't know anything in particular. Not a\nspecialist with the brain, he says this man has a brain\nembolism. That's all he says. Doesn't say anything else.\nDoesn't give any more details. And somebody -- and -- and\nthe -- the employer goes to a brain specialist and the\nbrain specialist says, again, nothing more than this\npatient does not have a brain embolism. That would not\nsuffice in the Ninth Circuit, would it? You would have to\ntake the opinion of the attending -- of the treating\nphysician.\nMR. ROHLFING: If there's no objective test\nresult from any physician, an MRI or a CAT-scan?\nQUESTION: Both of them -- both of them have\ncome in with conclusory statements. Why shouldn't I\nbelieve the conclusory statement of the expert who\nexamined the person rather than the -- the general\npractitioner? What the Ninth Circuit says is, you have to\nbelieve the -- the treating physician.\nMR. ROHLFING: I don't believe that any\nreasonable person would accept a -- an intern's -- or a\ngeneral practitioner's opinion that the person suffers\nfrom a brain embolism without an objective test showing\nthe existence and presence of that embolism.\nQUESTION: Well, then what purpose does the\nNinth Circuit rule say? The Ninth Circuit says the\ntreating physician is employed to cure and has a greater\nopportunity to know and observe the patient as an\nindividual. I mean, that's -- that's its rule.\nMR. ROHLFING: That's -- that's the test.\nQUESTION: Well, given the confusion about it,\nwhy isn't it the -- sorry.\nQUESTION: And we don't in -- in the law of\nevidence -- I'm trying to think of an analogy where we\nhave some special rule for a particular kind of -- of\nperson. We have expert testimony generally, but -- but\nthis is not so confined. I've never seen a rule like\nthis.\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, it really depends on how\nyou view juries would -- would review divergent expert\nwitness opinion. If you assume that -- that a jury would\nnot tend to give a source of evidence more weight than a\nevidentiary source that had a less -- lesser pool of\nevidence or information, less probative information, then\nI think that you're right. But I don't think that that's\nwhat juries do. I think juries look at it in a reasonable\nfashion and think an expert with more percipient\ninformation is going to get more weight. And --\nQUESTION: Mr. Rohlfing, why are we getting\njuries into it when I thought the genesis of this was the\nNinth Circuit said, in Social Security the courts created\nthis treating physician rule?\nMR. ROHLFING: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And the Commissioner liked it so\nmuch, the Commissioner embraced it as her own. And so now\nwe're going to do the same thing for ERISA.\nAnd that's why when you complicate it with this\nbias or conflict, there's no conflict in the Social\nSecurity. And as I read -- that's -- that's a piece of\nthis decision, but as I understood it, what the Ninth\nCircuit was saying, as far as the treating physician rule,\nis it was a good idea in Social Security and it's equally\ngood here.\nMR. ROHLFING: That's exactly what the court\ndecided, Justice Ginsburg. And I think that your analysis\nis correct. The court looked at the treating physician\nrule and -- and said it -- it creates tools for the courts\nto use engaging the reasonableness of administrative\ndecisions in that context.\nQUESTION: But then -- then you started to talk\nabout juries and in the Social Security context, it's a\nguide for the ALJ, not a jury.\nMR. ROHLFING: I was speaking more generally\nwith Justice Kennedy. I apologize for bringing in an\ninapt analogy.\nBut I do think that the -- the logic and\nfundamental underpinnings of the treating physician rule\nengaging any expert witness testimony is that the broader\npanoply of information available to, in this case, a\ntreating physician justifies, all else being equal, all\nelse -- assuming the same set of objective tests, that the\nphysician with the greater source of information is\nentitled to slightly more weight.\nQUESTION: Since the Secretary of Labor doesn't\nagree with you, why isn't it better for courts to leave\nthat kind of a decision to the Secretary of Labor?\nMR. ROHLFING: The Solicitor General argues in\n-- in its brief that -- the Government's brief, that it\nhas primary jurisdiction to develop the regulations and\nflesh out the body of ERISA law. But this Court has long\nheld that development of the body of Federal common law is\nwithin the jurisdiction of the courts.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm not suggesting a --\na primary jurisdiction rule. What I'm suggesting is that\nthe -- the Labor Department is a lot closer to the\nsituation at the trial level than an appellate court,\nincluding this one. And I -- I simply would have thought\nthat the -- that the Department of Labor was in a better\nposition just to make a practical assessment of either the\nneed for the rule or the probable value of the rule than\n-- than a court is likely to do. And -- and when that\nkind of expert judgment is available, why isn't it simply\nsensible for a court in a common law capacity to say,\nwe're going to leave it to the -- to the party -- to the\n-- to the agency that is in a better position to make the\njudgment?\nMR. ROHLFING: Well, Justice Souter, the -- the\nproblem with that is that the -- the Secretary of Labor\nhas not even addressed the conflict of -- of interest\nissue and that is the --\nQUESTION: But the conflict of interest issue,\nyou just told us, is not the reason for adopting the rule\nhere.\nMR. ROHLFING: But it is --\nQUESTION: It has a -- it is -- it is being\ngiven significance in the conflict issue, but I thought\nthat was not the reason the rule -- I'm going back to your\nanswer to your question to Justice Ginsburg. That isn't\nthe reason the rule was developed in Social Security, and\nthat wasn't the reason the rule has been adopted here.\nMR. ROHLFING: It isn't the reason the rule --\nit is the -- the focal point of the rule in the ERISA\ncontext.\nQUESTION: Whose money is at stake in the Social\nSecurity cases?\nMR. ROHLFING: Yours and mine.\nQUESTION: The Government's money, really. And\nif the Government wants to be particularly generous to the\nclaimant, I guess the Government can be if it wants to\nadopt a rule that's very favorable to claimants, which it\nhas done in the Social Security field.\nBut it's not the Government's money at stake in\n-- in this case and -- and in all of these ERISA cases.\nIt's either the trust's money or the employer's money, and\nit's supposed to be dispensed according to the agreement\nthat the parties have entered into. It seems to me it's a\ndifferent situation, and I don't think the Government has\nas much leeway in deciding to be generous as it -- as it\ndoes in the Social Security field. I just don't see --\ndon't see the parallel between the two at all.\nMR. ROHLFING: The parallel between the two\nexists on what questions are asked and what answers are\ngiven. The structure is -- is far different. Congress\nenacted Social Security as social policy. Black & Decker\nadopted its disability plan to attract employees as part\nof an employment package. And there -- although it's\nBlack & Decker's money, it has still promised benefits\nunder certain circumstances and then has, for -- for\nreasons that we still aren't -- don't know, concluded that\ndespite the -- the clear opinions of the treating\nphysicians and the ambiguous opinion of the independent\nmedical examiner, concluded that Mr. Nord did not sustain\nhis burden of proof, and despite the clear evidence from\nthe human resources specialist that Mr. Nord could not\nperform his usual and customary work --\nQUESTION: Why was it so clear? First of all,\nif you take the treating physician -- was given an\nopportunity to comment on the expert's opinion, on Dr.\nMitri's opinion. Here it is. Not one word from either\nthe treating physician or the -- what is it? The\northopedist who was -- who was called in by the treating\nphysician. So the expert stands out there all alone with\nno comment on it.\nAnd then as far as the human resources person is\nconcerned, it was Mr. Nord's counsel, was it not, that\nwrote up that evaluation for her to answer yes or no,\nright?\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I wrote\nthose interrogatories because I read Dr. Mitri's opinion\nwhen he said Mr. Nord could only lift 15 pounds, and I\nlooked at the human resources specialist's statement of\nbona fide occupational job qualifications that the\noccupation required lifting 20 pounds and a number of\nother factors, including the recognition of Dr. Mitri that\nMr. Nord suffered from a significant pain syndrome. I\nbelieved that -- that Ms. Forward would answer those\nquestions all in the negative, that no, Mr. Nord could not\nperform his usual and customary occupation. She didn't\nanswer the questions all in that manner. But she did\nanswer the last question in the negative, that Mr. Nord\ncould not perform the work of a material planner with the\npain that he was enduring.\nQUESTION: Well, I think -- I think if you gave\nanybody that question, somebody is in terrible pain, can\nthey relate to others -- it's not as though this was some\nkind of a neutral evaluation form. It was a loaded\nquestion that you asked her.\nMR. ROHLFING:\nframed, though, as terrible pain. It was occasional\nmoderate pain, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Let's find the question. Where is\nit?\nMR. ROHLFING: The question appears in the\nrecord.\nMR. PATERSON: It's at L36-L37.\nMR. ROHLFING: Thank you, Mr. Paterson.\nL36 and 37. The -- the sixth question that was\nasked of Ms. Forward --\nQUESTION: 36 and 37 of?\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes, in the large petition\nlodging. I can read the question in full.\nDr. Mitri describes Kenneth Nord as suffering\nfrom degenerative disc disease and a chronic myofascial\npain syndrome. You have indicated in your employer's\nstatement provided to Metropolitan that the work of a\nmaterial planner requires continuous interpersonal\nrelationships and frequent exposure to stressful job\nsituations. Assume that Kenneth Nord would have a\nmoderate pain that would interfere with his ability to\nperform intense interpersonal communications or to act\nappropriately under stress occasionally, up to one-third\nduring the day. Could an individual of those limitations\nperform the work of a material planner?\nAnd the answer marked is no. And Ms. Forward\nsigned that.\nQUESTION: As I understand that question, it --\nit asks him assuming he can't do his job for one-third of\nthe day, can he do his job? What -- what answer would you\nexpect? I mean, if -- if you just said assuming he had\nmoderate pain, could he do his job, then -- then your\nanswer would mean something, but you asked, assuming he\nhas moderate pain that prevents him from doing his job a\nthird of the day.\nMR. ROHLFING: Significantly interferes.\nQUESTION: Yes, all right.\nMR. ROHLFING: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, I'd give the same answer.\nYou -- it seems to me you -- you had a hypothesis that\ndoesn't help your case.\nMR. ROHLFING: In -- in asking a -- a question\nof a vocational expert or a human resources specialist,\nassuming the person suffers from moderate pain, could they\nperform their job, then we've left it up to the witness to\nanswer the question, what does moderate mean? And so what\nI did was define moderate.\nQUESTION: But you didn't ask moderate. You\ndidn't ask just moderate pain. You said, moderate pain\nthat would interfere with his ability to perform intense\ninterpersonal communications.\nMR. ROHLFING: But not preclude.\nQUESTION: So it wasn't moderate pain in the\nabstract. It was moderate pain in a quite concrete\ncontext that would -- moderate pain that would interfere\nwith his ability to do his job.\nMR. ROHLFING: Yes, Justice Ginsburg -- in my\nexperience if you don't define the terms of art in -- in\nquestions to vocational specialists, you're not going to\nget the answers that are helpful.\nQUESTION: You didn't -- you didn't leave it\navailable for her to say, I don't think that moderate pain\nwould interfere with his ability to conduct interpersonal\nrelationships. That was not available for her to say.\nMR. ROHLFING: That was certainly available to\nBlack & Decker to solicit that type of information. She\nwas -- she was a Kwikset employee, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Black & Decker Corporation. They didn't ask\n--\nQUESTION: Well, we're not examining their\nevidence. We're examining yours. The issue is what does\nyour evidence prove. It doesn't seem to me it proves\nmuch.\nQUESTION: Perhaps you could address why your --\nthe -- the treating physician didn't comment at all on the\nexperts.\nMR. ROHLFING: The treating physicians didn't\ncomment on the -- the opinions of Dr. Mitri because I\ndidn't ask them to. I read Dr. Mitri's report as\nsupporting the proposition of disability. His lifting\nlimitations were less than the lifting required of the\njob. The standing and walking that he needed was not\npermitted in the facial job description. And I made a --\nand I actually argued affirmatively to the Ninth Circuit\nthat Dr. Mitri's opinion, properly read in the context of\nthe -- the employer's statement that Ms. Forward had\nfilled out before at the request of Metropolitan, actually\nsupported the proposition of disability rather than\nsupporting the proposition of no disability that had been\nadvocated.\nAnd I would hasten to point out that this plan\ndoes not contain an accommodation clause. It doesn't say\nif you can perform your job with accommodation, then\nyou're not disabled. It doesn't say that. And if we're\ngoing to use contract analysis in -- in determining the\neffect of the plan language on the ultimate issue of\ndisability, the failure to include accommodation as an\naffirmative prong of the -- the inquiry in the issue of\ndisability is fatal to Black & Decker's case because the\nonly reason that Ms. Forward's answers to the first four\nquestions could be supported is if Black & Decker\naccommodated it.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Rohlfing.\nMr. Paterson, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEE T. PATERSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PATERSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule is a\ncategorical rule based upon the assumption that a treating\nphysician's opinion is superior to other medical opinions\nin the record. In the Regula case, at page 1139, the\nNinth Circuit got to the issue of -- of the treating\nphysician rule prior to the time it even began to discuss\nthe conflict of interest. And it held the treating\nphysician rule requires deference, as it applies under\nERISA, and that the treating -- the plan administrator in\nthe Ninth Circuit must defer unless there are -- he has\ngood enough reasons not to defer.\nThe court then later on in its opinion addressed\nthe issue of conflict of interest.\nThis Court in -- last year in Ragsdale v.\nWolverine when -- stated that categorical generalizations\nfailed to hold true that the justification for the\ncategorical rule disappears. In the facts of this case,\nthat categorical justification disappears both in the\nindividual facts of the case and as a general proposition\nfor all other cases.\nIn the facts of this case, respondent went to\nDr. Hartman, his internist, with back problems. Dr.\nHartman referred him to two specialists, Dr. Zandpour and\nDr. Ali, both of whom examined him, tested him, and\ndiagnosed his condition. Both Dr. Ali and Dr. Zandpour,\nbased upon the tests they conducted, provided a diagnosis\nof mild degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.\nThe employers sent the respondent to another\nspecialist, Dr. Mitri, a neurologist, who agreed with the\nopinions of Dr. Zandpour and Dr. Ali, but also looked at\nthe job duties of respondent. Dr. Mitri opined that he\ncould perform the duties of a material planner if he was\nallowed to stand up and walk periodically.\nJust focusing on these four physicians'\nopinions, it's clear that the opinions with the most\nweight are the three specialists, Dr. Zandpour, Dr. Ali,\nand Dr. Mitri, not the treating physician, Dr. Hartman.\nHowever, the Ninth Circuit's rule requires the plan\nadministrator to give deference, special weight, and a\npresumption in favor of Dr. Hartman's opinion even though\nhe referred respondent to specialists for evaluation and\neven though he has no apparent expertise in back injuries\nor back pain.\nIn the facts of this case, the categorical\ngeneralization is not true.\nIn addition, the amicus, American Medical\nAssociation, has brought before this Court its statistics\npublished in its own publication, the Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association. Those statistics state that\n39 percent of treating physicians misrepresent symptoms,\ndiagnosis, and severity of illness when their patients\nsubmit insurance claims. There's no justification for a\ncategorical rule that treating physicians' opinions are\nentitled to special weight, deference, and a presumption\nin ERISA disability benefit determinations when the\nprofessional organization of the treating physicians\nadmits that treating physicians often make\nmisrepresentations when their patients are filing\ninsurance claims.\nThere's no support for a categorical rule that\ntreating physicians' opinions are more reliable than other\nmedical opinions either in the facts of this case or in\nthe -- the ERISA context in general. In every case, the\nERISA plan administrator should weigh not only the source\nof the opinion, but also the experience, the testing, the\ntreatment, and the credentials of the -- of the physician.\nWe respectfully submit that this Court should\nreject the Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule and\nremand this case back to the Ninth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nPaterson.\n"
