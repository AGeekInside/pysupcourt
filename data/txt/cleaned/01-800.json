FRIEDBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is at least a little irony in the fact\nthat Dean Witter is the litigant here before you, about 27\nyears past the time when it started with Dean Witter and\nByrd the -- the move toward closing the courthouse doors\nto public investors and forcing them into industry-run\narbitration. Dean Witter is now back here attempting to\nplace a hurdle in the way of the public investor who\nironically at this point seeks to enforce an arbitration\nagreement.\nThe issue today before the Court is the extent\nto which the industry and Dean Witter may now invoke court\ninvolvement to interfere with a customer's claims before\narbitration and -- and to decide whether the customer's\nclaims are timely under a section of an arbitration code\nproviding for a time limitation on eligibility. The issue\nis who decides.\nIt is clear that -- that over the years a\npresumption has developed in favor of arbitrability where\nthere is an arbitration clause in a contract. And the\ncases say that that presumption can only be overcome by\nclear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to\nhave a court decide arbitrability issues within a --\nwithin the scope of an arbitration agreement. In this\ncase, there is no such evidence.\nThe arbitration clause in the 1992 agreement\nbetween the parties is as broad a clause as one can\nimagine. The client agrees that all controversies between\nher and Dean Witter concerning or arising from any account\nor any transaction involving Dean Witter and the client,\nwhether or not it occurred in the account, or the\nconstruction, performance, or breach of this or any other\nagreement between us. It's an industry-designed\narbitration clause, meant to be as broad as possible. The\nintent clearly is to move cases against brokers by\ncustomers out of the courts and into arbitration.\nThat -- that 1992 agreement was, of course,\nfollowed by a 1997 submission agreement signed by\nMs. Howsam which merely states that as an undersigned\nparty, she and her trust submit the present matter in\ncontroversy, as set forth in the attached statement of\nclaim, to arbitration in accordance with the Constitution,\nby-laws, rules, regulations, and/or code of arbitration\nprocedure of the sponsoring organization. In this case,\nit's the NASD, but the -- the other self-regulatory\norganizations and exchanges have similar rules to the 6-\nyear rule.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that some of the\nlanguage in First Options, which the respondent relies on\ncuts against your case. How -- how do you deal with that?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Well, first of all, First\nOptions is a case in which there was a question about\nwhether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the\ncase here. And Justice Breyer, writing for the Court,\nwrote that -- that in that situation, the presumption\nshifts.\nThe AT&T case -- clearly the -- when the\nquestion is just the scope of an arbitration agreement,\nbut there is no question about the existence of the\nagreement, there needs to be clear and unmistakable\nevidence of an intent to have the courts decide rather\nthan the arbitrators decide.\nQUESTION: The respondents here, of course,\nargue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the\n6 years, that limits the scope of the -- of the\narbitration agreement.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: The -- the respondent, of\ncourse, is -- is referring to rule 10304, which says that\n-- that disputes which arose out of transactions or events\nmore than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to\narbitration.\nFirst of all, that -- that rule is found in a\nsection of the arbitration code. It's not found in the\nagreement itself. And it's found in a section of the Code\nof Arbitration Procedure.\nQUESTION: Well, so is 10324 which you're\nrelying on. That is, the arbitrator shall be empowered to\ninterrupt and determine the applicability of. I mean,\nthat's --\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Exactly, Justice Scalia. And\nthe point I was -- was trying to make is that -- that the\ncode has to be read as -- as one code in that -- in that\nrespect.\nThe -- it's also, I think, illuminating that the\n-- the section, the 300 series of the code in which that\nis found, is -- is not the eligibility section in the\nsense that the 100 series is. The 300 series is -- is\nbasically a procedural, instructive portion of the code\nfor the arbitrators to apply.\nThere is some -- we -- we've made the argument\nand -- and I think it's a valid argument -- that eligible\nfor submission can mean a number of things. And -- and\nthat it refers, in this case to -- it could refer in this\ncase to when the arbitrators take the case under\nsubmission, just as this Court takes the case under\nsubmission after the petition, after the briefing, after\nthe arguments are made.\nThere -- there is, of course, the need to get\nthe case in front of a tribunal in order to -- to decide\nwhether or not the case is timely. So while the rule may\nprevent the case from going all the way to the end zone,\nit -- it certainly doesn't prevent the -- the litigant\nfrom or the -- the person arbitrating from -- from getting\nout of the starting gate.\nMoreover --\nQUESTION: Is -- is that your criterion, that --\nthat -- the -- on -- on the question of what -\narbitrability turns on the question, do you get in front\nof the particular person or tribunal at all as opposed to\nhow long do you stay when you get there? In other words,\nif -- if it's a question of whether you get there at all,\nit's -- the question is arbitrability and the presumption\ngoes one way. If the question is how long you stay there\nif you get in front of that person, that's not an\narbitrability question and the presumption goes the other\nway. Is that -- that's your point.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: That -- that is one point,\nJustice Souter.\nThe -- the other point that -- that needs to be\nmade is that whether or not this is part of the code, part\nof an agreement, it falls within the John Wiley and Moses\nCone case law as opposed to the First Options holding.\nAnd in -- in John Wiley, if the Court will recall, there\nwere prerequisites, timeliness prerequisites, to filing\nfor arbitration, which the Court said, because there was\nan arbitration agreement and there was no dispute about\nthat, were for the arbitrators to decide.\nIn Moses H. Cone Hospital, there were -- there\nwere prerequisites of timeliness. The -- as I recall, the\narbitration had to be filed within 30 days after an\nopinion by an architect as to the disputed contracting\nclaims. And so -- and -- and the Court -- the Court\nclearly said in Moses Cone that the Federal Arbitration\nAct establishes as a matter of Federal law that any doubts\nconcerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be\nresolved in favor of arbitration, whether the contract\ninvolves construction of the contract language itself or\nan allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to\narbitrability.\nQUESTION: -- definition of the domain of\narbitrability? You're saying shall be eligible for\nsubmission just means that the arbitration forum doesn't\nget to the merits if more than 6 years have elapsed. But\n-- so you say that's not a question of arbitrability but\nhow the arbitrator will proceed.\nWhat is your definition of arbitrability?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Justice Ginsburg, our -- our\ndefinition of arbitrability I think has to be broader than\nthat. But there is -- there is the merits arbitrability.\nThere is the --\nQUESTION: Well, the question that doesn't go to\nthe arbitrator -- you're saying this one does. It's just\nhe has to take it up first -- or she. But we're dealing\nwith, if it's a question of arbitrability, the courts\ndecide it. If it's not a question of arbitrability, but\nthe -- the range of other questions, then it's for the\narbitrator.\nSo my question is, what -- the domain for the\ncourt -- the question is it arbitrable is a question for\nthe court. What is the content of that label, arbitrable?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: It's a hard question for me to\nget my hands around, Justice Ginsburg, but there -- there\nis no question that in the first instance the court has to\ndecide whether a claim is -- is arbitrable. And -- and if\nthe court finds that -- that there is an arbitration\nclause that covers the merits of the dispute, then the\ncourt should defer to arbitrators on any question\nregarding scope.\nQUESTION: Well, now --\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I don't think --\nQUESTION: -- this -- this is a contract matter.\nRight? I mean, if -- if the parties clearly didn't want\nthe arbitrator to do this and wanted the court to do it,\nyou -- you don't dispute that the court would do it.\nRight?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Right.\nQUESTION: So it's just a question of contract.\nNow, you concede the point that arbitrability is\nfor the courts. Right?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Right.\nQUESTION: So presumably if 10304 had read no\ndispute, claim, or controversy shall be arbitrable, okay,\nunder -- under this code where 6 years have elapsed, that\nwould -- would that exclude this from -- from the\narbitrator?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I believe not, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: My goodness, it's using the exact\nterm that you concede sends it over to the -- to the\ncourt.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Well --\nQUESTION: It -- what do you have to do beyond\nusing the -- the very word that you say bounces it to the\ncourt? They say it. It shall not be arbitrable. And\neven that will not -- will not get it to the courts. What\n-- what does one have to do to get it to the courts?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Well --\nQUESTION: And my next question is going to be,\nis there a whole lot of difference between saying it shall\nnot be arbitrable and saying, it shall not be eligible for\nsubmission to arbitration?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I'm not --\nQUESTION: And I don't think there is.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I don't think there is either,\nJustice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Okay. Which is why you're fighting\nme so hard on this. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Precisely.\nI think what we have to do is look to the case\nlaw, including the ATT case and -- and its progeny, and\nFirst Options says the same thing really, that the court\nhas to decide in the first instance is there an\narbitration agreement. Having decided -- and in this case\nit's undisputed -- that there is an arbitration agreement,\nthen the question is, does it go to the substance of the\ncase or is it a matter of the scope? And the cases say,\nstarting with the Gulf and Warrior --\nQUESTION: What happened to the intent of the\nparties?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: That -- that's what --\nQUESTION: I mean, you're talking as -- as\nthough this is some law being sent down from on high. I\nthought we established that step one is what did the\nparties intend.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Right.\nQUESTION: And you say that even if the parties\nsay it's not arbitrable, well, that doesn't matter. We\nstill go through this -- this game that seems to come down\nfrom on high.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: But the question is who will\ndecide a certain issue of arbitrability, and AT&T and --\nand Moses H. Cone and First Options even says that once\nyou find that there's an agreement to arbitrate the\nsubstance of the -- the dispute, then the question is did\nthe parties, by unmistakable evidence, agree that the\ncourts, rather than the arbitrators, would decide that\nscope issue.\nQUESTION: So then you're saying arbitrability\nunder our cases is not for the court necessarily.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I'm saying --\nQUESTION: I mean, you can't have it both ways.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: There -- there's a --\nQUESTION: If you say arbitrability is for the\ncourts, then if the -- if the agreement between the\nparties says this is not arbitrable, that question of --\nof whether those facts exist or not ought to be for the\ncourts.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I think that's true for that\nthreshold issue, but if we get to a point where all issues\nthat -- that may preclude ultimately submitting the case\nto the arbitrators for determination have to be decided by\nthe court, then we're running afoul of John Wiley.\nQUESTION: I -- I didn't understand it that way.\nI thought the question was not what the parties intend.\nIt's how we find out what they intend. And I thought\nwe're trying to decide between a tough burden of proof\nstandard on that that favors courts and where you apply no\nburden of proof standard or, if anything, favor the\narbitration. In both instances, we're trying to find out\nwhat the party intended. But we assume that they intended\ncourt unless there is clear and convincing evidence they\nwanted this arbitrable. Am I right?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I think you're wrong, Justice\nBreyer, although --\nQUESTION: Because? Then I may not have stated\nit correctly.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I think what -- what the --\nagain, what the initial issue for the Court is, did the\nparties agree to arbitrate the substance of the dispute.\nQUESTION: Yes, of course, and I thought what\nmy opinion said was that when we're trying to decide\nwhether they agreed to arbitrate or not, we apply a fairly\ntough standard. They have to show rather clearly that\nthey did.\nWhat were the -- what was the word you quoted at\nthe beginning from the opinion? Didn't you quote a phrase\nthat said on that -- in deciding whether an issue is\narbitrable, we apply the standard of?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I believe I quoted from the\nMoses H. Cone --\nQUESTION: Yes. I'm sorry. You go ahead.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: -- decision which -- which says\n-- which says that the presumption is in favor of the\narbitrator's deciding.\nQUESTION: I'll get the phrase and then -- I'm\nnot communicating. I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I -- Justice Ginsburg asked a\nquestion that I'm also interested in. Quite apart from\nthe reference of -- in the agreement to the fact that the\narbitrator shall decide this, your second argument, on\nyour first argument, what do you want me to say if I write\nthe opinion or another member of the Court writes the\nopinion in your favor? If the essence of the dispute\ninvolves the particular issue, then that is arbitrable and\nthat's for the arbitrators to decide?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: No. I --\nQUESTION: I -- I just don't know what you want\nus to write. It's the same question Justice Ginsburg had.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Justice Kennedy, it's basically\nwhat was announced in the AT&T case when it was sent back\nto the court to decide who decides certain questions. The\nCourt should decide in this case that where there's a\nvalid, written agreement to arbitrate the subject matter\nor the merits of the dispute, particularly where the\narbitration clause encompasses all controversies and the\nparties have not clearly and unmistakably reserved certain\nissues of arbitrability for a court decision and -- and I\nmean, within the scope as opposed to the basic dispute --\nthe presumption in favor of arbitrability should apply,\nand issues relating to the scope of the arbitration\nagreement are for the arbitrators.\nAnd in this case -- AT&T, when the Court sent\nthe case back to the lower court said, these issues are\nfor the arbitrators to decide unless you find unmistakable\nevidence that the parties agreed -- and this is the intent\nof the parties -- that the court would decide.\nI -- I would like to reserve --\nQUESTION: Mr. Friedberg, do you disagree with\nthe Government? The Government did say there are two\nconsiderations. The first one you agree with obviously,\nwhether the parties entered into a binding arbitration\nagreement. And then the Government says there's a second\nquestion, that is, whether the subject matter of the\ndispute falls within the scope of that agreement. Those\nare the two things. You seem to be saying there's only\nthe one, did they agree to arbitrate.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: No. I'm not -- obviously I'm\nnot doing a very good job of expressing our position.\nWhere the subject matter of the dispute, the merits-\nrelated issue -- as in First Options, it was the question\nof whether the Kaplans owed money or not -- is within an\narbitration agreement, then any ancillary type dispute as\nto timeliness should go to the arbitrators to --\nQUESTION: What -- what if I have an arbitration\nagreement that says all -- all disputes arising from an --\nan accident on the employer's premises shall be\narbitrable, and the issue is whether this accident\noccurred on the employer's premises or not? One of the\nparties -- or the -- the employer contends that this\ninjury occurred elsewhere entirely. Who decides whether\nit occurred on the premises or elsewhere?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I think in the first instance\nthe court would decide that because the parties did not\nagree to arbitrate any claims.\nQUESTION: Why is that different from here? The\nparties --\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Because --\nQUESTION: -- did not agree to arbitrate any\nclaims that -- with -- with regard to an accident that did\nnot occur on different premises, but that incurred --\noccurred more than 6 years before.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Because --\nQUESTION: They didn't agree to arbitrate it.\nThey said it shall be -- shall not be eligible for\nsubmission to arbitration.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: Because of the principle,\nJustice Scalia, set out in the John Wiley case and the\nMoses H. Cone --\nQUESTION: But I don't see how that principle\napplies -- doesn't apply here, but applies in the other\npremises situation. I -- I just don't see any distinction\nbetween the two.\nMR. FRIEDBERG: I -- I think because the Court\nhas previously said that a timeliness issue is -- is a\nprocedural issue. It's intertwined with -- with\nsubstantive issues, of course, but --\nQUESTION: Well, can't you make it a -- I mean,\nit's up to the parties, who are masters of their\nagreement. If they want to make timeliness part of the\ncondition of the arbitration, surely they can do it, can't\nthey?\nMR. FRIEDBERG: They could but they didn't in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: What you're saying, I guess, is that\nif the -- if the allegation of harm falls within the\nsubject of the arbitration clause, everything goes to the\narbitrator unless they have unmistakably said that some\nsubsidiary issue does not. Is that --\nMR. FRIEDBERG: That -- that is what our\nposition is.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Friedberg.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor two reasons the question whether\npetitioners' claims were submitted within the 6-year time\nlimit is for the arbitrators to decide.\nFirst, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in\nJohn Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the\nsubject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration,\nthe question whether the dispute was presented within a\ncontractual time limit is presumptively for the\narbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that\nconditions the duty to arbitrate.\nSecond, the time limit in this case is imposed\nby the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure, which the\nparties incorporated into their agreement in full.\nQUESTION: What is -- what is the general\nprinciple that Justice Ginsburg was asking for that\ncontrols your first conclusion?\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay. Arbitrability is, as used\nin the Court's cases, a term of art that includes two\nquestions. One of those questions is whether the parties\nare bound by a valid arbitration agreement and the other\nquestion is whether the subject matter of their underlying\ndispute is within the scope of that agreement. And by the\nsubject matter of their underlying dispute, what I mean is\nwhether they agreed to arbitrate disputes about the\nprimary conduct that -- that is given rise to the -- to\nthe underlying claim.\nAnd what the Court held in -- in John Wiley is\nonce the parties -- once the court has determined that the\nparties have agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of\nthe -- the underlying conduct that's at issue, then\nquestions about their litigation conduct and how those --\nhow that dispute was processed after it arose -- those are\npresumptively for the arbitrators to decide.\nQUESTION: What was the text in John Wiley &\nSons? What was the language of the agreement? Did it --\ndid the agreement say that no controversy shall be\neligible for submission to arbitration?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. The -- the\nagreement didn't use that -- that language. It said the\nfailure of either party to file a grievance within this\ntime limitation shall be construed and be deemed to be an\nabandonment of the grievance. But the point --\nQUESTION: Why? That -- that seems to me -- let\nme put -- it's the same question. Let me put it to -- to\nyou another way. Is there any difference between your\nreading of this clause, shall be -- shall not be eligible\nfor submission to arbitration, and the -- the way you\nwould read a clause which said, no dispute, claim, or\ncontroversy which -- which occurred 6 years previously\nshall be --\nQUESTION: Arbitrable.\nQUESTION: No, not arbitrable -- shall be\nremediable? No award shall be given for any -- for any\noccurrence prior to 6 years.\nMR. ROBERTS: There -- there may be --\nQUESTION: Now, that -- that would be a merits\nquestion, and that's what I think was at issue in -- you\nknow, it's a statute of limitations.\nMR. ROBERTS: The --\nQUESTION: This is not phrased as a statute.\nMR. ROBERTS: There may be differences, Your\nHonor, but -- but the -- the time limit language, the\neligible for submission language, what that indicates is\nthat the timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to\narbitration of the merits of the claim. It doesn't say\none way or the other who decides whether that prerequisite\nhas been met. It doesn't say that the timeliness question\nis not arbitrable.\nQUESTION: Of course, it says the --\nMR. ROBERTS: It says the underlying claim is\nnot arbitrable --\nQUESTION: Neither --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- if it's not timely.\nQUESTION: Neither does a clause which says only\n-- only events that occurred on the employer's premises\nare arbitrable. That doesn't say --\nMR. ROBERTS: No.\nQUESTION: -- who decides that either. But --\nbut since it is an arbitrability question, you -- you\nassume the court will decide.\nMR. ROBERTS: You presume -- you presume that\nbecause if the parties didn't -- didn't contemplate that\nthey would arbitrate about disputes arising from the --\nfrom the underlying conduct, which that goes to, then they\npresumably didn't think the arbitrators were going to have\nanything to do with any questions connected with such a\ndispute. But when they did -- no. Here -- here we know.\nQUESTION: They didn't think they were going to\narbitrate about any matter that occurred more than 6 years\npreviously.\nMR. ROBERTS: When --\nQUESTION: And therefore, they didn't think the\narbitrator would be the one to decide whether it occurred\n6 years previously or not.\nMR. ROBERTS: They agreed and there's -- there's\nno question about it that they agreed that disputes that\narose from petitioners' securities accounts would be\nwithin the -- would the kind of disputes that they would\narbitrate. And so when this claim arose, it was within\nthe scope of -- of the agreement.\nAnd the question here is not whether it's the\nkind of claim that the parties agreed that they might\narbitrate about. It's a question of whether a claim that\nwas arbitrable when it arose has become not subject to\narbitration because of the parties' litigating conduct.\nAnd ordinarily people -- people would assume that the --\nthe forum that they've selected to resolve the underlying\ndispute is going to resolve ancillary questions about how\nthe dispute has been processed and the litigating --\nQUESTION: There are all sorts of\ncharacteristics of a claim: where it occurred, when it\noccurred, the people between whom it occurred, and so\nforth. You -- you've given us no -- no basis for\ndistinguishing one of those characteristics from another\nas far as whether the court or -- or the arbitrator\ndecides.\nMR. ROBERTS: I --\nQUESTION: I suggest that a very clear basis is\nwhat the parties themselves have said. When they have\nreferred to a particular characteristic as being non-\narbitrable, it means that the question of whether that\nissue -- whether that -- that fact rendering it non-\narbitrable exists is a question for the courts. That --\nthat would solve a lot of cases. And I don't know how\nelse you -- you -- you distinguish where from when from\nbetween which people.\nMR. ROBERTS: My -- my distinction is between\nand it's the distinction the Court drew in the John Wiley\ncase and that the courts of appeals have followed for 40\nyears except in -- in the limited context of the question\npresented here. It's the -- the distinction that's --\nthat's been embodied in the Uniform Arbitration Act, which\nis cited on page 14 of the reply brief. It's the\ndistinction between the primary conduct and whether\nthere's a limit on what primary conduct is subject to\narbitrability and other questions about -- about\nlitigating conduct.\nAnd the -- the rule that would focus on the\nlanguage of -- of the parties and parse that language to\nsee whether it's phrased as a limit of arbitrability, to\nthen decide whether the presumption in favor of courts\ndeciding the question of arbitrability imposes an extra\nlayer of complexity that doesn't -- it's not likely to\nreflect the -- the real intent of the parties.\nThe -- what we're trying to figure out is not\nwhether the parties thought this was a question of\narbitrability, but who they intended to decide the -- who\nthey intended to decide the question. And the -- and when\nthe underlying claim is within the scope of their\nagreement, it's likely that they intended that ancillary\nquestions would be decided by the party that they\ncommitted the underlying dispute to.\nBut even setting that aside, here we've got\n10324.\nQUESTION: Here where language is not very\nlikely to reflect their intent, it's -- their language\nwill --\nMR. ROBERTS: Their language reflects their\nintent --\nQUESTION: It's more likely to be reflected by\nsome arbitrary rule that if it relates to place, yes; if\nit relates to time, no.\nMR. ROBERTS: It reflects their intent that --\nthat timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to\narbitration of the merits of that claim. But it doesn't\nreflect their intent of who is to decide whether the\nprerequisite is -- is met. There's -- it doesn't say\nanything about that.\nRule 10324, which is also a part of the parties'\nagreement, does say something about that. It says that\nthe arbitrator shall be empowered to interpret and\ndetermine the applicability of all code provisions. And\nthe time limit is a code provision. The clear import of\nthat, regardless of the issue that we're discussing, is\nthat the arbitrators are empowered to apply the time\nlimit.\nAnd so, even setting aside the 40 years of law\nthat's settled by John Wiley and the distinction between\nthe subject matter of the underlying dispute and -- and\nquestions that go to the parties' litigating conduct, the\nagreement here is clear and that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, are you saying\nessentially the parties have an agreement to arbitrate,\nand that looks like very broad, any and all questions, and\nthen there's this code of procedure? So what the NASD\ncode is directed to is how, if the arbitrator has\nauthority, the arbitrator is to proceed. Is that\nessentially what you're saying?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. It's -- it's concerned --\nthe -- the code is concerned with the rules of the\narbitrable forum, and it makes sense that the arbitrators\nare the ones to interpret and apply those rules. And\nthat's confirmed by Rule 10324.\nBut -- but yes, the -- the question whether a\nclaim is timely submitted goes not to the character of the\nunderlying claim at the time it arose and whether claims\nof that character are subject to arbitration.\nQUESTION: And haven't we got to take that\nposition? Because otherwise we're just going to have\nlitigation chaos?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. That -- it's going to\ncompletely undermine the purpose of arbitration, Your\nHonor. The reason that people agree to arbitration is\nbecause they want cost effective and efficient dispute\nresolution, and moving all these questions into antecedent\njudicial proceedings is going to delay dispute resolution.\nIt's going to impose added costs on the parties, and it's\ngoing to undermine the very reason they agreed to\narbitrate. And it's -- it's -- that's another reason why\nit's just not likely that that's what they intended --\nintended to happen.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, am I right in\nunderstanding that this 6-year is a statute of limitations\nfor the arbitration forum?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Because it says nothing about if the\ncase were in court what the limitation would be.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. It's a forum-specific limit,\nand that's another reason why it makes sense that the\nforum that the limit applies to should be the one that --\nthat applies it. It says that cases won't be eligible for\narbitration under this code. It doesn't refer to whether\nthey might be pursued in other -- in other forums or other\nvenues. It reinforces the -- the expectation that the\narbitrators would decide it which, in any event, as I\nsaid, is -- you know, you can't get any clearer than a\nrule that says that the arbitrator shall be empowered to\ninterpret and determine the applicability of all code\nprovisions.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Starr, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nLet me begin with what we believe to be the\nfundamental point in the case. It has been mentioned in\nthe opening arguments, and that is, this is in fact\ndetermined by contract. What did the parties intend?\nIn response to the specific question posed by\nJustice Ginsburg, the language of AT&T we think is quite\npertinent. It says arbitrability simply means whether the\nparties' agreement creates a duty for the parties to\narbitrate the particular grievance, not whether there's an\narbitration clause at that level of generality.\nQUESTION: But doesn't a grievance -- I mean,\nisn't the point of speaking of grievance just what\nMr. Roberts said? The grievance has got to refer to the\nprimary conduct causing injury. If it is not limited to\nthat, in the absence of unmistakable language, then we're\ngoing to have a trial before every arbitration if there is\nany procedural or other defense that could be raised.\nMR. STARR: We believe, Justice Souter, that the\nlanguage is in fact clear, of 10304. Let me return to\nthat.\nBut let me go to your point with respect to\nlitigation chaos.\nQUESTION: Wait. Before you do that, do you\ndisagree with -- what he said the -- I thought that your\n-- your -- you would accept what he says, but that -- that\nyour point is that the primary conduct causing the injury\nunder this agreement is conduct that occurred within the\nlast 6 years --\nMR. STARR: It is --\nQUESTION: -- and not conduct that occurred\nbefore 6 years.\nMR. STARR: It is going to the issue of what did\nAT&T mean by the specific word grievance. What I believe\n10304 is is a clear statement by the parties, leaving the\nFirst Options presumption aside, which works for us. If\nthere is any doubt as to who decides, the presumption is\nthe courts decide. But here we know, by virtue of the\nplain meaning of eligible for submission. When we couple\nthat, since this is an NASD rule -- and what we did not\nhear from the SEC was what did the NASD intend. What have\nthey said this rule, which has been --\nQUESTION: This is your submission argument,\nyour -- your argument based on the -- on the word\nsubmission.\nMR. STARR: It's eligible --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. STARR: -- eligible for submission.\nQUESTION: But submission -- I just don't see\nhow submission can decide this case because you can say\nthe -- the ultimate issue is submitted when the -- when\nthe whole case goes to the arbitrator, or you can say it\nis submitted when the arbitrator gets beyond procedural\nissues and gets down to the issue of the primary conduct\nthat caused the injury.\nMR. STARR: Justice Souter --\nQUESTION: So I don't see how submission is --\nis going to be the -- the deciding factor.\nMR. STARR: Justice Souter, we would guide the\nCourt first to the word eligible for submission. Eligible\n-- and the NASD has described -- and we set this forth at\npage 25 of the brief -- specifically what it means in this\ncontext. But eligible is a very familiar term. It is\nfound in rule 6 of the Court, and what it means is if\nyou're not eligible, you don't get to this podium. You\ndon't go to the forum.\nAnd the parties are -- I think what is\nessentially dividing the parties here today is that there\nis some sense that because of John Wiley & Sons, the\nparties cannot agree to a temporal restriction. That\nmakes no sense whatever, and indeed it's inconsistent with\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, Congress' policy.\nQUESTION: But you can agree to a temporal\nrestriction and still not commit yourself as to who\ndecides whether that restriction is true.\nMR. STARR: And that guides us -- you're exactly\nright, and so you then go to what is that temporal\nrestriction, and let's analyze that temporal restriction.\nWe believe the words --\nQUESTION: But if the temporal restriction then\nwere phrased in terms of no relief shall be granted on a\nclaim arising, then it clearly would go to the arbitrator.\nMR. STARR: It might very well go to the\narbitrator --\nQUESTION: But it clearly would, wouldn't it?\nMR. STARR: -- under -- under those\ncircumstances. It all depends upon the specific language.\nQUESTION: So it depends on the wording of the\nclause.\nMR. STARR: Absolutely. But here, Your Honor --\nJustice Stevens, we know -- and I would guide the Court or\nrefer the Court to page 25 where we summarize what the\nNASD has said this is its rule. The rule is applicable\nthroughout the industry. This is commonplace. This is\nwhat the rule means, and it is called a -- a\njurisdictional limitation, a -- a substantive\njurisdictional limitation, and it gives the reason.\nQUESTION: But how -- how does the party that's\ndealing with the NASD know that this is -- I mean, why\nshould it be bound by what the NASD has said in other\ncontexts? I mean, it's not a Government organization, is\nit?\nMR. STARR: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the\nsubmission agreement in 1997 -- and this is commonplace.\nIn that submission agreement, the petitioner did, indeed,\nagree to submit the issue for arbitration to the NASD\nunder the rules.\nQUESTION: No, no. To one of three -- I think\nthey agreed to submit to one of -- one of three or four\ndifferent arbitrators, and they happened to pick this one.\nAnd if the other arbitrator had different rules, it would\nhave had a different result.\nMR. STARR: But they -- they don't, and that's\nthe assurance I want to give and why it's odd that the SEC\nhas been silent on this. The SEC has had, in terms of\nwhat the industry knows -- this is common practice in the\nindustry, this -- this rule, the eligibility rule that you\ncould use at a university, are you eligible for admission\nto this university? Eligibility means qualified for our\njustice. Chief -- now Chief Judge Becker described in\nPaineWebber v. Hofmann -- we quote that language at page\n20. 12 years ago he said, looking at the dictionary, at\nWebster's, it can only have one reasonable meaning, and\nthat is qualified for it. One doesn't get in the door.\nAnd there needs to be a gatekeeper. And it is,\nunder this Court's presumption -- this Court's law and\nit's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act as well\n-- it makes sense for the courts to be the gatekeeper.\nAnd I want to come, if I may, to Justice\nSouter's concern about litigation chaos. To the contrary.\nThe rule that is being suggested here ushers in all manner\nof difficulties and we would describe or refer the Court,\nin particular -- this is in our brief -- to the Edward\nJones v. Sorrells case. The Seventh Circuit had before it\nthe following kind of question. Eligibility claim made.\nNo one went to court, but an eligibility defense offered\nto the arbitrators. The arbitrators simply noted it.\nSome of these arbitrations go on for years.\nLiterally 2 years is not unknown in the industry.\nIn that particular case, the arbitrators never\ndecided the eligibility issue.\nAnd the NASD has said this -- we refer you to\npage 7 of our brief, as well as page 25. There was a need\nfor the eligibility rule -- for that rule to be clear and\nfor there to be a gatekeeper.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought that -- that what it\nsays, this rule says -- one interpretation of it,\nplausible interpretation, is arbitrators decide the\neligibility question first.\nDo you agree, Mr. Starr, that this 6-year rule\nis a rule for the arbitration forum? That is, suppose\nthis dispute now goes to court and the court says, we\nthink that the 6-year limit has not been met. Then the\ncustomer says, fine, court, but under New York law, the\nlimit, if we're in court, is 10 years and I'm well within\nthat. This is a limit, as I understand it, this 6-year\nlimit, is for the arbitration forum only, not for the\ndispute.\nMR. STARR: That is correct. But the issue is\nwho then decides whether this forum -- who is the\ngatekeeper? That's what's before you.\nQUESTION: That's now -- now, that's my puzzle\nbecause isn't it odd that a limitation period that applies\nonly in the arbitration forum is then decided by a court\nwhere the court would have a different limitation?\nMR. STARR: Not -- not at all because if there\nis a different limitation -- and, indeed, 10304 draws the\nvery distinction between the eligibility requirement to\nget in the door of arbitration as opposed to a statute of\nlimitation which might vary.\nNow, the 6-year limitation -- the eligibility\nrule -- and we would guide the Court back to the meaning\nof the word eligible for submission. We think that's\nclear, but we think it's clear for the reasons Chief Judge\nBecker said. But we would again refer the Court to what\nthe NASD has said. It is a substantive jurisdictional --\nQUESTION: It said more than that. I mean, it\nsaid -- you quote it on page 25. It said -- and this -- I\nwanted to ask you how that got into the Federal Register.\nIt said, the courts determine the scope of the agreement\nto arbitrate, including whether a matter is eligible for\narbitration on subject matter, timeliness, or other\ngrounds. And that's the NASD in the Federal -- what's it\ndoing in the Federal Register?\nMR. STARR: Yes. The self-regulatory\norganization, which is what the NASD and the exchanges\nare, submit their proposed rules to the SEC which could\nchange this at the stroke of a pen. It has not done so\nfor lo these years while these issues have been\nlanguishing in -- in the courts.\nQUESTION: I -- I would like to get back to the\nquestion --\nMR. STARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Well, why is these interpretations\nthat are not part of the agreement that the respondent or\nthe petitioner here signed -- why are they binding on the\npetitioner?\nMR. STARR: Because she agreed in the submission\nagreement to be bound by arbitration under the code of\nprocedure. It's an express agreement by her which she\nsigned, which goes back to paragraph 19 --\nQUESTION: Well, so we're just talking here,\nwhen you say the NASD has said, this is incorporated in\nthe code of procedure which she agreed to be bound by?\nMR. STARR: No.\nQUESTION: Okay. I thought -- I thought you\nsaid something else.\nMR. STARR: What I tried to say is that the NASD\nhas described the reasons for the rule to which she\nagrees.\nQUESTION: Well, why should that bind her?\nMR. STARR: It binds her only in the sense of it\nhelps the Court understand what the background of the rule\nis. She is bound the rule. We are now moving to what\ndoes the rule mean and what's the purpose of the rule. We\nthink, Mr. Chief --\nQUESTION: Well, supposing I enter into a\ncontract with Sears and, say, I'll pay $300 for something,\nand then Sears has a publication which says, you know,\nhere's the warranty and, okay, you get the warranty. And\nthen Sears puts out a magazine and says, what we really\nmean in this warranty is A, B, C. Now, certainly that\ndoesn't affect the terms -- how you interpret the terms of\nthe warranty.\nMR. STARR: There may very well be, under those\ncircumstances, an issue of whether there was a contract.\nThe other side doesn't dispute that there is a\ncontract and that the NASD rule is a part of the contract.\nQUESTION: But it's the NASD's interpretation of\nthe rule. I mean, if you have a private entity expressing\na view as to what the contract means, I just don't think\nit binds the other side.\nMR. STARR: I'm not suggesting binding\nauthority. I'm suggesting that illumination is provided\nby the NASD's explanation, which also goes to the purpose.\nWhy is this? Is this simply an arbitrary rule? No. It\nis a rule that is borne of experience of the entire\nindustry --\nQUESTION: But, Dr. Starr, can I ask you a\nquestion about the meaning of the rule? It may not really\nbe germane to this ques -- but I've been puzzled.\nSupposing you had a case in which the conduct occurred 7\nyears ago and it was fraudulently concealed until 1 year\nbefore the arbitration is requested. Would that be\narbitrable or not?\nMR. STARR: Well, there would be an issue that\nthe Court would then analyze what is the occurrence or\nevent.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm talking about the\noccurrence is 7 years ago.\nMR. STARR: And -- and in terms of purchase or\nsale of security, it might very well that that would not\nbe arbitrable in this industry because of the occurrence\nor event. There are also, as the Court knows, statutes of\nrepose in the statute of limitation -- in -- in the\nFederal securities context as well.\nBut the point is the --\nQUESTION: So this is an absolute rule without\nany tolling provision.\nMR. STARR: That's correct. It -- it is a\nabsolute eligibility rule that simply tells the person --\nand again, there's no choice here in the sense of if she\nhad gone to the New York Stock Exchange or the American\nStock Exchange because the rule is exactly the same.\nQUESTION: But I'd -- I'd like you to go back to\nwhat I thought was the key question, Justice Ginsburg's\ninitial question. What is this term arbitrability?\nThat the context -- I've gotten not to an\nanswer, but I've gotten to a beginning with First Options.\nFirst Options says that the question of whether you agreed\nto arbitration is basically a matter of intent and apply\nState law. That's the basic rule.\nThen there's a subsidiary rule. The subsidiary\nis, but if what you're interested in is whether the\nparties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability\n-- see Justice Ginsburg says what is that -- at subsidiary\nrule, what you do is assume that silence means no because\nonly if it's clear and unmistakable.\nThen First Options goes on to say we'll give you\na couple of examples. An example whether or not a\nparticular merits-related dispute is arbitrable because it\nwas within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement,\nthat is not a question of arbitrability. Why not?\nBecause the parties, after all, have a contract for\narbitrability. They thought about the question of\narbitrability. It won't -- it -- it's all very likely\nthat they wanted this whole thing to be arbitrable. And\nthen they give you an example of where it is, where there\nis no contract, where there is nothing, where the parties\nnever thought about arbitration, in all likelihood.\nNow, with those examples, it seems to me that\nwe're honing in on but we don't have yet an answer to the\nquestion Justice Ginsburg asked. Well, if there's a\ncontract and it's a thing they likely thought about and\nit's sort of a minor subsidiary thing and, after all, it's\nsomething that the arbitrator knows about and courts\ndon't, that would all say it's not about arbitrability in\nthe sense of requiring a special presumption. But if\nthere's nothing at all in writing, if it's something\ncourts know about, there is.\nAll right. That's where I am. That doesn't\nhelp you because I think in this case, yours would fall in\nthe first category. But, nonetheless, I'd appreciate a\nresponse because I -- I need my thinking developed on\nthis.\nMR. STARR: Justice Breyer, I believe that the\nquestion of arbitrability, the duty, and who decides that\nquestion is guided by the -- is determined by the intent\nof the parties.\nQUESTION: And we agree with that.\nMR. STARR: We now look to the contract.\nThere's some discussion as what does the contract include.\nThe parties have been in agreement that the contract\nincludes the rules, including 10304. That is the most\nspecific and targeted provision, that we then go to that\nrule, and we say, what is the parties' intent with respect\nto whether this issue is eligible -- this matter, dispute,\nclaim, or controversy shall be eligible for submission.\nIt does not say specifically the courts are going to\ndecide that. Right? But the First Options presumption,\nsince the language is not clear that the court shall\ndecide it, is that that is the baseline. That is, in\nfact, the default position unless, indeed, the parties\nhave clearly and unmistakably provided that that is an\nissue for the arbitrator.\nQUESTION: Which brings you to 10324.\nMR. STARR: And 10324 is, in fact, a broadly\nworded provision that says on its face that the\narbitrators are empowered to decide, to interpret, and the\nlike, the provisions of the code.\nSeveral points. The first is this is a very\ngeneral, as opposed to a quite specific, provision, and\nwhen we then analyze it, and we analyze it in the context\nof the remainder of the code -- and I would guide the\nCourt especially to rule -- or section 10104 that says\narbitrators shall be appointed --\nQUESTION: Where do we find that in your brief?\nMR. STARR: 10104 is at page 35 --\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. STARR: -- of the brief, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd that's 10304. And then at the bottom\nparagraph, 10104 says that arbitrators shall be appointed\nby whom? The director of arbitration only for cases that\nshall be eligible for submission under the code. In other\nwords, when we take the code and we look at various\nprovisions -- and we refer the Court to our footnote 8 on\npage 36 of our brief where we identify, Justice Kennedy, a\nnumber of provisions of the code that cannot, in reason,\nbe interpreted by the arbitrators. The powers of the\ndirector of arbitration, by way of example. We enumerate\nsix examples. I think they're more like 17, but when one\ngoes through the entire Code of Arbitration Procedure, one\nwill see a number of provisions that the arbitrators just\nwill not have occasion --\nQUESTION: But are not -- but that those --\nthose provisions are not ones that the court decides\neither.\nAnd I'd like you, Mr. Starr, to tell me why I'm\nwrong, because I take it from your argument you would say\nI'm wrong, in saying we have an agreement to arbitrate\nsigned by the broker and the customer. That seems to be\nas broad as you can get. And then we have a code of\nprocedure which says, if you are going to use the NASD\nauspices, these are the procedural rules, including\nstatute of limitations, which you should decide up front\nand not after you've decided the merits. Limitations\nfirst, then merits. If I think of this as the agreement\nis the agreement to arbitrate and sets what's arbitrable,\nthen the code of procedure is how you proceed in the\narbitration forum.\nWhat is wrong with that division?\nMR. STARR: Because it is building in a\nprocedural versus subject matter distinction, a sort of\nway of looking at the code as opposed to determining --\nand you used the term, Justice Ginsburg, statute of\nlimitations. This is not a statute of limitations. We\nwould guide the Court again -- refer the Court to the\nsecond sentence of 10304 which draws the distinction --\nthis also goes back to Justice Kennedy's question -- that\nwith respect to this -- the first sentence tells us, 6\nyears eligible for submission. It's not eligible for\nsubmission --\nQUESTION: Mr. Starr, can I interrupt?\nMR. STARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Supposing the -- the claimant files a\npiece of paper saying the events occurred 5 years and 11\nmonths ago, and the -- a company comes in and files a\npiece of paper and says, no, they occurred 6 years and 1\nmonth ago. It depends on how you interpret it. Who's\ngoing to decide which is right?\nMR. STARR: That would be a question of -- for\nthe court. It's a question of arbitrability.\nQUESTION: So just filing a defensive pleading\nwould oust the arbitrator of jurisdiction --\nMR. STARR: Oh.\nQUESTION: -- even though the claim itself said\nit was 5 years.\nMR. STARR: No. Under the -- I'm sorry. If\nyou're suggesting that -- and this is the Sorrells\nexample. The -- at -- there, there has been, in effect,\nan agreement, as it were, to allow the arbitrators to take\nthat first cut which comes back to Justice Kennedy's rule.\nThey can, if the parties agree, make the eligibility\ndetermination, but if they make it wrong, that's Sorrells.\nIf -- if the evidence is it's 6 months --\nQUESTION: Well, so -- so in my hypothetical --\nMR. STARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- it would be the arbitrator's\ninitial task to resolve the question of fact.\nMR. STARR: Only under the circumstances that --\nI want to be very clear. The issue of eligibility is, in\nfact, a question of arbitrability and it's presumptive --\nit is for the courts to decide absent clear and convincing\nevidence.\nQUESTION: So then am I correct --\nMR. STARR: But --\nQUESTION: -- that if the -- if the claimant\nfiles a claim saying it happened 5 years ago, and the\ncompany files an answer saying, no, it happened 6-and-a-\nhalf years ago, they would immediately refer that to the\ncourt?\nMR. STARR: Well, you're suggesting a procedural\nissue, namely, filing an answer which suggests to me that\nthe company has, under those circumstances, agreed for the\narbitrators to decide that issue.\nQUESTION: Why? Why? The whole reason for\nfiling the answer is to get it out of the arbitration.\nMR. STARR: No, I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: That's why you file. Go ahead.\nMR. STARR: You can, under those circumstances,\nsay the arbitrators -- I will allow the arbitrators to\ntake this initial cut at that.\nQUESTION: But you can, but what if you don't\nsay that? What if you say, I am saying it was 6 years and\n1 month and for that reason this eligibility question is\njurisdictional and it goes to a court?\nMR. STARR: Exactly. Exactly. And that's\nwhat --\nQUESTION: All right, and if that's what they\nsay, then they go to the court.\nMR. STARR: That's right.\nQUESTION: So all they've got to do is file a\npaper and we're out of arbitration and into court. And\nyour theory --\nMR. STARR: You're -- you're in -- you're in the\ncourt. I was trying to respond to the specific --\nspecific hypothetical, but the principle is yes, you go to\nthe court. What you would do under those circumstances is\nnot file an answer. You would, in fact, say you go to\ncourt and you go to court --\nQUESTION: And it's the same thing if -- if you\nsay that the accident occurred somewhere other than in the\nwork place. And it --\nMR. STARR: There's -- it's the same principle.\nYou're saying this is an eligible arbitration.\nQUESTION: All right. And -- and doesn't\nthat --\nMR. STARR: Are you going to stand -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: No. You go ahead.\nMR. STARR: I was just going to say the issue is\nare you going to stand on your rights under the contract.\nIn your hypothetical, they're filing an answer which is\nexactly what happened in Sorrells. It goes through\narbitration and eventually this is -- I want to provide\nthe Court again with the Sorrells exam --\nQUESTION: They make --\nMR. STARR: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: They make their submission in a\nmotion to dismiss, not in an answer. They say this is not\nproper -- suited for arbitration because the time, in\nfact, is different.\nMR. STARR: You -- the point is you would file\nthat in court.\nQUESTION: Can you step back one second -- one\nsecond from these details you're in? Because I'm seeing\nit not as a matter of detail. What we're after is the\nparties' intent. In most places in the law, the law of\narbitration in this area is either neutral or sometimes\nfavorable to arbitration. But there is one exception.\nThe one exception is where the parties may or may not have\nagreed to arbitrate arbitrability. And there we,\ninterestingly enough, use a presumption that's very\nhostile to finding the intent to have the arbitrators\narbitrate arbitrability.\nNow, in terms of the reason for that hostility,\nhow does that apply here? I would think, at first blush,\nit shouldn't apply at all. Why? Because we're talking\nabout rules of an arbitration forum. And rules of an\narbitration forum -- after all, they're more expert in.\nAnd moreover, the parties have agreed to go to arbitration\nin a lot of circumstances anyway, so they at least know\nsomething of what they're talking about. Why would we\nwant to apply so hostile an interpret -- hostile a\npresumption as to what their intent really is in this kind\nof an area?\nMR. STARR: Justice Breyer, we're asking you not\nto apply a presumption at all. We want you to follow the\nintent of the parties --\nQUESTION: Oh, well, fine. If no exception --\nif no -- if -- if that's really what you mean, then you do\nnot mean that there has to be clear and unmistakable\nevidence. What I mean by my assumption is these words,\nclear and unmistakable evidence, because once we're out of\nthat box, then I think we're right into what Justice\nKennedy said and that's the end of the case. But, I mean,\nit's only those words, clear and unmistakable, that help\nyou, and that's what I mean by the hostile presumption.\nMR. STARR: But again, the presumption and the\nanalysis in First Options goes to where, in fact, the\nparties have not spoken to this issue. We believe the\nparties have spoken to the issue through the NASD rules\nfor the reasons that we have stated, and that is, it's not\nthat we're seeking to build in some new presumption. To\nthe contrary, we're suggesting --\nQUESTION: No, I know. But would you agree --\nyou want it clear and unmistakable or not? Is that the\nstandard or not?\nMR. STARR: That's the standard with respect to\n-- the First Options presumption works for us. What we're\nrelying on is the intent of the parties as articulated in\nthe rules, and again, the NASD has said, here's the reason\nfor the rule.\nQUESTION: Can I -- can I ask you about the\nrules, about 10324 in particular which deals with the\ninterpretation of provisions of code?\nMR. STARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: I assume your -- the -- the other\nside says that -- that that provision gives the arbitrator\nthe power to decide whether 6 years have elapsed or not.\nIf it did that, I suppose it would also give the\narbitrator the power to decide whether the injury was one\nthat occurred in the work place; that is, whether the\nsubject matter was also --\nMR. STARR: The same logic applies.\nQUESTION: I don't see how you could limit it to\nthe one and -- and not apply it to the other, could you?\nMR. STARR: I don't think that they could.\nQUESTION: Shall be empowered to -- so how do\nyou read it? Shall be empowered to interpret and\ndetermine the applicability of all provisions. How do you\nread it? Meaning what? Once he has -- once he has\njurisdiction.\nMR. STARR: Once the arbitrator has juris --\nQUESTION: Within the scope of --\nMR. STARR: -- arbitrators have jurisdiction,\nthey are empowered to interpret the code. But it would be\npassing strange to suggest that prior to arbitration a\nnumber of the provisions of the code precede the\nappointment of the arbitrators and go to the powers of the\ndirector of arbitration. Therefore, it makes no sense to\nsay that the arbitrators can by virtue of the all\nlanguage, which this Court has said in a variety of\ncontexts, TWA, any number of contexts, to the effect that\nthat breadth, if anything, raises ambiguity.\nI just to -- if I may respond, I believe again\nthe First Options presumption is the default presumption.\nBut we would guide the Court and we rest our case on\n10304 --\nQUESTION: So you don't think you even need it.\nYou don't think you even need the presumption.\nMR. STARR: That's correct, because we think the\nparties' intent is clear and the NASD is clear with\nrespect to why this rule exists. It exists because long,\nstale claims, as good as the arbitration forum is -- and\nit's a very fine forum. It's been used in the industry\nsince 1872. But it does not work for long, stale claims.\nYou can't say let's arbitrate a claim from 1929 --\nQUESTION: Well, nobody is questioning the\n6-year limitation, and the question is who decides it.\nAnd I'm still left with the anomaly that a limitation,\napplicable only in the arbitration forum, gets decided by\na court. It's not a limitation on court action. It's not\nan all-purpose. It's not saying this -- these parties\nwill arbitrate -- will -- will have this dispute. This\ndispute will be dead after 6 years. You've conceded that\nthat's not so. The dispute might be alive for 12 years\ndepending on what the State law is.\nIsn't it odd that -- to read a contract to say\nthat a rule governing only the arbitration forum and not\nthe court is decided by the court?\nMR. STARR: It's not odd in this context where\nthe original agreement -- there was not, Justice Ginsburg,\nan agreement, in paragraph 19 of the original client\naccess agreement, to arbitrate in some generic,\nundifferentiated way. It is to arbitrate under the rules\nof either a self-regulatory organization or an exchange --\nQUESTION: But that would --\nQUESTION: Mr. Starr, I guess the same anomaly\noccurs when -- when the dispute goes to whether the\nprimary conduct is covered. Isn't there the same\nanomaly --\nMR. STARR: It's the -- it's --\nQUESTION: -- if the court decides it? And if\nthe court decides it, the arbitration can't go forward\neven though the plaintiff may have a cause of action\nbefore that court --\nMR. STARR: It's the --\nQUESTION: -- for the conduct that -- that is\nnot arbitrable.\nMR. STARR: It is the same principle in terms of\nto what did the parties agree. And I think Justice\nGinsburg is resisting -- I'm inferring -- resisting the\nidea that something that is in the code could somehow be\nin the contract. We would respectfully disagree and say\nthat will, indeed, create havoc in the securities --\nQUESTION: What I was saying is that there's a\ndifference between a code of procedure that says we agree\nto arbitrate and then this is the rules governing the\narbitration forum when you're in arbitration. The parties\nhave agreed to a code of procedure for arbitration.\nThat's how I'm reading this.\nMR. STARR: But, Justice Ginsburg, I would guide\nyou back to 10304 and its language and the term eligible.\nI think, with all due respect, that that interpretation\ndoes grave violence to the term eligible for submission.\nEligible cannot mean that you go to the university and\nthen they said, whoops, you're now out. It cannot -- and\nthere needs to be a gatekeeper here --\nQUESTION: But it could be if you say that all\nthis is is a code of procedure, like the Federal rules.\nMR. STARR: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And if that's what you -- if you say\nwe opt for arbitration and we opt for it to proceed under\nthis set of procedural rules.\nMR. STARR: May I briefly respond?\nQUESTION: Very briefly.\nMR. STARR: Justice Ginsburg, our submission is\nrigorously enforce the contract. This is part of the\ncontract. That is what Dean Witter v. Byrd says.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Starr.\n"
