DRAPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. DRAPER: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and\nmay it please the Court:\nKansas would like to address three issues today.\n50 years of success of the Court's river master\non the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the\nCourt's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the\nwisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate\ncircumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is\nthe subject of this case.\nSecondly, the Court should affirm the neutral\nprinciple that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages\nowing at the time interest begins to run.\nAnd third, a 1-year compliance period would be\nconsistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and\nwould preserve an essential right of Kansas and its\nfarmers under this -- this compact that would otherwise be\nlost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year\naccounting period.\nWith respect to this accounting period, I would\nnote that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court\nhas relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic\nInstitutional Model, which is the standard for compact\ncompliance in this case.\nIn the first opinion in 1995, this Court\ndistinguished between monthly and -- and seasonal use of\nthe model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but\nthat seasonal reliance on the model for determining\nuseability under article IV-D of the compact was\nreasonable.\nWhen the case was back here in 2001, this Court\nreviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a\nyearly basis. As you can imagine, the factors that go\ninto calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so\nit is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H\nI Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently\naccurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm\nwrong. I -- I looked at these papers a while ago. I\nthought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved\nit up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate\nthe -- the relevant amounts in the 10th year.\nMR. DRAPER: That is correct, Your Honor. It is\na moving accumulation of 10 years of results.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So they do use 10 years of\nfigures to determine what the relevant year's water would\nbe.\nMR. DRAPER: That's correct, Your Honor. In\nother words, the -- the annual determination includes the\nmost current year for which there is data and the previous\n9 years, adds all those up, nets out the pluses and\nminuses, and that determines whether in the year in\nquestion there is compliance with the compact.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This will begin in 2007, as I\nrecall. Is that -\nMR. DRAPER: That is the special master's\nproposal, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA:\neven -- even if we agree with you that it should be done\nannually, why -- why wouldn't you propose that it be done\nannually using the previous 7 years' experience that we\nnow have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can\nuse the previous 10 years? I -- I don't understand why we\nhave to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'\nbenefit of -- of this methodology.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I couldn't agree with\nyou more in the sense that we should begin now with the\naccounting so that you look each year at the results of\nthis standard, which has been approved by the Court, for\ncompact compliance in that year only, and if -- if you\naccumulate it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. That -- that's -- I said\njust the opposite. I said I -- I don't know why we should\nbegin looking for this -- at this year only using this\nmethodology. Why shouldn't we average this methodology\nover the previous 7 years?\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, averages will tend to\nsmooth out the results and will hide the effects during\ndry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are\nthe beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit -- and\nboth parties realize that. They need this water -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your method -- your\nmethod will over-emphasize the dry years. So either way\nyou have a -- a imperfect situation. In your case, year\nby year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over\ncompensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row,\nthen it's going to be -- work out to Colorado's\ndisadvantage.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I believe the -- the\nresult is the -- is the opposite. If I may explain.\nThe model, the -- the Hydrologic-Institutional\nModel, has been made as unbiased as possible. The one\naspect in which we have identified a bias is that it\nfavors Colorado during dry years. It tends to\nunderestimate the depletions that would have to be\nreplaced by Colorado.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the method that you're\nattacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't\nit be just the reverse?\nMR. DRAPER: We don't believe that aspect of the\nmodel would be any different if we're doing it year by\nyear. We'd simply be taking the results that are\ncalculated each year under either approach and use those\nin that year so that if you have a dry year, you are -\nare calculating in that year whether there is compliance\nand staying as close as possible to the true intent of the\ncompact, which is to provide water when the farmers need\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do you dispute what\n-- what the master found here, that the methodology is\nmore accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by\nyear?\nMR. DRAPER: No, Your Honor. The longer the\nperiod of time you take, the more the accumulated results\nof the model will match the measured -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The actual year-by-year\nresults. Right?\nMR. DRAPER: Yes, and I should point out that\nit's impossible to know what the right answer is. You can\n-- you can measure the flows and the diversions in the\nriver and compare that to one of the runs of this model,\nbut it's the difference between the two runs, one\nrepresenting the compact condition, which is supposed to\nbe met, and the other representing the situation with the\nwells operating. And it's the difference between those\ntwo whose accuracy is in question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I -- I -\nMR. DRAPER: And no one knows what that is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that -- that the\nmaster concluded that even as to a particular year, the\nmodel will be more accurate if you use the average from\nthe previous 10 years than if you just applied the model\nto a single year, that even as to the real results for\nthat single year, the model will be more accurate if you\nuse a 10-year average.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I don't understand it\nthat way. If you use 10 years, you are adding to the most\nrecent year results 9 years of pluses and minuses that's\ngoing to, in most case, mask what happened during that\nnext previous year. You will be looking at a 10-year\naccumulation of ups and downs and not analyzing what\nhappened in -- in the year in question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part or all of the\nobjectives of both the -- the decree and the 10-year model\nto conserve subsurface reservoirs?\nMR. DRAPER: Not -- not directly, Your Honor.\nIt -- it does preserve that reservoir in fact because\ndepletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows, and\nit's the stream flows that are compacted here and that\nhave up to now --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then -- well, then why\nisn't -- if -- if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado\nshouldn't get credit for the wet years in -- in -- on an\naverage? You're concerned about the dry years. It seems\nto me that Colorado should be given some credit for the\nwet years when the subterranean reservoirs are -- are\nreplenished. Or am I wrong -- am I wrong about that?\nMR. DRAPER: I think in general, Your Honor, you\nare -- are correct. The question about there are over\ndeliveries by Colorado, I believe is what you're\naddressing, is there -- is there a way to give Colorado\ncredit for that. And there is a way. There is a -- a -\nan account in John Martin Reservoir, which is 60 miles\nabove the State line, for those deliveries. When they are\ndelivered there, if there is more delivered than is\nactually needed in that year to achieve compact\ncompliance, that can be retained there and, except for a\nsmall effect of evaporation, is available to offset\ndepletions in the following year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I thought that the compact\nspecifically provided there shall be no allowance or\naccumulation of credits or debits for or against either\nState.\nMR. DRAPER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how does that comport\nwith what you just said?\nMR. DRAPER: Under those circumstances, the\nwater that would be delivered to this offset account in\nJohn Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted\nunder the compact for that year. So it would not enter\ninto the compact accounting for that year. It would not\nconstitute a -- a credit, but it would be available as a\npractical matter to be used as a credit in the next year\nfor current depletions. So there would be no carryover in\ncompact accounting.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't -- I don't understand\nthat statement. You say it would be available to be used\nas a credit in a subsequent year. Do you really mean it\nwould be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply\nbe there to be used?\nMR. DRAPER: I think your formulation, Your\nHonor, is -- is more correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. DRAPER: It would be there to be used, and\nit would not be a credit for accounting purposes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's not a credit for\naccounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as\nmuch the next year even though -- even though you had more\nwater the previous year.\nMR. DRAPER: This is under the assumption, Your\nHonor, that they have already met their obligations in the\ncurrent year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. DRAPER: And it will be available as a\npractical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent\nyear and be accounted in that subsequent year.\nI would point out that this is very important\nit is supposed to be delivered under the compact. If\nwater is -- is not delivered, as required, in one year, it\ncannot be recouped in a following year, certainly not 10\nyears later, as would be possible under the special\nmaster --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why are you using a\n10-year model at all?\nMR. DRAPER: It's not a 10 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me what you're -\nwhat you're saying is forget the 10 years. Just do it\nevery year.\nMR. DRAPER: That's what we are saying, Your\nHonor. And the model is inherently a yearly model. It\ncalculates actually results on a monthly basis, and we\nhave used it -- and the Court has relied upon it -- on a\nyearly basis up to now.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you do it on a\nmonthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily\nbasis? I mean, the master found that this model really\nworks if you -- if you stretch it out over 10 years. You\nsay 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?\nMR. DRAPER: Well, it -- it could be done that\nway, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this\nsame model in its own administration of groundwater\npumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of\nprotecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires\nreplacement of water on a monthly basis. So it is -- it\nis possible.\nBut we believe with the yearly accumulation that\n-- that we have relied upon so far in this case and that\nthe Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that\nthat is an appropriate accounting period for this\nparticular purpose. And that is -- that is our proposal.\nThe proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before\n-- and -- and accumulate it with the other 9 years before\nwe require any replacement.\nI would point out that the H-I Model, the\nHydrologic-Institutional Model, is the best tool available\nfor this purpose. It was endorsed by Colorado after the\nCourt's first opinion in this case when it -- the Court\napproved using the model on a seasonal basis for the\nseasonal accounting of useability. At that time, Colorado\ngave up its own model in favor of the Hydrologic\nInstitutional Model, and as you can see from the master's\nreport, there have been several significant improvements\nin the model since that time.\nI would also point out the correspondence -- the\nclose correspondence that exists between this case and the\nPecos River litigation in the 1980's. There you had a\ncompact that like this compact did not specify any\nspecific quantity of water in the compact itself, but\nindicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the\ndepletions that were occurring at the time of the compact\nwith a few small amendments that I could -- I could\nmention.\nBut the basic similarity of the compacts is that\nthe status quo at the time of the compact was maintained.\nThere was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be\nobserved and was required to be observed by the compact.\nIt was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by\na reference to an inflow/outflow method. In this case, it\nwas expressed implicitly in article IV-D of the compact.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The master found that\nthe role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite\ndifferent than the role of the river master you want to\nhave appointed here. He found that the role of the river\nmaster in the Pecos cases was really ministerial.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, we do not agree with\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You don't agree with\nwhat?\nMR. DRAPER: With the description of the Pecos\nRiver master as being -- as having only ministerial\nduties, and I can explain why.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:\nMR. DRAPER: Yes. if -- if you refer to the\nappendix of our -- our blue brief, on page A-22, you will\nsee that the opening section of the Pecos River master's\nmanual sets out the inflow/outflow relationship that is to\nbe observed in complying with that compact. This is the\nform of an equation. You can see y equals and a -- and a\nnumber there.\nIn -- in our case, we have the -- the\nHydrologic-Institutional Model, which benefits from\nseveral decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic\nanalysis to do the same job.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The Pecos master can\nsimply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results\nthat the compact requires?\nMR. DRAPER: He -- he is to apply the formula,\nYour Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment,\nprofessional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised\nin order to apply it. For example, you have to separate\nflood flows from base flows. When you look at the -- at\nthe results of a -- of a gauge on a river, you can see how\nmuch water was in the river at particular times, but this\nhas to be separated into two different kinds of flows that\nare treated differently under this compact.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, one of the\nan engineer. He's not a lawyer.\nMR. DRAPER: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: He's also the cheapest\nmaster we've ever had.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it seems to me\nthat the master you want appointed has got to be a lawyer\nand make legal decisions.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I don't believe so. I\nthink our master would be just as cheap.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the difference -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The question was what\nabout the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what relation do you\nor -- yes -- working relation do you anticipate, if -- if\nthe river master is appointed, between the river master\nand the commission? Does he go first to the commission\nand try to get agreement or -\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, no, he would not\nformally interact with the commission, just as the Pecos\nRiver master does not formally interact with the Pecos\nRiver commission.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what can -- what can the\nauthority can't do? I -- is the difference between the\ntwo of them -- call it a jurisdictional difference -- nil,\nbut there is process difference in the sense that the\nriver master could say do this or don't do that, whereas\nyour -- your fear is that the authority is simply going to\nbe deadlocked because everything has to be done\nunanimously? Is it a process difference?\nMR. DRAPER: It is a process difference, Your\nHonor. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But for that, you wouldn't be\nasking for a river master then.\nMR. DRAPER: Well, if there were an\nauthoritative way, such as a river master, by which the\nannual recurring exercise of judgment could be\naccomplished, we would not need the river master. But I\ndon't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But aren't you bypassing what\nCongress set up? You have this interstate compact and\nthis commission, which you're saying, well, it's\nineffective because it has to -- there are three from each\nState and it has to do everything unanimously. But what\nabout the commission's authority to call in an -- an\narbitrator when they are deadlocked?\nMR. DRAPER: That decision also requires\nunanimity, Your Honor, and in the one case I'm aware of,\nKansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by\nColorado. It's -- but it's -- it takes unanimity to do\nanything under that compact administration, including the\narbitration option.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying Congress -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Draper, could I ask you\nwhat is a matter of procedure? What is your understanding\nof -- of how one would go about challenging the river\nmaster's decision if one disagreed with it? Do you go to\nthe special master? Do you come direct to this Court?\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, we have suggested that\nit be set up just as you have set up the Pecos River\nmaster. In other words, if there were an objection to the\ndetermination, the yearly determination, of the river\nmaster, it would be reviewable by this Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Directly.\nMR. DRAPER: Directly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the special master would\nbe out. The special master would be out of the picture,\nas you describe it. You -- the special master would be\nfinished. The river master would take over.\nHas there ever been -- has this Court ever\nappointed a river master when the special master did not\nrecommend it? And as I understand both Delaware and the\nPecos River case, the special master recommended the\nappointment of a river master.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I believe in both of\nthose cases, the -- the special master was recommending\nthe appointment of a river master, but I would point out\nthat in setting out the criteria for appointing a river\nmaster, the Court did not refer to that factor as -- as\nbeing part of the consideration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand the system you\npropose, the river master's decision would be appealable\nto us, and we would review it de novo. Is that right?\nMR. DRAPER: We're suggesting the same scope of\nreview as on the Pecos, which is clearly erroneous. This,\nhowever, is something that the Court could decide to do\ndifferently than the Pecos, but the clearly erroneous\nstandard comports with the -- the way master\nrecommendations are handled in the district court under\nrule 53.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm very loathe to deprive\neither of the States of their -- their right to have this\nCourt decide matters between them.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, this would not deprive\neither State of that right. And in fact -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would if they can only\ncome here and -- and overturn the river master if he's\nclearly erroneous. That's a -- that's a very high\nstandard.\nMR. DRAPER: Well, there -- as I say, the Court\n-- the Court may set the review threshold as it sees fit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I had thought that your\nproposal was de novo review. This is -- this is new to\nme, that -- that you want it clearly erroneous.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I would -- I would say\nthat we have -- we have mentioned the clearly erroneous\nreview standard because it was in the Pecos framework. It\nis not essential to our proposal. A de novo review would\nbe perfectly fine with the State of Kansas.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the commission decided\nto appoint an arbitrator. Would the special -- pardon me.\nWould the river master then proceed independently and we'd\nhave two different recommendations?\nMR. DRAPER: As under the Pecos, Your Honor, if\nthe -- if the compact administration, as it's called in\nthe -- in the Arkansas Basin, is able to come to a\nresolution of an issue, then that would -- that would take\ncare of that issue. It would be -- not be necessary to\nhave the river master address that, and it would be an\nagreement of the States because it would either be an\nagreement because they had literally agreed before the -\nor in the form of the Arkansas River Compact\nAdministration or that they had agreed to binding\narbitration and had settled it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it would seem to\nme, procedurally at least, the river master would have if\nnot the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer\nthings first to the commission.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, the referral of matters\nto the commission is why we're here in the first place.\nIt cannot act without unanimity. The State of Colorado,\nthe State in possession of this resource, can veto each\nand every action of the compact administration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was the deal.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your -- yes. Your State agreed\nto it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was the deal they came to.\nWhy should we kick it over? They came to that\narrangement, and it was approved by Congress, and now you\ncome back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. You\nshould -- you should appoint this river master to do an\nend run around it. I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me to be\nfair.\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I don't believe that\nthis is an end run any more than the enforcement of the\ncompact is an end run around the administrative body that\nis set up in many of these compacts. Those are keep-in-\ntouch type bodies. If they can agree on things, they are\nvery useful, and the Arkansas River Compact Administration\nhas been useful in areas where there can be agreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you -- you agree that\nthis is the -- the authority here is more than a keep-in-\ntouch group. Your problem with it is -- is not that you\nneed something more than keep in touch, but that when you\nask them to do something more than keep in touch, the\nother State has a veto. And -- and that simply gets you\nto Justice Scalia's objection. That's the deal you made.\nMR. DRAPER: That is the -- that is the nub of\nour argument against reliance on the Arkansas River\nCompact Administration, that you can't look at it to\nsettle differences about the implementation of this\nCourt's decree.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What did the special -\nMR. DRAPER: That is a -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What did the special master\nmean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote\nproblem, but he said, but the climate may be changing?\nThe compact administration under the chairmanship of the\nUnited States representative may again be seen as the best\nway to administer their compact and settle issues. What\nwas he talking about?\nMR. DRAPER: Your Honor, I think he was talking\nabout the hope that he has that the States could work more\ncooperatively now, despite the fact that it was on this\nriver between these two States that this Court was first\nasked to resolve interstate river disputes between States\nin 1901, and we are here today still in dispute over this\nriver.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there was nothing tangible\nbehind his -\nMR. DRAPER: Nothing tangible, Your Honor.\nWe -- perhaps he was thinking of the settlement\nthat we have achieved on the Republican River. That case\nstarted, was accepted by this Court. After rulings by\nthis Court, it became possible to settle that case. It\nhas now been settled. And the States involved in that\nlitigation were Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. It was\npossible in that -- in that context. It has proven\nimpossible in this context.\nAnd we can expect disputes to go on, as they\nhave over the last century, if we do not have an impartial\nexpert authority to resolve disputes between States that\nare going to come up every year. Every year there are\nquestions. How do you take the data this year and put it\ninto the H-I Model? While many of those issues have been\nsettled, because different forms of replacement and other\ndifferent circumstances arise, you have those every year.\nAnd if you follow the lead that the Pecos River\ncases of this Court give us, there is also the possibility\nto address the improvement of the tool for implementing\nthe agreement of the States, and that is improving the\nHydrologic-Institutional Model on occasion, as we have\nseen the master do over the course of this litigation.\nThat is allowed under the Pecos River Decree, and we\nsubmit that it should be allowed under this decree as\nwell. And that is when the master would be exercising the\nmost judgment in our opinion.\nI would conclude by saying that a -- a river\nmaster is needed on the Arkansas to deal impartially and\nexpertly with annual questions that must be resolved to\nimplement the H-I Model, and that a 1-year compliance\nperiod will implement the intentions of the drafters of\nthe compact and the needs of Kansas farmers and is\nconsistent with the yearly reliance that this Court has\nalready placed on the H-I Model.\nI'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if\nthere are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Draper.\nMr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. ROBBINS\nON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT\nMR. ROBBINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think I will begin by discussing the river\nmaster since that's where Mr. Draper left off.\nI want to make it clear, first of all, that I\ndisagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact\nand the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they\noperate. The Pecos River Compact did, in fact,\nspecifically state that it was -- it intended to hold the\nlevel of -- of depletion of the system by man's\ndevelopment to the 1947 condition. The Arkansas River\nCompact, to the contrary, begins the -- the limitation\nclause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent\nfuture beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin,\nprovided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not\nmaterially depleted in useable quantity for existing use\nfor the uses. So the -- the Arkansas compact contemplated\nthat there would be a -- a more flexible effort at using\nthe water of the river by water users in both States,\nprotecting the existing uses in both States from that\nfuture development.\nNow, this -- this Court has appointed a river\nmaster in two circumstances. In both circumstances, as\npointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the -- the special master\nrecommended that because of the specific circumstances of\nthe case, that in fact a river master was appropriate.\nall other cases that deal with this issue where requests\nhave been made by -- by States without river -- without a\nspecial master's recommendation, the Court has declined to\nappoint a river master. There's a very good reason, I\nthink, behind that.\nColorado alone is the party denying interstate\ncompacts in two equitable apportionment decrees. If every\ntime a State is dissatisfied with its neighbor, is\ndissatisfied with how a compact operates, it is able to\ncome to this Court and say, please appoint a river master,\nwe're just having trouble with our neighbor, you'll become\nthe water management -- the super water management agency\nfor the country. You have river masters if you -- it's\ntotally up to -- to your discretion. But if you were to\nfollow this line of thinking, you end up supervising water\ndistribution across the west and part of the east.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the disputes are going to\ncome up here eventually anyway if the States are\nintransigent. Ultimately it will be a dispute about the\napplication of the compact and it will come back here\nanyway, won't it?\nMR. ROBBINS: Justice Scalia, that is absolutely\ncorrect, but the difference is where compacts have\nmechanisms within them that are designed to work out these\nColorado's position is and the special master's position\nwas it was in the Court's interest -- to refer these\nmatters back to those compact administrations. You --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, do you think it's\nany more likely today than in the past that the two States\nwill be able to work out their continued disagreements?\nMR. ROBBINS: Justice O'Connor, I agree\ncompletely with the special master. The State of Colorado\nhas proposed, as referred to in his ruling, that binding\narbitration be used and has committed itself to\nparticipate in that. To the extent there -- there have\nbeen past conflicts, Colorado has said let's get them\nbehind us. Let's return to the compact, congressionally\nsanctioned method for resolving our differences, and let's\nproceed down the road. We will --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but Colorado still has\nthe veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will\nbe appointed. Is that right?\nMR. ROBBINS: That is -- under the compact,\nthat's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, yes.\nMR. ROBBINS: And so -- but -- but Colorado has\nmade a -- a very clear commitment to the special master\nand does so to this Court that if arbitration is proposed,\nColorado would participate. We do not as a State find it\nvery acceptable to spend the time, money, and effort to\nlitigate these issues. After all, we have farmers.\nKansas has farmers. We need to get back to getting the\nwater equitably resolved through the compact mechanism.\nThat is our proposal. It was -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So is it right then that -\nlet's imagine the special river master's name is Mr.\nSmith, and unlike me, he knows about this stuff. And he\nthen -- you -- Kansas wants Mr. Smith to decide a certain\nnumber of issues. Call them issues on page 1, whatever\nthey are. And as far as you're concerned, your client\nwould say I'm happy to have Mr. Smith. Just don't call\nhim a river master. Call him an arbitrator. So you're\nsaying that when Kansas says they would do it except\nthere's a problem of getting unanimity, you say the only\nproblem is that you won't agree.\nMR. ROBBINS: At the present time, that's the\nposture -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, they're the obstacle to\nunanimity. So the keys are in their own pocket if they\nwant Mr. Smith. That's your view.\nMR. ROBBINS: Our view is if they want to\narbitrate pursuant to the compact, the keys are in their\n-- in their pocket. We do not believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER:\nunanimity because your side agrees. I mean, you heard\nwhat he said. So I'm -- I'm trying to see -\nMR. ROBBINS: Our side agrees, Your -- Justice\nBreyer, with -- with the concept that this matter should\nbe returned to the compact administration to resolve the\ndifferences in that forum.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and in that forum, you\nwill agree to binding arbitration.\nMR. ROBBINS: In that forum, we will agree to\nbinding arbitration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Binding arbitration will -\nwill mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk, won't it?\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes, it will.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBBINS: I want -- I want to make it very\nclear to the Court that the State of Colorado, different\nthan the situation in the Pecos River, acted very\naggressively to ensure that it promptly came into\ncompliance with the -- with the determination that in fact\ndepletions were occurring, impermissible depletions were\noccurring to the Arkansas River. Within 2 years, the\nState of Colorado's legislature had passed the appropriate\nlegislation. The State engineer had passed rules and\nregulations, implemented them, and enforced them. The\nacquisition of replacement water, and -- and the State of\nColorado -- your -- your ruling was in 1995. By 1997, it\nappears that the State of Colorado was in compliance with\nthe compact. That is a significant and very difficult\neffort on the part of the legislature, the Governor, the\nattorney general, and the State engineer.\nWe do not believe that this is anything like the\nPecos River. Your master in this case has not said to you\nthese parties are -- are torn, will not get together, and\nyou need to have a master, a river master, appointed. In\nthis instance, the State of Colorado took the exact\nopposite approach. They did everything they could to\nreduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow\nColorado to meet the terms of the compact, and that is an\nimportant fact you need to glean from the special master's\nreport.\nNow, the -- the other -- the only other point I\nwant to make on this is that the -- the -- it's -- it's\nvery important, in deciding whether or not a river master\nis the appropriate course of action to determine -- and I\n-- I mentioned this earlier -- whether or not the Court\nwants to be in a supervisory position. I happen to agree\nthat the States are entitled to seek redress of their\nconcerns before this Court, and as you said in -- in\nOklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to\nadjudicate disputes between the States where there are\nactual and existing controversies. And -- and the fact\nthat you would have a river master would not eliminate the\npotential for those controversies. In our view, the only\nway that you can get this matter off of your plate and\ninto the position that Congress recognized and -- and\ndirected is to follow the special master's recommendation\nnumber 12.\nI'd now like to turn, if I may, to the issue of\nthe accuracy of the model.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question,\nbecause you may not bother to talk about it otherwise,\nabout punitive damages? Your opponent didn't seem to\nthink it very important, but I have this question. Is it\nyour view that the other State waived its claim to the\npunitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it\ntoday or by submitting the different set of figures at the\ntime the -- the issue was before the master the last time\naround?\nMR. ROBBINS: Justice Stevens, in response to\nyour question, we believe that in fact the issue of\nprejudgment interest, or punitive damages, is law of the\ncase in this matter. The special master set out a formula\nby which he proposed how the damages should be calculated.\nKansas argued for actual value of money, a rather rigid\ntheory of compensation, and the special master chose in\nfact a balancing of the equities approach. He suggested\nthat the appropriate means to calculate those -- that\nprejudgment interest on the -- the nominal damages -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did he -- did he make that\nsuggestion or did the other -- did Kansas make that\nsuggestion?\nMR. ROBBINS: The special master ruled on how he\nbelieved the damages should be calculated.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In this time around or in the\npreceding -\nMR. ROBBINS: In the preceding time around. And\nwhat he said was that the damages from 1950 to 1968 should\nbe -- should -- should receive a inflationary increase to\nreflect the inflationary tendencies, but that they should\nnot be dealt with under prejudgment interest. In other\nwords, it shouldn't be compounded through prejudgment\ninterest. Only the damages from 1969 forward should be\ncompounded using prejudgment interest.\nKansas did not except to that methodology.\nKansas excepted to the fact that he didn't give them\nprejudgment interest on the damages from 1950 forward. In\nthe opinion that you authored for the Court, you accepted\nthe master's methodology, and you did one thing and only\none.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the master's methodology\nreally wasn't at issue.\nMR. ROBBINS: The master's -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The only issue before us, as I\nremember it, was the date from which the prejudgment\ninterest would run.\nMR. ROBBINS: That's -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's -- that's all that was\nargued.\nAnd it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed\nsum rather than an -- a changing amount as years went by,\nthat clearly we would have -- the interest would have run\non the existing liability. But it's an unusual case\nbecause the damages are changing as time goes by.\nMR. ROBBINS: It is and I agree with you,\nJustice Stevens. It is an unusual case. But the -- the\ncritical element here is that the master was looking for\nan equitable way to arrive at a damage sum.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that, as I read\nhis report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best\nhe could, on the second go-round.\nMR. ROBBINS: This -- this go-round?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. ROBBINS: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY:\nwhat's before us here. It -- it seems to me that your\nbest argument for no interest post '85 on the pre-'85\ndamages is to say, well, it's uncertain, it's hard to\ncompute, but that doesn't quite work because this Court -\nand of course, the special master -- allowed damages -\nthe interest on post-'85 damages even though those are\nequally difficult to compute.\nMR. ROBBINS: It isn't the -- if I may, Justice\nKennedy, it isn't the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So I'm -- I'm saying it seems\nto me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in\nthere.\nMR. ROBBINS: I understand.\nThe -- but the -- in our view the State of\nKansas was obligated to take an exception if it disagreed\nwith the methodology used by the special master and\nadopted in Justice Stevens' opinion by this Court. There\nwas a sum of damage that was calculated by that and\nreported to the Court: $38 million. By moving the year\nforward from 1969 to 1985, you automatically then reduce,\nby some degree, the amount of that damage calculation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but did we -- your -- your\nview is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that\npast damage.\nMR. ROBBINS: Prejudgment -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pre-1985.\nMR. ROBBINS: The -- the special master's\nmethodology, Justice Stevens, was that the damages in his\nthird report from 1950 to 1968 should not, under a\nbalancing of the equities, bear prejudgment interest at\nany point in time. They should only be advanced for\ninflation, which was a proposal Colorado made because\nColorado believed that it -- the changing a 1950 damage to\na -- to a 2002, or at that time a 1994, dollar value was\nonly fair and reasonable. We opposed the concept of\ngiving prejudgment interest because it would -- it would\nbe -- it's as if -- if this were a commercial context, we\nwould have been able to identify that there was a damage\ngoing on and the theory in your prejudgment cases is we\ncould have put the money in the bank --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we rejected that as to\npost-'85 damages.\nMR. ROBBINS: You agreed that prejudgment\ninterest, Justice Kennedy, should be applied to post-'85\ndamages, not to pre-'85 damages.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but our opinion didn't\nsay it was just post-'85 damages. Our -- our opinion\ndidn't -- didn't answer the question, and -- and the\nreason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it\nbecause nobody even -- nobody argued it at that time.\nMR. ROBBINS: Our view was that -- that -- our\nview is, Justice Stevens, that an exception needed to be\ntaken if the master's methodology was under challenge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So in a way you really are\narguing waiver I think.\nMR. ROBBINS: We are arguing law of the case.\nYes, we are.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is consistent with his\nfailure to argue it today.\nMR. ROBBINS: That's -- that is our position,\nYour Honor.\nI would like to, if -- if I may, move off of\nprejudgment interest. I would like to talk, while I still\nhave a few minutes, a little bit about this model and the\n10-year average.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can you give -- I'm -- I'm not\nsure I understand the dispute. Can you give me in -- in\n-- without using up all of your time, a -- basically a\nsimple example to illustrate the difference between the\ntwo contending methodological positions?\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes, I can, Justice Souter.\nUnder the -- the master's formulation, which is\nagreed to by Colorado, the damages which occur in each\nyear, 1950 through 1984, are -- are computed at -- in -\nas nominal damages in the year in which they occur. They\nare then expanded by the -- by an inflationary formula\nwhich allows the dollar in 1950 to be calculated in a 2002\ndollar.\nIn 1985 and to the present, any damages that\noccur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are\nalso awarded a prejudgment interest, which is compounded.\nIn other words, if inflation is 2 or 3 percent through the\nperiod on a long-term average, but -- but investments are\nat 6 or 7 percent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I got you.\nMR. ROBBINS: -- those damages advance.\nColorado's -- Kansas' view is that commencing in\n-- in 1985, all of the damages from 1950 to the present\nshould receive prejudgment interest. The difference then\nbecomes, if you use the master's methodology, the -- the\ncurrent amount of money in 2002 dollars which Colorado\nwould owe Kansas is approximately $29 million. If you use\nthe Kansas methodology -- and this is the impact of\nprejudgment interest -- it would be $52 million. Under\nthe original formulation that was presented to the Court,\nthe value under the master's formulation, which did not\ncharge prejudgment interest on the '50 to '68 dollars,\nboth States agreed that that would have been $38 million.\nSo from Colorado's perspective, having succeeded in our -\nin our exception that the year should be 1985 instead of\n1969, we in fact, under the Kansas theory, lose some\n$20-some million in the proposition, which we don't\nbelieve is what the Court intended.\nLet me -- let me turn very quickly to the model,\nif I may.\nThe -- the issue here is not Colorado's\nobligation to deliver water to -- to the river system.\nColorado has both senior surface water rights and the\nState of Kansas that it has obligations to protect.\nRemember, the compact envisions that this subsequent\ndevelopment can't injure water users in either Kansas or\nColorado. As a result, Colorado must ensure that on a\nmonthly basis, water is placed into the river so\ndepletions are -- are compensated for in the system as\nthey occur.\nThe problem here is not that process. The\nproblem here is a model that is inaccurate. Beginning in\nyour first report, you quoted with favor the special\nmaster's comments about this model in dealing with the\nwinter water storage program, which was an issue which you\nagreed should be dismissed several years ago. You\nindicated that depletions shown were well within the range\nof error and it could not be told if it was an impact or\nan error that the model was describing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, your time is running\nshort. This is very important. I think you misunderstood\nJustice Souter's question. He asked you to give us an\nexample of the Kansas versus Colorado approach as to the\n10-year model. You answered him about the interest.\nCould you -\nMR. ROBBINS: I'm so sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- could you tell us really -\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Give us an example of the\ndifference between the two.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes. The difference between the\ntwo is this. We believe that the model over a long period\nof time, as it's developer, Mr. Durbin, said, is\nreasonably accurate. We -- we agree with that, and we are\nwilling to use it like that. But that means you have to\nuse -- look at it over extended periods of time. Our view\nis that you simply look at the model, which is predicting\nover-deliveries and under-deliveries, predicting them.\nThey don't have any relationship to what Colorado is\nreally putting into the system. They are predictions.\nAnd in some years where you -- where you look back and you\nknow from the gauges the model is over-predicting a\nsignificant amount, you -- you want to be -- and you know\nin a subsequent year it's going to under-predict, you want\ngetting close to what's really going on. It is not an\neffort to carry dry-year depletions into wet years or vice\nversa. It is, in fact, an effort to allow the model's\ninherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more\naccurate result in each 10th year.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't -- why isn't the\nresult that you -- of -- of your position that you would\nget a more accurate set of predictions if all you were\nmaking was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a\nmore accurate set of predictions with respect to any one\nyear? And in fact, it is with respect to any one year\nthat's important under the compact. In other words, they\n-- they plan every year, not every 10 years. So why does\na 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical\nproblem you have on a year-to-year basis?\nMR. ROBBINS: As proposed by the special master,\nthe model is not used every 10 year -- or every 10th year.\nIt's used every year. If you're looking at -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know. But it's used on the\nbasis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate\nparticularly with respect to any given year even though\nthey would be -- they would be accurate if you were only\ninterested in a calculation every 10 years.\nMR. ROBBINS: You are making -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does it -- can -- can you -\ncan you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is\nwhat I'm saying.\nMR. ROBBINS: You get a better prediction on a\nyear-to-year basis. A -- a better prediction if you're\nlooking at the model over 10 years versus looking at the\nmodel just running it in a given year. Colorado does not\nwant to be in a position, Justice Souter, where we are\naccused of violating the compact because there is an\ninaccuracy in the tool that is being used.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you -\nMR. ROBBINS: It -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRobbins.\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Feldman, we'll\nhear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's the position of the United States that -\nthat we agree with Colorado and with the special master\nthat a river master should not be appointed in this case.\nThe compact between the States of Kansas and\nColorado sets up a commission that is responsible for\nimplementing the obligations in that compact, which has to\ndo with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount\nof water to Kansas. The commission is also charged with\ninvestigating violations of the compact, and the compact\nincludes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to\nbinding arbitration if the -- the States agree to that.\nThe -- the commission also certainly could use other\ndispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the\nauthority to do if it wanted to.\nThe States have agreed to that. Congress has\nenacted it into law, and this Court should permit the\nparties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that\nmight arise in the future rather than putting a river\nmaster in place under the authority of this Court.\nNow, the Court has -- itself has frequently\nstated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort\nis preferable to litigation. As the special master\npointed out, in the two river basins just north of the\nArkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River,\nthe parties recently, after having a dispute, including\nthese very same two States in one of them, have come to a\nconsensual resolution of the dispute that they had. And I\nthink that does show, as the special master pointed out,\nthat these -- the States can -- in fact, the disputes in\nof well pumping, among other things. As the special\nmaster pointed out, I think that shows that the States can\nuse a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and\nthis Court ought to continue its often-stated preference\nfor consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to\nproblems of this sort.\nIf the Court were to appoint a river master in\nthis case, then I think the question would arise in any\nfuture case in which you have two States that have\nconflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity,\nas what happened with river compacts, equitable\napportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an\ninherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an\nappeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree\nor judgment. And I think rather than -- that -- that\nwould be directly contrary to the Court's other statement\nin the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and\nthat it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions,\nbut also that the Court does not favor appointing agents\nor functionaries to carry out its decrees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I guess we made a mistake\nwith respect to the Pecos River and what was the other\none? Delaware?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. The Pecos River -- I mean,\nthere were a couple of differences, in addition to the\nones that Mr. Robbins pointed out. One difference is that\nnot only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos\nRiver case -- neither party objected to the appointment of\na river master or even to the more extraordinary step of\nclothing the master with authority to make determinations\nthat would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous\nstandard. In this case, there is a party that objects to\nit.\nAnd I would -- I think there's another\ndifference that's important that the Court ought to keep\nin mind. At the time the Pecos River master was\nappointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which\nthe Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide\nfor this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that\nfindings of fact by a master appointed by a district court\nshall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and\nthe Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the -- it\nprovided that the river master in that case would be\nreviewed under that standard.\nAs of 2003, rule 53 -- it's now rule 53(g) -\nprovides that masters appointed by district courts said\ntheir findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo\nstandard unless the parties agree otherwise. Therefore,\nat the present time -- and again, following the Court's\nrule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure should be guides -- and I think they are a\nuseful guide -- the appropriate course here, if the Court\nwere to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one\nwhose findings will be reviewable de novo.\nBut that itself raises problems because if the\nfindings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's\nreally just a continuation of the current litigation and\nit doesn't really advance things any. The parties will\nsubmit the evidence to the river master. He'll make his\ndeterminations, and then they'll come to the Court.\nThat's really more what the special master does at the\ncurrent time.\nSo I think that under all of those\ncircumstances, both the Court's preference for a\nconsensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of\nappointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the\nCourt's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to\ndecide cases of this sort and it can't -- it's not the\nobligation of other parties to do that, and the commission\nthat Congress has put into place specifically to deal with\nthis kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that\nthere could be disputes and a provision for a dispute\nresolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a\nriver master in this case.\nAs far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's\nthe position of the United States also that the special\nmaster and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest\nshould not be awarded. I think it's a familiar principle\nin -- to this Court in litigation that if a party -- when\nthe time comes to make objections, a party has to make all\nof its objections if it wants the Court to hear them.\nIn this case, the special master came up with a\nrecommendation in his third report about how to -- what\nshould happen with prejudgment interest, under which the\nearly years -- the -- the amount of the damages in those\nearly years would never be subject to prejudgment\ninterest.\nNow, Kansas objected to that and said we should\nmove the year back to 1950. We should get prejudgment\ninterest on everything back to year one. But they never\nmade the objection that if you -- if the Court disagrees\nwith that, which it did, that the method that the master\nhad used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969\nwas incorrect. That was the time that Kansas should have\nbrought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're arguing they've\nwaived the -- your argument is they waived the objection\nbasically.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. I think -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think you used the\nword waiver in your brief, and I don't think that Colorado\ndid either. But I guess that's the essence of your\nargument.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I actually think it's a\ncombination of two things. On the one hand, what the\nCourt actually said in its opinion was that the special\nmaster had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to\nsatisfy the demands of equity, something to that effect.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you not agree that if it\nwas a one-shot injury, not an ongoing injury, that the\nnormal reading would be the injury -- the interest should\nrun on the laws?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think in the normal contract\ncase that doesn't have the kinds of equities that this\ncase had, that is the current rule, that prejudgment\ninterest would run. But this kind of case involves\ndamages that go back 50-odd years. It could have been -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it involves continuing,\nongoing -\nMR. FELDMAN: And they're -- they're ongoing\nthat are different in amount in every year, that it's not\nmerely that Colorado was violating the compact as of 1950,\nalthough it probably didn't know it at that time, but that\nKansas didn't bring a suit until 1985 and the fact, I\nthink, that Colorado has always agreed to pay -- to adjust\nthe damages for inflation. So, in essence, Kansas is\ngetting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would\nnormally cover for those early years. I think if all\nthat's put together, I think the Court's conclusion that\nthe master's conclusion was just the amount that equity\ndictates was correct, and that if Kansas didn't like that,\nit should -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Feldman, the Government\ntakes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year\ncomputation?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, the Government doesn't have a\nposition on that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Too hard for you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FELDMAN: That issue involves the\nparticularities of this case and the Government doesn't\nreally have a particular interest in how that gets\nresolved.\nIf there's no further questions, that concludes\nthe argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nFeldman.\nMr. Draper, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. DRAPER\nMR. DRAPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI want to state that we do not believe that we\nwaived our position on the interest calculation as was\njust suggested in the -- in the last colloquy. The reason\nthat we didn't do that is because we filed an exception\nlast time against every respect in which the special\nmaster was not recommending full interest. And it turned\nout that the Court chose the -- the test that we now have,\nwhich is a relatively easy test to apply. It has certain\nincentives that grow out of it that make sense. And we\nbelieve that we sufficiently excepted to that. If look at\nour brief from that exception, the one in -- in support of\nour exceptions, in particular -- particularly to page 25,\nfootnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the\n-- the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950\nthrough 1968 period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You're talking about\nthe brief in the earlier case.\nMR. DRAPER: In the earlier case, to the third\nreport of the special master.\nI would -- also, on the other points that were\nraised, you need to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a lot of money\ninvolved, and -- and you certainly didn't argue it here.\nI don't recall that point being argued. And with all that\nmoney being involved, I would have thought it would have\nbeen argued.\nMR. DRAPER: Well, we were -- we were arguing\nthe larger issues on interest, but we were asking that\ninterest not be denied to us during that '50 through 1968\nperiod. That was very clear from our briefs, and we\nspecifically singled out that part of it in that footnote.\nSo I don't believe it's appropriate that -- to conclude\nthat we have waived that argument.\nAnd I would point out also that the only reason\nthat it was done that way -- and the calculations of the\nparties did -- did in connection with that review -- is\nbecause the special master required it. There is no other\nreason that we did it. We did not volunteer to do it that\nway. We did not like doing it that way. The master said\nthat's the way it's going to be in my recommendation. How\nmuch would that amount to? We did not agree in any way to\nthat part of the calculation.\nI would also point out that with respect to the\namounts involved, that you need to be careful. The\namounts cited by Mr. Robbins are not from the same year.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you. Thank you,\nMr. Draper.\nMR. DRAPER: Thank you, Your Honor.\n"
