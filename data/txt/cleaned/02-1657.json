Anthony J.\nPrincipi.\nMr. Wolfman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 1999, Randall Scarborough won his disability\nappeal before the Veterans Court on the ground that the\nGovernment's position constituted clear and unmistakable\nerror and that that position was, quote, not reasonably\ndebatable. End quote.\nHe then immediately filed a fee application\nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act that contained three\nof the elements called for by the act, but it did not\ninitially allege that the Government's position lacked\nsubstantial justification.\nThe Government seized on that alleged omission\nand without any mention of this Court's path-marking\ndecision in Irwin v. Veterans Affairs, both it and the\nFederal Circuit determined that this omission of this\nlegal conclusion was jurisdictional, meaning in effect\nthat Mr. Scarborough's amendment to the application could\nnot relate back to his timely filed application.\nThe Federal Circuit and the Government persisted\nin this view even after this Court remanded in light of\nEdelman v. Lynchburg College, which embraced the relation\nback doctrine both in a judicial and an administrative law\ncontext.\nThe Federal Circuit's fundamental error here,\nthe basic mistake, is that it perceived EAJA's limitations\nperiod as jurisdictional. As I said, that holding can't\nbe squared with the decision in Irwin or as reiterated by\nthis Court just two terms ago in Franconia Associates, and\nthat principle is this: unless Congress has provided\notherwise, limitations periods that run in favor of the\nGovernment like those involving private parties are not\njurisdictional, but rather are subject to ordinary statute\nof limitations principles that provide exceptions under\ncertain circumstances.\nAnd so then the question is, what does EAJA say\nto this? There's nothing in EAJA that even hints that the\nstatute creates the absolute -\nQUESTION: EAJA is Equal Access to Justice.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Equal Access to Justice Act.\nThat's the acronym, Your Honor.\nThere -- there's nothing that even hints that\nthe Court -- that the Congress created that type of\nabsolute time bar under EAJA. In fact, quite the\ncontrary. The statute makes clear that a court\nentertaining an EAJA application already has jurisdiction\nover the action. Simply put, EAJA can't be jurisdictional\nin that sense, absolute in that sense, because as this\nCourt just reiterated in Kontrick v. Ryan, EAJA doesn't\nserve to place a class of cases within a court's\nadjudicative authority.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfman, if you're right about\nthat it's not jurisdictional, so there should be equitable\ntolling, why should there be equitable -- what's equitable\nabout allowing a lawyer to overcome his carelessness? I\nmean, the -- the case of a layperson not getting a\nverification is one thing. A lawyer reads a statute, it\nsays, do this, that, and the other, and he doesn't do the\nother, and then it says, oh, but be equitable, court. Why\nshould a lawyer's carelessness be an occasion for\nequitable tolling? Is there anything in it for the client\nif this is just the lawyer's fee?\nMR. WOLFMAN: No. Well, I think there are\nseveral answers to that, but let me take the last part\nfirst, Your Honor.\nFirst is that here actually the -- the client\nhas much coming. These are the client's fees, and the\nveterans statutes provide that the contingent fee, which\ncannot exceed 20 percent, would be reduced dollar for\ndollar by the EAJA recovery. So the client here, as all\nveterans claims, do have money at stake.\nLet me turn to the question of equitable tolling\nthat you asked.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Explain that again. The\ncontingence fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by the\nrecovery on -\nMR. WOLFMAN: By the EAJA recovery, yes. The -\nthe statute -- the -- the veterans statutes provide that\nthe lawyer can enter a contingency arrangement with the\nclient, but that the fee can't -- can't exceed 20 percent\nof the claimant's back benefits if he or she prevails.\nBut when -\nQUESTION: That's the recovered back benefits?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is correct, Your Honor. So\nthere -- there can be no fee taken unless there's victory.\nThe statute also provides that.\nHowever, a -- a statute also provides on what do\nwe do about the interaction between EAJA and this\nstatutory contingency fee. And what it provides is that\nfor the same work, if there is an EAJA recovery, the\nclient must benefit by that. There can't be a double\nrecovery and that the contingent fee would be reduced\ndollar for dollar for the EAJA recovery.\nQUESTION: You could easily just reduce it if it\nwas the lawyer's negligence and stopped him getting the\ncontingency.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is correct, but the law does\nnot provide.\nQUESTION: So -- so then we're back to where\nJustice Ginsburg's question was. You say, really, the\nperson who should suffer is the lawyer, if the lawyer is\nnegligent, not the client. That would be pretty easy to\narrange. And you really want a rule that says whenever\nthe lawyer is negligent, well, the other side has to\nsuffer the consequence rather than the lawyer.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Your -- Your Honor, first, there\ncould be such a rule if Congress so provided, and I\nsuppose -\nQUESTION: Why couldn't you do it under a rule\nof the court? Why couldn't you just say -- I mean, if I\nwere sitting in that court, it wouldn't take me long to\ntry to figure that out unless Congress thought of -\nunless it forbid it somewhere. I mean, if it forbid it,\nyou couldn't do it, but -- but I don't know -- what you've\nread me doesn't sound as if it forbids it.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think it is true that the -- the\nstatutes that I've just talked about don't forbid that.\nWhether rulemaking authority enters into that kind of\nsubstantive arena, I think that would be unusual because\nordinarily that would be governed by State malpractice -\nQUESTION: I don't know what we're talking about\nhere. Whether -- whether the -- whether the client can\nresist the lawyer's request for the 20 percent contingent\nfee on the ground that it's the lawyer's own fault that I\ndidn't get compensation that would enable me to pay that\nfee.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think that's -- that's what the\n--\nQUESTION: I don't know if that -\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- the question -\nQUESTION: Well, anyway, okay, let's skip that\nbecause the question is -\nMR. WOLFMAN: I would like to go back to the -\nQUESTION: Let's go back to the main issue.\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- question of equitable tolling,\nif I might. And -- and let me answer that in two ways.\nFirst of all, there is a category of equitable\ntolling that's set out in the Irwin decision and others\nwhich if -- if a claimant filed -- timely files a -- an\naction, that -- that is properly filed but\njurisdictionally defective in some way, that equitable\ntolling is a -- is a basis for allowing some forbearance\nin that circumstance -\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfman, I -- I don't understand\nwhy we have to first address equitable tolling. I mean,\nwhy don't we look at the statute and see whether it is\nnecessary that this allegation that the U.S. was not\nsubstantially justified has to be made within 30 days? I\nmean, if it doesn't, why do you get into equitable tolling\nat all? Why don't you start with what the statute\nrequires? I thought that was what the split was about.\nMR. WOLFMAN: We -- Your Honor, with all\nrespect, no. The split was not on the question of what\nthe -- this -- whether the statute requires the allegation\nof no substantial justification in the 30 days. The split\nwas on the question -\nQUESTION: Do you take -- do you take the\nposition that under the statute, the Equal Access to\nJustice Act statute, subsection (B), that that allegation\ndoes not have to be made within the 30-day period?\nMR. WOLFMAN: We do and we briefed that\nextensively both in our opening brief and our -- and our\nreply brief.\nQUESTION: And do you plan to address it this\nmorning with us?\nMR. WOLFMAN: I'd be happy to address it right\nnow if -- if Your Honor will allow, which is that -\nQUESTION: Well, it just looks like a lot easier\nargument to me than equitable tolling.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Let me answer that. The -- the\nanswer is the plain language of the statute, the first -\nthe first sentence of (d) -- of section (d)(1)(A) -\n(d)(1)(B) -- excuse me -- says that there shall be three\nthings alleged and that they must be done within 30 days.\nThe next sentence, which is the one that is at issue here,\nsays that the -- the parties shall also allege that the\nposition of the Government is not substantially justified,\nand that sentence does not include the 30-day time limit.\nThat is one of our arguments in this case.\nQUESTION: And that's similar to the kind of\ninterpretation the Court had to face in Edelman, isn't it?\nMR. WOLFMAN: It is.\nQUESTION: I mean, you know -\nMR. WOLFMAN: And that -- we make that argument\ndirectly in our brief.\nQUESTION: In Edelman, it wasn't in the -- it\ndidn't follow immediately as part of the same paragraph\nand the -- the what leaps to mind when you read a sentence\nthat says the parties shall also allege, is where? Where\nshall the party allege this? Is he supposed to file a\nseparate paper later? The logical answer to that question\nis found in the preceding sentence: shall within 30 days\nsubmit to the court an application which shows that the\nparty is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an\naward stating the actual time, blah, blah. The party\nshall also allege. Surely it means where? In that\napplication that is referred to in the preceding sentence.\nIt seems to me you're making a -- a -- just a\nmess of -- of that paragraph to say, you know, you can\nfile a paper, who knows, 9 months later alleging that.\nThat -- that's just not a -- that's not a reasonable\nreading of it, it seems to me.\nMR. WOLFMAN: But, Your Honor, we disagree and\nthe reason is it's in that separate sentence and there are\nsubsequent proceedings in the case. There are subsequent\nfilings made. There are sometimes hearings where that -\nQUESTION: It doesn't matter at all when it's\nalleged? You can wait until, you know, the very end of\nthe case?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That -- that is -\nQUESTION: The Government has to go along not\neven knowing whether you claim that the Government's\nposition was substantially justified?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, on that question, the -- the\nburden is on the Government to show that its position was\nsubstantially justified.\nQUESTION: That's the point. The statute places\nthe burden on the Government to prove that its position\nwas not substantially justified.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is correct, and that is our\nsubmission. So the question is why might Congress have\nparsed it in this way.\nQUESTION: It's the burden of proof as opposed\nto the burden of making the allegation of -- of setting\nthe -- the point in controversy.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That -- that is correct in the\nsense that -- that the statute is unusual and that it -\nit's -- it does say that the party seeking fees shall\nallege the position of the Government lacks substantial\njustification. But there's no question -- and it is\nconceded here that the Government has the burden of\npersuasion on that question. So in -- in this respect -\nQUESTION: You mean, even if you don't allege\nit, the Government has to come in and show that its\nposition was -- even though it's never alleged. Surely\nyou don't say that.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Your Honor, it -\nQUESTION: What -- what if you have a lawyer\nthat hasn't read the statute and he doesn't realize, that\nhe thinks if he won the case, he gets his fees? And so he\njust files this without any allegation that the\nGovernment's case was not substantially justified.\nMR. WOLFMAN: We -\nQUESTION: The Government still has to come in\nand prove that its case was substantially justified?\nMR. WOLFMAN: No. We -- we believe that at some\npoint the statute makes clear that at some point the\napplicant will have to make that allegation.\nQUESTION: What would be the logical point -\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think the -\nQUESTION: -- for that -- for that claim to be\nmade?\nMR. WOLFMAN: In all candor, Your Honor, the\nmost logical point is at the outset.\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMR. WOLFMAN: We don't disagree with that. But\nour position is that if you look at the statute, the\nstatute doesn't contain that 30-day limit within the\nsecond sentence, and following on Justice O'Connor's\nquestion, there is potentially good reason for that which\nis that the burden on that question is on the Government.\nWe don't know why because it is not revealed entirely why\nthe 30-day limit is not in the second sentence.\nQUESTION: Well, that would be a good reason for\nomitting the requirement entirely, but I don't think it's\na very good reason for saying that the 30-day rule doesn't\napply.\nMR. WOLFMAN: The 30-day -- well, that is our\nposition, Your Honor, and I think -- I think we've\nexhausted the reasons why Congress might have done it.\nMay I go back to the initial question? Because\nI want to -- I want to clarify something. I initially got\na question about equitable tolling, but our principal\nsubmission here and I think the easiest way to resolve\nthis case is that this -- this provision is not\njurisdictional. Mr. Scarborough filed on time, and so\nit's a perfect example of where the relation-back doctrine\nwould apply.\nThis is a typical relation-back situation. The\n-- the application was filed. It was timely. There was\nan omission and Mr. Scarborough, immediately upon the\nomission being brought to his attention, filed an\namendment that made this 10 -- this 10-word legal\nconclusion, and that should be the end of the matter.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfman -\nQUESTION: Will you just clarify one thing for\nme? I want -- I think I understood your answer, but -- to\nJustice Ginsburg, but if he has a contingent fee of 20\npercent, he gets a $1,000 recovery and a $200 fee, and he\ngoes -- now he gets -- files an EAJA position, if he\nrecovers precisely $200, that goes to the client?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That would be correct.\nQUESTION: What if he recovered $300?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Then the $100 -- then $200 would\ngo to the client and $100 would go to the lawyer.\nQUESTION: But in all events, the client would\nget a piece of the recovery under EAJA.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is correct unless, for some\nreason, there was not a contingency fee. That is correct.\nQUESTION: Not a contingency fee.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right.\nQUESTION: But you're saying -\nMR. WOLFMAN: And -- and in almost all cases -\nQUESTION: -- they are -- typically they are -\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- there is. Yes.\nQUESTION: -- contingent fee cases.\nMR. WOLFMAN: In almost all cases there are.\nAnd as I say, the statute allows it up to but not in\nexcess of 20 percent.\nQUESTION: Am I right in thinking that your\nclient did not file the allegation about the Government's\nposition being unjustified until after the Government\nmoved to dismiss?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That is correct. That is correct,\nand that was approximately 33 days after the 30-day period\nexpired.\nQUESTION: But there -- there is an argument the\nother side I'd like you to deal with. There's a -- you -\nyou look at the statute, and it looks like Congress was\nintending to have in front of the judge and in particular\nto have in front of the Government all the facts right\nthere the first day. There are a lot of these things.\nThey have to process them quickly and they want to decide\nwhether to settle it or not settle it. And what they\nhave, therefore, you say right in the application within\n30 days. Did I win? It's not so clear sometimes because,\nyou know, they're mixed claims. Explain it. Show that\nyou're eligible and also say how much it's going to be.\nRight there, first from day one. And although this next\npart is a formality and is in a separate sentence, that\ndoesn't matter. It happens to be really in the same two\nsentences and there's no reason to treat it differently.\nAll right? So that's their argument.\nAnd now I'd like to see what your response is.\nMR. WOLFMAN: My response is -- and if I\nunderstand the question -- is take -- to take as a given\nthat the -- that the statutes contemplates that the no\nsubstantial-justification allegation be made within the 30\ndays. And then our response is that this is not a\njurisdictional provision. The statute does not create an\nabsolute bar, and then we look to the common law\nexceptions to statutes of limitations.\nQUESTION: You could do that. You might do\nthat. So that -- that's -- in other words, you're saying\n-- that's Irwin. I mean, you're arguing -\nMR. WOLFMAN: It's Irwin. It's -- it's Edelman.\nIt's Becker and so forth.\nQUESTION: So you want to say that that would\napply to every one of these four provisions.\nMR. WOLFMAN: It would and the courts -\nQUESTION: All right, and -- and treat them all\nalike and therefore the separate sentence is a kind of\nmake-way.\nMR. WOLFMAN: No. I'm not saying that. I'm\nsaying that your question -- I -- I took your question to\nask me to assume that all four allegations have to be made\nwithin the 30 days.\nQUESTION: Okay. So -\nMR. WOLFMAN: If I assume that, then yes, the\nanswer to your question is yes, that we would apply those\nordinary common law exceptions.\nNow, judges -\nQUESTION: Aside from that, now -- now take the\nother part of your argument and say, no, no, it's really\ndifferent, this fourth one. This fourth one is really\ndifferent. And I got it that it's in a separate sentence.\nI don't know how much to make of that. Is there -- is\nthere any other basis for saying -- I mean, maybe that's\nconclusive. I'm not saying it isn't, but I want to be\nsure I have everything in front of me that would make it\ndifferent.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think the other thing that -\nthat I would like to put in front of you -- and this had\nto do with my colloquy with Justice O'Connor -- which is\nthat there is a different character that -- to that\nallegation. It is a mere allegation and it simply\nnotifies the Government about its substantial\njustification defense.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, there's -- there's more\nthan that to it. This -- this is always filed by an\nattorney, and as an officer of the court, I assume that he\ncannot just come in and say the Government's position was\nnot substantially justified when it is very clear that it\nwas substantially justified. I assume he'd be -- he'd be\nliable for a sanction from the court if he did that.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think that is a fair point, Your\nHonor, and let me answer that this way.\nQUESTION: So to follow up, I mean, what -- what\nthis means is we -- we want to be sure, when this thing is\nfiled, that it's not just nuisance stuff. We want a\nlawyer, when the thing is filed within the 30 days, to be\nstanding on his reputation as an officer of the court\nthat, in fact, the Government's position wasn't\nsubstantial.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I got that, and let -- if -- if I\nmight let me answer that. Because then I think if we\nconceive of the purpose of this allegation as making a\nlawyer think twice, then it puts the case in the realm of\nEdelman and Becker where in Becker you had a signature\nrequirement, Edelman you had a verification requirement,\nand those -- those requirements are things that are\nsupposed to make the filing party think a little bit\nbefore he or she does the filing.\nBut in both of those cases, the Court said,\nokay, we realize the purpose of it, but we will still\nallow supplication -- supplementation of the application,\nand we'll allow them to amend and to relate back unless\nthe adverse party is prejudiced.\nAnd it's hard to conceive of the prejudice here.\nQUESTION: We -- we may not be as tender to\nattorneys who should know better as we are to -- to\nlitigants who maybe had a bad attorney or didn't know\nbetter themselves.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, with -- with all respect,\nYour Honor, I think that might in part, at least in part,\nexplain Edelman. But I do not believe it explains Becker.\nBecker did involve a pro se applicant, but as we know,\nmost appellants in the courts are -- are parties that are\nrepresented by lawyers, and Becker held unequivocally that\nthe failure to sign was not fatal and that, in fact, the\n-- the amended, signed notice of appeal could relate back.\nAnd that's all that's being requested here.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfman, I was surprised that you\ndidn't cite 1653 of title 28 which says defective\nallegations of jurisdiction may be amended upon terms. I\nmean, if you say, okay, even assuming it were\njurisdictional, if it were jurisdictional -- even if it\nwere jurisdictional, you could still amend with the\ncourt's permission.\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think you're right, Your Honor,\nand that is neglectful on our part and we could have -- we\ncould have cited 1653 as well. It stands for the same\nprinciple I think as the -\nQUESTION: Well, excuse me. Nobody says that\nthis is an allegation regarding jurisdiction.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, that -- that is true too.\nQUESTION: I mean, what -- what the issue is is\nwhether the 30-day limit is a jurisdictional limit or not.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Right. And -- and -\nQUESTION: But I don't think any -\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- it's not. And -- and I think\nthat's the key point. It is not and the -- the Irwin and\nFranconia Associates I think so clearly stand for that\nproposition. That is the argument that we went to first\nand most directly, that unless Congress explicitly\nprovides otherwise, limitations periods will be governed\nby the same types of limitations principles that -- that\ngovern private litigation.\nQUESTION: I -- explain this relation-back\ntheory. Anything can relate back? You can do any -- is\nthere no limit to the -- to the sweep of that proposition?\nMR. WOLFMAN: No. I think there are limits.\nFor -- and -- and I think -\nQUESTION: What are they?\nMR. WOLFMAN: -- a court would look to rule 15\nwhich codifies the relation-back doctrine and says, number\none, does it -- does the matter arise out of the same\ntransaction as occurrence -- as the original filing. Does\nit arise out of the same thing that the adverse party was\ngiven notice of?\nAnd then I think the other thing that's quite -\nthat's quite apparent the courts would apply is, is the\nother side prejudiced by this? How long of a time period\nhad gone by? How important or how new is the information?\nHere, there's never been any claim of prejudice nor could\nthere be, I don't think, because the Government responds\n-- they point out that -- that this legal allegation was\nnot made. The other side comes in and immediately amends\nor -- and -- and that's all there is to it. This matter\nwould have been resolved years ago if that had transpired.\nQUESTION: Suppose you had a statute that -\nthat provided a -- I don't know -- 3-year statute of\nlimitations for -- for negligence in a particular context,\nbut it -- it went on to say, however, all causes of action\nclaiming intentional wrong must be filed within 1 year.\nDo you think that after 2-and-a-half years you could\nrevise a filing that did not allege intentional wrong and\nsay it relates back? And -- and some States do have\ndifferent statutes for intentional torts versus negligent\ntorts. Do you think you could revise your -\nMR. WOLFMAN: I think that would be a much more\ndifficult claim for relation-back, and the reason is is\nbecause the court -- the State apparently has said, as a\nmatter of our substantive policy, that we want to give\nnotice of this type of claim much earlier.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WOLFMAN: But let me answer that -\nQUESTION: So it really does come down to\nwhether this -- this allegation was -- whether there was\nsome particular reason why it had to be -\nMR. WOLFMAN: But might I extend my answer a\nlittle bit?\nQUESTION: Sure, sure.\nMR. WOLFMAN: Because -- because I -- I think\nyour hypothetical stands in contradistinction from the\nordinary rule, that if you've alleged the -- the relevant\nfacts, you can -- actually amendment is freely given to -\nto state the legal theory under which those facts arise.\nAnd I cite those cases in my brief.\nQUESTION: Complaint -- in a complaint, you\ndon't even have to state the legal theory. That would be\nin a brief opposing a motion to dismiss.\nMR. WOLFMAN: That -- that is correct that -\nthat you have to state jurisdiction and you have to state\nthe facts. And the -- the forms that appear at the end of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do say that the -\nthe pleader ought to state the -- the type of action,\nwhether it be negligence or otherwise.\nBut I think it does stand in distinction to\nJustice Scalia's hypothetical where the State has made\nvery clear that there is a substantive policy that we want\nto follow such that we want to give more notice and\nquicker notice of this type of action. That's not what we\nhave here.\nQUESTION: All right. The -- the problem with\nthis -- and there is a problem maybe just for me, but\nthere's a lot of legislative history here that says that,\nfor example, the deadline for filing the fee application\nis jurisdictional and cannot be waived. And then there\nare a lot of other stuff. The Administrative Conference\nhas said you ought to make this subject to waiver for good\ncause, and that was rejected. And so there is a lot of\nhistory that says you just can't do an Irwin kind of\nthing. We don't mean that. We don't mean you can waive\nthis.\nNow, what am I supposed to do with that?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well -\nQUESTION: Sort of parse the thing and say,\nwell, this -- this portion of it is -- is subject to the\nequitable exception and the doctrine itself -- the -- the\napplication itself is not subject to it? Or how am I\nsupposed to handle that in your view?\nMR. WOLFMAN: Well, we deal with the legislative\nhistory in quite some detail in our reply brief, but let\nme -- let me deal with it briefly here, which is that the\n-- the one line that you quoted about the jurisdiction -\nthe application is jurisdictional and cannot be waived was\nin a -- a committee report that was submitted with\nlegislation that was vetoed by the President.\nThe next year when the legislation was actually\nenacted, very similar legislative history appears, and\nit's -- it drops that line and says as follows. The court\nshould avoid an overly technical construction of these\nterms, the terms being the 30-day rule. This section\nshould not be used as a trap for the unwary resulting in\nthe unwarranted denial of fees.\nQUESTION: Who said -- who said that?\nMR. WOLFMAN: That's in the legislative history\ncited in our brief.\nQUESTION: Yes, what is it? I mean, just -\njust -\nMR. WOLFMAN: It's a House report No. 99-120 at\n-- at page 6, footnote 26.\nBut it -- what I'm -- what I'm getting at is the\nlegislative history, from which this was taken, the one\nline that they rely on, was -- accompanied legislation\nthat was actually vetoed. It was then replaced by other\nlegislative history which supports our position.\nI want to be clear. I'm not -- I'm not\nsuggesting that this legislative history, either way,\nbears great weight, and we don't rely on it in our opening\nbrief. But to respond to that question, I think the\nlegislative history at best for -- for the Government is a\nwash.\nUnless the Court has any further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Wolfman.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MINEAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 2412(d) requires that EAJA fee\napplicants submit an application within 30 days of a final\njudgment that includes an allegation that the Government's\nposition was not substantially justified. Petitioner's\nlawyer failed to do so in this case and for that reason\nfails to qualify for fees.\nThis Court has no power to amend EAJA or to\nexcuse lawyers from their carelessness in failing to\nfollow its requirements.\nQUESTION: Are there any instances in which the\nGovernment is liable for fees even if its position was\nsubstantially justified?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, under section 2412(b), EAJA\nsubjects the United States to fees on the same basis as\nother parties in other legislation.\nBy contrast, section 2412(d) provides a special\nprovision, distinct from those provisions that apply to\nprivate parties and the United States generally, that\nrequires there be a showing that the Government's position\nwas not substantially justified.\nQUESTION: There are also some -- some other\nstatutes besides EAJA in which the Government, when it\nloses, whether its position was substantially justified or\nnot, is subject to -- to fees. Isn't that -- isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, if I can clarify. Section\n2412(b) indicates the Government is waiving its sovereign\nimmunity as to those other statutes.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MINEAR: So in the case of 2412(b), it puts\nthe United States on the same par as private parties, and\nin that sense, it's comparable to the situation that was\nfaced in Irwin where the United States is subject to Title\nVII actions on the same basis as private parties.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think you know where I\nwas going. Was -- was the Government somehow puzzled or\nconfused when it received this document or did it\nnaturally assume that it would have to show that this\nposition was substantially justified? In other words,\nwould there have been some other theory in which the\nGovernment might have thought it would have been really\nliable for these fees?\nMR. MINEAR: Justice Kennedy, I have two answers\nfor that. First of all, the statute requires that these\nconditions be met, and these are conditions on the\nGovernment's -\nQUESTION: Well, that's the issue we're -- we're\ntalking about.\nMR. MINEAR: And these are conditions on the\nGovernment's waiver of sovereign immunity. So the\nGovernment has an obligation to insist that parties comply\nwith those conditions -\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's true. The\nquestion is whether this allegation has to be made within\nthe 30 days or whether it can be offered subsequently as\nan amendment.\nMR. MINEAR: That's -\nQUESTION: Clearly it has to be made. And the\nGovernment certainly was not in doubt about the fact that\nits -- it wasn't going to be liable for the fees unless it\nwas in due course made.\nMR. MINEAR: I'd like to make two points with\nregard to this.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: First of all, with regard to the\n30-day time limit -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MINEAR: -- this Court indicated in INS v.\nJean, 496 U.S. at 160, that the 30-day requirement does\napply to the allegation of no substantial justification.\nAs we explain in our brief, Jean indicates it's a 30-day\nrequirement and at page 160 they say that the fee\napplication has to include -\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, can I -\nMR. MINEAR: -- this allegation.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you sort of a basic\nquestion? Sometimes these things are negotiated I think,\naren't they? After the fee application is filed, the\ncounsel may meet and discuss whether they can settle the\nfee application?\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct.\nQUESTION: During -- if such a meeting took\nplace 15 days after the application was filed, do you\nthink the Government lawyer would have an ethical duty to\ntell the plaintiff's lawyer -- say, you goofed and forgot\nthe no-substantial-justification allegation in your -- in\nyour request?\nMR. MINEAR: The Government -- the Government\nattorney might have that obligation in the course of\nsettlement negotiations.\nQUESTION: What would be the -\nMR. MINEAR: But in adversary litigation, the\nUnited States certainly doesn't have the obligation -\nQUESTION: What would be the basis of settlement\n-- of the obligation in settlement negotiations? I mean,\nlong ago the Court said that you didn't -- that opponents\ncouldn't live by their adversaries' wits.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, that's -- and I agree with\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. But in the course of discussing\nthese matters, there's a possibility that there could -\nthat the Government has to be careful not to mislead the\nparty, and so that's where an ethical obligation could\ncome forward.\nBut in this case, there were no negotiations of\nthat type. Rather, there's simply the Government's\nobligation to respond to the fee application, and we\nresponded appropriately.\nQUESTION: But -- but in this -- in this case\nthe application did say that it was pursuant to 2412. So\nas I indicated and Justice O'Connor said, the Government\nwas under no -- no mistaken assumptions about the\napplicability of this section and this section only.\nMR. MINEAR: But the United States was not on\nnotice whether this party was contesting that the\nGovernment's position was not substantially justified.\nQUESTION: Do you take the position that there\nis any point in requiring that allegation to be made other\nthan the point that was described in the earlier half of\nthe argument? And that is, to put the -- in effect, to -\nto put the lawyer on notice that there is a responsibility\nhere to be serious before one goes forward with a -- with\nfee litigation under this act.\nMR. MINEAR: There -\nQUESTION: Is -- is there any other reason for\nit?\nMR. MINEAR: There are three reasons. First of\nall, it's a condition that Congress placed on sovereign\nimmunity. And by that alone, the courts and lawyers and\nthe United States representing Congress' will must respect\nit.\nSecond, this obligation requires the party, as\nwas articulated earlier, to examine the Government's\nposition and make a determination of whether or not they\nwish to contest whether it is substantially justified or\nnot. So that does put that additional obligation on\ncounsel.\nThird, it's of use to the United States in\ndetermining how to respond to a fee application. The\nUnited States -\nQUESTION: Yes, but all the United States has to\ndo, in the absence of an -- of the allegation, is what it\ndoes here and say, you didn't make the allegation. We\nmove to dismiss. If the lawyer is really serious, the\nlawyer is going to come back and say, whoops, I -- I do\nmake that allegation. At that point, the United States\nknows where it stands and presumably it has the -- the\nbenefit of the lawyer's sense of responsibility for going\nforward and you go forward.\nMR. MINEAR: Except that the party did not\ncomply with the condition that Congress imposed on its\nwaiver of sovereign immunity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear -\nQUESTION: But other than that, the Government\nhas not really been prejudiced in anyway. The Government\nknows of the substantial justification rule and it's\neither ready to defend or -- or acquiesce on that point.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, the Government and the courts\nare both prejudiced by this because it requires two\nadditional filings that otherwise would not need to be\nmade if the lawyer had not been careless.\nIn this situation -- we face thousands of suits\nthat potentially implicate EAJA claims, and Congress\nrecognized that these are matters that need to be resolved\nquickly with minimal litigation in contradistinction to\nwhat's happened in this case. And -\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, the -- the Federal\nCircuit obviously doesn't agree entirely with the position\nyou're now saying, you have to do everything up front.\nAnd what struck me as curious is the Federal\nCircuit allows you to flesh out allegations. So, for\nexample, you say I -- I want a fee of $1,000 but you don't\nput in the itemization. As I understand the Federal\nCircuit's position, they allow you to flesh out something\nthat -- that really seems to me is a lot more substantial,\nto document your fee. But this is a pro forma allegation.\nSo it seems to me, if you're saying -- if you're taking\nthe position you must do everything within 30 days, then\nyou would have to say the Federal Circuit is wrong in\nsaying you can flesh out allegations.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, those issues are not before\nthe Court at this time. The United States does have a\ndifferent view on that.\nBut I must disagree that is a pro forma\nallegation. That -- that suggests that -- that we need\nnot require the lawyers to comply with the letter of the\nlaw because we don't think they're going to comply with\nthe spirit of the law. Rather -\nQUESTION: No. They have to comply. The\nquestion is can they be excused if they're a little late.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and in that respect, the\nparties have -- petitioner has -- the petitioner has made\ntwo arguments. One is the relation-back doctrine and the\nother is equitable tolling. I'd like to turn to each of\nthose issue specifically.\nQUESTION: Before you do that, could you finish\nyour answer before where you said you had two points and\nyou raised a case with regard to point one, and then I\nnever did hear point two because a question came up. You\ndon't remember it either.\nMR. MINEAR: This -- probably -- I'm not sure if\nit was -\nQUESTION: Let's forget about it.\nMR. MINEAR: On -- on the relation-back\ndoctrine.\nQUESTION: You said you'd give us some reasons\nwhy this is important to the Government.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and the reasons were, first of\nall, our obligation to defend those conditions that\nCongress places on its waiver of sovereign immunity, and\nsecond, to ensure that there is efficient processing of\nattorney application fees. Justice Breyer made allusion\nto this in the first part of the argument, and as I said\nbefore, the Government faces thousands of these requests,\nand it's very important they be -- be resolved promptly.\nAnd they can only be resolved promptly if parties follow\nthe rules that Congress has laid down. We believe that's\nwhy Congress set these rules, because they wanted to make\nsure that attorney claims would be resolved efficiently,\nand they cannot be resolved efficiently if parties don't\nplay by the rules.\nNow, the relation-back doctrine is really an\nexception to the rules that Congress set forward, at least\nthe -- the relation-back doctrine, as the -- as\npetitioners are suggesting it ought to be applied here.\nAs a general matter, the relation-back doctrine is a\nprinciple that's codified in rules, such as rule 15 of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. And it provides an\nexception for, in that case, pleadings being amended after\nthe fact.\nBut this isn't a case of initiating civil\nlitigation and this is not a case where rule 15 applies.\nRather, the question is what did Congress intend. If\nCongress had wanted a relation-back doctrine, it could\nhave specified that.\nQUESTION: Wasn't there a relation-back doctrine\nthat courts were applying before it was codified in 15(c)?\nMR. MINEAR: The examples that petitioner points\nto are cases involving the Federal Employees Liability Act\ninvolving the injuries to interstate -- to railmen who are\nworking in interstate commerce. And in several instances,\nthe Court had applied that as a common law principle\nindicating, as in Keene, that those arguments on either\nside for that particular rule. But I don't think we can\nsay that there's a general principle of relation-back.\nAnd certainly -\nQUESTION: You wouldn't want to generalize from\nFELA cases, would you?\nMR. MINEAR: No, I would not.\nQUESTION: But there was in States -- some\nStates also had a relation-back doctrine.\nMR. MINEAR: And the note in rule 15(c), the\n1937 note to the Federal rules talks about codifications\nof this, but we're talking here about a situation where\nCongress has set a time limit and has not provided for\nrelation-back, a case where we're dealing with sovereign\nimmunity, where this is a charge against the Federal fisc.\nAnd so we have -\nQUESTION: Of course, the timeliness argument is\nsomewhat strange in this case because he filed the\napplication prematurely, as I remember the case, didn't\nhe? And then said, no, you got to wait until the mandate\ncomes down, and then after the mandate came down, he\nrefiled it, and then the 30 days went by and the\nGovernment asked for an extension. It didn't -- to get it\n-- to get it disposed of. So the Government's argument\nthat you've got to get this done as fast as possible seems\na little strange in this particular case.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, in this case\nthere were two premature applications that were filed.\nThe first application was filed prematurely. The court\nreturned it and said until the 60-day period runs.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MINEAR: The parties then filed another\npremature application.\nQUESTION: Which was identical to the first.\nMR. MINEAR: That's right. And the court held\nit until the mandate issued and at that point asked the\nUnited States to file a response, a 30-day response.\nSo the Government acted quite appropriately. It\nacted -\nQUESTION: Well, they took more than 30 days to\nrespond.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, it did, but it could well be\nbecause we are dealing with -\nQUESTION: Because they wanted to wait and see\nwhether he'd catch his goof.\nMR. MINEAR: No, not at all. At the time we\nfiled our extension, the time had already run for that.\nBut the -- the problem that we face in the\nGovernment is that we have numerous cases and numerous fee\napplications. It could very well be -\nQUESTION: But why doesn't all that fit within a\n-- an equitable exceptions doctrine because that's one of\nthe things you take into account? My basic question is,\nwhy not read the statute of limitations -- say what this\nCourt said in Irwin and others -- as they're normally read\nsubject to equitable exceptions? Or at least if the -- if\nthe legislative history makes that impossible -- and I was\njust told it doesn't at all -- read the filing of the\npaper as absolute but the contents of the paper is subject\nto equitable exceptions? So you'll win 99 percent of the\ntime. It's just the lawyer really had a heart attack on\nthe way to the post office, you know. I mean, something\nawful came up and why not give him the advantage of that\nequitable exception?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, in this case the\nequitable tolling argument, I have to point out, was not\nraised before the court -\nQUESTION: No, no, no, but I mean, we're trying\nto interpret this statute. And would it be -- is there\nany reason not to interpret the statute -- whether they\nwin or they lose in this particular case is a matter of\nlesser importance perhaps, but not to them, but to -- to\nothers.\nBut to get the statute right is important. And\n-- and therefore, do you think the correct interpretation\nof this statute is like other statutes, as I said, A,\nsubject to equitable exceptions or, B, at least the\ncontent of the document is subject to equitable\nexceptions?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, we would say neither is\nsubject to equitable exceptions.\nQUESTION: I knew you would say that.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I'm interested in why.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. First of all, the statute\nitself sets a strict 30-day time limit. It does not\nprovide for relation-back. If Congress wanted relation\nback, it could have. And to imply a relation-back\ndoctrine is to negate Congress' specific intent in this\ncase.\nWith regard to equitable tolling, this Court\nsaid in Irwin that equitable tolling will be presumed to\napply in those cases involving Government waivers of\nsovereign immunity where the Government is held liable on\nthe same basis as private parties as in title VII. But as\nmy colloquy with Justice Stevens pointed out, this is not\na situation where the United States is being held liable\nfor attorneys fees on the same basis as other parties.\nThat's what section 2412(b) applies -- provides, and\nperhaps equitable tolling should apply there, perhaps not.\nThat's a different question.\nHere -\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear -\nQUESTION: Let me ask you another question, if I\nmay. Supposing that a plaintiff's lawyer has trouble\nfinishing his time sheets. It's a long, protracted case,\nand just before he filed the fee application, he called\nthe Government lawyer and said, I don't think I can get my\ntime statement in in 30 days. Will you agree to a 2-week\nextension? Would the Government lawyer have authority to\ngrant that -- to -- to stipulate to such a 2-week\nextension?\nMR. MINEAR: No, he would not. Under our\nreading, this is a 30-day time limit and the parties have\nto comply. After all, this litigation, as in this case,\nhas been going on for several years. The attorneys have\nan obligation, if they want fees, if they want the\nGovernment to pay their fees, to keep good records and to\navoid careless acts -\nQUESTION: But is he -- is there any other\nreason? So far what I've registered in my mind is the\nstatute says nothing about equitable exceptions one way or\nthe other. The difference between this statute and a lot\nof other Government statutes of limitations is in the\nother ones, they're creating an equality between\nGovernment liability and private party liability, and in\nthis one it's only the Government that would be liable for\nthe fees.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And is there anything else? That's\nquite a -- it's a formal reason but an important formal\nreason. Is there any other reason?\nMR. MINEAR: That is our principal basis -\nQUESTION: All right. So that's it.\nMR. MINEAR: -- for distinguishing Irwin.\nBut I'd like to point out also that equitable\ntolling was not raised in the Court's own -\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Minear, is it -- could we\npossibly find for you in this case on the -- on the issue\nof relation-back while leaving open the question of\nwhether equitable tolling can apply or not?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, you can.\nQUESTION: Because as I understand the relation\nback doctrine, it doesn't matter about the equities.\nWhether -- whether it's his fault or not, you can always\nrelate back.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Whereas, equitable tolling would\ngenerally be -- be eliminated if -- if fault is involved.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. Now -- now, we\nthink that you do not need to reach the equitable tolling\nissue, but if you do, there's no basis for equitable\ntolling in this case in any event because equitable\ntolling is a doctrine that developed with the -- based on\nthe concept of ameliorating or preventing unfairness to\nlitigants. Now, there's nothing unfair in requiring an\nattorney to comply with Congress' -\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, can I ask you to go back?\nBecause I don't think you -- in the relation-back, if it\ngoes by rule 15(c), it's not just that you have an\nabsolute right. 15(c)(3) makes it very clear that if\nthere's prejudice to one side, it doesn't relate back. It\nisn't an automatic thing that, oh, you can always make up\nfor not having -\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct, Your Honor. If I\ncould clarify. In answering Justice Scalia's question, I\nwas indicating that there doesn't have to be inequitable\nconduct in order to qualify for relation-back. But it\ndoesn't mean you would get it automatically.\nQUESTION: But it isn't -- it isn't -- it isn't\nautomatic. It has to be that the other side knew or\nshould have known that but for a mistake, that you would\nhave put this in.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. But again, rule 15(c) by its\nterms does not apply to this case. It applies to\npleadings.\nQUESTION: You made a distinction in your brief.\nYou said, well, rule 15(c) is a pleading rule. This is\nnot a pleading. This is an application for a fee. So I\nsay, yes, it is an application for a fee, not a pleading,\nbut why should that make any difference to the concept of\nrelation-back?\nMR. MINEAR: Because rule 15(c) applies to\nlitigation generally. In this case, we're dealing with a\nspecific time requirement that only applies to Government\napplications -- to applications for fees against the\nGovernment when the Government's position is not\nsubstantially justified. There's simply no basis for\napplying rule 15(c) to this situation.\nQUESTION: But that -- well, that answer does -\nhas nothing to do with whether it's labeled a pleading or\nan application.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. That -- that may\nbe correct. Ultimately 15(c) simply doesn't apply here is\nmy point, and if we're going to look at the time limits,\nwe have to look to what did Congress intend what it -\nwhen it enacted 2412(d)(1)(B). It set a 30-day time\nlimit. It didn't create any exceptions. It didn't\nprovide for any relation-back. And imputing relation\nback would destroy that 30-day time limit that Congress\nspecified.\nQUESTION: You're in the -- I mean, you've\nraised a number of -- of very good points that make this\nquite complicated, and I'm looking to try to simplify it\nin my own mind.\nCould we say -- and you'll -- could we say that\nin respect to the 30-day filing requirement, we don't have\nto decide whether it is absolute or not absolute, subject\nto equitable defenses of different kinds or not. In\nrespect to the content parts of this, at least the fourth\npart, it's treated like any statute of limitations, any\nordinary statute of limitations, and whatever they're\nsubject to, Judge, you make this one subject to.\nNow, there you'd meet me with the argument but\nthis is the Government and -- the one we went through. Is\nthere any other reason for not doing it?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, this is as -- as you point\nout, this is a content limitation. It's like Torres and\nother cases where content does need to be included within\nthe specified time limit. It's not simply a formality\nlike a verification or a signature. Rather, we're talking\nabout the threshold allegation that triggers the right for\nattorneys fees and triggers the obligation of the\nGovernment to respond and show that its position was\nsubstantially justified. Without that, you really don't\nhave a fee application as Congress conceived of it.\nWhen we look at what do we mean by a fee\napplication, we have to look at 2412(d)(1)(B), and\nCongress indicated what it felt was essential in the fee\napplication. You have to show that you prevailed. You\nhave to show that you're a qualifying party under EAJA.\nYou have to provide your costs, including an itemized list\nof costs, and you have to make the threshold allegation\nthe Government's position was not substantially justified.\nThose terms define what a fee application is. And this\nCourt's decision in Jean indicates it all has to be done\nin that 30-day period.\nNow, to apply any sort of relation-back doctrine\nsimply negates the very careful, strict rules that\nCongress imposed on this charge against the treasury.\nQUESTION: Can you -- can you give me any\nindication of how -- how many of these applications there\nare, how many times the Government contests the\nsubstantial justification, how many times the Government\nconcedes that? Does the Government ever concede no\nsubstantial justification?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, in many cases the Government\nwill settle it because the costs of litigating aren't\nworth fighting over the matter.\nBut in terms of statistics, I was able to find\nthis in a -- a quick review. And -- and this outside the\nrecord, so I am stepping outside the record and looking at\nGovernment files. But in the case of the Social Security\nAdministration, between August 2001 and August 2002, the\nGovernment paid 5,500, roughly, EAJA applications in a\ntotal amount of $18 million. Now, Social Security is only\none small part. I shouldn't say small, but it's a\nsignificant part of the EAJA -- qualifying EAJA cases.\nBut as that indicates there, at least in 5,000 cases the\nGovernment made a payment either by settlement or on the\nbasis of a -- of a -\nQUESTION: Any indication of what percentage\nthat is out of the total?\nMR. MINEAR: No, I do not have an indication of\nthe total number of cases that are available.\nBut what we do know is that we face thousands of\nthese cases, and efficiency is paramount unless fee\nlitigation is going to become a second major litigation,\nwhich is something -\nQUESTION: That second major litigation I don't\nsee. I see you have to make the motion to dismiss, but\nbeyond that -- and once the allegation is made, it, as\nJustice O'Connor pointed out, is the Government's burden\nto show that its position was substantially justified. So\nwhat is the satellite litigation beyond your filing the\nmotion to dismiss because they didn't make the allegation?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, it's satellite\nlitigation like this: over whether or not relation-back\nshould apply, under what situations it should apply,\nshould equitable tolling apply, have the conditions for\nequitable tolling been met, all of that.\nQUESTION: But if this -- but once the Court\ndecides this case and suppose it should say that relation\nback applies, well, that's -- that would be it and there\nwouldn't be any satellite litigation.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, as -- as you\npointed out, relation-back is not automatic. So there\nwould be these questions of whether or not whatever\ncriteria the Court decides to create for relation-back\nwere satisfied.\nAnd I have to point out the Court is going to be\ncreating all of these rules. As it stands right now, we\nhave a simple 30-day rule. Once we inject relation-back\nand equitable considerations, then we're at sea in terms\nof what's necessary to satisfy this requirement.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's true of the\ndoctrine in the first place, isn't it? I mean, we don't\nget into relation-back because Congress originally passed\na statute saying there's going to be relation-back. In\nevery one of these instances I suppose in which there is a\nrelaxation of -- of a stated rule, we got into it because\na court recognized it.\nAnd -- and it seems to me your argument about\nthe satellite litigation at most means maybe we'll have a\nhalf a dozen cases deciding exactly what exceptions to the\n-- to the literal statement in the statute book there may\nbe, but as -- as against EAJA litigation in which there\nare at least 500 a year on -- in the courts around the\ncountry on Social Security alone, that seems to be rather\na -- a minuscule percentage of -- of extra cases.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, with respect to\nhow the Court got involved in these matters, in many cases\nCongress simply deferred to -- to the courts to establish\nthe appropriate procedural rules. It didn't set time\nlimits.\nQUESTION: Did it say we are deferring to the\ncourts to -- to set procedural rules? I doubt it.\nMR. MINEAR: Well -\nQUESTION: Didn't Congress simply pass a statute\nand somebody says, well, gee, does -- does the 30 days -\nis the 30 days absolute or not?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, the rule's enabling act\nI think is a -- a direct delegation to the courts to\ncreate rules to govern practice and procedure where\nCongress has not otherwise specified the controlling\nrules. In this case, we have a rule that Congress has\nset, a 30-day rule that makes a great amount of sense in\nthese circumstances, where the object is to determine fee\nlitigation quickly and efficiently. And if parties abide\nby the rules and follow those rules, then we can be\nassured that these cases will progress and that we will -\nthe courts and the United States will be not burdened with\nthis type of additional litigation.\nThese are, after all, charges against the\ntreasury, the area where the Congress' sovereign immunity\nis paramount, and when Congress -\nQUESTION: You -- Mr. Minear, I know you've said\nit's not before us, but would you make a distinction, the\none that this Federal Circuit makes between you don't\naccount for -- for the fees and so you want later to\ndocument what -- what supports your -- your requests\nfor -\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, our feeling is that\nthese showings can be made very easily. You can show that\nyou're a prevailing party by attaching a copy of your -\nyour judgment. You can show that you qualify for fees by\nattaching an affidavit showing you have a net worth of\nless than $2 million. Itemization is not all that\ndifficult. Attorneys keep these records.\nQUESTION: But the itemization is -- is what the\nFederal Circuit allows leeway on.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I -- I wanted to see your fix on\nthe statute. I suppose you would say the Federal Circuit\nis wrong to allow any leeway on -- on that.\nMR. MINEAR: We think that -- that the better\nrule is that itemization should be -- be complete at the\ntime the application is -- is filed. However we deal with\nthat issue, certainly the threshold allegation that's at\nissue here does need to be made, and this is the trigger\nthat -- that determines whether or not the Government\nneeds to respond to the fee application at all. And if\nthe party has not made that basic determination -\nQUESTION: You characterize it as a trigger. Do\nyou defend the court of appeals' characterization of the\nrequirement as a jurisdictional requirement?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I think it can be\ndescribed as jurisdictional in the sense that term is used\nin Sherwood v. United States, that sovereign immunity is a\ncondition -- the conditions of -- that waive sovereign\nimmunity are limitations defining the scope of the Court's\njurisdiction. I think that's how that terminology has\nbecome applied.\nQUESTION: So your answer is yes.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nI think it might be more accurate to say it's a\nsovereign immunity-based limitation, but that carries with\nit the very same point. Namely, it needs to be strictly\nconstrued. Courts have no power to expand it beyond what\nits normal confines would be.\nSo the term jurisdictional is just a label.\nWhat's important is the substance of conditions on\nsovereign immunity, and that is they need to be strictly\nconstrued and cannot be enlarged beyond what Congress has\nprovided.\nQUESTION: What -- what's your best case in\nsupport of your position of a strict interpretation of a\nrequirement like this, other than cases about sovereign\nimmunity being -- it can't be expanded?\nMR. MINEAR: Cases such as -- some of these\ncases are not cited in the brief, but Brokamp, Locke, a\nnumber of these cases involving statutes of limitation\nwhere Congress has -- where this Court has ruled that the\nemphatic statute of limitation that Congress has set is\ndeterminative.\nI'd also point out to Justice Frankfurter's\nstatement in Holmberg v. Armbrecht where he said that when\nCongress sets a statute of limitation, there is the end of\nthe matter. The statute of limitation that Congress set\nis definitive.\nQUESTION: Of course, Locke was a case involving\na total failure to file on time, not omitting an\nallegation in the filing.\nMR. MINEAR: That's true, but again, I'm not\nsure a real distinction can be made there because, as I\nsaid before, when we look at what is a fee application, we\ndefine a fee application by those things that Congress\nsaid are defined as content.\nUltimately I think the important point here is\nthat strict adherence to these types of statutory rules is\nthe best guarantee of fairness in these cases. This is a\ncase where the burden that is placed on the attorneys is\nminimal and we believe that this Court should follow what\nCongress -\nQUESTION: But the burden of the real result is\nplaced on the client. I mean, the burden -- the -- the\nreal loser here is not the lawyer. It's the client.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, in the case where -\nQUESTION: The lawyer gets the same amount in\nany event in many, many cases.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and an attorney who is\ncareless, I would say, might well have some obligation not\nto charge his -- his client for his carelessness.\nIf there are no further -\nQUESTION: Why would he have that obligation?\nBecause the statute is absolute. It says you can get 20\npercent of the recovery.\nMR. MINEAR: The statute is not so absolute\nactually. I believe the provision that we're talking\nabout here, which is 38 U.S.C. 5904, does allow the Court\nof Veterans Claims to adjust fee applications in the event\nthat they're not fair, if there are some inequities that\nare involved in them. Now, I'm not sure to what's -- what\nextent the court has -- has exercised that authority, but\nit certainly has -- does have that authority under the\nstatutory provisions that are at issue here.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Wolfman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WOLFMAN: I'd like to go immediately to\nJustice Kennedy's question. He asked about the best case.\nWell, the case that the Government relies on principally\nin its brief is Soriano v. the United States. The problem\nwith that case is it was overruled by Irwin, and the\nproblem here is that the principle we're now operating on,\nthe problem with the Government, is that when we talk\nabout statutes of limitations principles, you apply the\nsame principles that apply among private parties unless\nCongress explicitly provides otherwise.\nNow, I did want to, if I might, turn to the\nrelation-back doctrine just briefly. And the -- the\nquestion arose in Mr. Minear's presentation, well, this\ncase doesn't involve rule 15(c). But either did Edelman\nv. Lynchburg College. Edelman is best read as a case that\napplied the common law doctrine of relation-back. The\nCourt held, regardless of the EEOC's regulation, even if\nwe were interpreting the statute from scratch, we would\napply the relation doctrine back here because it has a\ncommon law pedigree. And that's all we're asking for\nhere.\nThe other principal submission by Mr. Minear is\nthe efficiency argument, that these matters have to be\ndone promptly and efficiently and there's thousands of\nsuits. I have two basic answers to that, the general and\nthe specific.\nThe general is that the -- until the Federal\nCircuit ruled, this was the rule, the rule that we're\nasking for, in all of the circuits that had ruled on it.\nAnd the Government does not present an iota of evidence\nthere were any problems in applying the relation-back\nprinciple in those circuits. It's the Third, the Sixth,\nand the Eleventh Circuit.\nThe specific answer is I think we know what\nwould have happened in this case if my client's amendment\nhad related back. The matter would have been resolved 3\nor 4 years ago. There is no serious efficiency concern\nhere. The reason we're here much later is both because\nthe Government interposed this jurisdictional defense and\nit asked for seven or eight extensions of time during the\ncourse of this litigation.\nThe final thing I would like to say is that the\nGovernment's arguments presuppose that there's no good\nreason for relaxing rules. But there is. We realize that\nlitigants and lawyers make mistakes and rules such as\nrelation-back serve important purposes so that litigants\nand lawyers don't get tripped up by technical rules such\nas the one the court -- that the court below and the\nGovernment is trying to impose here.\nIf the Court has no questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nWolfman.\n"
