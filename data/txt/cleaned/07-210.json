BECKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BECKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nBoth parts of the question presented in this\ncase should be answered \"yes.\" For a treble damage\ncivil RICO claim based on fraud, someone must rely on\nthe alleged misrepresentation, and that someone must be\nthe plaintiff. But that's the very nature of a fraud\nclaim. Plaintiffs here claim that they were injured by\nreason of a RICO violation, the predicate acts of which\ninvolved a scheme or artifice to defraud.\nBut no one in this case is arguing that a\ncivil RICO claim based on fraud can proceed without\nsomeone relying. So some reliance is required; the only\nquestion is who must rely? And we submit that the\nnatural answer is the plaintiff.\nA plaintiff who hasn't relied to his\ndetriment on an alleged misrepresentation hasn't been\ndefrauded; he hasn't been injured by reason of a scheme\nto defraud. Plaintiffs here haven't alleged that they\nrelied on any misrepresentation; they haven't even\nalleged that they received a misrepresentation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what about a case,\nsay, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of --\nan organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of\nrivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those\nrivals to customers and suppliers, not to the -- to the\nrival. So there was no -- there is no misrepresentation\nmade to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers\nand suppliers.\nSo on your theory, is there no RICO claim\nbecause the misrepresentation was made to someone other\nthan the plaintiff?\nMR. BECKER: Yes, that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. There would be a criminal RICO prosecution\nbecause, under the Neder case, we know that reliance,\njustifiable reliance, and injury is not required.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But no civil case in\nthat -- in that situation?\nMR. BECKER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't even\ncomport with common-law civil cases. I mean, for a long\ntime courts have allowed someone who's been euchred by a\ncompetitor's misrepresentations to his customers. An\nold New York case that was discussed in the briefs that\nI used to teach in contracts class, where he told\nsomebody that the horse was no longer for sale and it\nwas still for sale, and the person who wanted to sell\nthe horse at the higher price should have -- to buy the\nhorse should have had a cause of action, even though the\nrepresentation was not made to him.\nMR. BECKER: Justice Scalia, those cases as\nwell as the Rice versus Manley New York case, the cheese\nbuyer's case, similar situation, do exist, but they are\nreally tortious interference with business expectancy\ncases. And we believe that the law makes that clear.\nWhen RICO was enacted in 1970, the law even\nin New York, as we point out in our reply brief, had\nevolved to the extent where -- where there were some\nreferences to fraud in those early cases in the 19th\ncentury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose in a tortious\ninterference case, the two tort -- there are two tort\nfeasors, and they communicate with each other by mail.\nIs that a violation of the mail fraud statute?\nMR. BECKER: It would be a violation of the\nmail fraud statutes. But I will say, Justice Kennedy,\nthat the government's position here seeks to extend the\nmail fraud statute far beyond what this Court did in\nNeder. As a matter of fact, the government made the\nexact same argument in Neder as it did to this Court,\nand the Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In my -- in my\nhypothetical, there was no -- there was no reliance on\nanything said. It was just used to facilitate the\nscheme. And I assume the plaintiff could recover.\nMR. BECKER: I think that in criminal mail\nfraud, reliance is not required, Justice Kennedy. And\nthat's what the Neder Court held. But in doing so, it\nlooked to the common law and imposed a materiality\nrequirement. And the only reason that the Neder case\nruled that it's not required in criminal mail fraud is\nbecause no one has to be injured; there does not have to\nbe a completed scheme.\nCivil -- there is, of course, no private\nright of action in mail fraud. And when we look to\nwhether or not someone has a civil claim under RICO\nthrough the predicate act of mail fraud, we have to go\nthrough 1964(c), the \"injured by reason of\" requirement.\nAs this Court found in Holmes, the common-law\nrequirement of proximate cause applies, we submit so\ndoes the common-law element of reliance, justifiable\nreliance, apply in a civil RICO case predicated on mail\nfraud.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't the\ndifference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis \"by\nreason of\" through which the -- as we read it -- the\nproximate cause standard was -- was brought into the\nstatute. Here, in fact, there -- there isn't any text,\nit seems to me, that you can -- can rely on.\nThe fact of fraud itself doesn't do it\nbecause the statute speaks in terms of an offense for\nwhich an individual should be prosecuted. So it's\nlooking to the criminal rather than the civil model.\nAnd isn't that the distinction, in effect, a textual\ndistinction, between Holmes as a means for importing\nproximate cause and the statute in this case as a means\nfor importing first-party reliance?\nMR. BECKER: Well, Justice Souter, of\ncourse, in Holmes the Court was looking at the \"injured\nby reason of\" language and looked to the Clayton Act and\nlooked to the Sherman Act before it, where Congress used\nprecisely the same language. Certainly RICO doesn't\nhave proximate cause in its text at all.\nThe reason -- the very reason that the\ncommon law does apply when you are construing a mail\nfraud predicate act through a civil RICO claim is\nbecause Congress has not told us what \"defraud\" means.\nIt has not defined \"scheme to defraud,\" and of course\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why hasn't it done so\nsimply or sufficiently done so by referring to the -- in\neffect -- the criminal mail fraud violation?\nMR. BECKER: Because in other cases where\nthis Court has looked at the same type of situation, the\nNeder case, Field versus Mans, for example, where there\nis not a definition of a term such as fraud, the Court\nhas looked to the common law to define that term.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but we didn't have --\nI don't think we had in those cases the phrase that\noccurs here. I think the phrase here is \"could be\nprosecuted or indicted\" for something -- I think it was\nprosecution -- which tends to narrow it down to the\ncriminal model, rather than allowing us to roam into the\ncivil field.\nMR. BECKER: Except, Justice Souter, that\nthe -- the requirement that there need to be an\nindictable offense is not enough to make out a civil\nfraud because criminal law recognizes a -- an\nuncompleted fraud, simply a scheme, where here, if\nyou're talking about a completed fraud, for someone to\nbe injured by reason of a fraud, it has to be completed\nand someone has had to rely on it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Well, that means\nthat to that extent the criminal -- in effect -- the\ncriminal cause of action is narrowed down. It doesn't\nfollow from that that the statute contemplated adopting\na civil model regardless.\nMR. BECKER: I -- we -- we believe it does.\nIf Your Honor will contrast the Salinas case with the\nBeck versus Prupis case, we believe it's the similar --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're going to have to\nhelp me do that.\nMR. BECKER: All right. I will. In the\nSalinas case, which was a criminal RICO case, the Court\nruled that it was not necessary to have a wrongful overt\nact in order to make out a criminal cause of action for\nconspiracy under the RICO statute. And the reason was\nbecause all you need is the agreement and any acts.\nThis was a situation where a sheriff\nactually was the wrongdoer, but the deputy sheriff took\nsome innocent acts that were in furtherance of\nconspiracy. The Court said that's conspiracy.\nHowever, in the Beck versus Prupis case, the\nCourt said that for civil RICO cause of action based on\nconspiracy, you need to look at the combination between\n1964(c), the \"injured by reason of\" language, and the\nactual statutory language. And since conspiracy is not\ndefined in the RICO statute, the Court looked to the\ncommon law, and the common law requires that there needs\nto be an unlawful overt act or tortious act in order to\nmake out a common-law cause of action for conspiracy.\nAnd the Court ruled that that was necessary.\nWe think it's the exact same relationship\nSalinas is to Beck as Neder is to this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it -- there is\nreliance on their allegations by the county. The county\nthinks that each bidder is putting in only one bid. So\nthe county has been deceived, and the plaintiff suffers\nthe effect of that deception. Why doesn't that qualify?\nMR. BECKER: Because no representation has\nbeen made to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff hasn't\nrelied on the misrepresentation that was made to the\ncounty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But without the mail fraud\nviolation -- let's assume -- the tort would have been\nunsuccessful. It would not have been complete.\nMR. BECKER: Without the misrepresentation\nto the county, Justice Kennedy?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes. Let's assume\nthat. And it was directed at this class of persons and\nit was relied upon by the county. It seems to me that\nthat's certainly sufficient under the -- it's a mail\nfraud violation.\nMR. BECKER: Well, I think this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, refer to the mail\n-- the civil RICO refers to whether it's a mail fraud\nviolation. You want to assume this additional reliance\nrequirement.\nMR. BECKER: We think it's necessary, Your\nHonor. The other aspect, of course, in the hypothetical\nis that there needs to be some direct injury, and we\ndon't believe that a direct injury is presented here.\nIn order to -- in Anza and, of course,\nbefore in Holmes, the Court set forth three basic\nguidelines in order to determine whether there was\nsufficient proximate cause to bring a cause of action\nunder civil RICO, and in Anza under mail fraud. We\ndon't think those three are enough in this kind of a\nsituation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the problem with\nyour argument that if this isn't direct enough, there is\nno injury at all? The county isn't hurt by this. The\ncounty has got its rotational scheme basically to avoid\nfavoring particular bidders who appear in multiple\nguises, but the county isn't getting hurt. So that if\nit's not direct enough for -- for the Plaintiffs in this\ncase to sue, then nobody has a direct enough interest or\ncan show direct enough causation for RICO.\nMR. BECKER: Well, Justice Souter, first, we\ndisagree that the rotational allocation is well pled\nfact. As we pointed out in our reply brief toward the\nlast several pages and in footnote 7, the actual sale\nand the bidding is nothing like the concept of\nrotational allocations.\nBut putting that aside for a moment, the\ncounty certainly could be a victim. First of all, the\ncounty -- this is a violation of an administrative rule.\nThat's what is at the heart of this case, an alleged\nviolation. The county has made the rule possibly for\nthe purpose that Your Honor just articulated, although\nthere is nothing in the record to let us know that.\nBut what we do know is that these types of\nrules exist for the benefit of the property owners, and\nthat's because the Illinois Supreme Court in -- the same\nplaintiff brought a case challenging a very, very\nsimilar rule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But how could the property\nowner be hurt if there is -- if we are dealing in a\nsituation here in -- in which the penalty is zero\npercent, and everybody is bidding zero percent, then\nthis is a situation in which the property owner isn't\ngoing to get hurt no matter who ends up with it.\nMR. BECKER: Justice Souter, zero percent is\nby no means guaranteed. That's only been the last three\nyears. In fact, in the 2000 case before the Illinois\nSupreme Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that's the --\nthat's the case here. So if your direct-injury\nrequirement, as you construe it, applies here, I think\nwe are still left with a situation in which on these\nfacts, nobody would be injured, because nobody -- or\nnobody would be -- be able to prove injury by a\nsufficient direct route to establish causation.\nMR. BECKER: Including the bidders and the\nPlaintiffs, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. Right.\nMR. BECKER: Well, I think that they\ncertainly could not prove injury as a matter of proof.\nThe problem with that, of course, is in a RICO case it\ntakes five years to get there. And someone can artfully\nplead -- use two words with no elaboration at all,\n\"rotational allocation.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's a\ndifferent point, the point that you made in your reply\nbrief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system,\nand maybe they can't prove that they were -- that they\nwere injured; that they would have gotten a greater\nshare. But your case is about -- it doesn't matter even\nif you -- you have to accept the allegations of their\ncomplaint as true, even if everything they say in the\ncomplaint is true, they have no claim. They have no\nRICO claim.\nMR. BECKER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have to assume what\nthey say about the rotational system is right and -- but\n-- but you are hanging your hat on no misrepresentation\nwas made to them.\nMR. BECKER: That's correct, Justice. We --\nwe are -- we have raised below, but not in this Court,\nthat there was not sufficient injury, directness of\ninjury; and it can't be proved in this Court. I think\nit comes into play in the reliance concept under\nproximate causation.\nAnd what we are asking the Court to do is to\nrecognize that, in the context of a civil RICO claim\nbased on fraud, that there is -- there is nothing that\nis -- that is revolutionary about finding that a\nreliance requirement should be applied. This case, as\nthe Court knows, was originally dismissed by Chief Judge\nHolderman on that very basis.\nIf we have -- if we were to accept -- if the\nCourt were to accept our opponents' position, a\nremarkable array of lawsuits could be brought as RICO\nactions: Competitor versus competitor for harm that\nallegedly is caused by false statements to customers,\nsuppliers, distributors, marketing agencies, government\nentities; consumer or end user versus manufacturer for\nharm allegedly resulting from false statements to the\nfirst buyer in a distribution chain.\nAnd the circuit court cases in the Fifth --\nFourth and Fifth and Sixth and Eighth and Eleventh\ncircuits have recognized this, and they require reliance\nas a part of proximate causation, and we believe this\nCourt should do the same.\nI also wanted to make the point that to\nelaborate, in the Neder case, the Government -- and this\nis a case where the Government ostensibly argues that it\nwants us not to restrict civil RICO claims. But in the\nNeder case the Government made the very same argument in\ntrying to expand mail fraud claims under the criminal\nstatutes.\nAnd I think that's -- that's a sub rosa\nissue in this case. The Court nine years ago\nspecifically said in a unanimous opinion, with Chief\nJustice Rehnquist writing for the Court, that the Court\ndisagreed that mail fraud was moored to the common law\nof fraud, and it is not unmoored in the Neder case.\nThey said it was moored, and even in a criminal\nprosecution materiality is required. And although\njustifiable reliance and injury is not required in a\ncriminal prosecution, to unmoor the mail fraud statute\nin a civil RICO context and to then make the argument\nthat all sorts of other claims can -- can also be\nincluded such as tortious interference -- because at its\nheart this is a tortious interference case. We know\nthat because the Plaintiffs pled it in their complaint.\nThat's their pendant State court action. And that's\nwhere this case should be. It should be a tortious\ninterference case.\nIf they can prove that case and if they have\npled it, then they have a remedy. If they can't, they\ndon't. But the problem is that to give the civil RICO\ntool, to call \"racketeers\" -- to call your competitor a\n\"racketeer\" and to seek treble damages and attorney's\nfees in this kind of such an attenuated situation,\nshould not be something that the Court condones.\nAnd it's different; if you Google my\nclients, you'll come up -- they will come up as\nracketeers now, and -- and that's the problem that we\nhave. If there were a reliance requirement, you could\nimmediately tell if this was a situation where the\ncommon law --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just go back to a\nstatement you made? I thought you -- you conceded that\non their allegations your client would be indictable for\nmail fraud?\nMR. BECKER: Well, I didn't concede that my\nclient would be indictable for mail fraud. I think that\nthere would have to be -- we'd have to take a careful\nlook at the indictment, certainly. But I will say that\n-- that I do -- I do say that the mail fraud statute\ndoes not require justifiable reliance or injury.\nI think the problem is when you ask the\ndirect -- my client hasn't been indicted for mail fraud,\nand I don't think it's any -- it's any oversight because\nthis has been a very well known case in Cook County. I\nthink the reason, if one were to ask me why my client\nhasn't been indicted for mail fraud, is because they\ndidn't commit it, because the county in its own rule --\nthe treasurer wrote the rule and expressly says in the\nrule that she has the exclusive discretion to determine\nwhether or not there has been a violation of the rule.\nShe has not so determined. And this case has been\npending now for close to over three years. The\ntreasurer is aware of it, and we know that, and she\nstill has not determined that there has been a\nviolation. So if there hasn't been a violation of the\nrule, there is no criminal mail fraud violation either.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is your client still\nbidding on -- on these --\nMR. BECKER: Yes, Justice Souter, and also\nall of the -- al of the plaintiffs -- the Respondents\nare still bidding, which I think is an interesting fact.\nAnd it's not -- it's in the record because they have an\namended complaint where they have pled subsequent sales.\nThat's how far afield from the law of fraud this is\ngoing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are all the shell\ncorporations still bidding?\nMR. BECKER: Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, if all of them aren't, it's simply because\nthere may be new corporations that are, and they are\nformed not for the purpose of defrauding anybody, but\nfor tax purposes.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd --\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Becker.\nMR. BECKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. DeBruin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. DeBRUIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. DeBRUIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt is presumed true in this case that\nPetitioners submitted false affidavits, filled the\nauction room with related entities, and obtained\nthousands of liens that would have been awarded to\nRespondents and other bidders, causing them injury in\nfact. I submit the central issue in this case is\nwhether on those facts Respondents can establish\nproximate cause, and specifically whether in order to do\nso they must establish that they personally received and\nrelied upon the false statements at issue.\nI submit that this Court already has\nestablished in its decisions in Holmes and in Anza the\nproper test for proximate cause. And no claim has been\nmade in this case, at least not until perhaps briefly\nthis morning, that the Respondents cannot establish\nproximate cause under the standards set forth in those\ncases. Moreover, no argument is made that the standards\narticulated in Holmes and in Anza are insufficient to\nferret out the appropriate cases that can go forward;\nthat those cases produce anomalous results either here\nor in any other case that has been decided.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is it your view that\nassume -- assuming there is a State law cause of action\nfor tortuous interference, that if that tortious\ninterference was effected through the use of the mails\nby the co-tort features, that that automatically invokes\nthe RICO statute?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Your Honor, all of the\nelements of RICO would have to be established. There\nwould have to be predicate acts of mail fraud.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that there are\npredicate acts, yes.\nMR. DeBRUIN: And they would have to form a\npattern and all the other requirements that were\nsignificant would have to be met, but yes.\nAnd I submit in this case there is no\nserious dispute but that the allegations over the course\nof many years of the complaint established indictable\nmail fraud. The issue is not whether the fact pattern\nis under the common law tortious interference or some\nother common-law tort.\nThe question is: Do the facts as alleged\nmake out indictable mail fraud? There is no question\nbut the mail fraud statute is broad. It prohibits any\nscheme or artifice to defraud; and I believe that if the\nfacts here were proved, the submission of false\naffidavits to the county on a regular basis, there is no\nneed under mail fraud to prove reliance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those -- those\nweren't mailed, or at least that's not what you're\nrelying on. You're not relying on the affidavits that\nmake the misrepresentation using the mails. I thought\nyour reliance on the mails is only the tail end of this\ntransaction, the notices that get sent to the property\nowners.\nMR. DeBRUIN: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. The mails here are an essential component to\nallow this fraud to have any effect. If it weren't for\nthe use of the mail, the Petitioners could never realize\nthe economic value of the liens that they obtained\nthrough the fraud. And in that sense the use of the\nmails are essential to the scheme. And that's what this\nCourt held in the Schmuck decision: That the mails,\nthemselves, don't have to be false so long as the use of\nthe mails is essential to the scheme.\nHere it clearly is. Absent the notices\ngiven to property owners, there would be no way for the\nPetitioners to realize the value of the liens and obtain\nthe benefit of the fraud by -- by making the false\nstatements to the county and literally obtaining\nthousands of additional liens that otherwise would have\ngone to other entities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what --\nwould your position be different if the county were, in\nfact, injured; we didn't have the zero-percent situation\nbut different percentages? Your client would not be\nable to sue them, right?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthe Court has already addressed that in Anza and has\nmade clear that if in an appropriate case the government\nhad been harmed and was in fact -- could be expected to\nsue, as it was in Anza -- in that case the claim was\nthat the defendant had not paid its taxes to the State\nof New York. And the Court found that New York was the\ndirectly injured party, could be expected to sue, and\nunder Anza there was no proximate cause. We accept that\ntest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what does that\ndo to your statutory argument? In other words under\nyour statutory argument, you still could sue; but\nbecause of other considerations you can't?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, we have to establish\npredicate acts of mail fraud, but we also have to\nestablish proximate cause. And under Anza the failure\nwas an inability to prove proximate cause. In this case\nit has not been seriously disputed that we satisfy the\nfactors set forth in Anza. The county was not harmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what happens\n-- what happens if some of the bids were more than zero,\nand some weren't? You get to sue for part of the\ndamages, and the county gets to sue for the rest? Or\nhow do you divvy that up?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, the only time that the\naffidavits and the representations in this case have\neffect is if all the bids are zero. The county, in\norder to protect itself from property owners, provides\nthat if there are multiple bids above zero, the county\nwill not issue the lien. It holds the lien itself.\nThe only time that this rule comes into\neffect where there is a rotational award is if the\ncounty is paid its taxes in full, and there are multiple\nbidders at zero percent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I suppose\nsince we are talking about a rotational rule, you could\nhave -- what are these, monthly or annually -- one,\npossibly, cycle where it's all zero percent, and then\nothers where it isn't, and then another where it is.\nAnd that would affect the rotation in a way that would\ninjure your client but would also injure the county.\nMR. DeBRUIN: Not the way the county\nadministers these auctions. If that happened -- and it\ncertainly could happen -- that the bidding process that\ntakes the penalty down stopped at five percent or two\npercent, the county rules under the program at issue\nprovide the county will not apply the rotational system.\nIt won't award the lien at all.\nThe rotational rule only applies when there\nare multiple, zero-percent bids. And Respondents will\nshow, as this case goes forward, that they can identify\nthe specific properties on which there were multiple\nbids; that the Petitioners and the related entities,\nwhich they will prove are related, received liens and\nthereby increased to the thousands the number of\nvaluable liens that the Petitioners got, leaving the\nRespondents essentially with hundreds of liens.\nThe key is, the central question is, whether\nPetitioners can show proximate cause under the standards\nin Holmes and Anza. And under Anza what this Court held\nis the central question for proximate cause is the\ndirectness between the violation alleged and the injury.\nAnd in this case there is a direct relation between the\nviolation of mail fraud alleged, the predicate acts, and\nthe injury that Respondents have incurred.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would you explain why your\nargument is consistent with Beck versus Prupis? In that\ncase, couldn't the plaintiff show that it was injured by\nreason of the criminal violation that was alleged, the\nRICO conspiracy; and, yet, the Court said something more\nwas required, taking an additional requirement from the\nlaw of civil conspiracy? How is your argument here\nconsistent with that?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Justice Alito, Beck was a\ncompletely different case. The issue in Beck was --\nsection 1964(c) says that the plaintiff must prove\ninjury by reason of a violation of the act. And the\nviolation of the act at issue in Beck was 1962(d), which\nis a conspiracy to violate the other provisions. And so\nwhat the Court was looking at was the word \"conspiracy,\"\nwhich was not defined in the statute. And the Court\napplied the accepted rule that where a word is not\ndefined, the Court can assume that Congress intended its\nordinary meaning.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But -- well, the meaning of\na RICO conspiracy in the criminal context is very well\nknown. I don't know why it matters whether it is\ndefined in the statute or not; and there is no\nrequirement in that that anybody be injured by virtue of\nan unlawful, overt act.\nMR. DeBRUIN: But the Court looked to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it appropriate there\nto look to the law of civil conspiracy and yet\ninappropriate here to look to the law of civil fraud?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, it looked to conspiracy\nto make up the elements of the civil cause of action\nthere. But here the relevant provision that is relied\nupon is 1962(c), which is a violation of RICO. And we\nalso alleged 16, 1962(c). But in (c) the violation of\nRICO is to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through\na pattern of racketeering activity.\nNone of those words, \"conducting the affairs\nof an enterprise\", are words that Petitioners contend\nyou look to the common law to define. There could be a\npattern of racketeering activity that would consist of\nfraud, of violence, of bribery all together.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Am I -- am I reading these\nprovisions wrong? I thought you were proceeding in a\n1961, and that the conspiracy -- the conspiracy\nprovision is 1962(c).\nMR. DeBRUIN: 1961 is the definitions. We\nallege a violation of both 1962(c) and 1962(d).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the conspiracy\nprovision.\nMR. DeBRUIN: 1962(d) is the conspiracy. We\nallege a violation of that. We also allege a violation\nof 1962(c).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking on page 2 of\nthe Petitioner's brief. Have I -- have I been\nmisinformed?\nThe blue brief, page 2, maybe that's wrong,\nbut that's what it says. It says 1962(c), it shall be\nunlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of\nthe provisions of subsections (a), (b) or (c).\nMR. DeBRUIN: Your Honor, the citation\nappears at the bottom of the quote, the way it's set\nforth on page 2.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. I understand.\nMR. DeBRUIN: So if you look at the very\nfirst quotation, you'll see where it follows.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see, I see, I see.\nOkay.\nMR. DeBRUIN: So in this case, we allege\nboth a violation of 1962(c) and (d). 1962(c) prohibits\nconducting the affairs of an enterprise through a\npattern of racketeering activity. That pattern may\nconsist of fraud, violence, bribery --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that, but\nwhen the pattern of racketeering activity consists of\npredicate acts of mail fraud, why isn't -- why does not\nBeck point you to the word \"fraud,\" which like\n\"conspiracy,\" I don't believe is defined in the RICO\nstatute? So why if you look to civil conspiracy to\nunderstand what \"conspiracy\" means in the RICO statute,\nwhy do you not look to \"civil fraud\" to find out what\nthe word \"fraud\" means in the RICO statute?\nMR. DeBRUIN: I would say two things:\nFirst, what that argument would do would make\nessentially common-law fraud the predicate act under\nRICO, when instead it is indictable mail fraud, not\ncommon-law fraud. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you can say the same in\nBeck. It would make civil conspiracy the predicate act\nin RICO, rather than -- the RICO violation, rather than\ncriminal conspiracy.\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, the Court, again, in\nBeck, was looking to the common-law word \"conspiracy\" to\napply it in different contexts. There is not a\ncommon-law fraud that is actionable under RICO.\nBut secondly, even if you accept that test,\nJustice Alito, under the common law of fraud, there is\nno doubt that claims like ours were actionable and were\nactionable as fraud. The case that Justice Scalia\nreferenced to, the common-law cases involving the buyer\nof cheese and other facts, those were actionable as\nfraud where --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Becker says they were\ninterference with a business relationship, not fraud.\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, under the law of torts\nas it has evolved, there are different labels that are\napplied. But what was critical is that that conduct,\nthe interference through fraud with a contract of\nanother, was actionable at the common law. The\nplaintiff could make out a claim and recover damages,\neven though the plaintiff had not received the statement\nat issue and had not relied on the statement at issue.\nSo that even if, under RICO, you were to look for civil\npurposes to a common-law analogue, the common law made\nclear that these kinds of claims were actionable,\nwhatever label might be applied to them today in terms\nof the nature of the -- of the tort.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One concern, because RICO\ncan be a very broad statute, is that if you are right,\nthen any unsuccessful bidder could look through a\nrival's submission, find a false statement, and sue\nunder RICO.\nMR. DeBRUIN: Your Honor, I believe that is\nnot true for the reasons this Court set forth in Anza.\nThe standards set forth in Holmes and in Anza are very\nrigorous tests to establish proximate cause. So the\nmerely assertion of falsity by a competitor -- I mean,\nAnza involved a competitor situation. There the claim\nwas that had been mail fraud that caused the competitor\nharm.\nThe Court recognized in Anza that that case\nwas different than Holmes. There was an allegation of a\ndirect injury in Anza, but nevertheless the relation\nbetween the violation and the harm was far less direct\nthan it is in this case, as Judge Easterbrook, Chief\nJudge Easterbrook explained.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is it -- I\nreally worry about adopting a rule which would produce\nthe result that whenever anyone makes a false statement\nin an official form, someone who is deprived of a\nbusiness opportunity, or at least can say so, can bring\na RICO action.\nMR. DeBRUIN: Justice Scalia, I would say\ntwo things: First of all, I think it's critical to\nrealize that Congress enacted RICO to protect\ncompetitors. One of the principal motivations behind\nRICO was to protect legitimate businesses that are\ninjured in their business or property by reason of a\npattern of racketeering activity as defined under the\nstatute. That's number one.\nNumber two, there are important restrictions\nthat this Court repeatedly has recognized. It's not\nenough that there be a single act. There must be\npredicate acts that are a pattern of activity.\n\"Pattern\" doesn't just mean two. It means a continuing\nthreat of continuing criminal activity. There must be\nproximate cause under Holmes and Anza. All of those\nrestrictions exist. And only if the plaintiff can\nsuccessfully navigate all of those things, proving not\ncommon-law fraud but indictable criminal activity,\nproving a pattern of continuing criminal activity,\nproving proximate cause, only then can the plaintiff\nmake out a RICO violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that every\nother bidder in this situation is a viable plaintiff.\nMR. DeBRUIN: In this case, we don't submit\nthat we are the only potential plaintiffs. That there\nwere other bidders -- the bidders at these auctions fall\ninto perhaps two different categories. Many bidders --\nover 50 percent of all the registered bidders receive\nfewer than 10 liens. In other words, they are at the\nauction to bid on a specific property or small number of\nproperties.\nThen there are other what I would call\nprofessional tax buyers, who basically do research,\nidentify the most attractive properties, and we will\nshow, are essentially bidding on the same group of\nproperties. And those are the properties at issue.\nThose are the bidders at issue. It is more than just\nthe Respondents, but it is a relatively small group --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose in\nother cases where if we adopt the rule you argue for,\nthat wouldn't be confined at all. For example, in a\nsituation where a competitor is defrauding a supplier,\nevery competitor no matter how many there were, could\nbring a RICO action.\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, I think the Court --\nagain, if you look to the Anza case, the Court has made\nclear that if a RICO defendant takes actions that simply\nenhance the defendant's own competitive position, which\nwas the allegation in Anza, that that may not be enough\nto establish proximate cause. But whereas here the\nforeseeable and clear effect of defendant's actions is\nto work a direct injury on competitors and, in fact, on\nno one else, not on the county, not on the property\nowners, but only on competitors, that was within the\nambit of what Congress sought to protect in RICO.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of how\nmany competitors there are?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Well, yes. As this Court\nrecognized in Storey Parchment and Hazeltine, in\nantitrust cases as well as RICO cases, damage issues\nhave to be worked out. But the fact that there may be\nmultiple bidders that you may have to award damages to a\ngroup does not defeat the claim. The defendant cannot\ncome into court and say because damages here have to be\nallocated among a larger number of people, you can't\nestablish a claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it the law generally in\nthe States that an unsuccessful bidder can sue the\nsuccessful bidder if the successful bidder misstated\nqualification?\nMR. DeBRUIN: Justice Kennedy, the\ncommon-law rule actually was, I believe, in 27 of 40\nStates -- this unfortunately came up after the\nbriefing -- that a disappointed bidder could bring an\naction at the common law if the allegation was one of\nfraud in the procurement. So that the common law did\nnot provide an absolute bar to claims like this.\nNow, again, the issue is: Will the claims\nsatisfy Holmes and Anza? There is no argument here that\nthat standard, the framework this Court established\nfirst in Holmes and then applied in Anza, that that\nframework is inadequate, that it produces an anomalous\nresult here or will produce an anomalous result in other\ncases. It's a very rigorous test.\nThis Court looked at directness; it looked\nto the suitability of other plaintiffs; it looked to\nwhether the harm was derivative. That's a\nquintessential proximate cause analysis. Proximate\ncause is, historically through the common law, a very\nfact-based intensive test. But the Court has made clear\nthat the ability of the RICO plaintiff to overcome that\ntest, it's a significant showing that must be met.\nChief Judge Easterbrook, in this case, went\nthrough the Anza factors very methodically. He showed\nthat, under each factor, proximate cause clearly can be\nmet under the common law. The Respondents were directly\ninjured in a significant and substantial way, and that\nis sufficient, I submit, to make out the elements of the\nRICO claim, assuming all the other elements are also\nmet.\nIf there are no further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. DeBruin.\nMr. Miller?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRICO provides a cause of action to\nplaintiffs who have suffered injuries by reason of, that\nis, proximately caused by, a RICO violation. Now, when\nthe RICO violation is predicated on an act of mail\nfraud, the plaintiff ordinarily will need to show that\nsomebody relied on the false statements in order to\nestablish that the fraud was even a \"but for\" cause of\ninjury.\nA plaintiff who can establish that it was\nthe one who relied on the false statements would be able\nto show proximate causation. But that's not the only\nway to establish proximate causation, and there is no\nbasis for this -- for the imposition of a per se rule\nrequiring that the plaintiff be the one who has relied.\nInstead when a defendant creates a scheme to defraud\nthat induces reliance by one party in order to injure\nanother party, the injured party should have a cause of\naction under --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the answer\nto Justice Kennedy's question with respect to Federal\nGovernment contracts?\nMR. MILLER: My understanding is that the\ncase has established that they can. Again, since this\ncame up after the briefing, one illustrative example is\nin the Eighth Circuit, Iconco against Jensen\nConstruction Company, which is 622 F.2d 1291. In that\ncase, it was a contract that was set aside for small\nbusinesses, and the company got the contract by falsely\nclaiming to be a small business. And then in a\ndiversity case applying Iowa law, the Eighth Circuit\nheld that the disappointed bidder could bring an action\nfor fraud and unjust enrichment against the successful\nbidder. So I think that -- and that's of a piece with\nthe long common-law tradition, going back to cases like\nRice against Manley, where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if there\nare 50 disappointed bidders?\nMR. MILLER: Well, it would be the burden of\nthe plaintiff to establish that, but for the fraud, it\nwould have gotten the contract. So in most cases of\ncontracting, that's going to be very difficult for a\nplaintiff to show. This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.\nMR. MILLER: -- is somewhat usual.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't you show --\nwhy couldn't -- that's like the situation where a\ncompany runs a -- runs a lottery and in fact\nmisrepresents what the odds are. And then you mean the\npeople can't recover because they couldn't show that\nthey would have won? It seems to me you can calculate\nthe difference in the odds or something and place some\nvalue on that. Is it really painless to say, you know,\nI'm running a lottery and your chances of winning are\none in a thousand, and everybody buys a ticket on that\nbasis, and it turns out that really your chances are one\nin a million? Nobody has a cause of action because\nnobody can prove he would have won?\nMR. MILLER: No, the participants in the\nlottery in that case would have a cause of action\nbecause they have paid money to the person running the\nlottery.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's all they can get?\nJust what they paid for the ticket?\nMR. MILLER: I think -- I think the -- the\ncommon-law measure of damages would be -- would be what\nthey paid in that situation. But certainly the recovery\nfor disappointed bidders in cases like this, does have a\nlong common-law tradition, and with the more modern\nelaboration of tort law, as demonstrated by the\nsecondary statement, it has sometimes been given a\ndifferent label, and that is either \"injurious\nfalsehood\" or \"intentional interference with a\nprospective contractual relation,\" but at its heart, the\naction that's at issue here is one that's for fraud.\nBut I would like to say in response to some\nof Justice Alito's questions that, with respect to the\nBeck case and the relevance of it, that ultimately in\nour view it doesn't really matter whether the common law\nwould have allowed recovery in this case, and that's\nbecause, unlike in Beck where the Court had to consider\nwhat is the meaning of -- what does it mean to be\ninjured by reason of a conspiracy? And the Court\nanswered that question by looking at the common law of\ncivil conspiracy. That mode of analysis would be\nappropriate here if the relevant predicate under 1961\nwere fraud or any conduct involving fraud or otherwise\nmade reference to common-law fraud. But, of course,\n1961 does not say that; it says \"any act which is\nindictable under section 1341,\" the mail fraud statute.\nSo under -- given the structure of the statute, the only\ninquiry is: Is the injury incurred by reason of an act\nwhich is indictable under 1341?\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the RICO statute doesn't\nsay you can recover if you're injured by reason of\nconspiracy, without any elaboration. It says \"by reason\nof a violation of this statute.\" And therefore you look\nto 1962(d), which tells you what the violation is. It's\na RICO -- it's a criminal RICO conspiracy. So I just\ndon't see how that argument works.\nMR. MILLER: Well, 1964(c) refers you, as\nyou noted, to 1962, which simply says \"conspiracy.\" And\nso the Court in Beck explained that to figure out how\nyou tell when someone has been injured by civil\nconspiracy, there is a body of law, the common law, that\nanswers that question. There is no corresponding\ncommon-law principle of what it means to be injured by\nan act of mail fraud because there is no common law of\nmail fraud per se; it's a statutory creation. And so\nthe relevant inquiry is simply: Did the conduct violate\nthe mail fraud statute, section 1341? Not was it common\nlaw fraud?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't think it's\nbecause there's no common-law equivalent. I think it's\nsimply because the word \"conspiracy\" is a -- the\nsubstantive violation under 19 -- under 1962(c). \"It\nshall be unlawful for any person to conspire.\" And we\nhave to interpret the word \"conspire,\" and we say we\ngive it its common-law meaning; whereas, for a violation\nof the general racketeering statute, there's -- there's\nno equivalent reference to a word that we have to give\ncontent to. It just says -- unless it's the word\n\"indictable.\"\nMR. MILLER: No. I think that's right. And\ncertainly the \"by reason of\" requirement in 1964, it\ndoes refer to the common-law requirements of proximate\ncause. But that -- that language -- \"by reason of\" --\ndoes not contain a reliance requirement because it\napplies to any number of predicate acts, all of the\npredicate acts under 1961. And in the context of many\nof those acts, reliance would be completely\ninappropriate. I would also like to point out that I\nthink the conduct that is alleged here really does go to\nthe core of what RICO is intended to redress. Congress\nmade clear, in the finding that accompanied the statute,\nthat one of its principal concerns was that criminal\nenterprises could use illegal means to compete unfairly\nwith legitimate businesses. And so if a business -- a\ncriminal business were to use threats of violence\ndirected at its competitor's customers to get them to\nswitch their business to it, the competitor would have a\ncause of action for that. And then the same should be\ntrue, we submit, if the business uses fraud directed at\nits competitor's customers to induce them to switch\ntheir business.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Miller.\nMr. Becker, 10 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE M. BECKER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BECKER: Thank you.\nThe difference between this case and what\nCongress intended is that, yes, in the comments to the\nenactment of RICO, Congress did say that it was trying\nto protect legitimate competitors from illegitimate\nconduct or unlawful conduct. This case has now morphed\ninto a situation where competitors are using RICO as an\nanticompetitive device, and that's what we believe the\nreliance requirement will -- will at least rein in,\ntotally consistent with the common law.\nWe are not asking this Court to impose any\nrequirement on RICO that does not already exist by\nreason of the common-law meaning rule. Actually, we\nbelieve our opponents and the S.G. are asking this\nCourt to expand RICO by unmooring it from the common\nlaw. We believe that Beck versus Prubis is exactly the\nsame situation and the same analysis. Although 1962(d),\nwhich is a substantive conspiracy violation of RICO, was\nat issue in Beck versus Prupis, you get to the same\nsituation just as an extra step. Here's the -- here's\nthe analysis. You look to 19 -- they have a conspiracy\ncount of course. But you look to 1962(c), and it says\nthat \"any person injured by reason of\" -- if you read in\n1964(c) to it -- by reason of a RICO violation or a --\nor a racketeering activity \"shall have a cause of\naction.\"\nNow, you look to racketeering activity in\n1961, and that has a hundred and something predicate\nacts, one of which is mail fraud. You look at mail\nfraud, and it says \"a scheme to defraud.\" It uses the\nword \"defraud.\" What does that mean? It's the same\nplace; you just -- you just need to take one more step\nto get there, but it's the same place the Court found\nitself, we submit, in Beck versus Prupis. If criminal\nconspiracy means the same thing as civil conspiracy,\nBeck versus Prupis would not -- the Court would not have\nheld what it did in Beck versus Prupis. And if mail\nfraud only means an indictable offense and nothing more\nunder the criminal law, it should be the same as the\ncivil law, then there would be no common-law meaning\nrule. To apply the common-law --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the weakness\nof the argument that you're, in effect, dividing mail\nand fraud? You're saying there are two requirements,\nand therefore, fraud here is just like conspiracy in\nBeck. But in fact, mail fraud is -- is a single term of\nart. It refers simply to a criminal violation for which\nthere -- there is no exact civil counterpart. And so,\nif you take mail fraud as being a unified term of art,\nthen it seems to me that your argument falls apart,\nbecause you can't treat the fraud in the mail fraud the\nway you treated the conspiracy standing alone in Beck.\nMR. BECKER: Justice Souter, we respectfully\ndisagree and refer the Court to Field versus Mans, where\nit was bankruptcy fraud. And I believe -- the exact\nsame thing. What does bankruptcy mean? What does mail\nfraud mean? Well, they looked to -- the Court looked to\nthe common law meaning rule, and looked to the elements\nyou need for fraud in order to determine what has to be\nproved for bankruptcy fraud.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there was no definition\nof bankruptcy fraud as a separate definition, was there?\nWhereas in mail fraud, we know what it means.\nMR. BECKER: Not from the statute we don't,\nJustice Souter. There is no definition of mail fraud in\nthe statute. The only reason we know what it means is\nbecause the Court has construed it over the years. In\norder to construe it now in a civil context, we are\nasking the Court to apply the common law meaning rule\nbecause that's -- the analog is fraud; that's the\nobvious source to look to the common law.\nIf I may I'd like to make a few other\npoints.\nFirst of all, I cannot leave this podium and\nleave this Court under the impression that there is\ndirectness of injury. There are 195 bidders. The\nplaintiffs themselves alleged this in paragraph 46, our\njoint appendix 20 and 21. Without belaboring it, the\nlast few pages of our reply brief show all of the things\nthat would have to be shown in order to have even --\neven a remote directness of injury in this case.\nSo the -- we have not -- we have not in any\nway conceded that the requirements of Anza or Holmes\nhave been met. And -- but I think our brief adequately\ndeals with that.\nI'd also like to point out that RICO and\nmail fraud don't reach everything actionable at common\nlaw. I mean, if there was an argument, that would mean\nthat civil RICO in every case involving a false\nstatement -- every case involving a false statement, no\nmatter to whom it's made, would be a civil RICO case.\nThe general idea of protecting competitors\ndoesn't mean that Congress provided that anything that\nanyone says to anybody violates civil RICO. That's not\nthe way that this Court interprets statutes; and there\nis no allegation in the complaint at all as -- that the\nrotational basis applies only when bids are at zero\npercent.\nIn the year 2000 the Illinois Supreme Court\nconfronted the same plaintiff in this case, Phoenix\nBond, challenging a very similar rule because at that\npoint in time there was collusion including the same\nplaintiff to keep the penalty rate at 18 percent. And\nthe Illinois Supreme Court said the rule will -- is\nsomething that the treasurer has the right to make to\ntry to regulate the bids, and the treasurer certainly\ncan be a victim of this situation. If the bid is not\nperceived as fair, the treasurer will not have enough\nbidders in order to sell all the bids, and therefore,\nthe county will not be paid the unpaid taxes.\nIf the treasurer thought that there really\nwas a misrepresentation here made by the Petitioners,\nthe treasurer would have a very great incentive and a\nvery great state in enforcing this rule; and the\ntreasurer did not, we believe because the treasurer\ndoesn't believe there is any violation.\nThe -- the other ways that the county could\nbe injured are that if the -- if the penalty rate goes\nup beyond zero percent, there is no guarantee that the\nsame number of bidders will -- will come to the sale.\nThere -- I also want to refer the Court to\nother -- this is not new. In Safeco Insurance just\nrecently, last term, the Court asked -- was asked to\ndefine the term \"willfulness\" in a civil liability\nprovision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the\nCourt observed that there is different meanings in the\ncivil and criminal law to the term \"willfulness.\" In\nFarmer versus Brennan the Court recognized different\nuses of the term \"recklessness\" in the civil and\ncriminal contexts.\nSo once again we are asking this Court to\nrule consistent with the common law meaning rule that\nthe -- a civil RICO action predicated on mail fraud,\nwhere one is -- it has to fulfill the requirement that\nyou have been -- the plaintiff has been injured by\nreason of mail fraud or racketeering activity. The\nplaintiff must rely on a misrepresentation or the fraud\ndirectly, because that's the essence of civil fraud.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
