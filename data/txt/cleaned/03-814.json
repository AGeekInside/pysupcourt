        "content": "(11:01 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kaplan, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. KAPLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KAPLAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI received word that the Court is interested in\n46 U.S.C. 801, and I intend to focus my attention on that\nbefore I get into my argument.\n46-801 is referred to as the Shipping Act, and\nit was enacted in 1916 and the amendment in 1918. At that\ntime, the United States Government was involved in a war\nand we were interested in developing the merchant marine\nfor purposes of transporting cargo, equipment, and people\nback and forth. And so the amendment that was filed was\nfashioned after exactly 1 U.S.C. 3, but it had some\nadditional features involved, one of which was that a\nvessel that was under construction was included as part of\nthe act, one of which was if the owner intended to use the\nvessel for transportation, it was included. It is under\nno circumstances affecting a Jones Act claim because the\nJones Act requires, number one, a vessel in navigation and\nit can't be on the dock or being under construction, and\nif it was under construction, it wouldn't have a crew.\nSo under the circumstances, with all due\nrespect, it is our judgment that we -- we would win on\nboth sides. The Super Scoop would indeed, qualify under\nthat act as well as under 1 U.S.C. 3. But we think that\nthis goes a little too far and not appropriate.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is the Super Scoop\npractically capable of transportation on water, counsel?\nMR. KAPLAN: It is more than practically\ncapable, it actually is -- actually transports its\nequipment and its personnel at work and its --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Didn't it come from the west\n-- did it come from the west coast originally?\nMR. KAPLAN: Indeed, it did. It came through\nthe west coast, unmanned, however. It came from the west\ncoast through the Panama, through the Gulf, up the east\ncoast, and, sir, if anything had occurred on that trip, that\n-- that would have been considered a vessel. However, when\nit came in to Boston --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was nobody on it in\nthat trip.\nMR. KAPLAN: Sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nobody -- there was\nno one on it --\nMR. KAPLAN: In fact, it's unmanned.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to be injured.\nMR. KAPLAN: There was nobody injured and\nunmanned, yes, indeed.\nBut what -- what I'm saying is historically\nthere has never been a decision in which a dredge was not\nconsidered a vessel until this case that we appear here\nnow.\nOf course, I'm here to seek to have you overrule\nthe decision that was rendered. But more importantly, we\nare having a morass in the lower courts, and I'm here to\ntry and persuade this Court to establish, once and for\nall, that there is a standard, that there is a definition\nfor the use of the word vessel under the Jones Act.\nNow, in 1920, when the Jones Act was enacted,\nthere was no reference to the use of the word vessel, and\nwe know that when that happens, we have to seek to find\nwhat was the meaning, what was the established meaning at\nthat time. And the way we do that is to look first to\nstatutory law, and in addition we look to case law.\nThe statutory law is clear. In 1873 in the\nrevised statutes it makes it very clear that section 3\ndescribes a vessel is any watercraft that -- or other\nartificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, for\ntransportation on water. With that standard in 1873, this\nCourt in 1907 tried the case of Ellis v. the United States\nand did apply that revised statute and decided that the\ndredges that were working in the city of -- in the Boston\nHarbor were indeed vessels and that the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, that -- that\ndefinition, used or capable of being used -- right, now.\nAfter one of the hurricanes, I saw a -- a\ntugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the\nGulf. What if somebody -- some enterprising person had\nfitted that out like a -- like a diner, you know, a -- a\nrestaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're\nserving the meals off of this boat? Now, the boat, apart\nfrom the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland,\nis capable of being -- still capable of being used. Are\nthe employees of that diner covered by the Jones Act?\nMR. KAPLAN: Very interesting question, Justice\nScalia. However, this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it goes to whether we\nwant to use, you know, section 3 as -- as our definition.\nMR. KAPLAN: This Court seemed to have focused\nright on point in the cases of Cope in -- Cope was early,\n1903, and in the case of Evansville in 1926 when they\nadded the two words, practically capable. The Cope case\nwas a dry-dock and it was run into by somebody and they\nsought damages. And the Court -- this Court said, wait a\nminute. In that case, that's a dry-dock. It goes up and\ndown. It doesn't navigate. It doesn't transport people\nor cargo over water. So they said it's not practically\ncapable of fulfilling under the revised statute.\nThe easiest case is 1926 when this Court again\nin Evansville made it very clear that a wharf boat, which\non occasion was taken out. Once a year, I think the\nevidence is, they would take it out and move it back. But\nit was affixed to the land. It had its telephone. It had\nits sewage. It had all connections to the land. And this\nCourt again used 1 U.S.C. 3, but did say that it wasn't\npractically capable of performing.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that what we would say\nabout all these gambling casino boats that are parked on\nthe side of the Mississippi River?\nMR. KAPLAN: Your Honor, these are a problematic\ncase, and the whole thing is determined on whether or not\nit's in navigation. If a vessel is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's your answer? There\nare lots of these gambling boats that are parked --\nMR. KAPLAN: If the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- along the side of the\nriver.\nMR. KAPLAN: If the gambling boat has lost its\nability to be in navigation, if it's affixed to the land,\nif it has connections to the land, if it doesn't expect to\ngo into navigation, it is out of navigation. It's owner\nhas taken that vessel from a navigable vessel into out of\nnavigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then what is the standard\nyou use, the definition to use to get to that result? Is\nthis your practically point again?\nMR. KAPLAN: Say that again, please.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You've given us the answer.\nWhat's the standard that you use to get to that answer?\nDo you go back to the definition that it -- it cannot\npracticably be used?\nMR. KAPLAN: Well, the standard that I'm seeking\nto have the Court employ is 1 U.S.C., section 3, which\nsays, any -- a vessel is any watercraft or other\nartificial contrivance used, or capable of being used --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then -- and then the\nriverboat -- it depends on how -- how permanently it's\naffixed to the land. Suppose it stays there for 10 years.\nIt -- it can go anytime, but it stays there for 10 years.\nMR. KAPLAN: If in fact it stays there for 10\nyears and it does not move, that's evidence that the owner\nintended that vessel to lose its position in navigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's an intent component\nto your test now?\nMR. KAPLAN: There -- there -- technically one\ncould say break the bonds that hold it to the dock and\nthen take it out and use it because once a vessel, always\na vessel? The answer is no. According to this Court,\nthis Court said --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kaplan?\nMR. KAPLAN: -- when it's not practically\ncapable of doing it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kaplan, you said two\nthings and I -- I'm wondering whether these are separate or\nthey're really one concept. I thought your answer was\ngoing to be to the boat that is used as a diner or to the\ncasino that's tied up to the land, that it's not in\nnavigation. It may satisfy the 1 U.S.C. definition of\nvessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by\nthe Jones Act. So I thought that's what you would --\nsomething that's taken out of navigation would not qualify.\nMR. KAPLAN: The answer is no. It -- it does\nnot qualify if it's removed from navigation. Once the\nvessel is taken out of navigation, as in Justice Scalia's\nsituation where that vessel is on the land, it is being\nused as a completely different --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say it is a vessel. I\nthought your answer before was that it was not a vessel\nbecause it's not practically capable of being used.\nMR. KAPLAN: I say it's not a vessel. It's out\nof navigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I like Justice Ginsburg's\nanswer better.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is a vessel but it's not in\nnavigation. Then you could stick with the -- with the\nsection 3 definition. It's capable of being used, so it's\na vessel, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then the question is\nwhether or not it's in navigation at the time of the\naccident.\nMR. KAPLAN: And that only applies --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and that is a rule\nthat, I take it, you do not wish us to adopt, or maybe you\ndo.\nMR. KAPLAN: I'm trying to establish that if\nit's in navigation, then it is a vessel. If the owner of\nthat vessel removed it from any chance of navigation, made\nit a different kind of a vessel, it is no longer in\nnavigation. It remains a vessel, but it's not a vessel in\nnavigation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but doesn't -- doesn't that\nput you right back in the problem, the original problem,\nwith -- with the riverboat? If all it is is tied up, it\nisn't permanently taken out of navigation. It isn't\nprecluded. All they've got to do is cast the lines off\nand it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the\nvessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.\nMR. KAPLAN: Justice Souter, if on that\nsituation where all they have to do is cast the lines off\nand go out to sea, then of course it remains a vessel, and\nit remains in navigation. And it is -- it fits all the\nelements of the requirements. But if that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying -- and I -- I\ndon't mean to disagree with you. You're saying, yes,\nthere are going to be a few tough results under this\ndefinition.\nMR. KAPLAN: There may be, but there's got to be\nsome practically capable influence that this Court has\nalready focused on to say whether that particular vessel\nis practically capable of being in navigation. If it's\nout of navigation, it's never going to be back in\nnavigation, and there's nothing more that's going to\nhappen to that as a vessel, then of course it's no longer\na vessel that would qualify.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what is -- I see the\nFirst Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question\nyou're raising, which is I think difficult.\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it seems to me fine,\nlet section 3 apply. No problem so far with me. But that\nis so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my\ngarage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's\ncapable of being used in navigation, if worst came to\nworst. And now you're trying to narrow it to get out of\nthat absurd result. Well, so did the First Circuit.\nThat's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up\nin it.\nBut that's -- so -- so what -- that's why I\nthink we're struggling with the words, and -- and perhaps\npractically -- if you mean by practically that it is not\npractically capable of navigation, even though it really\nis, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long,\nlong time and has connections to the land like Jimmy's\nHarborside probably or -- or --\nMR. KAPLAN: Like the establishments from the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. KAPLAN: -- pier 4, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, or one like that.\nBut is -- are those the words? Do we need some\nother words as well? We say practically capable but\npractically capable has a technical meaning here that it\nmeans if there's a close to permanent connection to the\nland, it doesn't apply?\nMR. KAPLAN: Justice Breyer, we're talking\nprimarily of Jones Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KAPLAN: Jones Act requires a relationship\nbetween the worker and the vessel. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So could we say -- could we say\nthat, as well, it must be unlike my garage door? A, it\nmust be a -- a structure that normally would have a crew\nor that -- a significant amount of the time. We would\nhave a connection to the water. It would be capable of\nhaving a master or crew. What about that?\nMR. KAPLAN: This Court has already\nestablished --\nMR. KAPLAN: -- what the standards are for Jones\nAct, whether a person qualifies. There are filters\nbetween whether a person is a Jones Act seaman or not.\nFor example, there has to be a vessel. There has to be a\nvessel in navigation. There has to be a economic\nrelationship between the worker and his vessel and he has\nto contribute towards the mission or to the function of\nthat vessel. He has to, more importantly, have a\nsubstantial relationship to his vessel, both with respect\nto duration and with respect to nature.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you say the function of\nthe vessel, do you mean the function of the vessel in its\ntransportation function?\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that would be the answer to\nthe riverboat problem. You'd say sure, if the -- if the\nriverboat is capable simply of being let go in the water\nby casting off lines, the riverboat is a vessel. But you\ndon't have to worry about turning all the -- the croupiers\nand the waiters into seamen because they're not\ncontributing to the transportation function of the vessel.\nMR. KAPLAN: Precisely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, is that the way out of\nthe problem?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Precisely? So then the --\nMR. KAPLAN: There is a safeguard between the\nvessel and whether a person qualifies as a Jones Act\nseaman on that vessel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you think that the\nperson who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating\nthe vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?\nMR. KAPLAN: Oh, I do not. I do not, indeed. I\nsay --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You do not what? Do not think\nhe's covered by the Jones Act?\nMR. KAPLAN: I say he's covered by the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is covered. Well, then why\nisn't the croupier covered?\nMR. KAPLAN: Why isn't what?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't the croupier covered,\nyou know?\nMR. KAPLAN: Is the croupier contributing to the\nfunction of the vessel?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That vessel's function is\ngambling. He sure is.\nMR. KAPLAN: It is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does -- look, does the -- does\nthe person in charge of the dredge control this process of\npulling against anchor lines that moves it 8 feet or\nwhatever it is?\nMR. KAPLAN: The manner in which the dredge --\nthis dredge worked -- by the way --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if you can give me a\nyes or no answer, give me a yes or no answer.\nMR. KAPLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KAPLAN: That man controls not only --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that's why he's different\nfrom the croupier then, isn't he?\nMR. KAPLAN: The croupier does not control\nthe motion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, and the -- the guy in\ncharge of the dredge does control the movement of it.\nMR. KAPLAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if you have a very\ncomplicated dredge and it takes two people? One of them\ndoes nothing but -- but operate the steam shovel that\npulls up the goop and puts it in the -- in the barges.\nOkay? And the other one moves the dredge. You say the\none is -- is covered by the Jones Act and the other one\nisn't? No, it can't be. If the function of the vessel is\ndredging, anybody who is performing that function of\ndredging is covered by the Jones Act. Don't you believe\nthat?\nMR. KAPLAN: I do believe that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you do. So the\ncroupier is --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what do you -- then what\ndo you do with the croupier? You can't have it both ways.\nMR. KAPLAN: Well, if the croupier is\nparticipating in the navigation of the vessel, we don't\ncare anymore.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He's not participating in the\nnavigation of the vessel.\nMR. KAPLAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He's doing whatever croupiers\ndo. I don't know.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --\nMR. KAPLAN: They don't hand me any money, I'll\ntell you.\nWhat I'm trying to establish here is that there\nreally is a distinction between the law applicable to\nwhether or not there is a vessel, and I'm suggesting that\n1 U.S.C. clearly describes what a vessel is and should be\nfor Jones Act purposes.\nThe second part of the issue is whether or not\nthe individual qualifies and is warranted to have the\nJones Act coverage. So as to the vessel -- as to this\ncoverage, we know, through Wilander and through Chandris,\nthis Court has established some very sensible and good\nstandards by which a person can or cannot be a -- a Jones\nAct seaman.\nNow the only thing that's necessary is we have\nto round the circle up to determine what is a vessel for\nJones Act purposes. 1 U.S.C. seems to satisfy it.\nIt's important to note that in this particular\ncase this is a Coast Guard-certified, inspected vessel.\nThis vessel is -- carries -- it has a 1290 ton itself and\nit carries cargo of 466 ton. It is -- it has navigation\nlights. It has to be ballasted. It has to be load-lined.\nWhen it goes to work, the way in which it moves is as\nfollows. The tugs take the anchors out 50 feet. Now, as\nthe operator is using that bucket to dump into the scows,\nhe's also handling the -- the vessel is also moving\nthrough its own deck winches. They spool up on their own\nwinches. So in addition to where he's digging, they're\nalso moving so that instead of just digging a hole,\nthey're digging the trench.\nSo under all the circumstances, this Super\nScoop, because it has a crew, a captain and a crew of 10,\nbecause they have to wear lifesaving devices, because they\nhave a -- a standby vessel for safety purposes right there\nby order of the Coast Guard, because it is exposed to all\nthe weather and navigation problems that exist in the --\nin Boston Harbor, because the risks are inherent in this\nkind of work, this man qualifies as not only a vessel but\nas a Jones Act seaman.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the scow a vessel too?\nMR. KAPLAN: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The scow. The --\nMR. KAPLAN: Oh, the scow.\nMR. KAPLAN: Well, what happened in this one, if\nYour Honor pleases, is when -- this was a collision at sea.\nClient was aboard the scow when it collided with the Super\nScoop and he was tossed down a 10-foot --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know the circumstances of\nthe accident. And you're -- you're discussing whether\nSuper Scoop was a vessel. I'm asking if the scow where\nthe injury occurred is a vessel.\nMR. KAPLAN: Oh, indeed. The scow is -- is what\nthey put the fill in, and as differentiated from a barge,\na scow has the ability to open up its bottom to let all\nthe fill out when they get out to sea.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you haven't told us\nwhether you think it was a vessel or not.\nMR. KAPLAN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was -- was it a vessel?\nMR. KAPLAN: The scow is a vessel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The scow was.\nMR. KAPLAN: The scow is absolutely a vessel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, that's not even close.\nMR. KAPLAN: Not even --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it carries all this\ngoop somewhere else to -- to dump it. Right?\nMR. KAPLAN: They had to move from here to\nsomewhere else. That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then explain to me why --\nMR. KAPLAN: So did the Super -- sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why it wasn't the vessel\nthat counts. If it's a vessel and it is in fact the place\nwhere he was injured and it was moving, it -- that would\nbe an easy case, but somehow you have to deal with the\nSuper Scoop, and I'm wondering why.\nMR. KAPLAN: Well, the Super Scoop was not\nmoving at that moment, but the scow was moving --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't you just say\nthe scow was a vessel? End of case. The scow was a\nvessel. It was moving. That's where he was injured.\nMR. KAPLAN: I would take that, Your Honor, but\nI would like to extend it to get a status -- a statement\nfrom this Court so that we can remove the indecisions, the\nsilly tests that the lower courts have been creating for\nwhat is a vessel and what is not a vessel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Kaplan. Thank\nyou. Your time is up.\nMR. KAPLAN: Oh, my. Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nJustice Ginsburg, I take it the reason that the\nscow was not relied on is because the petitioner worked\n99.9 percent of his time on the Super Scoop and petitioner\nnever made the argument that he had a connection to the\nscow.\nBut this case, the dredge, the Super Scoop, was\na vessel in navigation and it's an easy case under both\nstandards because it remained in service as a means of\ncarrying its workers and equipment as it moved along the\nBoston Harbor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think we need to use\nthe word practical or practically in section 3?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. I mean, you've -- you've read\nit in into Evansville and Cope, the -- the dry-dock case,\nbut it's -- it's basically referring to any mobile\nwatercraft that is practically capable of moving either\ncargo or people.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that reading anything\nin? I mean, do -- do you think if -- if you were not\npractically capable, you would be capable?\nMS. BLATT: I don't -- I don't think it much --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't regard that as a\nreading in at all. I mean, capable means capable. You're\neither capable or not. If you practically can't be moved,\nyour're not capable.\nMS. BLATT: That's fine, and I think -- like I\nsaid, this is an easy case. If I could address some of the\n-- the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why is this an easy\ncase? Because, after all, the First Circuit is struggling\nwith the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use\nsection 3. That's fine. But you know that the garage\ndoor is not a vessel, and you also know that Jimmy's\nHarborside is not a vessel. And you also know that\nJustice Scalia's beached scow or something is not a\nvessel. And I take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied\nup for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and\none day they take it out to sea and -- because they want\nto move it across the harbor. I guess that isn't a\nvessel. Is it? Or maybe it is. So why is this so easy?\nBecause the First Circuit --\nMS. BLATT: Justice Breyer, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- tries to make those\ndistinctions.\nMS. BLATT: Right. The -- I respectfully\ndisagree. The First Circuit was way off base. It did not\nuse section 3 of title 1.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's say it's\nwrong about that.\nMS. BLATT: What it did is it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now let's take section 3.\nMS. BLATT: Okay, let's -- okay, let's go from\nthere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And taking section 3, it seems\nto me, we have the same problems.\nMS. BLATT: Let me -- let me answer your\nquestion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'd like to know your\nanswer and you just said to Scalia what I thought --\nJustice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't\nbecause I thought that word practical, as co-counsel\nrecommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get\nrid of a lot of these. Now you're saying no, it doesn't.\nMS. BLATT: I think the -- the -- you look at\nthe physical characteristics and the surrounding\ncircumstances of any type of watercraft, and if it's out\nthere moving, I -- I think that really is an easy case.\nWhat I think is bothering -- what was bothering the First\nCircuit is that this vessel clearly had a stationary\npurpose. It had two essential and indispensable purposes,\none of which was stationary and one of which was a mobile\nbarge.\nThe types of cases that raise problems under 1\nU.S.C. 3 is you have things that meet the definition of\nvessel. The Coast Guard regulates them as vessels, but if\nthey have no function to transport people or things -- and\nthe best example is our country's battleships. They're\nbasically retired vessels. They're museums. And there\nare some casino boats that function the same way. They\nhave no transportation function. They've been withdrawn\nfrom navigation.\nIf you want a legal standard for what in\nnavigation is it's this. It's what the Court said in\nChandris, which is it's the status of the ship, and that\nmeans does it have some -- is it still servicing as a\nship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that goes to in\nnavigation --\nMS. BLATT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not to whether it's a vessel\nor not. It is still a vessel even if it's beached up on\nland so long as it is capable of -- of floating. It's\njust not in navigation, isn't it?\nMS. BLATT: I agree. The only types of cases\nwhere a vessel would lose its status as a vessel if it's\nbeen basically -- there -- there are basically two kinds\nof cases where the casino boats or the museums or hotels\nhave lost their status. And there are basically -- there\nare two examples. They're boats in a moat. They've been\nbasically landlocked in through concrete or landfilled and\nthey can't go anywhere. And the other one that's --\nthat's equally as common is pipes and stuff have been\ndriven through the hull of the ship, and they're not\npractically capable of transporting anything. They'd have\nto be overhauled.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your -- your view of the word\nin navigation does all the work here. And so a -- a\nconcert ship, which exists, which say is docked at a dock\nfor, let's say, 300 days of the year or maybe 360, and\nthose other 5 days they -- they move it from one town to\nthe next town where it stays for another 4 months, that is\nin navigation or not?\nMS. BLATT: We think it's in navigation. If you\nhave a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then --\nMS. BLATT: If it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the concert master and the\n-- the -- all the orchestra players and everyone else are\ncovered by the Jones Act even though, by the way, none of\nthem has ever moved whatsoever.\nMS. BLATT: No, no. That's not correct. It\njust means it might be a vessel in navigation. You have\ncruise ships, military ships, pleasure crafts that sit all\nthe time, some for years, but they're still ready for\nanother voyage when and if they're needed. Those are\nstill in navigation. Now, if you have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's so, that's --\nMS. BLATT: I'm going to answer your question on\nthe seaman. If you've got a worker that never goes to sea\non a vessel in navigation, the place to deal with that is\nnot by saying it's not a vessel or not that it's not in\nnavigation. But this Court emphasized in the Harbor Tug\nand Barge case, as well as the Chandris case, that there\nhas to be a substantial connection not only in duration\nbut also with respect to nature. And the Court in Harbor\nTug said that -- that inquiry will concentrate on whether\nthe employee's duties take him to sea.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In the case of the steam\nshovel operator on the dredge, do we say that -- that he\ncontributes toward that function because it can't move\nunless he dredges first, so that the -- the whole object\nof moving across the harbor to dredge includes the -- the\ndredging part?\nMS. BLATT: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the way we do it?\nMS. BLATT: There's -- there's a decision in\nMcDermott v. Wilander that expressly holds that the worker\nneed not aid in the navigation of the ship.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.\nMS. BLATT: Bartenders, croupiers, waitresses,\net cetera on cruise ships are all seamen. That's just the\nholding of McDermott v. Wilander.\nNow, there's still a separate question of\nwhether they're exposed to the perils of sea.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So as long as -- as long as\nsomebody is -- is engaged in a navigation --\nMS. BLATT: In the ship's work --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- function, everybody else\ncomes --\nMS. BLATT: -- whether that work is gambling\nor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But now we have, in my concert\nship, the concert master and the whole orchestra covered\nby the Jones Act even if none of them, by the way, has\never been even to sea on that day when -- they take the\ntrain.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I just said that they may not\nbe covered, but they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. BLATT: They may not be covered --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. BLATT: They may not be covered if they fail\nthe last requirement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it says --\nMS. BLATT: -- of Chandris.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in terms of both its\nduration and its nature, i.e., a connection to a vessel --\nMS. BLATT: Vessel in navigation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in navigation.\nMS. BLATT: Right, and I -- Harbor Tug v. Barge,\nwhich is a later opinion, explains that that test will\nlook at whether the employee's duties take him or her to\nsea.\nNow, in this case the dredges operate not only\n-- only on the water, but they're out there usually away\nfrom shore and are engaged in regular movement over\nnavigable waters. And the workers on that dredge, such as\npetitioner, are subject to the traditional perils of\nnavigation which include not only collision with ships,\nbut even capsizing.\nBarges such as dredges are particularly\nsusceptible to capsizing because their distance between\nthe deck of the barge and the water, which is known as the\nfreeboard, is low. In this case it was only 5 feet, and\nthey have a high center of gravity because of those\nderricks or cranes that are holding the bucket ship. And\nif it's operating in poor weather or for some reason it's\noverloaded, they can tip over and you have a marine\nincident or even casualties. And this worker was exposed\nto the perils of navigation like other traditional seamen.\nAnd this Court -- we think it's pretty telling\nthat the Court basically in two decisions has resolved\nthis case. You have already used 1 U.S.C. 3 in the Norton\ncase in defining what is a vessel for purposes of the\nseamen exclusion in the Longshore Act. And then in the\nEllis decision, this Court has already held that a dredge,\nincluding the scows that were accompanying that dredge,\nwere vessels for purposes of 1 U.S.C. 3 and that the\nworkers were seamen and that they were basically called\nupon to perform the duties, more or less, of ordinary\nseamen. And every other court that had looked at the\nissue and passed on it had equally held that dredges were\nvessels for a variety of maritime purposes. That was\nseamen's liens, limitation of liability, and -- and the\novertime -- overtime laws in the Ellis case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Blatt, the -- there was a\nbrief filed by Signal I think that argues that a Jones Act\nvessel has to provide food, care and lodging to be\ncovered.\nMS. BLATT: Right. With due respect to the\nauthor, I think that approach is novel, it's radical, and\nit's unsubstantiated. Never has the definition of vessel\nturned on whether the watercraft has sleeping quarters.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there problems in\ncomputing maintenance and cure in a case like this one?\nMS. BLATT: It's usually governed by the\ncollective bargaining agreement. I think it's something\nlike $40 a day, and this petitioner was a union laborer.\nAnd it's -- it's usually governed --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it were just left\nup to the law. Are there problems in computing what cure\nand maintenance --\nMS. BLATT: There used to be, but in -- there\nused to be a debate, which I think most of the cases the\nSignal brief is relying on, in how long maintenance and\ncure goes for and it was a rather kind of arcane, tricky\nthing, but basically this Court resolved it in 1930. It\ngoes to maximum cure, until the seamen can no longer be\ncured. And there used to be a debate about should it just\ngo to the extent of the wage contract or to some longer\npoint, and the Court resolved that.\nBut there is no case that has ever even\ndiscussed the fact that a vessel turns on whether it has\nsleeping quarters. And we think that brief is also\nfatally undermined by the decision in Ellis and all the --\ndecision in Ellis already holding that vessels -- or the\nworkers were seamen, and there was never been a discussion\nin those dredge cases about whether they had sleeping\nquarters. Several of those cases -- the most oft-cited\none is that Saylor v. Taylor case out of the Fourth\nCircuit, was a maritime lien case, and those are exactly\nthe type of workers that this Court in McDermott said were\nseamen who were intended to be covered under the Jones\nAct.\nIf there are no questions, we would ask that the\nFirst Circuit's decision be reversed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Connelly.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK E. CONNELLY, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CONNELLY: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court in Chandris and in Harbor Tug stated\nthat the basic point of trying to be reached is to separate\nlien-based\nemployees from sea-based employees. This Court also\nstated that was Congress' goal in passing the Jones Act.\nThe Court wrote: the Jones Act remedy is reserved for\nemployees whose work regularly exposes them to the special\nhazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to the\nsea in ships are subjected. The First Circuit's ruling is\nmuch more likely to get to that result. The goal that\nthis Court stated was Congress' goal then is section --\nexcuse me -- 1 U.S.C., section 3.\nJustice O'Connor, your first question had to do\nwith the casino boats, and that is a point that I was\ngoing to raise. Those casino boats are traditional\nvessels plying the rivers and used mostly in the Midwest\nand -- and the Great Lakes. Those States have recently\nover the last 3 or 4 years changed their law. The law had\nbeen that they had to go up to -- out into navigation.\nThey've now changed them and said, no, you must stay\ndockside. All they are is tied up dockside. They can be\nuntied and moved out at any time.\nThe cases that -- and you're probably going to\nhave some before you -- are dealing with dealers and\nwaiters and waitresses who go aboard the casino boat and\nmaybe fall down in the kitchen or something and are\ninjured. They have never been on the boat while it was\nmoved and it hasn't moved for the last several years.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that might affect the\ndecision of whether they are seamen covered under the\nJones Act. It might still be a vessel.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there may be other\naspects of the test that aren't met --\nMR. CONNELLY: But breaking it down --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- when the thing is tied up.\nMR. CONNELLY: Breaking it down, Your Honor, if\nthe petitioner has his way, those tests are met. The\nfirst test is whether it's a vessel. It is a vessel.\nSecond test, whether it's in navigation. The Government\nhas just told you, and it states in its brief, any vessel\nthat had any transportation purpose at all that is still\nnot -- unless it's mothballed -- and I think they said\ntoday either pipes driven through it or in cement -- is a\nvessel in navigation. So it is a vessel in navigation.\nWe know that the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I think it might be a vessel,\nbut probably not in navigation while it's tied up or in\nmothballs.\nMR. CONNELLY: Again, Your Honor, all it is is\ntied to the pier. The Government has taken the position,\nas has petitioner, in their briefs and here today that\nit's still in navigation if it can be used.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think what the\nGovernment has said is that though it's in navigation, we\nhave a case that says that the -- that the seaman's\nconnection to the ship has to be related to the\nfunctioning of the ship in navigation. He doesn't have to\nnavigate it, but he has to be working at what the ship\ndoes in the course of its navigation, and a dredge\noperator does that.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, I don't think a dredge\noperator does that any more than the waiter on the casino.\nThe dredge operator -- the dredge is there to do\nconstruction work. It is there to dredge. The casino is\nthere to have people gamble and serve them drinks.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't that the\npoint? The dredge is there necessarily to move. The\ncasino is not there necessarily to move.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, it is our position -- and\nas shared by some of the First Circuit -- that the\nmovement of the dredge was incidental. Once --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Should we clarify that?\nBecause I don't -- I didn't read the case saying what\nJustice Scalia just said or what you -- what it says is\nthat a seaman must have a connection to a substantial --\nin terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in\nnavigation.\nMR. CONNELLY: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Obviously, a croupier has such\na connection.\nMR. CONNELLY: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say anything about\nbeing connected to the navigating part.\nMR. CONNELLY: That's correct, and this Court\nhandled that in Wilander, Your Honor, that it said in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not to the navigating part but\nto what the vessel is doing in the course of its being in\nnavigation.\nMR. CONNELLY: If the term, Your Honor, in\nnavigation, had the bite that I think it should have, then\nwe may not be here today at all. The First Circuit was\nactually looking at the actual transportation function,\nassuming that it had to be into navigation. What the --\nwhat the petitioner wants is 1 U.S.C., section 3 which\nlooks at theoretical transportation, a mere capability.\nAnd Your Honor, I understand what you said,\nJustice Scalia, that to you, they're the same, practical\ncapability or capability. But to the petitioner and the\nGovernment, they are far different. In both of their\nbriefs, they have said that without the Evansville change\nin the language of the statute which adds practical\ncapability, both have agreed that it is overly inclusive a\nstatute, 1 U.S.C., section 3. It includes everything and\nincluding Justice Breyer's garage door.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But as Mr. Kaplan pointed\nout, all -- the fact that something is a vessel doesn't\nmean there's Jones Act coverage, and I think Mr. Kaplan\nwas getting to the perils of the sea. Someone who's\nworking on a boat that is not in the water day in and day\nout is never exposed to the perils of the sea.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, the perils of\nthe sea, which this Court discussed at length in the Papai\ncase, we -- we say that -- that is further evidence that\nMr. Stewart is not entitled to Jones Act remedies. Mr.\nStewart was on a construction site. It happened to be a\nwork platform in site of land. He was never more than 500\nyards off the coast. The dangers that he was up against\nwere more akin to that of a construction worker or, at the\nvery least, a harbor worker or a stevedore. They were not\nthe same perils that are normally faced by a true seaman.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One peril was a collision\nwith another vessel, and that's exactly what happened\nhere.\nMR. CONNELLY: We disagree with that, Your\nHonor. This was a situation where the Super Scoop was --\nwas moored. It was anchored and stationary, again as a\nstationary work platform. The scow was just being brought\nfrom one side to the other alongside -- attached to it at\nall time by -- by cables and by the crane. The -- the --\nhe got jostled and he fell. No different than harbor\nworkers and stevedores face everyday when they're\nunloading ships and working on harbors.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there had been --\nsuppose there had been very rough water --\nMR. CONNELLY: They would have sent everyone\nhome.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and -- and the crane\noperator was the -- was operating it and the water came\nover the freeboard and it capsized. That's -- that would\nbe the perils of the sea, wouldn't it?\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, because we are in the\nprotected harbors of the -- of Boston Harbor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. This is my -- this is a\nspecial day in Boston --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which -- which they have --\nMR. CONNELLY: That happened a week ago.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- every 86 years or\nsomething.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It happens every -- every 86\nyears they have one of these storms.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CONNELLY: Your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So far.\nMR. CONNELLY: Your Honor, I think in that -- in\nthat -- using your hypothetical, it's a construction\nplatform right off the coast. They'd send everyone home.\nIf there was any trouble with the sea, the -- the greatest\nperils that are discussed in the petitioner's brief -- and\nthey list them all -- one of them is isolation and far\naway from home and far from aid. Those don't apply to Mr.\nStewart. Mr. Stewart would be sent home if there was too\nmuch -- the weather got bad. He would be sent home in a\n-- in a minute or 2. He lived right in Boston. He was in\nthe middle of a large city. There was no major danger of\nisolation. That -- the Super Scoop was inspected\nregularly by the State, Federal, and Government officials\nand by the general contractor on the job. There was no\nisolation. All of the perils that have been listed by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and by the Coast Guard.\nMR. CONNELLY: The Coast Guard also. I'm not\nsure they went out on a regular basis, but they did\ninspect the -- the Super Scoop at -- at some point.\nThere's no question about that.\nThis Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're not contending that\nanything that happens in a harbor is not exposed to the\nperils of the sea, are you?\nMR. CONNELLY: Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor.\nThis Court in Cope and earlier cases has long equated a\nvessel with transportation. That's what the First Circuit\ndid. They -- they needed a bright line. They chose a\nbright line, and the bright line was transportation. Is\nthe structure primarily engaged in transportation or\ncommerce? And navigation, transportation, and commerce\nare all intermixed, and -- and the definitions include\neach other. And they found that it was not primarily\nengaged in transportation. It was primarily a work\nplatform doing construction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do you -- how can you\npossibly describe as a bright line test anything that says\nyou have to identify the primary function? Plus, even if\nit's not its primary function, if it happens to be moving\nat the time of the accident, then there's coverage. That\ndoesn't seem to me very bright line.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, what it is, I\nbelieve, is a bright line test with an exception. And the\nStewart case talked about the DiGiovanni exception, which\nfalls very closely to -- to what Justice Stevens wrote in\nhis concurring opinion in the Chandris case, that it is\nunfair that somebody who was actually injured while a -- a\nvessel or -- or structure is in actual navigation does not\nget at least a second bite at the apple and that that\nperson cannot be -- said to be a Jones Act seaman.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the identical\naccident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the\nvessel isn't moving.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, at no time\nduring the 1 and a half years that Mr. Stewart was in the\nharbor, as far as we know from the record, was the Super\nScoop in transportation. The incidental movement of -- of\npulling forward a few feet with its anchors is not\nnavigation or transport -- transportation. The First\nCircuit stated that the movement of the scow was both\nimmaterial because, as the Government has already\nadmitted, he wasn't tied to the scow. His -- his time was\nspent on the Super Scoop, but also incidental, Your Honor,\nbecause it was just slight movement along the site. It\nwasn't transportation or navigation.\nAt no point -- and -- and the petitioner has put\ntheir spin on this that -- stating that Mr. Stewart every\nday he was out there moved in and out of coverage. That's\nnot true. He was never in Jones Act coverage.\nAnd Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I guess I could agree with\nyou if -- if I believed that I had to look to the primary\npurpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was\ntransportation. But what -- what do you do about gambling\nships that, you know, they -- they sail out beyond the 2-\nmile limit and then come right back to where they left?\nNow, people get on board not to get transported. They get\non board to gamble. And the purpose of the ship, the\nprimary purpose of the ship, is gambling. You think that\n-- that -- the -- the seamen who -- who are on that ship,\nwhich regularly goes out beyond the 2-mile limit, you\nthink that they're -- that they're not covered by the\nJones Act?\nMR. CONNELLY: I think in that situation, Your\nHonor, it's -- it's a closer call, that they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's close at\nall. I think they're obviously covered by the Jones Act.\nMR. CONNELLY: That is a traditional trip --\nship and those people are engaged in a form of\ntransport --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that's not the\nprimary purpose of -- of the ship, just as the primary\npurpose of this scow is -- of -- of this dredge is not\ntransportation.\nMR. CONNELLY: In that situation, Your Honor, it\nwould be -- it would be a primary purpose, though, that\ntransporting the people who happen to be gambling --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, a primary purpose? Now,\nyou're getting a little fuzzy there. I thought you said\nthe primary purpose.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, in the First Circuit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be a primary purpose.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, in the Manuel court, the\nFifth Circuit actually uses the term, a primary purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A. Oh.\nMR. CONNELLY: And -- and I think -- and to a\ndegree that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that's not fuzzy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CONNELLY: It's an -- it's an oxymoron, Your\nHonor.\nBut what -- what the First Circuit was doing in\n-- in the Stewart case is -- is similar to what this Court\ndid in Chandris. It was looking at a temporal view. A\nworker -- and the temporal view used by this Court in\nChandris was looking at what the worker was doing. What\nwere his duties? He isn't going to be denied Jones Act\ncoverage because he happened to be an office worker 2\nmonths before if his duties had changed and he was now a\nJones Act seaman, nor if he fell in the office, after he\nhad been reassigned to the office, was he going to gain\nJones Act seaman status just because he spent the last 2\nyears on the vessel.\nThat is what the First Circuit has done in terms\nof the vessel as well, not just the work but in terms of\nthe vessel. Do not look at what this vessel did in the\npast. Do not look at what it did -- might do in the -- in\nthe future. It's transportation from California through\nthe Panama Canal up the east coast is immaterial. You\nshould look at the worker who is claiming Jones Act\nstatus, his relationship to the structure and what the\nstructure's purpose was and business was during that\nrelationship. During the 1 and a half years that he was\nassociated with it, it wasn't transporting anything. It\nwas used as a -- a work platform only, only a structure,\nand it wasn't transporting anything during that time.\nThe same thing with the casino boats, these\nindividuals who go upon the casinos as a waitress and are\nnever -- never leave the port, never leave the dock\nshouldn't be entitled to the special protections of the\nJones Act. They face none of the perils of -- of the sea\nor of -- of perils of -- of navigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a difference to this\nextent, would you agree, that something that's just tied\nup to the dock and never moves is different from something\nthat is actually in the water and whether you call it\ntransportation, it is moving? It has to move to engage in\nthe construction of this tunnel.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, this Court has\ndecided, I believe it was in Chandris, that a -- a seaman\ndoesn't lose his seaman status just because the vessel\nhe's assigned to is now in -- in port. They wanted --\nthey didn't want a person to go in and out too many --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm just -- let's focus\non what is a vessel because someone -- it may be a vessel\nbut the injured person may not be a seaman. Those are two\ndifferent things. This is only the first step. So when\nyou're bringing in what the worker does, whether it's a\ncroupier or whatever, the only question that we are\nconsidering is, is this dredge a vessel? We're not\ninvolved with the question of whether the worker is a\nseaman unless we pass that basic threshold.\nMR. CONNELLY: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nof course, the ultimate issue the Court is trying to\narrive at is whether or not Mr. Stewart is a Jones Act\nseaman. And this Court has held for him to be a Jones Act\nseaman, it must be a vessel in navigation. I don't think\nthat that can be separated, that just looking at a vessel.\n1 U.S.C., section 3, which the petitioner wishes, of\ncourse, everything -- everything that floats that is\ncapable of transportation is -- is a vessel. The First\nCircuit has -- has used a much more narrow definition but\nfocusing on the purpose and primary use of the structure\nbecause it is trying to get to where this Court was trying\nto get. Is it a vessel in navigation?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it the vessel\nthat's the problem? Why -- why do you focus on the\nvessel? It seems to me most of your argument has gone to\nwhether it's in navigation. Can you be a vessel that is\nnot in navigation?\nMR. CONNELLY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you can or you\nwouldn't have the -- the combination of the two terms\nappearing anywhere. So why isn't the problem here not\nwhether it's a vessel but whether it's in navigation?\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, again, Your Honor, if -- if\nin navigation means what it should mean, which is an\ninstrument for transportation or commerce over navigable\nwaters, and not simply as the petitioner and the\nGovernment want it to mean that anything that once might\nhave been in navigable waters and stays in navigable\nwaters and isn't mothballed is still in navigation -- if\nit means what it should mean, then that's something I\nthink the First Circuit is -- was trying to get to anyway.\nThey -- they were looking at it in terms of vessel status,\nvessel in navigation versus just in navigation. They --\nthey were trying to get there and that's why they used\nwhat is really a -- a temporal look and looked at what was\nthe business use.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, exactly. And -- and in\nChandris, this Court rejected the snapshot approach to\ndetermining what's a vessel and the First Circuit seemed\nto go back to that. And certainly what the First Circuit\ndid seems in serious tension with this Court's cases. It\njust didn't follow the same line that we had outlined.\nMR. CONNELLY: The First Circuit does -- the\nFirst Circuit rule, Your Honor, in DiGiovanni and Fall and\nStewart does have a snapshot exception.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. CONNELLY: There's the main rule which has a\nbright line --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right, and that was rejected\nby this Court in Chandris. So I -- I think there's a\nproblem here.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, Your Honor, there -- there\nare always -- and this is answering Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion earlier as well. There are always going to be\ndifficult situations where some people, doing the exact\nsame work, using the same equipment on the same structure,\nsome are covered and some are not, a situation where one\nhas the requisite connection 30 or 40 percent to a vessel,\nthe other person doing the same work next to him only has\n10 percent. One is covered.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it might be much\nsimpler to rely on 1 U.S. Code, section 3 and our -- our\ndefinition, as we've described it there, and then deal\nwith other situations within the framework of the\ndefinition of seaman and the other issues that arise. And\nit seems like the First Circuit went backwards from\nChandris back to Giovanni which basically had been\nrejected. So that's the concern.\nMR. CONNELLY: Your Honor, again, I -- I think\nthat if 1 U.S.C., section 3 is adopted, then every vessel\ncapable --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Congress adopted that.\nMR. CONNELLY: Well, I don't -- I don't agree,\nYour Honor. The way -- the way we look at the\ncongressional intent -- this Court has already decided in\n-- in several cases that Congress left it to the Court to\ndecide which persons are -- should be granted Jones Act\nseaman status. This is what the Court has said. Why then\nwould the Congress in -- in the same statutes have sort of\nhandcuffed the Court by saying it's for you to decide\nwho's a Jones Act seaman and who's entitled to those\nspecial protections, but we're going to handcuff you and\n-- and say this is what you have to decide as far as\nvessel is concerned?\n1 U.S.C., section 3 was not followed. I should\nalso point out that the petitioner is a recent convert to\nthis position, and it -- it hasn't been followed in the\ncircuits at all. There isn't a lot of cases out there\nwhere a lot of circuit judges have stated section 3 should\nbe the definition for the Jones Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if you go -- I thought\nvessel -- the word vessel appears in our cases. It\ndoesn't appear in the Jones Act. Am I right or not about\nthat?\nMR. CONNELLY: It does not appear in the Jones\nAct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we have a degree\nof freedom on this. But -- but the -- the question then\nis, is it -- how -- I'm getting the impression from you\nand -- and from the SG that it's rather deeply embedded in\nthe law, if we start reading the Fifth Circuit cases, that\nif we define X as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel\nin navigation, that the cases have said the word in\nnavigation mean nothing, with one exception. The\nexception is if you actually have like a physical cemented\nconnection to the land so they can't escape. Otherwise,\nif it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to\nsea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning. If it's\na vessel, it's a vessel in navigation. If it's my garage\ndoor, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in\nnavigation.\nNow, how accurate is that assumption I'm now\nmaking? What would I read in the law? Is that definition\nof in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really\nembedded in the law?\nMR. CONNELLY: It is pursuant to what -- the\npetitioner and the Government's view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know it is but what is your\nview?\nMR. CONNELLY: My view is that it shouldn't be,\nthat it should have some bite to it. It should mean, as\n-- as I stated before, an instrument of commerce or\ntransportation over navigable waters. But that's not what\nit has come to mean in a lot of the circuits below. It\nhas come to mean something that's just simply in navigable\nwaters no matter how many years it has gone without --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, would it help? Suppose\nwe were to say it was -- had to be capable, at least, of\nhaving a captain and crew?\nMR. CONNELLY: I have never thought of that,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then we better not do anything\nfor the first time.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CONNELLY: Your Honor, I think in that in\nthat situation, there are -- there can be vessels involved\nwith transportation, getting back to the Cope case and\nother cases, where there -- it's -- it's a barge being\ntowed, but it's transporting things. We're not disputing\nthat. I don't think it needs to have a captain and crew\nnecessarily to be a -- considered a vessel in navigation.\nBut you hit the nail on the head, Your Honor,\nand that's -- that's where the First Circuit was befuddled\nin -- in trying to come up with a regional -- reasonable\ntest because they're dealing with this situation where it\nseemed like everything is a vessel in navigation. And\nyet, that doesn't serve Congress' intent of only persons\nwho face the perils of the sea are entitled to the special\nprotections under the Jones Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the word vessel does\nappear in the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation\nAct.\nMR. CONNELLY: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is the -- the only\npurpose of the vessel inquiry that we're involved in is to\n-- to say is this person within one injury compensation\nscheme or another.\nMR. CONNELLY: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now why, in making that\ninquiry, should the courts go off on their own and be\ninventive and come up with a definition when Congress has\ngiven a definition that can be used by default? If\nCongress thinks it should be other than the general\ndefinition they have provided, Congress can also do that.\nBut in the meantime, why should the courts go creating\ndefinitions instead of using the one that's right there in\nthe statute book?\nMR. CONNELLY: Because this Court effectively\noverruled the definition or decided not to use it in the\nEvansville case. It saw in that case that it would not\njust rely on the section 3 language. It would add the\nword practically, practically capable, and -- and not just\ncapable because the Court saw that in Evansville the\nwharf boat, which they determined was not a vessel, even\nthough again not dealing with the Jones Act, it was\ncapable of transportation, but it wasn't practically\ncapable of transportation. So the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the Court then --\nMR. CONNELLY: -- the Court has decided --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just construing --\nMR. CONNELLY: -- not to follow section 3.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just construing instead of\nnot following, but say by capable, Congress must mean\npractically capable.\nMR. CONNELLY: Your Honor -- and I realize that\nis what Justice Scalia said earlier. The position of the\npetitioner, as he stated as he was standing here not too\nmany minutes ago, was that they seek to have the Court\nemploy 1 U.S.C., section 3, not the Evansville change to\nthat section. They -- they see it as quite different and\nit's in both of their briefs, that Evansville did change 1\nU.S.C., section 3. The petitioner's position is that this\nCourt is bound by -- to follow 1 U.S.C., section 3 because\nCongress says so.\nIt is our position that they're not so bound.\nIf you're bound -- if you're not bound, why take a faulty\ndefinition such as section 3 and try to change it a little\nbit? You're -- you're free to as -- as you are, to\ndetermine who is a Jones Act seaman. You're free to\ndetermine what is a vessel in navigation or a vessel\npertaining to the -- the Jones Act.\n1 U.S.C., section 3 was never referenced in the\nLongshore Act. Congress at that time, many years before\nand many years after, has passed many statutes in which\nvessel is defined. Sometimes they reference section 3;\nother times they write in a definition. Sometimes it's\nsimilar to section 3, sometimes quite different. In this\ncase -- for the Longshore Act, they decided to leave it to\nthe courts.\nThe Jones Act was passed in 1920. Its\npredecessor was the Act of 1915. That act did have a\ndefinition of vessel that was very restrictive and\nactually talked about actual navigation. In 1920, the\nMerchant Marine Act was passed and it -- that portion of\nit had a very large definition, which was already\ndiscussed earlier, the Shipping Act definition. The Jones\nAct didn't adopt that one and it didn't adopt the one in\n1915.\nThe -- the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act was\npassed in 1927. Certainly by that point they knew that\nthey had just jettisoned two definitions 7 years before.\nThey chose again to leave it to the courts.\nIn 1972 and again in 1984, there were\nconsiderable amendments that Congress did to the Longshore\nAct. At that time, they certainly knew -- and there's\nalways been heavy -- heavy lobbying going on in Congress\nevery time that they try to touch the Longshore Act or --\nor the Jones Act. They knew by that point in time that\nthe circuits were not using section 3 as the definition\nfor Jones Act vessel. Again, they chose to leave it to\nthe courts. They did not intercede and then reference\nsection 3 or incorporate a definition like it or\nsomething. They again chose not to.\nIn 1920, section 3 was certainly not the only\ndefinition of vessel. Benedict on Admiralty, which this\nCourt has cited several times, which the petitioner has\ncited, had a completely different definition of -- of\nvessel, and that could have been the one that Congress had\nin mind.\nI realize it's always dangerous to mention the\nCongressional Record, but most of the people who spoke in\n1920 and again in -- mainly in 1927 were discussing\ntraditional vessels and vessels on a voyage. If they had\ntrue seamen in mind, they probably had more of a\ntraditional vessel in mind.\nAlso looking at the record, when the House\nwanted to include everybody, all seamen, into the\nLongshore Act, they listed out various structures such as\ndredges and barges. Obviously, a compromise was reached\nwith the Senate, and when the act was passed, they limited\nit, not just seamen and -- and but only to masters and\nmembers of crews of vessels. They limited it to that and\nleft it, of course, to the courts to decide who is\nentitled to the Jones Act status.\nIf I may have a second, Your Honor.\nThe term vessel can and often has had a\ndifferent meaning for the Jones Act, which this Court has\nstated is a vessel in navigation, than it does with the\nLongshore and Harbor Workers Act. In his amicus brief\nfiled on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Hillsman writes\nthat the lower court unanimously -- unanimously -- have\ndecided that the definition of vessel for purposes of the\nLongshore Act is much, much more inclusive than it is for\nthe Jones Act, and it has worked perfectly fine.\nUnder the Longshore Act, most of the persons who\ncollect Longshore benefits only have to show it's a\nmaritime nexus. There's no vessel requirement from almost\nall of the claims under the Longshore Act.\nAnother point I wish to make is that both the\nFirst Circuit and the petitioner talked about a bright\nline test. The First Circuit, though, test is dealing\nwith actual transportation, the actual use in business of\nthe structure during the time that the person who is\nclaiming special status is associated with it.\nMore confusing is dealing with 1 U.S.C., section\n3, which although bright is also very broad and would\ninclude everything. Anything that floats or is capable of\nfloating would be included under that.\nThere are always going to be situations, no\nmatter what definition the Court comes up with -- always\nsituations where a person would have to be covered under\nboth acts, and I realize in the Chandris case, it was the\ngoal of the Court to say we'd like to make it clear as we\n-- we can. We don't want people going in and out of Jones\nAct status.\nHowever, as this Court saw in Gizoni, a perfect\nexample -- in Gizoni, the person was a harbor worker.\nThis Court sent it back to the lower court saying -- the\nlower court had said you're a harbor worker. That's your\nlabel. You're in the harbor workers' union. You're not\nentitled to -- for Jones Act status. This Court said no,\nsend it back, let's take another look. The person,\nalthough a harbor worker, may have had the requisite\nconnections to a vessel in navigation to be able to claim\nJones Act seaman status. Obviously, in that situation,\nwhich is a perfect example, the -- the employer would have\nhad to cover him under the Longshore Act and if -- if the\nlower court changes or -- or the jury decides that he's a\nJones Act seaman, would have had to have covered him under\nthe Jones Act.\nProfessor Schoenbaum has said that the mutual\nexclusivity of the two acts is really in theory only and\nthat there are always cases and will be dealing with the\nbrown water seamen and brown water employees, harbor\nworkers and longshoremen, where they're going to have to\nbe covered under both anyway.\nAgain, the First Circuit test, which does have\nan exception to it, which it clearly is -- is a snapshot,\nagain to give someone another bite at the apple, which\nthis Court thought, at least in the concurring opinion in\nChandris, was a fair result, has that. But the test\nitself is -- is broad. It -- it is a bright line and it\nmakes it clear, as this Court has stated in the past, that\nunless there's a transportation function, it's not a\nvessel in navigation.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Connelly.\n"
