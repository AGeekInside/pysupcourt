Roche Molecular Systems.\nMr. Ayer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. AYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Bayh-Dole Act sets forth a comprehensive\ndisposition of rights in inventions made by nonprofit\norganizations and small business organizations under\nFederal funding agreements. That disposition\nspecifically defines the rights of inventors and it puts\nthem in the third position behind the contractor, the\nnonprofit contractor, and behind the government, and\nspecifically says that the inventor may only receive\nrights -- that is to say, take title -- when the -- when\nthe contractor has declined to take title or defaulted\nin some respect, and the government itself has -- has\nlikewise declined to take title.\nIn this case Roche's sole claim rests on an\nassignment from an inventor who was at that time I think\nwithout question a Stanford employee who was working on\na project under a Federal funding agreement.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the inventor had\nnot been an employee? If it had been an independent\ncontractor who was working in combination with the\nuniversity, how does this automatic vesting -\nMR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, the act deals\nspecifically with independent contractors, and -- the\nregulations at least do. And they indicate that the -\nthat the contractor in that instance, if in fact working\non a Federally funded project, would step into the shoes\nof the contractor. But I don't believe it would affect\nthe outcome in terms of whether it would be a Bayh-Dole\ninvention.\nThe -- the critical fact here is that the\ninventor was working on a project that was already\nfunded, his work at Cetus was part of that project. And\nthen that result was -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That seems to be a\nfactual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that.\nAccording to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this\nscientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal\nfunding; that that Federal funding for this project, the\nStanford project, came about after the scientist had\nspent his 9 months at Cetus. At least that's the\npicture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that\nthey got their assignment from the scientist at a time\nwhen there was no Federally funded project.\nMR. AYER: That's what they say, Your Honor,\nand I would submit that is plainly not correct. We deal\nwith this at pages 21 and 22 of our yellow brief, and we\nspecifically talk about the fact -- there's several\ncritical facts here. One is that the article which was\nwritten about the work at Cetus, the JID article at page\n135 of the joint appendix, specifically has a footnote\nindicating that the work reported on -- that is the work\nat Cetus on the assay -- was funded by the two specific\ngrants in issue.\nDr. Merigan, who is the head of the lab at\nStanford that Dr. Holodniy worked in, talks in his\ndeclaration at 98 and 99 of the joint appendix -\nspecifically talks about how Dr. Holodniy's work was\npart of the AIDS research center at Stanford and part of\nan AIDS clinical trial at Stanford, and all of that work\nwas federally funded.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just -- just as a\nhypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice\nGinsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual\neven before he was employed by Stanford at all, much\nless employed by a Stanford project funded by the\nFederal Government, entered into this kind of an\nagreement with somebody that he had been working for.\nHow -- how would it -\nMR. AYER: Well, I think you have to look\nvery carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak\nloosely and categorically about the facts, but what -\nwhat I will say is that in a situation where -- and this\nis very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work\nis done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set\nof facts, not affiliated with the university, and\nthey -- let's say that person conceives of an invention,\nand that later the university takes that conception of\nan invention and reduces it to practice. The conception\nby a person who is not a university employee, if -- if\nthere's no university person involved in the conception,\nthen it can't be an invention of the contractor, because\nyou can't be an inventor without being part of the\nconception.\nSo that's a variation on Your Honor's -- on\nYour Honor's question, but it's a -- it's a clear\nexample where Bayh-Dole would not apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does that change when\nyou -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was\nalready an employee of Stanford, but was not working as\nan employee of Stanford when he was at this other\ncompany? You could still say that -- that Stanford was\nnot the inventor.\nMR. AYER: Well, you would -- you -- I think\nyou are now in a zone where one of the things that has\nto be considered is the equitable character of any\nassignment of a future interest, that is to say a future\ninvention. Because if in fact what was assigned was, as\nhere, the possibility that there might at some future\ntime be an invention, then equitable considerations come\ninto play; and one of the equitable considerations we\nthink the one that is of paramount significance, is the\nfact that the Congress of the United States has said in\nthe context of Bayh-Dole that when the United States\ninvests money in research, it wants certain things to\nhappen that are very carefully set out in the -- in the\nBayh-Dole Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me, assume\nno Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties\nthat are not involved with the Federal Government.\nInventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor -\ninventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent -\nMR. AYER: Well, it depends what's assigned,\nYour Honor. If -- if B is a bona fide to purchaser\nunder 35 U.S.C. 261, then B would prevail. If B is not\na bona fide purchaser, and that can only apply under\n261, where you are dealing with an assignment in law of\na patent or a patent application, then I think you are\nin the difficult zone where there are two competing\ninterests in the future possibility of an invention; and\nI don't know that I can, without knowing all the facts,\neven intelligently try to tell you what would end up\nhappening.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, if you do\nnot prevail on your principal argument, have you\npreserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was\ncontrary to public policy?\nMR. AYER: I think we have, Your Honor. I\nthink -- essentially I would say, frankly that that\nis -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the court of appeals\ndidn't seem to discuss that.\nMR. AYER: Well, I think that is at the\nheart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the\ngovernment's argument, and it is that, as the trial\ncourt here held, and as we've said in our brief several\ntimes, the inventor, because he is working here at the\ntime of the assignment on a Federally funded project as\nan employee of Stanford University, is essentially\nworking on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being\ncovered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to\ntransfer title to this future invention to someone else\nbecause the statute has already spoken for it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ayer, it seems the\nFederal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the\nscientist saying \"I will assign,\" which was the language\nused in the agreement with Stanford, and \"I hereby do\nassign,\" and it seems that that was critical to the -\nto the Federal Circuit's decision.\nThey say -- they cite a whole bunch of\ncases. The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had\nsaid \"I hereby do assign,\" there would be no case\nbecause Stanford would have been first in time.\nMR. AYER: Well, one interesting thing about\nthat discussion is that the very first case that we know\nanything about, that we're aware of, making that\ndistinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an\nassignment using the words \"I hereby assign,\" was the\nFilmTec case in 1991. That was 2 years after the events\nin this case, so how was Stanford supposed to know that\nthat fine distinction was going to be made?\nWe think the critical -- the critical issue\nhere is whether the inventor, while working on a\nfederally funded project as an employee of the\ncontractor -- and there's no doubt that his work at\nCetus was part of his Stanford research. All you have\nto do is look at pages 16a to 18a of the petition\nappendix for the court of appeals decision or pages 62a\nand 69a for the district court opinion. It's perfectly\nclear that everyone knew he came to Cetus to advance his\nwork on his Stanford research, which was in fact funded,\nas we show at pages 21 and 22. And the Bayh-Dole -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What have universities been\ndoing for the last 30 years? Have they been proceeding\non the assumption that title to inventions vested in\nthem automatically or have they been very careful about\ngetting assignments from all of their employees?\nMR. AYER: Universities, and -- and I think\neverybody engaged in research, is generally careful.\nThey have policies in place to get assignments, and\nthere are lots of reasons why that would be true. It\nwas true before the Bayh-Dole Act. It's a -- it's a\nwise and prudent practice to have an understanding with\nyour employees about who is going to own what.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do those policies ever\ndistinguish between Federally funded projects and\nNon-Federally funded projects?\nMR. AYER: I don't -- I don't know about the\nuniverse of them. I -- I know that the -- that the\nStanford policy in this case relevant at this time was a\npolicy that indicated employees could retain title in\nmany instances, but not where Federal law, applicable\nlaw, says that they can't retain title; and in that\nsense they do.\nBut those policies I think are very\nclearly in virtually every case I know anything about\npolicies that are signed by an employee pretty much the\nday they walk in the door, as I think was the case here\nwith Dr. Holodniy back in 1988. And it's a general\nunderstanding of what the expectations are, and I don't\nwant to here be heard to say at all that we think this\nis an unwise thing or that it isn't a good thing that it\ngoes on. It's a very good thing that it goes on,\nbecause people need to understand what the situation is.\nThe critical issue is whether, in the event\nthat that fails to happen for some reason or that there\nis a slip-up here where a fellow going to visit\nsomewhere on the first day there has something put under\nhis nose called a visitor's confidentiality agreement\nwhich he happens to sign, and down in paragraph 2 it\ntalks about assigning away everything that he ever might\ndo as a consequence of this.\nThe point is that in that situation you\ncan't have the interest of the United States, which is\nthe critical paramount interest in this case -- I want\nto make that very clear. It's the interest in the\nUnited States when it spends millions and billions of\ndollars on research in having that research handled in a\ncertain way, having the fruits of it dealt with in a\ncertain way and having it go where Congress says it\nshould go. Now, the critical -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't you think that\nthe -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in theory -- I\nmean, you're cloaking yourself in the interests of the\nUnited States, but we're going to hear from their lawyer\nshortly.\nMR. AYER: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you ever have\ndifferent arrangements with respect to the assignments\ndepending upon who the researcher is? I mean, I suppose\n-- I would have supposed there are very prominent\nresearchers that you would like to have at Stanford, and\nyou would be willing to negotiate less than a\nrequirement of full assignment of their inventions in\norder to -- to get that person there.\nMR. AYER: I don't know -- I wouldn't tell\nyou categorically -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,\nyou'd be willing -- wouldn't you be willing to sell the\ninterests of the United States down the river to get -\nto advance your interests?\nMR. AYER: Well, we would not, I think, be\nwilling, and I wouldn't think anybody would be willing,\nto break the law. And we would submit that that's\nwhat's going on here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I thought\nthe law meant that the United States got whatever\ninterest the contractor got, right? And if -- it\ndoesn't say what the contractor can or can't do with\nrespect to the employees it has.\nMR. AYER: The statute -- the statute\ndefines a universe of covered cases which are inventions\nof the contractor, which we think the other side uses\nthose words to argue that -- that inventions of the\ncontractor are only the ones the -- the contractor\nalready owns by virtue of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Plus the word \"retained,\"\ndon't forget that, too.\nMR. AYER: Right. Those two provisions are\nessentially their argument for narrowing the universe of\ninventions that is covered.\nAnd I want to just say at the outset, the\ncritical thing about narrowing the universe of\ninventions covered is that it narrows the universe of\ninventions in which the government's rights to, number\none, itself receive title under several provisions of\nthe act; number two, itself to enforce a whole series of\nrequirements under 202(c)(4), (5), (6), (7) and a\nvariety of other provisions, to itself march in and do\nthings.\nWhen you define out of that category\ninstances where inventions exist and were produced with\nFederal money, then you're limiting the coverage of the\ngovernment's interests. But on the two provisions at\nissue, we think clearly they do not mean what the other\nside says they mean. The word \"invention of\" someone is\nconventionally understood, if you hear the light bulb\nwas an invention of Thomas Edison, you don't think\nThomas Edison owns the patent; you think he invented it.\nThe same thing is true. Even though -\nJUSTICE ALITO: There are two things that\ncut very strongly against your argument. I mean, there\nare many things that cut in favor of it, but the two\nthings that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against\nyour argument are: First, that it has long been the\nrule that inventors have title to their patents\ninitially, even if they make those inventions while\nworking for somebody else.\nAnd the second is that you are relying on a\nprovision that says that the nonprofit organization may\nelect to retain title, which means hold onto a title,\nthat the -- the organization already has. There's just\nno accepted definition of the word \"retain\" that\ncorresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to\nthat word. \"Retain\" does not mean obtain.\nMR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. Can I\nanswer? Basically, what I would say is, on the first\npoint: You're quite correct, obviously, that that's the\ngeneral rule, that inventors receive title. However,\njust in this case, in this fact pattern, the array of\nso-called vesting statutes that predated the Bayh-Dole\nAct throughout the 30 years in between are statutes that\nspecifically, in most instances without any discussion\nof an assignment, simply vested title directly in the\nUnited States. So Congress clearly had the power to do\nthat, and they did it, and no one ever seriously argued\nthat they couldn't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this isn't vesting it\nin the United States. This is -- this is speaking of\nthe -- the university retaining title. If -- if the\ngovernment was going to make such a huge change from\nnormal patent law where the inventor owns his invention\nuntil he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set\nforth clearly? All they needed was one paragraph.\nMR. AYER: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says when you're working\non a -- on a government-funded project, you have no\nright to your invention as an -- as an employee. It\nautomatically vests in the -- in the university. I\nwould have expected that to be set forth very clearly\nif -- if they were making such an immense change in\npatent law.\nMR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, I would take\nexception to how immense it is, given the prior history\nin which the government simply took title to these very\nsame inventions.\nBut on the issue of the meaning of the word\n\"retain,\" that's actually a word that has a lot of\npotential connotations. The one thing we can be sure of\nhere without any doubt is that it doesn't mean that you\nhad to have ownership before, because in section 202(d)\nof the act, the act specifically talks about the\ninventor's opportunity to itself be considered for\nretention of title, and everyone agrees that that phrase\nis one that never applies when the inventor already has\ntitle. So \"retain\" doesn't mean that.\nWe would submit that what the word \"retain\"\nmeans is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I lost you. Go\nover that again.\nMR. AYER: Okay. 202(d) -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, where is that?\nMR. AYER: 202(d) is -- is the section -\nwhere is it in the -- okay. It is -- it is on page 9a.\nAnd it says that if a contractor does not elect to\nretain title -- 9a of the blue brief, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Got you.\nMR. AYER: -- \"does not elect to retain\ntitle to a subject invention in cases subject to this\nsection, the Federal agency may consider and, after\nconsultation with the contractor, grant a request for\nretention of rights by the inventor.\"\nOn 38 of the red brief, you will see the\nother side vehemently arguing that that only applies\nwhen the inventor doesn't have title to start with. So\nyou can't have \"retain\" mean one thing in one place and\nplace -- and one thing in the other.\nYour Honor, if I could, I would like to save\nthe rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the Chief Justice's question suggests,\nalthough Stanford and the government's interests are\naligned in this case, that won't invariably be so, and\nthe government has perhaps different reasons for\nsupporting the same position that Stanford is\nsupporting.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, could I ask you\njust a factual question?\nWhen the Federal Government contracts with\nuniversities or other nonprofits, does it require those\nuniversities to get assignments from their employees?\nAnd if so, how?\nMR. STEWART: The government-wide regulation\nthat -- which was promulgated by the Department of\nCommerce and which identifies certain things that should\nbe in the funding agreements, it does not require an\nassignment of title from the university's employees.\nThe regulation does require the university\nto make assurance -- give assurances that it has\ncontractual obligations from its employees to cooperate\nin filing the documents necessary to process a completed\npatent application. But that would be necessary -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So why doesn't the Federal\nGovernment just require assignments from employees to\nthe university?\nMR. STEWART: Well, under our theory -\nfirst, under our theory it wouldn't be necessary,\nbecause the statute itself would give the university\ntitle. And second, under Respondent's theory I think\nthere is a substantial doubt whether it would be\npermissible. That is, Respondent's vision of the\nBayh-Dole Act is that Congress imposed elaborate\nrequirements on inventions as to which the contractor\nhas obtained title from the researcher, but that\nCongress left entirely to private ordering, was\nindifferent as to whether the contractor took title in\nthe first instance.\nAnd if that view of the statute were\naccepted, there would at least be a substantial doubt\nwhether the Commerce Department could promulgate\nregulations that would validly require the contractor to\ndo something that, in Respondent's view, Congress left\nto private ordering.\nNow, I don't want to argue that point too\nvigorously, because certainly, if this Court holds that\nassignments from the inventors are required, we would\nlike to have the opportunity to require the contractor\nto get them, but it isn't clear to me how you would get\nthere if Respondent's view of the statute were accepted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nWhy can't the Federal government just say: We're not\ngoing to fund your project unless you get assignments of\ninventions by all the employees working on it? What's\nthe problem?\nMR. STEWART: We would certainly like to\nhave the opportunity to do that, but to use an analogy,\nthe Bayh-Dole Act is triggered by voluntary choices of\nsmall businesses and nonprofits to accept Federal funds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And by -- and by the\nFederal 0 voluntary decision to provide funds. I mean,\ncertainly you can condition your grant of funds on that.\nI -- I really don't see the problem.\nMR. STEWART: If -- certainly if this Court,\nas I say, holds that the -- an assignment from the\ninventor is required, then we would like to be able to\nhave regulations that would require that to be done. As\nI say -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the -- as a\npractical matter, when a university is seeking a patent,\ndoesn't it have to identify the inventors and get\ntheir -- proof of their assignment before it can claim\nownership of the patent?\nMR. STEWART: Well, typically it would -- it\nwould certainly have to identify the inventors on the\npatent application, and typically the university\nwould -- whether it felt an assignment was legally\nrequired or not, it would attempt to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different\nquestion than mine.\nMR. STEWART: It would -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the Patent Office\nrequire the assignment for purposes of showing ownership\nof the patent?\nMR. STEWART: Not -- in most cases, but not\nnecessarily. There's a provision of the Patent Act, 35\nU.S.C. 118, which says that if an inventor refuses to\nexecute an assignment or cannot be found after\nreasonable diligence, a person to whom the patent\napplication has been assigned or to whom the inventor\nhas promised to assign it, or some other person with a\nsufficient proprietary interest in the invention, can\nfile its own patent application. It will identify the\ninventor as the inventor, and it will provide\ndocumentation that establishes its own interest in the\ninvention.\nAnd this is the kind of thing that we might\nin some instances have to do with respect to Federal\nemployees. That is, there's an executive order that\nsays basically as a condition of Federal employment, if\nyou conceive -- if you create or conceive an invention\non the job, it -- the Federal Government is entitled to\ntake title to it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask -- that all\nsounds to me like there's an assumption about\nassignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the\nsection that you just recited to me says a promise to\nassign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't\ngive it to you.\nMR. STEWART: It could be a -- I mean, there\nare two different things. It could be a promise to\nassign at the formation of the employment arrangement,\nwhere the employee is not -- doesn't necessarily have in\nmind any particular invention, but he exercises a\ncontractual commitment to assign to the -- to the\nemployer at a later date.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what we're\ndealing with in this case? I mean, there was a -- an\nagreement, a standard Stanford agreement, that said I\nwill assign any -- any patent.\nMR. STEWART: He agreed to that, and he also\nagreed that he would not enter into any other\narrangement that placed him in conflict with the\nagreement he had made -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why isn't that the\nbeginning and end of this case? I mean you -- there are\nimportant questions presented. But the Federal Circuit\nsaid everything turns on the difference between \"I will\nassign\" and \"I hereby assign.\" Cetus would have come\nsecond in time, therefore would not have prevailed over\nStanford, but for, except, the Federal Circuit said, one\nis a future conveyance and one is an immediate\nconveyance. You know -\nMR. STEWART: Leaving aside the question of\nwhether that is right or wrong is a matter of contract\nlaw, our view is it was not within Stanford's power to\nessentially convey to the inventor or allow the inventor\nto retain title, and that's clear in a couple of\ndifferent respects. The provision that Mr. Ayer was\nreading, section 202(d), says that if the contractor\ndoes not elect to retain title, then the inventor can\nmake a request for retention of title, which the agency\nwill consider after consultation with the contractor.\nSo the statute doesn't say to the contractor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice\nGinsburg's question, and I have the same concern, is\nthat why can't we resolve this case in a simple way?\nWhat you're asking for, based on submissions to us of\namici, of amicus briefs, means a very great change in\nhow -- how -- how patents are held. If we can resolve\nthis case on a simple contract basis, why not do it?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- if the Court were\nto hold that the agreement made with Stanford took\nprecedence over the contractual commitment to Cetus,\nbased either on general contract law or on the view that\nBayh-Dole would prohibit the enforcement of the -- of\nthe agreement with Cetus under these circumstances, that\nwould satisfactorily resolve the case from the\ngovernment's perspective. The one -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, do you know, is\nthis a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general\nproblem? In other words, are there many universities\nthat have agreements like Stanford's that would be\nsubject to the Federal Circuit's ruling? Or is this\njust an example of one university that unfortunately has\na bad agreement?\nMR. STEWART: I think there are probably a\nlot of universities that use this language, and indeed,\nas one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very\nnatural to distinguish between a present assignment and\na promise to assign in the future with respect to an\ninvention that now exists. It seems a little ethereal\nto distinguish between a present assignment of an\ninvention that has not yet been created and an agreement\nto assign that in the future.\nNow, certainly universities could change\ntheir contracts if that was what was necessary. I think\none of the concerns that the government has, and this\nwas hinted at by the Chief Justice's question, is that\nwe're -- we're worried not just about what can be done\nto universities, but what universities could do to us.\nThat is, it's standard university practice to say\nemployees agree to assign their inventions to the\nuniversity, and the two parties will divide the\nroyalties; and if that is done, then even under\nRespondent's view it becomes a subject invention; and\nthe university's commercialization of the invention is\nsubject to all the requirements of Bayh-Dole. The\ngovernment -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it the case that at\nleast some components, possibly many components, of the\nFederal Government for the last 30 years have been\nproceeding on that assumption that assignments were\nnecessary? The grants here were -- were from NIH, isn't\nthat right?\nMR. STEWART: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And one of the amicus briefs\npoints out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law\nan inventor has initial ownership of invention; however,\nawardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act\nto have in place employee -- employee agreements\nrequiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an\ninvention to the organization -\nMR. STEWART: -- well, the -- the NIH\ndocument is internally inconsistent, because it says at\nthe beginning that title passes automatically to the\nuniversity, but then, as you say, it states later on\nthat an assignment is required, but that the contractor\nis required to get it.\nAnd I think some people have proceeded on\nthat assumption because it never -- so long as\nassignments were in place and were enforceable, it never\nreally mattered whether they were needed.\nBut to continue my answer to Justice Kagan,\nI wanted to point out, under Respondent's theory,\nuniversities could make a conscious, calculated decision\nthat, rather than obtain an assignment for their\ninventors, they would simply agree with the inventor\nthat royalties would be split in -- in the same manner\nas previously, but that the inventor would retain title\nand, perhaps with the assistance of the university's\ntechnology transfer office, would negotiate with\ncommercial entities. And the effect would be to\ncontract around Bayh-Dole; commercialization could occur\nwithout complying with any of the prerequisites.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\nMr. Fleming.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Bayh-Dole Act had the laudable objective\nof taking inventions off of government shelves and\nputting them into the market, and it succeeded; but it\ndid not change the long-standing rule dating back to\nthis Court's decisions in Hapgood and Dubilier that\ntitle to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to\nassignment, not in the inventor's employer. We submit\nthat, in light of this long-settled rule which Congress\nnowhere purported to change, the Act should be given its\nstraightforward meaning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a reason\nthat the Federal Government can't just say, from now on\nwe're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody\nelse until they have an agreement making clear that the\ninventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with\nthe university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act?\nMR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, I know of\nno reason why the Federal Government cannot make that\nrequirement. In fact, in the case of FilmTec v.\nHydranautics, a Federal Circuit decision, the decision\nreflects that the Federal agency there did exactly that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have no\nproblem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his\nclient, but you're comfortable with the idea that the\ngovernment could impose that, even though there's\nnothing in the statute that requires it, and even though\nsomebody could argue that the statute's somewhat\ninconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it\nwants to promote commercialization.\nMR. FLEMING: As far as I know that has\nnever been litigated, but I know of no reason why a\nFederal agency couldn't say to a contractor, we want to\nbe absolutely certain that the assumption that underlay\nnot only Bayh-Dole contracting, but contracting going\nall the way back to Attorney General Biddle's report in\n1947, that everyone assumed was in place, which is an\nassignment from an employee, whether it's a Federally\nfunded invention or a privately funded invention -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, though -\nMR. FLEMING: -- would go to the contractor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's where I\nexactly am. I mean, the -- the brief that I found very,\nvery interesting is that filed by the Association of\nAmerican Universities and the Advancement For Science\nand the Council on Education, and they seem to take the\nline that you are -- I don't know how far you want to\npursue it.\nThey say the strongest analogy is with\ngovernment employees, and if you look at government\nemployees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid\nfor it, they should have the invention. And the way\nthey do it is not to deny the employee the right to have\nthe invention, but they insist upon an assignment,\nassignment of an exclusive license.\nAnd there are cases which are cited here\nthat suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his\nway around that and simply goes and before the\ngovernment can get it assigns the interest to a third\nparty, that that third party assignment is void as a\nmatter of public policy; and that the assignment to the\ngovernment of the exclusive right is valid as a matter\nof law, a legal implication from the executive order in\nthe circumstance.\nThat brings me back to where Justice\nGinsburg was, and Justice Kennedy. The analogy is so\nstrong. The government has paid for it. There is a\nstatute here that really seems to assume, though not\nexplicitly say, that the universities will have title -\nthat we simply copy what happened in this other area and\nsay that an effort to assign by the employee in\ncontravention of what this statute takes as its basic\nassumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of\npublic policy, because the exclusive license is assumed\nto be assumed -- to be assigned to the university,\nthough I don't need the second part; for this case, the\nfirst part suffices.\nMR. FLEMING: Justice Breyer, let me begin\nwith the assumption that I agree underlies the AAU brief\nabout the situation with respect to government\nemployees. Actually, I think the situation of\ngovernment employees supports our side, because, as this\nCourt ruled in Dubilier, just because the government\npays for an invention does not mean that it\nautomatically owns it.\nIn Dubilier, there were employees of the\nBureau of Standards who came up with particular\ninventions and they got patents on them, and the\ngovernment said: We own that because these are\ngovernment employees. And this Court ruled that's not\nthe case. Government employees are in no different\nposition from employees of private entities with respect\nto ownership of their inventions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that before the\nexecutive order or after?\nMR. FLEMING: The executive order simply\nsays that there can be regulations where the employment\nagreement, which is essentially regulatory between the\ngovernment agency and the individual, can result in an\nassignment from the individual to the government, just\nas the same applies in private industry. Employees sign\neither an agreement to assign, as happened with\nDr. Holodniy and Stanford here, or, as happened with\nCetus, there's a present assignment of future expected\ninterest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the\nproblem with -\nMR. FLEMING: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you finished\nanswering Justice Breyer?\nMR. FLEMING: What I was going to say is\nthat there was no rule of automatic vesting of title,\nwhich is what -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I understand that.\nMR. FLEMING: There's a requirement of an\nassignment. And the regulations actually give the\ngovernment employee the right to refuse to assign an\ninvention to the government, and there are appeal\nprocedures, as set out in many of the regulations. We\nquote the Air Force regulations in our brief, but there\nare many others, where it's possible that the employee\nwill wind up retaining his rights to an invention that\nwas made, even though he's a government employee.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if the employee seeks\nto assign to a third party in contravention of his\nagreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what\nhappens to that assignment?\nMR. FLEMING: Well, there can be -- it\ndepends on the facts, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The facts are that he was\nsupposed to give it to -\nMR. FLEMING: There could be a situation\nwhere there's an order to reassign, as there was in the\nHeinemann case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, there's no -- what\nthere is, is an agreement with the government that says\nany invention you will assign to the government. That's\nthe agreement.\nMR. FLEMING: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now, in violation of\nthat agreement, he assigns it to a third party. What\nhappens to that assignment?\nMR. FLEMING: The question will be whether\nthat assignment can be void under ordinary equitable\nprinciples, just as it said here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what the Court said -\nmy reading of it, must be yours -- is in the cases they\ncite, that assignment to the third party is void as a\nmatter of law because it's contrary to public policy.\nThat was my reading of it, and I'm questioning you about\nthat because I might not have read it correctly.\nMR. FLEMING: I'm not sure which case Your\nHonor is referring to. If it's the Heinemann case -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have -- you have\nhere L-I v. Montgomery, Li v. Montgomery -\nMR. FLEMING: Well, Li v. Montgomery, is I\nbelieve -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, am I right or not in\nyour opinion.\nMR. FLEMING: I -- I don't think so, Justice\nBreyer. I think Li v. Montgomery is the unpublished\ndecision of the D.C. Circuit, which has less than a\nsentence of discussion of this. The only one in which\nthere -- this was actually covered in any respect I\nthink is the Heinemann decision in the Federal Circuit.\nBut there, there was no assignment to a third party.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -\nMR. FLEMING: It was just a question whether\nthe -- I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any conceivable\nreason that, under the Bayh-Dole Act, whose intent was\nto protect the government's interests after it's funded\nthe discovery or implementation of an invention, that\nCongress would have ever wanted the university and the\ninventor to be able to circumvent the act by failing to\nsecure an assignment?\nMR. FLEMING: The purpose of the act,\nJustice Sotomayor, was to clarify the relationship\nbetween the contractor on the one hand and the Federal\ngovernment on the other on the basis of uniform\nFederal -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But frankly, every act\nbefore this one -- actually, the IPA -- required that\nthe contractor seek assignments from inventors. Why\nwould this act omit such a critical term if it didn't\nintend to vest title in the contractor?\nMR. FLEMING: The answer, Justice Sotomayor,\nis given by the IPA, which is: There was no need for\nsuch a requirement. Universities had shown that they\nwere perfectly able under existing law -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government just\nsaid -- if we say that the contractor and the inventor\ncan do what they want, what sane university wouldn't\nenter into agreements with employees letting the\nemployees retain title to their inventions and just\nsharing royalties thereafter? It wouldn't make any\nsense for universities to do what you're saying -- get\nassignments -- because they could just continue taking\nthe bulk of the royalties.\nMR. FLEMING: If that were to happen,\nJustice Sotomayor, the remedy that Mr. Stewart kept in\nhis pocket, which is that the agency would say to the\nuniversity: You're not getting any more Federal money\nuntil we are assured that the assumption that has\nunderlaid Federal contracting since 1947 and before is\nin place, namely, that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that might lead\nto the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to\nget away from, which is a variety of different\narrangements across the vast array of government\nagencies, because they will have differing degrees of\ninterest, differing leverage with respect to what they\ninsist on from the different contractors.\nMR. FLEMING: Well, Congress, Mr. Chief\nJustice, in the Bayh-Dole Act, was considered with a\nparticular type of uncertainty. It didn't do anything\nand everything that could be argued to create\nuncertainty in tech licensing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- are you\naware of situations where the universities enter into\ndifferent types of arrangements with different types of\nprofessors and researchers?\nMR. FLEMING: Certainly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably some of\nthem have greater degree of leverage than others and can\nsay: Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of\nthe royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much.\nMR. FLEMING: Well, certainly there are\ndifferent approaches, and that is the system that\nBayh-Dole left in place, which is that the relationship\nbetween the contractor and the inventor would be\ngoverned under ordinary patent contract law principles.\nMIT and Caltech, for instance -- I'm sorry, I was going\nto answer the question with examples, but -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead.\nMR. FLEMING: MIT and Caltech get present\nassignments of future interest. We cite those policies\nin the brief. Stanford, for its own reasons -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The whole thing that was\nwrong here is that Stanford, instead of drafting the\nagreement \"I agree to assign,\" should have said \"I\nhereby assign\" and then there would be no case. Is\nthat -- the Cetus agreement said \"I hereby assign,\" and\nthe Federal Circuit said for that reason, even though it\nwas second in time, it takes precedence. Stanford just\nsaid \"I will assign.\"\nSo if Stanford had instead used exactly the\nformula that Cetus used -- \"I agree to assign and hereby\ndo assign\" -- would you have any case?\nMR. FLEMING: The question presented before\nthis Court would not be presented. There would be other\narguments we might have as to whether that earlier\nassignment was enforceable as against Cetus in light of\nrepresentations that were made at the time Dr. Holodniy\ncame in.\nBut Justice Ginsburg, your question is -- is\nsound, which is that there is this distinction between\nan agreement to assign and a present assignment of\nfuture expected interests. That has been the law for\ndecades. There are plenty of settled expectations based\non that. That has not been challenged, not in the\npetition for certiorari, not in the opening brief of\nStanford, and it only comes up in a footnote on the\npenultimate page of the reply brief. So I would\nsubmit -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the Cetus agreement\nthat came second in time had said \"I will assign,\" then\nagain, you would have no case?\nMR. FLEMING: The question presented here\nwould not arise, because the only effective assignment\nof the invention would have been the assignment that\nStanford got subsequently from all three coinventors and\nfiled in the Patent Office in 1995, recognizing that it\ncouldn't simply say: Bayh-Dole Act vests title in\nStanford, but rather, we need an assignment, and it got\none.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We -- we have a number of\nsample clauses in this record, and some say \"I will\nassign.\" Some say \"I hereby do assign.\" The notion\nthat the -- that answer, who is it who loses, should\nturn on whether one drafter says \"I agree to assign\" and\nthe other says \"I hereby assign\" does seem very odd.\nMR. FLEMING: That's a distinction, Justice\nGinsburg, that goes back to the Federal Circuit decision\nin Arachnid by Judge Giles Rich, who is a notable\nauthority on the patent act. He relied on the Curtis\ntreatise from 1873. But if that were an issue that the\nCourt wished to reconsider, I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that patent law or is it\nregular contract law? Doesn't it apply in other fields\nas well? I mean, I'm -- I'm not aware that this is a\npeculiar doctrine applicable to patent law.\nMR. FLEMING: No, not in particular. An\nagreement to assign is specifically that. It's an\nagreement to do an assignment in the future.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To do it in the future. If\nsomebody else gets an assignment before that agreement\nis -- is executed, the assignment prevails.\nMR. FLEMING: That's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then we're talking about\nnonexistent property; property that may never, in fact,\nexist?\nMR. FLEMING: That comes from the FilmTec\ndecision, which relied on Justice Storey's decision in\nMitchell, and it's used, again, by universities like\nCaltech and MIT that rely on the validity of a present\nassignment of future expected interest.\nI mean, I know that the issue of the\ninterpretation of agreements to assign was addressed in\nthe cert petition in ProStar v. IP Venture, which this\nCourt denied cert on three terms ago. But if this Court\nwere to wish to reconsider that doctrine, I would submit\nit can be done in an appropriate case where there is an\namicus briefing on that issue. That's not been\nconsidered here at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So in the future, the\nuniversities would be protected against a third party\nsimply by changing the form of contract with their\nemployees to say \"I hereby assign,\" so we would have no\ncontinuing problem? Is that all this -\nMR. FLEMING: I -- they -- they would be\nprotected from this particular constellation of facts\nthat came up in this case. There might be other\nproblems -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and then your clients\nwould be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't\nassign a future interests in the fruits from black acre;\nI mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't\neven around yet. And so when somebody ran in and got\nthose fruits, well, then now we have a fight; and in law\nthe second person wins, and in equity maybe the first\nperson can get an injunction. I don't know. But I\nguess people would raise that kind of argument, wouldn't\nthey?\nMR. FLEMING: The point, Justice Breyer, is\nthat all these questions are resolved in the exactly\nsame way when we're not talking about a federally funded\ninvention. The Bayh-Dole Act has nothing to say about\nthis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if fact -\nMR. FLEMING: Those questions might be\nrelevant -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason it's relevant\nyou to, of course, if that's so, Senator Bayh and\nSenator Dole passed a law which could so easily be\nsubverted by individual inventions and third-party\ncompanies that there might be a large class of cases\nwhere neither the university nor the government would\nactually get much of a benefit from research that the\ntaxpayer had funded.\nMR. FLEMING: I don't think that's a fair\ninference, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. FLEMING: The fact that this has not\nhappened at all in 30 years of the Bayh-Dole Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because most people perhaps\nthought that they had made a valid assignment.\nMR. FLEMING: Well, in most situations there\nwill be a valid assignment, but the fact that Stanford\nhere did not get an effective assignment from Dr.\nHolodniy is no reason to read the Bayh-Dole Act that\nCongress did not intend to draft it. And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's just -\nMR. FLEMING: -- it that it doesn't -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it's not just\nthat there may or may not be an effective assignment.\nThe problem is you may get together, you the inventor\nget together with the university and say, look, the one\n-- we share an interest in making sure none of this goes\nto the government. Why would we want to do that? So\nyou make an arrangement.\nYour theory -- your theory is that whatever\nthe contractor gets is what the government can get and\nnothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal\nto make sure that the contractor doesn't get the\ninvention or the patent, it just gets royalties.\nMR. FLEMING: I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they're happy\nbecause they're -- the value of the patent is not\ndiluted by the fact that the government is going to be\ndoing something with it.\nMR. FLEMING: I think in that situation, Mr.\nChief Justice, there would be other doctrines that the\ngovernment or a bona fide third-party purchaser could\ninvoke, including section 261 of the Patent Act or a\nlawsuit for a reassignment, as is happening in Fenn v.\nYale or a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So at the end of the\nday, though, your theory is that Congress passed a law\nthat could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point -\nbe easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by\nthe inventor and the contractor working together.\nMR. FLEMING: It's not that it can be\ncircumvented. It's -- there are efforts, there are ways\nin which if there is an inequitable assignment, it can\nbe attacked in equity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's nothing\ninequitable about it. It's a perfectly fair deal\nbetween the university and the inventor.\nMr. Fleming: In that event the government\nhas all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about.\nAs a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by\neminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low\nif in fact it has funded all of the research.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could refuse to fund.\nMR. FLEMING: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could refuse to fund\nwithout a clear assignment upfront.\nMR. FLEMING: That's quite right. What it\ncan't do is relitigate Dubilier and just say that\nbecause we funded it, we own it. It doesn't make that\nrule even for Federal employees. An assignment is\nrequired. I mean, I think -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have an explanation,\nMr. Fleming, of why it is that Congress left such a big\nproblem off the table?\nMR. FLEMING: I -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, clearly\nCongress was thinking about how to protect the\ngovernment's interests with respect to these patents,\nand to say, well, we have these interests with respect\nto patents that the university owns, but we don't have\nthose same interests with respect to patents that the\nindividual researcher owns, just seems bizarre.\nMR. FLEMING: There is an explanation,\nJustice Kagan. Which is that the universities had shown\nthey didn't need a vesting rule in order to get title\nfrom their inventors, just the same as private industry\ndoes not need a vesting rule to get title to\nnonfederally funded inventions. This was something that\nAttorney General Biddle in 1947 -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sorry. They -- they do.\nI mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the\npatent.\nMR. FLEMING: Correct, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there -- there is\nproof that they can go into court, an employer can go\ninto court and show that the inventor was hired for this\nspecific item and the law would presume or recognize the\nemployer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of\nthat up to the nature of the contract that the\nuniversity entered into with its inventors?\nMR. FLEMING: That's precisely what happens\nin the context of Federal employees, it's governed by\nthe employment relationship between the Federal\nGovernment and the employee, and it was shown in the IPA\nsystem, in the system that Attorney General Biddle\ntalked about in '47, that the assignment came under\nordinary patent law. There was no need for a new -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the -- but the\nquestion I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up\non, why would Congress create this act relying on\nassignments and not have a provision requiring one?\nNothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere\nis there a requirement that Federal contractors seek\nassignments.\nMR. FLEMING: Because there was no need for\nsuch a requirement. The universities and industry were\nable to do it without the vesting rule.\nI think in order for Stanford to prevail\nhere, to Justice Scalia's point, the Court would have to\nbe satisfied that -- that Congress worked a highly\ntransformative change in the law of patent ownership and\nassignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect\nway. It didn't do it through an express provision, like\nit does in section 201 of the Copyright Act, which\nexpressly says that an employer can be treated like an\nauthor for purposes of the copyright. It didn't do it\nin the way that was done under the IPAs, which is it was\nleft entirely up to private contract.\nSupposedly it created this brand-new vesting\nrule, not through a clear provision, but through a\nquestionable implications from the preamble or other\nprovisions of the Act that don't directly apply, and it\ndid it without a peep in the legislative history that\nCongress was trying to do this. I think it's remarkable\nthat for 30 years of Bayh-Dole, no one noticed this\nsupposedly all-encompassing vesting rule until this case\narose. As Justice Alito -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's also remarkable\nthe other way, that here we have many statutes that took\nthe principle that when the government pays for an\ninvention, the invention vests in the government. Now,\nthere's that statute, that background. Not all of them,\nbut some. NASA, various others.\nMR. FLEMING: There are three of them,\nJustice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, that's fine.\nMR. FLEMING: -- and they all specifically\nsay in terms that title shall vest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I know that; I know\nthat; that isn't my point.\nMR. FLEMING: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My point is that it's\nsomewhat remarkable because of this new statute, now\nthat happens to only to inventions in those areas that\nare inventions of the contractor who, by the way,\ninvents nothing. Human beings invent things, not\nentities like universities.\nMR. FLEMING: That's quite so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And on your view what that\nmeans is it applies to nothing. It only applies to\nthose things that the contractor freely or not freely\ndecides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right\nwords and so forth.\nThat also seems a little surprising, that\nthere could be such a hole in what used to be public\nownership of such matters. I'm not -- I don't mean to\nbe -- I started off sounding a little sarcastic. I\ndidn't mean to be. I mean to be -- serious question.\nMR. FLEMING: No, no, I -- I appreciate the\nquestion, Justice Breyer.\nThe point about the vesting statutes, it's\nimportant to make a distinction between statutes that\nexpressly vested title, of which we know of three, and\nstatutes under which the government was entitled to ask\nfor an assignment from the employee or the contractor,\nwhich were -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your answer is not as bad\nas I think.\nMR. FLEMING: Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- okay. Now.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about\nthe provision that says there shall be -- this is a\nprovision of the law, that the universities are supposed\nto enter into contracts, funding contracts with the\ngovernment to make this thing effective.\nHmm -- effective. Effective for what?\nEffective just to apply to some of the things that\nuniversities got money to pay for? Or to a lot of them,\nto all of them?\nMR. FLEMING: Effective in terms of\ninventions of the contractor to which the university has\nthe right to retain title. Try as Stanford may,\n\"retain\" does not mean \"get.\" It doesn't mean to take\naway from somebody. An invention of the contractor for\nexactly the reason you say, Justice Breyer, is not an\ninvention created by a contractor employee. Contractors\ndon't invent.\nWhen Congress wanted to refer to employees\nin the Act, it did; in section 202(c)(7), it refers to\ncontractor employees. In 202(e), it refers to employees\nof Federal agencies. If -- if Congress had wanted to\npass a law that completely wiped out the practice of\nleaving the relationship between contractor and inventor\nto private contract, it had plenty of examples of how to\ndo so. It had the NASA statutes, it had the Copyright\nAct, or it could have just written something clear that\nsaid that.\nIt did none of those things because it\ndidn't need to. Over $200 billion of -- of funding\ncomes from the private sector to -- to technology and\ninventions like this without the benefit of a vesting\nrule. If there's any lack of clarity or lack of\ncertainty in this world, it is worked out through the\npatent law, ordinary provisions, or through the common\nlaw, and that is exactly the way Congress envisioned it\nwould be done in -- in the federally funded situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't there a -\nMR. FLEMING: There's no need to state a\nseparate rule for Stanford for -- for inventions that\nfunded out of its endowment, versus inventions that are\nfunded out of a Federal grant.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there a big difference\nbetween the statute and the prior vesting statutes? The\nprior vesting statutes said if the government pays for\nthe research, then the taxpayers ought to get the\nbenefit of the patent. But this statute says if the\ntaxpayers pay for the research, if the research is 100\npercent funded by the taxpayers, taxpayers don't get the\nfirst priority. The first priority goes to the\nuniversities.\nSo it's totally different from the vesting\nstatute. This is a Federal subsidy for universities and\nother nonprofits, isn't it?\nMR. FLEMING: In some ways, Justice Alito,\nthat's right. And the point is that the statute is\nlimited to inventions where the contractor has gotten\ntitle from its inventors. It is certain different -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government\nhadn't been doing much with the parents that it acquired\nautomatically?\nMR. FLEMING: Absolutely not, Justice\nScalia. That's exactly -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the reason they gave\nit to the university or to the private sector.\nMR. FLEMING: That is exactly the reason\nthis act was -- was enacted, is to get rid of the\ninconsistent practices among agencies as to the terms of\ncontracts with contractors. It has to do with the quid\npro quo. The Federal government gives the money, it\nagrees not to demand title, and in return the contractor\ntakes on certain obligations. It isn't -- the\nobligations are not opposable against a noncontractor,\nlike Cetus or Roche in this case. And that's exactly\nthe same as the situations that we cite on page 35 of\nour brief, which we've offered to lodge with the Court,\nwhere Stanford co-owns patents with noncontractor\ncompanies like the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are the\nobligations -- what are the obligations that the\ncontractor undertakes?\nMR. FLEMING: The contractor agrees to give\nthe government a nonexclusive paid-up irrevocable\nlicense. It agree to be subject to march-in rights if\nthe government feels that the invention is not being\nsufficiently commercialized.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All things -- all\nthings that the government had and more under the prior\nsystem?\nMR. FLEMING: Yes. That's -- well, that's\ncertainly right. It will all depend on what the\nindividual Federal contract has, but yes, in many ways\nthe government was giving up rights in the Bayh-Dole\nAct, and that was deliberate, because it was felt that\nthe -- that private entities would do a better job of\ncommercializing inventions than the Federal government\nwas doing, and that's not disputed, but it has nothing\nto do with the rights that apply to a third party that\nhas not taken on obligations from the government, like\nCetus, that simply invited Mr. Holodniy in, in order to\ncollaborate, but before it did so, said: We need an\nagreement to protect our intellectual property.\nOne of the hypotheticals that underlies\nMr. Ayer's presentation here is that Dr. Holodniy was\nsome kind of rogue, faithless employee who was out on a\nfrolic of his own and simply decided to assign away all\nhis inventions in satisfaction of a personal debt. But\nthe record is quite the contrary. He showed up because\nhe did not know how to do the PCR technique that is at\nthe core of this invention. The Court only needs to\nread pages 55 to 57 of the Joint Appendix, where he has\nmarched through each of the steps of this invention\nthat's ultimately claimed in the patents and admits that\nhe had not done any one of them.\nHe went to Cetus, he took the -- he had the\nbenefit of a free flow of information from Cetus\nscientists, and he also got confidential, proprietary\nmaterials that were not available in stores, including,\nparticularly, the RNA standard, which is used every\nsingle time one of these assays is run. It's the thing\nthat gives you the standard curve against which you can\nmeasure the data from your unknown sample and figure out\nwhat the quantity of HIV is in your patient's sample.\nThat was, you know, not available at Stanford. It was\ndesigned by Alice Lang of Cetus. It was built by\nClayton Casipit in the Cetus lab. It was named after\nhim, using his initials, CC 2, and Mr. Casipit handed it\nto Dr. Holodniy in a tube for free.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that Cetus\nwould have let the doctor in absent the agreement\nbetween Cetus and Stanford? Wasn't that the primary\nreason they permitted the doctor in? It wasn't for this\nephemeral assignment of an unknown invention. It was\nbecause the university and the company had entered into\na share agreement of what would happen if they\ncontributed to a Stanford invention.\nMR. FLEMING: I wouldn't quite agree with\nthe end of the question, Justice Sotomayor. What\nhappened is that Dr. Holodniy's supervisor at Stanford,\nDr. Merigan, sat on Cetus's scientific advisory board.\nWhen it became clear that Dr. Holodniy could not figure\nout how to do a PC assay that would quantitate HIV at\nStanford, he arranged for Dr. Holodniy to visit Cetus in\norder to learn how to do that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they had a\npreexisting cooperative arrangement, correct?\nMR. FLEMING: It was a materials transfer\nagreement, that's right. So when Dr. Holodniy went\nthere, he signed a separate assignment, the one that\nassigned his inventions, as a result of the\ncollaboration or as a consequence of the collaboration,\nto Cetus. And that was the consideration.\nTo this day, Stanford has not explained what\nCetus could have done to protect its intellectual\nproperty so that it could have been able to practice its\ninvention without having to go to Stanford for a license\nand pay a royalty. As far as I know, the only thing\nunder Stanford's theory that Cetus could have done is\ntold Dr. Holodniy to take a hike, because they couldn't\nhave any assurance that his employer would subsequently\nsay, You know what? There was a thousand dollars, ten\ndollars, one dollar -- we don't know -- of Federal\nfunding under an agreement that has never been produced,\nthat is of indeterminate scope, and they suggest, simply\nby averring in a patent application, that this is all of\na sudden a Bayh-Dole invention, even though it was -\nindisputably now, under the findings of the District\nCourt, conceived before Dr. Holodniy left Cetus and\nsubject to this agreement, and it was done at a time\nwhen Dr. Holodniy was being paid not by a\nBayh-Dole-related grant, but by a National Research\nService Award, which the Bayh-Dole expressly exempts\nfrom its provisions in section 212.\nSo the notion that Cetus somehow has lost\nthe private right to the invention conceived using its\nproprietary materials and information simply by the\nsubsequent use of an unknown amount of Federal funds,\nthat that works as a divestiture -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You were here,\nMr. Fleming, when I asked Mr. Ayer about that -\nMR. FLEMING: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not -- so that the\nfederally funded project existed at Stanford before\nDr. Holodniy ever went to Cetus?\nMR. FLEMING: This, Justice Ginsburg, is a\nquestion that was raised in front of the Federal\nCircuit. The Federal Circuit didn't reach it. It is\nopen on any remand. Of course, we don't think there\nshould be a remand, but it's certainly not before this\nCourt. But to answer the question, here's the record on\nthis point. The salary was not paid by NIH grants. It\nwas paid by a National Research Service Award that is\nexempted. The grants were never produced. The grant\ntitles, on their face, do not apply to the work that was\ndone at Stanford. One of them deals with establishing a\ncenter for AIDS research. Of course, this is work that\nwas not done at the Stanford Center; it was done at\nCetus.\nThe second one deals with AIDS clinical\ntrials, and it's undisputed that there were no clinical\ntrials at Cetus. The clinical trials only happened when\nDr. Holodniy went back to Stanford. Dr. Merigan's\ndeclaration, which Mr. Ayer referenced on JA98, says\nonly that Dr. Holodniy's research at the lab at Stanford\nwas covered by Bayh-Dole Act. It says nothing about the\nwork at Cetus.\nAnd if there was any doubt, Stanford argued\nrepeatedly to the Federal Circuit that the federally\nfunded research started in 1990, and this issue was\ndecided on summary judgment against Roche when all\nfactual inferences should have taken in our favor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. FLEMING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Ayer, you have\ntwo minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe -- I think the place to start here is\nwith the fact that Congress, faced with a history under\nwhich the Federal government had taken ownership\noutright of federally funded inventions in approximately\n80 percent of the cases, enacted a statute to change\nthat because the government wasn't any good at getting\nthe stuff developed. And so they -- they defined the\ncoverage in terms of -- to cover these two phrases,\ninventions of the contractor.\nThere is no question, if you look at section\n200 on 1A of the blue brief, you will see in the middle\nof this initial policy and objective section a reference\nto what they thought they were talking about. At the\nvery bottom of that page, on the bottom line, they talk\nabout ensuring that inventions made by nonprofit\norganizations and small business organizations. That's\nthe universe they wanted to cover. The same words -\n\"inventions made by those organizations\" -- are in the\nheading of the regulations, and they appear elsewhere\nthroughout the regulations. So they meant to cover the\nuniverse of inventions that those institutions create.\nWe talked earlier about the word \"retain.\"\nThe word \"retain\" cannot, consistent with its usage in\n202(d), mean that whoever is retaining it must have\nowned it before they started, because it's a hundred\npercent clear, just from thinking about the statute and\nfrom reading page 38 of the red brief, that when an\ninventor is allowed to be considered for retention of\ntitle, he never has ownership of it. And so the word\n\"retain\" can't mean that.\nWhat does the word \"retain\" mean? I would\nsubmit the word \"retain\" means what it often means. It\nmeans that sometimes in a situation, someone is allowed\nto continue holding something subject to conditions that\nmay change, and perhaps in spite of realities that make\nyou think that's surprising. For example, a parent may\nbe allowed to retain custody after a disputed custody\nhearing. That's a temporary thing, perhaps. The court\nmay allow it to change.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
