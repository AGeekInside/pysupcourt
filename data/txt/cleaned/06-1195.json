United States.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH W. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Petitioners in these cases have three\nthings in common. First, all have been confined at\nGuantanamo for almost six years, yet not one has ever\nhad meaningful notice of the factual grounds of\ndetention or a fair opportunity to dispute those grounds\nbefore a neutral decision-maker.\nTwo, under the decision below, they have no\nprospect of getting that opportunity.\nAnd three, each maintains, as this Court\nexplained in Rasul, that he is quote \"innocent of all\nwrongdoing.\" Now the government contends that these men\nare detainable, and the facts of these 37 cases differ,\nand it may well that be that an adjudicatory process\nthat preserves the core features of common law habeas\nwould reveal perhaps that some of these Petitioners are\nlawfully detainable. But limited DTA review of the\nstructurally flawed CSRT process cannot provide any\nreliable examination of the Executive's asserted basis\nfor detaining these Petitioners, let alone an adequate\nsubstitute for traditional habeas review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that we\nruled in the Hamdi case that procedures quite similar to\nthose under the DTA were adequate for American citizens?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, with respect, Mr. Chief\nJustice, what you ruled -- as I understand what the\nplurality held in Hamdi was that so long as there was a\nprocess accompanying detention, that provided for\nmeaningful notice of the factual grounds for detention,\na meaningful opportunity to present evidence in response\nto that before a neutral tribunal with the assistance of\ncounsel, that determination would certainly be entitled\nto substantial deference by a habeas court; and we don't\ndispute that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that --\nMR. WAXMAN: That's not what they got.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So our judgment in\nthis case depends upon whether we agree with you or the\ngovernment that the procedures available under the DTA\nare meaningful under Hamdi?\nMR. WAXMAN: It -- I think your decision in\nthis case, the question -- the principal question we\nthink is presented by the case is whether or not the DTA\nreview of the CSRT procedures that occurred in this case\nadequately substitute for the writ of habeas corpus.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, how could\nthat be, because the D.C. Circuit never got to that\nquestion? The D.C. Circuit, as I understand it, ruled\nthat there was no access to habeas, end of case.\nSo the D.C. Circuit never examined the\nprocedure under the DTA, did it?\nMR. WAXMAN: No. The district court -- the\ntwo district judges sitting in habeas went to the merits\nof the case, and Judge Green did evaluate the\nprocedures. The D.C. Circuit held that the\nConstitution, neither the Suspension Clause nor the Due\nProcess Clause, applies to these people. And therefore\nit didn't reach the merits. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So shouldn't we, if we\nagree with you, that there is authority in the\nD.C. Circuit, send it back to them to make that\ndetermination whether habeas being required, this is an\nadequate substitute.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I'm not saying that this\nCourt couldn't do that. It certainly could do that.\nBut one of the principal -- the principal guarantee of\nhabeas corpus through the centuries has been a speedy --\nthe remedy of speedy release for somebody who is\nunlawfully being held in executive detention.\nThese 37 men have been held in isolation for\n6 years, and it is manifest on the record in this case.\nThere's no doubt about how the CSRT has proceeded.\nThere is little doubt about the circumscribed nature of\nthe D.C. Circuit's review. The D.C. Circuit has already\nheld that the Constitution doesn't apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument\nwouldn't be any different with respect to the\navailability of habeas if these people were held for one\nday, would it? We don't look at the length of detention\nin deciding whether habeas is available, do we?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I want to give a\nqualified disagreement with your hypothetical, because\nit's entirely clear that, as I think members of this\nCourt have indicated and that habeas traditionally\nindicates, there may be military exigencies, there may\nbe a limited time period in which it is inappropriate\nfor a habeas court to rule. And moreover -- if there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me just\nstop you there. Do you want this Court to rule on\nwhether or not there are military exigencies that\nrequire the holding and detention of these enemy\ncombatants?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, what I was referring to\nwere sort of the hypothetical of battlefield -- somebody\nis captured -- you know -- and the next day or the next\nweek from the battlefield, does he or she have the right\nto -- does a habeas court have constitutional\njurisdiction. Putting aside-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside the\nbattlefield hypothetical, we're talking about\nGuantanamo. Your argument is that somebody held one day\nin Guantanamo has the right to habeas. So the extent of\ndetention is irrelevant to your assertion.\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't think so, with respect.\nI think -- I don't think -- I think it is appropriate\nfor a habeas -- if the Executive says we have detained\nthis person, we believe this person is an enemy\ncombatant who may be lawfully detained under the AUMF,\nwe have an administrative process that is fair, that\nwill -- that will determine the facts. You should stay\nyour hand to allow that procedure to occur. Of course,\nthat is appropriate, so long as the procedure is\nmeaningful and speedy. That's what we do in immigration\ncases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your basic position\nhas to rest on Guantanamo Bay being just like if we had\nthe detainees in, say, the Everglades. But do you\nconcede that if these people had never been brought to\nthe United States, if the facility were in, say,\nGermany, that these detainees would have no access to\nhabeas, no access to our courts?\nMR. WAXMAN: I wouldn't agree with that for\ntwo reasons. First of all, I think these people are in\na place that is even -- that is under even more complete\ncontrol and jurisdiction of our national Executive than\nthey would be in the Everglades, because there are no\nFederalism constraints here. Our national government\nsupplies the only law.\nAnd if they were detained in Germany, the\nquestion would be A, are they being detained by the\nUnited States or by some multinational coalition force\nas was the case, for example, in Hirota.\nB, are there other laws, or can they invoke\nthe jurisdiction of another court? And the answer to\nthat question would depend upon the terms of our --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who says that -- let's\nconsider first the basis on which the court of appeals\ndecided this case.\nThey decided it -- in Rasul, we had held\nthat the habeas statute extended to Guantanamo, and that\nthose people who had filed their suits before the\nstatute, at least, could bring a suit.\nCongress acted. And enacted a new habeas\nstatute which makes it very clear that the habeas\nstatute, at least, does not apply to these people in\nGuantanamo.\nYour assertion here is that there is a\ncommon law constitutional right of habeas corpus that\ndoes not depend upon any statute.\nDo you have a single case in the 220 years\nof our country or, for that matter, in the five\ncenturies of the English empire in which habeas was\ngranted to an alien in a territory that was not under\nthe sovereign control of either the United States or\nEngland.\nMR. WAXMAN: The answer to that is a\nresounding yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what are they?\nMR. WAXMAN: They are the cases that were\ndiscussed and cited by the majority opinion in Rasul,\nand we have -- we have added other ones to them, but\nit's showing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What cases -- what case in\nparticular do you think in Rasul?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think the opinion of two of\nthe three law lords in the Earl of Crewe, which the\nmajority cited as In re Sekgome. It is certain -- the\ngovernment concedes it was the case in Mwenya. It was\ntrue in the Indian cases. And, in fact, as we point out\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mwenya involved an English\n-- an English subject, not an alien.\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed, it did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question there is an\nalien.\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed, it did, and the\ngovernment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's totally irrelevant.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, no -- let me take a shot\nat convincing you that it's not totally irrelevant. The\nCrown Counsel in that case, in his brief, stated\nforthrightly that subjecthood or citizenship didn't\nmatter and, in fact, in the very minority opinion that\nthe government relies on in its brief here in Earl of\nCrewe, Lord Justice Kennedy specifically said that the\ncitizenship is irrelevant. It isn't and wasn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In both of those cases, it\nwas a citizen, nonetheless. In 220 years of our\nhistory, or five centuries of the -- do you have a\nsingle case in which it was not a citizen of England or\na citizen of the United States in which a common-law\nwrit of habeas corpus issued to a piece of land that was\nnot within the sovereign jurisdiction?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the Court majority in\nRasul cites a case involving the Isle of Jersey, the\nChannel Islands. None of those were within the\nsovereign courts' --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They were not regarded as\npart of the crown's dominion, but they were part of the\ncrown's sovereign territory.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'll take one more chance,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, try them. I mean,\nline them up.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. Here they go. In the\nIndian cases -- I mean, first of all, let's say that\ncitizenship was not a notion at common law. The\nquestion was subjecthood, and subjecthood was a very\nill-defined term that had no fixed parameters, as our\nreply brief points out.\nCertainly many of the petitioners in the\nIndian cases that we cited -- and in fact that Sir John\nChambers decided -- were not Englishmen or people who\nwould have been otherwise considered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the cases were decided\nunder a statute that applied in India, not under --\nunder the common law.\nAnd the writ did not come from England; the\nwrit came from English courts in India under a statute.\nAnd we decided that in Rasul. I mean, you want to do\nthat in Rasul, that's fine. But you are appealing to a\ncommon law right that somehow found its way into our\nconstitution without, as far as I can discern, a single\ncase in which the writ ever to a non-citizen.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, as Lord\nMansfield explained in the King v. Cowle, and both sides\nare citing to it -- even if the writ -- even with\nrespect to the persons detained outside the English\nrealm, the relevant question was, is this person under\nthe subjection of the crown? Not what is the\nsubjecthood or citizenship of this person? And in fact\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the\nrelevance to your -- this line of reasoning to the\nrecent enactment by Congress of section 1005(g), which\nsays that the base at Guantanamo is not part of the\nUnited States? There is a judgment by the political\nbranches that we don't exercise sovereignty over the\nleasehold, and it seems to me that, if we're going to\nadhere to our habeas corpus cases, we would have to\nreject that determination.\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, let me\nanswer that question directly and then if I may finish\nmy answer to Justice Scalia.\nWe don't contend that the United States\nexercises sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay. Our\ncontention is that at common law, sovereignty (a) wasn't\nthe test, as Lord Mansfield explained, and (b) wasn't a\nclear-cut determine -- there weren't clear-cut\nsovereignty lines in those days. Our case doesn't\ndepend on sovereignty. It depends on the fact that,\namong other things, the United States exercises --\nquote -- \"complete jurisdiction and control over this\nbase.\" No other law applies.\nIf our law doesn't apply, it is a law-free\nzone.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the answer to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, it wouldn't matter where\nthese detainees were held so long as they are under U.S.\ncontrol. If they were held on a U.S. military base\npursuant to a standard treaty with another country, if\nthey were in Afghanistan or in Iraq, the result would be\nthe same?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, I think, Justice Alito, I\nwant to be as clear about this as I can be. This is a\nparticularly easy straightforward case, but in another\nplace, jurisdiction would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances, including the nature of an agreement with\nthe resident sovereign over who exercises control. And\nI want to come back to that with the Japan and German\nexample, because I have read the status of forces\nagreements there.\nSecondly, even if there technically were\njurisdiction, there might very well be justiciability\nissues under the circumstances of the sort that\nJustice Kennedy addressed in his concurrence in Rasul;\nthat is, there may be circumstances and temporal\nconditions in which, under the separation of powers, it\nwould be a -- a court would deem it inappropriate to\nexercise that jurisdiction.\nAnd finally, even if it were appropriate to\nexercise the jurisdiction, the review of a habeas court\nin the mine run of cases would be anything but plenary\nbecause members of enemy armed forces and enemy aliens\nwithin the meaning of the Alien Enemy Act are\ndetainable. Period. Now, with respect to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if, in a future war,\nmany of the soldiers and the opposing Army don't wear\nuniforms? What if it's a war like Vietnam and thousands\nof prisoners are taken into custody and they are brought\nto prisoner-of-war camps in the United States as\noccurred during World War II? Every one of them under\nyour theory could file a habeas petition. Is that\nright?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, if they were in the\nUnited States, I think it's clear that they could file a\nhabeas petition. And, you know, the question about how\nGuantanamo relates to that is for this Court. What's\nmaterial is that -- I mean we cited to the Court the\nArmy directives and the Army procedures implementing\nArticle V of the Geneva Conventions that were used in\nVietnam, which is the only other war we engaged in that\nhad combatants who weren't in uniforms. They not only\nhad a hearing that was near the time and near the place\nof capture and the right to call witnesses; there's no\nevidence that classified information was withheld from\nthem. And they not only had a right to counsel; the\ngovernment provided them counsel, somebody who was their\nadvocate.\nNow, once a determination like that is made,\nthey may -- if they're detained in the United States --\nthey may file a habeas petition and the response will be\nthere is absolutely no reason not to defer to the\nadjudication of that tribunal. You have, as I started\nwith the Chief Justice, you had a fair notice of the\nfacts, a fair opportunity to challenge them with the\nassistance of counsel before a neutral decisionmaker.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So to determine\nwhether there's jurisdiction, in every case we have to\ngo through a multi factor analysis to determine if the\nUnited States exercises not sovereignty, which you've\nrejected as the touchstone, but sufficient control over\na particular military base? Over the Philippines during\nWorld War II, in Vietnam, and it is going to decide in\nsome cases whether the control is sufficient and others\nwhether it isn't?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that is a\njudgment we the Court would make, not the political\nbranches who have to deal with the competing\nsovereignties in those situations?\nMR. WAXMAN: You know, I think -- both sides\ntry to derive force from the fact that such claims, such\nhabeas petitions, haven't come forward in floods in the\npast.\nI think the reason is that, in the past, we\nhad combat in which -- you know -- I mean in a war of\nthe conventional sort, soldiers wear uniforms, and more\nto the point, the interests of the captured soldier and\nthe command -- and the capturing officer are aligned.\nThe captured soldier wants to be treated as a prisoner\nof war or released.\nThe commanding general wants to release\ncivilians who aren't in the Army or turn them over for\ncriminal prosecution. That's why, in the Gulf war,\nthere were 1200 -- roughly, just a few hundred, 1200\nArticle V field tribunal hearings that were held, of\nwhich almost 900 were released as civilian\nnon-combatants and the remaining were detained --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, we had 400,000\nGerman prisoners in this country during World War II.\nAnd not a -- you say it's clear in the Vietnam example\nthat the Chief Justice gave you, it's clear that habeas\nwould lie. 400,000 of these people. It never occurred\nto them.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, first of all, there is\nColepaugh --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And many of them were\ncivilians, by the way, and not in uniform. Not a single\nhabeas petition filed.\nMR. WAXMAN: There's -- there are Colepaugh,\nthe Tenth Circuit case and In re: Territo, both of which\nwe discussed. But more to the point, as I said,\nJustice Scalia, there is no doubt that a member of the\nGerman army or somebody who is assisting the German\narmy -- it would be totally unavailing to file a -- to\nfile a habeas petition because they are detainable. It\nwould be like Mr. Ludekey in the United States v.\nLudekey saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He claims he wasn't\nassisting the German army, just as these people here\nclaim that they were not attacking U.S. bases.\nMR. WAXMAN: They were provided Article V\ntribunals that gave them actual notice of the\ngovernment's facts and actual opportunity to controvert\nit and a determination by military officers who had not\nbeen told that both the commanding general of the\nsouthern command and the Secretary of Defense had\npersonally reviewed the evidence and determined that\nthese were enemy combatants; and a habeas court would\nsimply dismiss.\nAnd a habeas court could simply say whether\nwe do or don't technically have jurisdiction under\nbattlefield circumstances or circumstances involving\nforeign detainees in a zone of occupation where active\nhostilities occur, it is inappropriate under the\nseparation of powers for us to intervene. But these men\nhave been held, taken by the United States, thousands of\nmiles away -- in the case of my six individuals, plucked\nfrom their homes, from their wives and children in\nSarajevo, detained for three months at the United States\nrequest.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your primary position is\nthat we should order that they be released, is that\ncorrect?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, we've asked that they be\ngranted habeas relief. We think what that means is that\nthey should be -- the cases should be returned to the\ndistrict courts where their cases are proceeding. The\ngovernment has filed its factual returns to the writ.\nJudge Green, in the cases pending before her, has\nestablished procedures to protect the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there had not been\na six-year wait, would it be appropriate then for us\nto -- if you prevail -- remand the case to the habeas\ncourt and instruct the habeas court to defer until the\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia has\nfinished the DTA review proceedings?\nMR. WAXMAN: I would argue that the answer\nis no for two reasons. The one because there is no\nprospect, no prospect that the DTA proceedings will be\nconducted with alacrity or certainty; and second of\nall --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should I assume that\nthe district court in Washington would be any faster\nthan the court of appeals?\nMR. WAXMAN: Here's -- the -- the -- let's\ntake the cases in front of Judge Green. Judge Leon in\nthe cases of my client just granted the government's\nmotion to dismiss. But in all of the cases the\ngovernment has filed its factual return under the\nprocedures, under the long-established habeas procedures\nunder 2243. It is -- the burden is now on us. She has\nalready ruled that with respect to secret information or\nclassified information, here are the safeguards that\nwill govern, here's how we will work. And it is simply\non us now to adduce and present evidence to try and\nover -- to try to shoulder the burden we have.\nIn the court of appeals, Justice Kennedy,\nthe government, after two years, has not produced the\nrecord on review in a single case. It has now said --\ntwo years. It has now said that it cannot do so, and\nthe court of appeals has suggested that what the\ngovernment ought to do is hold entirely new CSRT\nproceedings.\nNow, those proceedings are structurally\nflawed. Perhaps this Court could say, look, here's how\nit's going to be. First of all, the Constitution does\napply. Second of all, we have to have a hearing in\nwhich the following things occur.\nWe either in the Court of Appeals under the\nAll Writs Act or under 28 USC Section 2347C -- the\nPetitioners have to have the right to adduce and present\nevidence to controvert the government's return which\nwas -- almost all of the government's evidence was\nintroduced ex parte, in camera, and with a -- to boot\nwith a presumption that it is accurate and genuine.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't that take place\nin the CSRT review proceedings that are pending?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't -- it could if\nthe military had different procedures to govern the\nCSRTs. And our submission is that with respect to these\nPetitioners, you've asked to hold aside the six years.\nI would say with respect to future detainees, that this\nCourt could issue a ruling -- well, this Court should\nissue a ruling saying for these people if the writ means\nanything, the time for experimentation is over. We have\ntried and true established procedures. We've got\nexperienced district judges including a judge who was\nthe chief judge in the FISA court, who's already\nestablished the rules for maintaining confidentiality of\nclassified information.\nBut we are not as a Court saying that there\ncould not readily be an adequate substitute if the\nadministrative procedures generated by the Department of\nDefense allowed for the process minimums that the Chief\nJustice asked me about at the beginning and advocated a\nstandard that was authorized -- a substantive standard\nauthorized by the AUMF. DTA review may very well be an\nadequate substitute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that possible for\nyour -- let's say your six clients at this point or for\nany of the Guantanamo detainees, I guess, because\nwouldn't they all run into the problem of -- the\nneutrality problem that you raised? The commanding\ngeneral, the Secretary of Defense, in effect, have\nalready said these people belong where they are.\nWouldn't that make it impossible, really, at this stage\nof the game to substitute a military procedure?\nMR. WAXMAN: I certainly think so. But at a\nminimum, Justice Souter, you would have to have the kind\nof tribunal that is called for under the uniform code of\nmilitary justice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Where you don't have the\nconvening authority exercising command control over the\ntribunal officer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm just wondering whether\nassuming you win this case, that would be an appropriate\nform of relief. And I'm not sure --\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't think it is. I\ncertainly don't think it would be unless this Court\nclarified under the -- I don't know whether this would\nfall under the guise of clarification; but specify that\nunder the circumstances, the deferential review of the\nD.C. Circuit in which it presumes accurate and presumes\nsufficient -- adequate the evidence which the tribunal\nitself presumed accurate would have to fall; that is, a\nhabeas court would never accord that presumption.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I have a quick question. I\ndon't want to interfere with his five minutes of\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you your\nrebuttal time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Going back to\nJustice Scalia's question on the precedent, suppose --\nand I'm going to be -- I'd like my mind to be clear on\nthis. I thought that the question asked was for you to\nfind an instance where there was no sovereignty of the\ncountry and they issued the writ, and it was turning on\na technical thing. Whether that was how the question\nwas met or not, what I read here in these different\nbriefs is in 1759, Lord Mansfield, the case can issue --\na writ of habeas corpus, no doubt the power could issue\nit where the place is under the subjection of the crown\nof England. Then Lord Sellers in Mwenya said subjection\nis fully appropriate to the powers, that's habeas,\nirrespective of territorial sovereignty or dominion, in\nother words, non-technical.\nIn our case in Rasul, both the concurring\nopinion and the majority opinion say things like the\nreach of the writ depends not on formal notions of\nterritorial sovereignty, but on the practical questions.\nThen they both list practical questions.\nNow suppose we take that as the definition.\nNow, can you find instances where the writ has been\nissued by Britain in history to people who were not\ncitizens and who were not actually held in Britain?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are --\nMR. WAXMAN: I will cite two examples. I\nknew that there was one other thing I wanted to try on\nJustice Scalia. One is -- and it's referenced in our\nfootnote -- you know, in 1777 and 1783, Parliament\nsuspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus for\npeople on the high seas or out of the realm,\nspecifically directed at U.S. seamen, at American\nseamen. And if the writ never extended to American\nseamen on the high seas or out of the realm, there would\nhave been no point in suspending it.\nSecond of all, the common -- the high\ncourt judges who were administering -- issuing the writ\nfor the benefit of detainees in India before it became a\nsovereign possession were not exercising a statutory\nauthority, with all due respect to Justice Scalia.\nThere was a royal charter that granted\nthose judges the -- all of the common -- the\nauthority -- common law authorities of the Queen's\nbench.\nAnd as the Indian case law explicates,\nand Sir John Chambers explains, one of those authorities\nwas the exercise of the writ of habeas corpus, not\nmandamus, outside territories that were no part of the\nRealm of England.\nThose are the, I think -- I mean there\nmay be be something in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Spanish doctor, the\nSwedish doctor, the Spanish sailors, the British spy,\nthey're all in this case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, in this -- in this\ncountry, In Re Felateau, which was decided only a few\nyears after the founding, not only was he an enemy\nalien; he was granted release under the writ of habeas\ncorpus because, not being a citizen, he could not be\ncharged with treason, which was the basis for holding\nhim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where was he held?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think in Pennsylvania. Maybe\nit was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure he was being\nheld in Pennsylvania?\nMR. WAXMAN: It was the mid-Atlantic.\nExcuse me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're being held\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States. I am\nstill waiting for a single case, other than the Indian\ncase which you mentioned which was under a statute, a\nsingle case in which an alien that -- in a -- in a\nterritory not within the Crown, was granted habeas\ncorpus.\nAnd it's not enough to say there was a\nstatute that applied on the seas. That's fine. Just\ngive me one case. There's not a single one in all of\nthis lengthy history.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Scalia, you're\nasking me to discard the Indian cases, and I've -- I've\nmentioned to you the cases that the majority of Indians\nin Rasul relied on, the Earl of Crewe and Mwenya. I've\ngiven you the two statutes. I think at this point I\nhave to plead exhaustion from remedies.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, this\ndetermination, whether it's sovereignty or subjugation\nor control of non-sovereign territory, would, I expect,\nhave diplomatic consequences. It is, I think, typically\nan act of war for one country to assert authority and\ncontrol over another country's jurisdiction.\nAnd here we have Section 1005G where\nCongress and the President have agreed that Guantanamo\nBay is not part of the United States, and, yet, you\nwould have this Court issue a ruling saying that it is\nsubject to the total, complete domination and control,\nor whatever the factors are.\nWhat is the reaction of the Cuban government\nto be to that?\nMR. WAXMAN: My -- I don't think it's in the\nrecord here, but what is in the record are the terms of\nthe lease. And I don't really take it to be disputed\nthat Guantanamo is under the complete, utterly\nexclusive, jurisdiction and control of the national\ngovernment of the United States.\nThat's in the lease, itself. The courts of\nCuba have so held. They have designated Guantanamo,\nquote, \"foreign territory\" unless and until the United\nStates in its sole discretion chooses to vacate the\nbase. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We -- there are --\nam I wrong that there are Cuban workers who come on to\nthe base and work?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not sure whether there are,\nor not, any longer. But unlike -- or if you take --\nthey are not subject -- and it has never been contended\nthat they are subject -- to Cuban control with respect\nto conduct that is subject to any law of the United\nStates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have two\nof those workers and they get into a fight over\nsomething, one can't sue the other in Cuban courts?\nMR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not, and this is the\nkey difference, I think, going to Justice Alito's\nquestion. Under our established --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority --\nwhat authority do you have for that: That such a suit\nwould not lie in the Cuban court?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, first of all, the terms\nof the lease, and, second of all, I -- I don't know that\nwe cited -- I mean, somebody has cited decisions of the\nCuban Government, the judiciary and its executive, that\nthey don't exercise any jurisdiction over --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The converse question is:\nCould we prosecute a crime committed in Guantanamo by\nCubans? And the answer is yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: The answer is certainly yes,\nand if I can just make the point about bases elsewhere,\nin Germany and Japan, for example, the status of -- this\nis the only base, I believe, that -- you know, in\nsomething other than an active war zone, that isn't the\nsubject of a status-of-forces agreement that very\nspecifically explicates both the judicial and executive\nauthority over acts that occur on the base.\nAnd, for example, under our status-of-forces\nagreement with Japan, it is entirely clear that if it is\na Japanese citizen or a Japanese national or conduct\nthat is subject to the laws of Japan, the Japanese\ncourts have jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're not heartened by\nthe prospect that the detainees could apply to the Cuban\ncourts, which would then hand process to the Commanding\nGeneral at Guantanamo?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Not particularly. Let's put it\nthis way: It has not occurred to us yet.\n(Laughter).\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, this is in -- this is\nin many respects a uniquely straightforward case. I\nreally didn't mean to be facetious when I said our\nnational control over Guantanamo is greater than it is\nover a place in Kentucky, because there we have -- under\nour system of federalism the Federal Government has\nlimited controls.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought this was\ndecided in Rasul. That's why I am so puzzled by the\nGovernment's position. I think Justice Kennedy said it\nmost clearly when he said that, well, in every practical\nrespect, Guantanamo Bay is U.S. territory; and whatever\nCongress recently passed, they can't, as you pointed\nout, change the terms of the lease.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. I think that's right, and\nI also think that, although it is correct, as\nJustice Scalia pointed out at the outset, that the\ndecision in Rasul was a decision about the scope of\n2241, which has now been amended, and the majority, at\nleast, rendered a decision on the basis of the statute,\nnonetheless, the Court was construing 2241(c)(1), which\nis in haec verba with Section 14 of the 1789 act.\nThere are other provisions of the habeas\nstatute like the civil war provisions that -- under\nwhich this Court reviews State court convictions and\ndetentions. But the statute that this Court was\nconstruing in Rasul was identical in language to the one\npromulgated in the -- the very first judiciary act of\n1789, which this Court has said in Bollman was an\ninstantiation, a positive enactment of the writ, that\nwas protected by the Constitution.\nAnd so, while technically, the majority was\nissuing a statutory ruling -- and we don't contend\notherwise -- inferentially, its conclusion must extend\nto the -- the extent of the writ at common law.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Waxman. We will give you five minutes for rebuttal.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL PAUL D. CLEMENT,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSince this Court's decision in Rasul,\nPetitioners' status has been reviewed by a tribunal\nmodeled on Army Regulation 190-8, and Congress has\npassed two statutes addressing Petitioners' rights.\nPetitioners now have access to the Article\nIII courts and have a right to judicial review in the\nD.C. Circuit.\nThat review encompasses preponderance\nclaims, claims that the military did not follow their\nown regulations, and statutory and constitutional\nclaims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, you said\nit was modeled after 190-8. Is it identical to 190-8?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, it is\nvirtually identical. If you look at pages 50 and 51 of\nour brief, you'll see kind of a side-by-side comparison;\nand the deviations are ones that, we would submit,\nenhance the rights of the detainees in this particular\ncircumstance.\nSo they are given a right to a personal\nrepresentative, which is not something that Army\nRegulation 190-8 provides. They are specifically\nprovided for the ability to submit documentary evidence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How is that personal\nrepresentative chosen?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The personal\nrepresentative is assigned to the individual by the\nmilitary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean is that personal\nrepresentative also under an obligation to report back\nto the military anything that might be unfavorable to\nthe person he is supposedly representing?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't know about\n\"unfavorable,\" but I think if there's -- certainly, if\nthere is material intelligence information, he is to\nprovide that information.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So he's not -- he is not in\nthe position of counsel, as we understand the term.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. We are not trying to\nmake the point that the personal representative is a\ncounsel. We're just saying it is something that is\nprovided above and beyond 190-8 in terms of the\nprocedure; and there are other particulars as well, like\nthere is the notice of the charges in the unclassified\nsummaries that are provided.\nNow, there's the complaint on the other side\nthat the unclassified summaries aren't particular\nenough, but it is worth noting that that's something\nthat is provided here that's not specified by 190-8.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under 190-8, does the\ndefendant have a right to counsel?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, they do not, not under\nthe basic regulations of that. Now, Mr. Waxman\ncorrectly indicated that in a particular instance in\nVietnam, counsel was provided in 190-8 proceedings, but\nthose are not provided by the basic 190-8 procedures.\nAnd, I think it is worth --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The DTA, see, is\nunclear to me, anyway, on this question. You agree that\nthere is the authority under the DTA, and I assume under\nthe Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in reviewing\nthose determinations, to order a release?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- the way I would\nanswer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is this: In terms, the\nDTA does not provide for an order of release. And we\nwould certainly have taken the position that, as a first\norder, if the D.C. Circuit finds a defect in the CSTR,\nwe think the proper remedy would be to order a remand\nfor a new CSTR.\nBut, certainly, if this Court thinks that\nthe constitutional line is -- essentially necessitates\nthat the D.C. Circuit have the authority to order a\nrelease, there is no obstacle to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 2243 doesn't specify\nthe availability of release, either, but it has\ncertainly been interpreted to authorize that by habeas\ncourts in this country.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. And the D.C. Circuit\nwould have available to it the All Writs Act, and the\nD.C. Circuit, in fact, in its Desmoula decision, which\nis the decision where the Government has filed an en\nbanc petition -- that protective order that was issued\nthere was done pursuant to the All Writs Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The D.C. Circuit hasn't\nbeen shy about asserting that authority. And, again, if\nthat's what was required here, they could use that\nauthority to order a release.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't the resort to\nthe All Writs Act beg the question?\nAnd that is -- I mean the All Writs Act is\nthere to protect jurisdiction, and the question is\nwhether there is jurisdiction to release.\nAnd you say there no textual impediment to\nit; and, yet, we know -- I forget which brief it was in\n-- from one of the briefs the -- the instance of the\nprisoner Ali, one of the Chinese -- is it \"Uigars\"? Is\nthat how it is pronounced?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: \"Uigars.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Who was one of what, 12 or\n13, who was found not to be an enemy combatant, and the\nGovernment's position there was: Go back and do it\nagain in front of another tribunal, another panel,\nwhich, in fact, conveniently found that he was.\nSo the practice of -- of the Government, it\nseems to me, has clearly been to deny the right to\nrelease.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I would disagree,\nJustice Souter. Let me say a couple of things to that.\nOne is that I think with respect to the\nUigars, in particular, there was a problem with ordering\nrelease outright. And it is interesting that when Judge\nRobertson, the same judge, district court judge, who\ndecided the Hamdan case, had before him one of the\nUigars in a habeas petition, he recognized that under\nhabeas he couldn't order release.\nAnd the problem wasn't any kind of inherent\nlimitation on what he could order in his jurisdiction.\nThere was just a practical problem, which was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It was a practical\nproblem. But the fact is that the effectiveness of\nhabeas jurisdiction, for example, in requiring new\ntrials, and so on, depends upon the ultimate sanction,\nwhich is the authority of the court to let somebody go\nif the Government does not comply with a condition.\nAnd the -- the Government practice so far\nunder the DTA seems quite contrary to that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, Justice\nSouter, what I would say is simply this: that if what\nthe Constitution requires to make the DTA to be an\nadequate substitute is the power to order release, there\nis no obstacle in the text of the DTA to that. And the\nAll Writs Act is available to allow them to order\nrelease to protect their jurisdiction under the DTA.\nAnd I think that would be a solution to that problem.\nNow, I think, more broadly, let me -- let me\nsay about the DTA and the MCA, it really does represent\nthe best efforts of the political branches, both\npolitical branches, to try to balance the interest in\nproviding the detainees in this admittedly unique\nsituation additional process with the imperative to\nsuccessfully prosecute the global war on terror.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They get additional\nprocess. The question, I guess, is whether it is an\nadequate substitute for having withdrawn the writ of\nhabeas corpus.\nOn that question, suppose that you are from\nBosnia, and you are held for six years in Guantanamo,\nand the charge is that you helped Al-Qaeda, and you had\nyour hearing before the CSRT.\nAnd now you go to the D.C. Circuit, and here\nis what you say: The CSRT is all wrong. Their\nprocedures are terrible. But just for purposes of\nargument, I concede those procedures are wonderful, and\nI also conclude it reached a perfectly good result.\nOkay? So you concede it for argument's\nsake. But what you want to say is: Judge, I don't care\nhow good those procedures are. I'm from Bosnia. I've\nbeen here six years. The Constitution of the United\nStates does not give anyone the right to hold me six\nyears in Guantanamo without either charging me or\nreleasing me, in the absence of some special procedure\nin Congress for preventive detention.\nThat's the argument I want to make. I don't\nsee anything in this CSRT provision that permits me to\nmake that argument. So I'm asking you: Where can you\nmake that argument?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm not sure that he could\nmake that argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm not sure he can make\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: If he cannot make that\nargument, how does this become an equivalent to habeas,\nsince that happens to be the argument that a large\nnumber of these 305 people would like to make?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let\nme take it this way, which is, of course, you're getting\nto the gravamen of their claim, which is that the DTA\nand the review provided in the D.C. Circuit is not an\nadequate substitute for habeas review.\nAnd I'll start with the assumption for a\nsecond, which I hope is right, because it seems that\nJudge Friendly reached this conclusion -- and it seems\nto me the right conclusion -- which is that the base\nline is 1789.\nAnd if you compare what these detainees have\nunder the DTA in terms of judicial review to what would\nhave been available to them at common law in 1789, it is\nnot even close.\nThis is the remarkable liberalization of the\nwrit, not some retrenchment or suspension of the writ.\nThese detainees at common law would face not one, but\nthree obstacles, to getting into court to make these\nclaims. The first, of course, is the geographical\nlimits on the reach of the writ. The second, but\nequally important, is the line of authority that says\nthat the writ was simply unavailable to prisoners of\nwar. And the third problem would be the\nwell-established common law rule that you can't\ncontrovert the facts as set forth in the return.\nSo at common law, somebody who took the\nincredibly, I think, poor strategic call to concede all\nof their legal arguments away and say only: I have a\nconstitutional claim here to be brought, I don't think\nthey would have gotten into court with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't you simply\nrearguing Rasul?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not at all --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We have passed that point;\nhaven't we?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not at all,\nJustice Souter. And, first of all -- I mean, I take it\nyour -- your principal objection goes to the\ngeographical writ point, because I think that the issues\nabout controverting the facts of the return and the\navailability of the writs to prisoners of war is\nsomething that really wasn't -- had any reason to be\nbefore this Court in Rasul.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it -- it wasn't, and\nI didn't want to get into the prisoner of war point.\nBut if you want to get into it, the problem with your\nprisoner of war point is the United States is not\ntreating them as prisoners of war. They have not been\nadjudicated prisoners of war, or otherwise, under the\nThird Geneva Convention, and that argument on the\nGovernment's part is entirely circular.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nSouter --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, I\nremember in a prior hearing about Guantanamo that the\nGovernment was taking the position firmly that these\ndetainees were not prisoners of war and, therefore, were\nnot entitled to the protection of the Geneva\nconventions.\nSo if the Government is maintaining that\nposition, these people are not prisoners of war, then\nthe treatment of a prisoner of war is not relevant.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect,\nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Souter -- because I think\nit gets to the same point -- we are using \"prisoner of\nwar\" the way that the common law courts use the term\n\"prisoner of war.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the Geneva Convention\nmodeled after the Constitution of the United States?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What it means by \"prisoner\nof war\" is the same thing that the Constitution means?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and -- and -- with\nrespect, the Framers in 1789 had the benefit of the\nthree Spanish soldiers and the Schiever case. They\ndidn't have the benefit of the Geneva Convention.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the three Spanish\nsoldiers were -- were ultimately found to be prisoners\nof war, And, yet, they had process to get into court.\nThere was no question of the jurisdiction of an English\ncourt to entertain their claim.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The writ was denied,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The relief was denied.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, the writ was denied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That had a hearing under\nthe writ.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They did not have a\nhearing. The writ was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then how did the court ever\ncome to the conclusion that, in fact, they were\nprisoners of war?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Because it said that -- it\nlooked at the pleading in the petition. There was no\nhearing. It looked at the petition and it said: on\ntheir own showing, they are prisoners of war. They are\ndenied the writ.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: On their -- on their own\nshowing, but, in fact, the proceeding did not end until\nthe court had come to that conclusion.\nIt was not a conclusion that the court\nassumed simply on the basis of a Government claim in the\nreturn to the writ.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It didn't even ask for a\nreturn, Justice Souter. I mean -- you know, they\ndecided the case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: On the basis of a\nGovernment claim formally or informally proffered to the\nCourt. They -- they came to that conclusion, as you\nsaid, based on the -- on the prisoners' own showing.\nBut the court certainly -- there is no authority in the\nprisoner of war case for saying that if the Government\nmake as claim that one is a prisoner of war -- contrary\nto the Government's prior position, incidentally -- that\nthat forecloses the possibility of consideration under\nthe writ -- the petition as filed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: There is authority for\nthat proposition, Justice Souter. It comes along later\nin the World War II cases in Britain. The reason\nthere's not authority contemporaneous with the 1759\ncases is because these courts are operating with the\ncommon-law rule you can't controvert the facts as set\nforth in a return. So the petitioners in these cases\nwisely didn't make a factual dispute; they made a legal\ndispute. And the courts rejected it time and time\nagain. I thought the Spanish sailors and the Shiver --\nI'd like to just offer you that the 1941 authority --\nbecause this question of course, over time, by 1941, the\nBritish courts have relaxed the rule against\ncontroverting the facts of the return, and they\naddressed this question about what kind of factual\ninquiry is necessary when the government comes back and\nsays that somebody is an enemy combatant, a prisoner of\nwar, or, under the Emergency Detention Act of 1939, a\nthreat to the realm.\nAnd in two cases, Liverridge against\nAnderson and Green against Anderson, the law lords, in\n1941, say that they are not going to look beyond what\nthe government has provided in the return. They're not\neven, in the Green case, going to ask for an affidavit.\nSo if you're looking --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, was that because they\nwere reflecting 1789 practice, or because they were\nreflecting the Defense of the Realm Act? I don't know\nthe answer to that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it is a pretty\ngood snapshot of where things were as of 1941.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Unless you can answer my\nquestion, we don't know what the snapshot proves.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They were exercising\nhabeas jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They were exercising habeas\njurisdiction in a court -- in a polity in which\nParliament is supreme and Parliament had already passed\nthe Defense of the Realm Act, and I don't -- I mean it.\nI don't know the answer to the question I asked you.\nBut I think unless we have an answer to that, we don't\nhave a reliable clue as to the understanding of the\nEnglish courts at a time that's relevant to our inquiry.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think we do have an\nanswer, Justice Souter. It is in the Liverridge case,\nbecause there there's a question of interpreting the\nEmergency Detention Act. And they basically have a\nchoice. They can interpret it to allow the detention to\nturn exclusively on the subjective belief of the home\nsecretary, or they can interpret it to reflect an\nobjective standard. And they choose, over the dissent\nof Lord Atkins, they choose purely subject if standard.\nSo in interpreting a act of Parliament that could have\ngone either way they interpreted under the common law\nwrit to involve no factual inquiry whatsoever. And the\ncase at common law in 1789 is a fortiori from that\nbecause they would not go beyond the facts as set forth\nin the return. And the only response the Petitioners\nhave to that common law rule is they can point to a\ncouple of cases where the courts were tempted and did\naccede to the temptation to peek beyond the return in\nthe context of a child custody case or private custody\ncases.\nBut this is a situation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought we were here\ntalking about -- I see that you have a strong argument\nand they'll have a strong argument in reply. I think\nboth are pretty good, how you interpret these cases. I\nthought we were talking about what the availability of a\nforum in which you can make your argument and they can\nmake their argument, and that's why I'm back to the\nquestion of this is remedy that's given in the statute\nsufficient to allow you to make your argument and their\nto make their argument? And what you said was, when I\nthought I produced an example of an instance they wanted\nto argue quite strongly, and you said no, they couldn't.\nThen you said well, neither could they in\nEngland. Well, that I wonder. That's where I'm back\nto. After all, England doesn't have a written\nconstitution. So it is hardly surprising if they\nconcede everything away in England, they're not going to\nbe able to make any argument. There's nothing left.\nBut let's image in England you had a statute and that\nstatute said the government cannot hold an alien in\nBeckawannaland for six years without either charging\nthem or releasing them. Or except for -- and we have\nsome very detailed preventive detention. Suppose there\nwas a statute like that. And then our friends in\nEngland in whatever year conceded every argument but\nthat one.\nNow, are you going to tell me now that the\nhabeas courts would have said we won't even listen to\nyour argument?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: As Justice Souter pointed\nout -- I mean, if you assume that the statute also said\nany review for that claim should be in the court of\nappeals, not in the traditional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. And you told me\nin this statute the court of appeals will not listen to\nthat argument. And as I read the statute, I agree with\nyou. Because I can find no place where they could make\nthat argument since it does not concern how well this\ntribunal did, nor does it concern the constitutionality\nof the procedures of the tribunal.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, as I\nsay, I think that if you accept that there would be some\ndeference to the ability to bring statutory claims, I\ndon't know why that deference would be limited to the\nsubstance and not to the forum.\nAnd Congress here has spoken. It has\nspoken. The political branch has spoken. They have\nstruck a balance. They've given these detainees better\nrights and access to administrative and judicial review.\nAnyone --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the Court holds that the\nDTA is not an adequate substitute for habeas, what will\nhappen? Will these Petitioners then have access to all\nof the procedures that normally apply in a habeas\nproceeding under 2241? The same right to discovery,\nsubpoena witnesses, access to classified information,\npresence in court?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The government will\ncertainly take the position that they are not entitled\nto those things. Presumably the Petitioners will be\narguing they are entitled to those things.\nThe answers to those questions will be\nunclear because the review provided by the DTA and the\nhabeas statute, if it is applied in this context, either\nway, whatever the vehicle for that judicial review, it\nwill be unprecedented. And there will be difficult\nquestions that will need to be worked out, and I don't\nunderstand why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Clement, if we had\nto either charge or release these people, what would\nthey be charged with? Waging war against the United\nStates? Is there a statute that prevents non-citizens\nfrom waging war against the United States and provides\ncriminal penalties?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not as such,\nJustice Scalia. Now, of course, we might have an\nargument as to some of these individuals, that they\nengaged in unlawful --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand the\ngovernment's position, these people are not in uniform,\nso they're not an under the law of war. They have all\ncommitted murder, not just fighting a war. That's your\ntheory, I think. They are all committed war crimes.\nThose that were caught on the battlefield, I mean. I'm\ntalking about those.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right, and the ones that\nactually killed somebody would have committed murder.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's right. And they\nare not prisoners of war under the law of war, because\nthey were not in uniform.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They don't qualify for\nprisoner of war status, but just to be clear I think\ncertainly when the British cases are talking about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about common\nlaw. I mean under the law of war, the common law of\nwar. They were not prisoners of war.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They would not qualify for\nprisoner of war status. They're enemy combatants --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Their engaging in war-like\nacts would be the crime of murder or the crime of\nassault and so forth and so on. That's how I understand\nyour theory in one of these prosecutions is that not --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That would be our theory\nin those cases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean it is your theory?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That would be our theory\nin those cases -- and it is our theory in those cases\nwe've chosen to prosecute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- in the military\ncommissions, but there are other individuals with\nrespect to whom we don't have the right kind of evidence\nin order to go with the full-blown military commission\ntrial, but we still have the option that this Court\nrecognized in Kirin and Hamdi and most particularly in\nKirin, not just to try people who are unlawful\ncombatants for their unlawful combatancy, but also to\nhold them as we would hold anybody else who was captured\nas preventative detention.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: For the duration of\nhostilities, if you can show that they are enemies.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think if we can\nshow that they were enemy combatants, that's exactly\nright.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you are operating today\nunder a broader concept, as I understand it, of \"enemy\ncombatant\"?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Than? I'm sorry? Broader\nthan what?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Than was indeed the case\nfor example in our early litigation, let alone at the\ntime of Kirin.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well two things,\nJustice Souter. One thing is that with respect to the\ndefinition that the military commissions -- I'm sorry --\nthat the C-Cert 7 apply, that is a broader definition, I\nwould quickly add though that with respect to the\nmajority of individuals -- I mean you have the\nPetitioners from Bosnia that Mr. Waxman represents, but\nmost of these people were seized in Pakistan and\nAfghanistan, and so the situation is not that different.\nAnd obviously we would take the position to the extent\nyou have some concerns about the breadth of the\ndefinition, what this Court -- what the plurality said\nin Hamdi in footnote 1 gets it exactly right. The way\nto deal with those concerns is in the adjudication of\nparticular cases which can take place under the DTA or\ncan take place in habeas.\nAnd again I think the burden --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But how can -- and this\nagain, maybe I should know the answer to this, but I\ndon't. How could that be litigated under the DTA?\nDoesn't any proceeding under the DTA simply have to\naccept the statutory definition?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, it does not. I mean\nit's a regulatory --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean -- you're saying\nif it gets to the court of appeals, they can raise the\nconstitutional claim that the definition is broader than\nconstitutionally could be enforced. Is that what you're\nsaying?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That was in my points,\nJustice Souter. So I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't understand that\npoint when you were having your colloquy with\nJustice Breyer, either. I thought you were going to\nanswer to Justice Breyer, that the court of appeals does\nhave the right to determine whether to the extent the\nConstitution and the laws of the United States are\napplicable, whether such standards and procedures, such\nas CSRT, are -- - to make the determination -- are\nconsistent with the Constitution --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's provided in the\nMCA.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It absolutely is. I think\nJustice Breyer's hypothetical was cleverly crafted,\nthough, to take that off the table.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It wasn't cleverly\nredrafted. I wanted to say that the people I'm thinking\nof are not challenging those procedures. What they say\nis you could have the best procedure in the world, and\nthey're totally constitutional -- we'll assume that --\nthey're assuming it. They're not going to concede it.\nThey're assuming it.\nOn that assumption, we still think that\nCongress, the President, the Supreme Court under the\nlaw, cannot hold us for six years without either trying\nus, releasing us, or maybe confining us under some\nspecial statute involving preventive detention and\ndanger which has not yet been enacted.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the statute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are arguing it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the statute talks\nabout standards. Why can't that question that\nJustice Breyer raised be reached by the Court of Appeals\nunder the CSRT review hearings when it determines the\nconstitutional adequacy of the standards, or am I\nmissing something?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think, again, that\nJustice Breyer's hypothetical, as I understood it, sort\nof assumed away the adequacy of all of the standards and\njust said: Putting all of that to one side, I have some\nother constitutional claim.\nAnd I'm just not so sure that habeas ever\nallowed you to sort of bring every claim that you\npossibly wanted to; and I think the -- what I -- the way\nI read this Court's Hamdi decision is what was\nenvisioned on a habeas case in a case where Army\nRegulation 190-8, which, of course, the plurality cited,\nwas complied with. It was in that case: The habeas\npetition in court would take that as a starting point,\nand that you wouldn't necessarily be able to say: Look,\nit was nice that we had that proceeding, but put that to\none side. I have another claim.\nI don't think the court, even in habeas,\nwould have envisioned that that would go forward.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just one more question on\nthat point: Would the Court of Appeals in -- under the\nMCA have the authority to question the constitutionality\nof the definition of noncombatant -- of unlawful\ncombatant?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely,\nJustice Kennedy. That would be available to them in the\nD.C. Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, I thought\nyour answer to Justice Breyer -- and maybe I'm missing\nsomething -- would be that there is a third alternative\nwhich he didn't consider, namely: That these are\ncombatants picked up on the battlefield, and they may be\ndetained indefinitely without proving they committed a\ncrime.\nAnd that is your position, I think.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is our position. I\nmean I want to give Justice Breyer's hypothetical its\ndue. I mean there might be claims that you could have\nbrought, hypothetical claims that you could have brought\nat some level, and that the DTA does --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You have a hypothetical\nclaim that a particular prisoner says: I was kidnapped\nby people who were not in the United States Army and\nsold for a bounty. And I am -- I just happened to be\nthere when I got kidnapped.\nAnd then there is a genuine question of fact\nas to whether the fact that they may have been sold in\nthat manner justifies detention, which is a different\nquestion entirely from whether they committed a\nviolation under the law of war.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely,\nJustice Stevens. But that question, of course, can be\nconsidered by the D.C. Circuit on review, because\nthey're specifically entitled to a preponderance review\nin the D.C. Circuit. So that's a claim that they\nclearly could bring.\nThey can also bring the statutory and\nconstitutional claims to the standards and procedures,\nand they can make claims that the procedures that are\nset forth in the CSRTs are not provided. And I think,\nagain, if you compare that to what they would have had\nat the common law, and you ask the question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me interrupt again,\nand I know your argument. But with respect to those\nclaims, do you make the argument in your brief that some\nevidence is enough to refute that claim, or do you say\nit is a preponderance standard?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It's a preponderance\nstandard, and that's what is set forth in the statute.\nAnd, again, that's something where Congress specifically\ngot involved in the CSRTs in a way that I think is\ndifferent from the Hamdan case and Congress's\ninvolvement with the Military Commissions. In the\nMilitary Commissions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose any\nchallenges to the adequacy of the standards, or\nwhatever, are the sort of things that would be raised in\nthe D.C. Circuit. And we don't know what that's going\nto look like yet, because the D.C. Circuit hasn't had an\nopportunity to rule on those.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right,\nMr. Chief Justice. And that's why, as we say in the\nbrief -- I mean there's a sense in which this is really\na facial challenge.\nI mean, in order for them to prevail with\nthe argument that DTA review is an inadequate\nsubstitute, they really have to say that it is\ninherently an inadequate substitute. That no matter\nkind of how many times the D.C. Circuit cuts the\nPetitioner a break --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the main issue the\nfact that it has taken six years to have the issue\nresolved -- \"relevant\" --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They say they have\nbeen unlawfully detained for six years from the\nbeginning. And isn't that delay relevant to the\nquestion of whether they have been provided such a\nwonderful set of procedures?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nthink the delay is going to be relevant to whether or\nnot courts should expedite hearings, and the like. But\nI don't think it should cloud the basic constitutional\nquestion before this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The procedures that\nare before us under the DTA and the MCA, of course,\nweren't available for the whole six-year period, were\nthey?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, of course not. And I\nthink it is worth recognizing that Congress legislated\nin this area not in year one, and then six years have\ngone by. Congress legislated with these particular\nprocedures and this level of review in years four and\nfive.\nAnd the fact that they didn't immediately\ntake effect, I think, is not an accident. It is a\nproduct of the fact that Congress in this area was\nproviding unprecedented review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And, of course, when you\ndo something unprecedented, new questions will arise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think, to go back to\nthe beginning, my notion of your position was you never\nget to that question: Is the review of these procedures\nadequate in the D.C. Circuit, because there is no\nauthority, period, for the D.C. Circuit to engage -- to\ngrant what is before us is if the -- our applications\nfor a writ of habeas corpus.\nYou say that's out the door. They might\nbring some other proceedings. I thought that was your\nposition.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that is our\nposition, Justice Ginsburg. But our position is they\nwant -- they styled something -- they filed something\ncalled a habeas petition. Congress subsequently has\ncome in and said: The way we are going to deal with\nthis is we are going to remove jurisdiction for that\nhabeas petition, and we're going to allow you to file a\nDTA review provision -- a DTA review petition.\nNow, their argument is that Congress can't\nforce that choice on them because this is an inadequate\nsubstitute for habeas. The Suspension Clause applies in\nGuantanamo; and therefore, the DTA is effectively\nunconstitutional to the extent it prevents us with\nproceeding with our habeas petition.\nNow, there are a variety of ways this Court\ncould reject that claim. It seems to me that the most\nstraightforward way, though, is to simply ask the\nquestion: If the level of review provided by the DTA in\nthe DTA petition were provided by statute in 1789 or\neven 1941, for that matter, would it have been seen as a\nliberalization of the writ, or a contraction and\nsuspension of the writ?\nAnd I think it is very, very clear that if\nthis statute had passed, if this kind of review was\nprovided in 1789 or in 1941, it would have been greeted\nas a remarkable -- remarkable liberalization of the writ\nas it had then been understood.\nAnd I think we are in the situation where\nthese individuals, for the first time, are really\nallowed this kind of access to the court system.\nAnd when that happens, there are going to be\ndifficult questions. We have difficult questions about\nwhat the record on review is. We have difficult\nquestions about the extent to which classified\ninformation should come in.\nBut all of those difficult questions are\ngoing to be waiting for us if we go back to the habeas\ncourts, because the same kind of issues --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, on that -- and you\njust mentioned remedy. Suppose, contrary to what you\nhope for, that the Court were to say that this is -- we\nhave a minute or two.\nSuppose they were to say that this is an\nunconstitutional suspension of the writ, and that the\nremedy here written in the statute is not adequate in\nrespect to many claims that might be made.\nOn that assumption, the habeas would lie.\nNow, it has been six years, and habeas is supposed to be\nspeedy.\nAnd, yet, people have serious arguments,\nanyway, that they are being held for six years without\neven having those arguments heard.\nIs there anything in your opinion that this\nCourt could say by way of remedy that could get the\nD.C. Circuit or the others to decide this and the CSRT\nclaims, there are 305 people to do this quickly within a\nperiod of months rather than six more years? And if so,\nwhat?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, obviously lower\ncourts take anything this Court says very, very\nseriously. So, if this Court makes it clear --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are we faced with this\nproblem, and I don't want to put you right on the spot,\nwhat approximately would you say in respect to this?\nBecause it is a serious problem.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean -- let me --\nif I could, I would answer it as to what this Court\nshould say about what the D.C. Circuit should do on DTA\nreview. I prefer to discuss the opinion where we win\nrather than the opinion where we lose.\nAs to that opinion, the courts -- the lower\ncourts should be instructed to with due cognizance for\nthe fact these individuals have been detained six years\nand this is the process that has been provided in order\nto decide whether or not that continuing custody is\nlawful, they should expedite this to the greatest extent\npossible.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How can we fit your\nposition when we have no jurisdiction here?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you win, we never get to\nthese issues.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect if you win --\nif we win, you still write an opinion saying that we\nwin, and that opinion can still say everything --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Our opinion says have a\nnice day, everybody.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can't win without\nreversing the Court of Appeals.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You can certainly affirm\non alternative grounds.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we affirmed on\nalternative grounds, leaving the court of appeals'\nreasoning as it stands, these interesting questions that\nyou referred to will never arise.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's\nright, Justice Souter. There is active litigation going\non in the D.C. Circuit over basically these questions\nand how this litigation is going to take place. And if\nthis Court in affirming on -- begrudgingly affirming and\ndirecting the D.C. Circuit to move with all appropriate\ndispatch, that's going to be read just as carefully and\ntaken just as seriously if it's an affirmance than if\nit's a vacate or a reversal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that because the\nwithdrawal of jurisdiction does not apply to review of\nthe proceedings in the D.C. Circuit that's provided\nunder the statute? In other words, your argument that\nthe habeas jurisdiction doesn't extend doesn't reach the\nreview of the adequacy of the DTA proceedings?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right.\nThat's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why would they litigate\nthat adequacy if they have determined in advance that\nsubstantively the individuals who are petitioning have\nabsolutely no rights?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They hadn't decided that,\nJustice Souter. That might have been a problem back in\nRasul. But now whatever the answer to the question of\nwhether the Constitution provides rights in Guantanamo,\nthey have rights. They have the statutory right to\npreponderance review. They have a statutory right to\nhave the military follow its own procedures. And they\nhave lots of arguments in the lower courts trying to\ntake advantage of those rights that they have.\nSo there will be a meaningful procedure in\nthe D.C. Circuit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At the end of the day, the\nonly thing, as I understand it, that could possibly be\nadjudicated would be the question of formal adherence to\nprocedure or not. There would never be an adjudication\nthat ever went to the merits because the merits issue,\nas I understand it, is already -- I mean merits of\nrelief -- have already been prior admitted by the\nexisting determination of the circuit in this case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I'm\nnot sure that this Court -- I understand your question,\nI believe, which is that the D.C. Circuit, I think,\nalmost unavoidably reading this Court's Rasul decision\nand reading it as a statutory rather than a\nconstitutional holding, has stuck with its circuit\nprecedent and said that there aren't constitutional\nrights here. That is going to be true unless this Court\nreverses it in habeas or in the DTA review.\nIt would seem particularly strange that if\nthat's the real problem that this Court would somehow\ndecide, well, you know, we really think the DTA is an\nadequate substitute, but the only way we can correct\nthis other mistake, in our view, that the D.C. Circuit\nis laboring under is to rule against the government.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You were arguing that the\nquestion of the adequacy of the substitution should, in\nfact, be litigated in a plenary fashion in the Court of\nAppeals or the district court for that matter?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. I think that's the\nissue before this Court now. And this Court, for\nexample --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said a moment\nago that there were all of these interesting questions\nthat could be explored if there was a remand?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm sorry, Justice Souter,\nI may have misspoke.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I misunderstood you.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The interesting questions\nthat I think are left on the remand, no matter what, are\nissues about whether or not based on the Abraham\ndeclaration that the military followed their own\nprocedures for assembling the record below, or whether\nthe military followed its own procedures for providing\nexculpatory evidence. Those are all questions that\naren't questions that require the answer to the question\nof whether Eisentrager is still good law --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are talking about in\neffect about evidentiary procedural questions?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about\ntaking the statute, Congress's statute that set up this\nsystem with limited review in the D.C. Circuit and\nsaying that's it. The D.C. Circuit never got to that\nquestion because it said the acts that these people are\ntrying to bring habeas doesn't exist. The only thing\nthat they have, the only remedy they have is the one\nthat Congress provided. And it seems to me the only\nquestion before us is whether there is jurisdiction in\nthe court of appeals to decide that threshold issue.\nThey tossed it out and didn't reach -- didn't say one\nword about the adequacy of the procedures or of the\nthings that you're talking about.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right,\nJustice Ginsburg. I want to be clear that my position\nis that an alternative ground for affirmance, which\nwould allow this Court to address some of those\nquestions, is that the D.C. Circuit was right to say\nthat the DTA review, that the habeas petition should be\ndismissed. The reason they were right is because the\nDTA is an adequate substitute for habeas.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be -- we would\nbe deciding that as a court of first view because they\ndidn't decide that? You don't need an adequate\nsubstitute for habeas because you have no right to\nhabeas.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's a fair\nobservation, but obviously this Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: In the context -- I mean\nthis has been fully briefed in, and in the context of\nwhere the Court uses an alternative ground for\naffirmance, it would not be a novel situation, I don't\nthink.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, your\nsuggested reason why they're right is quite different\nfrom the reason they actually gave. They did not reach\nthe question of the adequacy of these procedures.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's a fair\npoint, Justice Stevens, though I would say that really\ntheir reasoning encapsulates one of the three reasons\nwhy at common law they were right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but they did not\nreach this very important part of the whole case. And,\nOf course, the substitute procedures here are not nearly\nthe same as those in our prior cases of where we\nsustained the 2255 and district here.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, that's right,\nJustice Stevens, but in fairness, in those situations\nyou were dealing with sort of substitutes for core\nhabeas under situations where they're was no dispute\nthat there was a robust right to habeas at common law,\nand so here you first deal with the situation of -- all\nright, the baseline is, as Judge Friendly suggests,\n1789, is this an adequate substitute? And that even if\nsomehow -- and I don't know how you get past that --\nthen you I think still might ask the question that this\nCourt asked in the Felker case, which is, you know,\ngiving some deference to Congress's ability to shape the\nscope of the writ, is there a problem here? I think we\nwould point the Court to Felker.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you say those later\ncases are not relevant because habeas corpus in the\nmodern world is much broader than it was in 1789.\nThat's part of your point?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is part of our point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And we would say, though\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the comparison you ask\nus to make is between what the habeas writ was in 1789,\nnot what the comparison to a habeas writ would be today?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We would start with that\nproposition, but I think this isn't a case where it's\njust 1789 versus today because as I read this -- -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think you would\nseriously contend that the procedures set forth in the\nstatute are equivalent to those afforded under the\nhabeas writ under today's jurisdiction?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It's a hard question for\nme to answer -- -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At least you haven't\nargued that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, no, but I mean the\nquestion is, you know, in a different case, sure, there\nwould be a different habeas. But we don't know sort of\nthe answer as to what habeas looks like in the context\nof enemy combatants detained in a place like Guantanamo,\nand we suggest, based on our best reading of Hamdi that,\nif there was habeas jurisdiction now, that the\nproceeding that would unfold would not be the plenary\nhabeas that is envisioned by Petitioners but would be a\nmuch more narrowly circumscribed habeas. I would also\npoint out that, again, it's not just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: On the point I made, I\nthink that's critical to your argument that the\nsubstitute is adequate.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right. I\nwould say, though, that our only baseline is not 1789\nbecause, as we read this Court's decision in Rasul,\nRasul is based on the predicate that until 1973 and\nBraden's overruling of Ahrens, that the habeas statute\nwould not have gone to Guantanamo. And unless this\nCourt is willing to say that there was an inchoate\nSuspension Clause violation until 1973 when Braden comes\nalong, it seems like the tradition in this country too,\nbased on the immediate custodian rule and the\nterritorial jurisdiction of the courts, was that habeas\nin Guantanamo is a novelty. It's -- 1973 at best.\nIf I could finish with just bringing the\nCourt's attention to one thing. This is in an amicus\nbrief that is in support of us, the Criminal Justice\nLegal Foundation brief. But there's sufficiently little\nprecedence for the Court to rely on, and I want the\nCourt to have this: The Schiever case, which is one of\nthe prisoner-of-war cases. There's not -- in the Rasul\ncase, Justice Stevens, and the parties, we both cited to\nvolume 97 of English Reporter and the report of the case\nby Burrow -- there is in the English Reports an\nalternative report of that case, from Kenyon. And the\nreport of that case which is 96 English Reports 1249 is\nactually longer on the law, shorter on the facts, but\nlonger on the law than the report by Lord Burrow. So I\nwanted the court to have that available to them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nGeneral Clement.\nMr. Waxman, we'll give you five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH W. WAXMAN.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI want to speak mostly about the adequacy of\nthe substitute and particularly the question that you\nand Justice Kennedy asked about adjudication of the\nstandard on remand, but just to take first things first,\nI don't -- I don't believe I've ever seen the\ngovernment's -- the case Liverridge or Green cases cited\nby the government before. And I don't know what they\nsay. But it is absolutely incorrect that DTA review of\nthe CSRTs is a liberalization of the traditional writ.\nAs this Court made -- or the King's Bench made clear in\nthe Bushell's case and all of the commentators including\nSharpe, who both sides are citing as authoritative, here\nagree in cases of executive detention, where there\nwasn't a trial occurring, the court absolutely could --\nthe prisoner could controvert the facts of the return in\nSchiever and Spanish Citizens -- Spanish Prisoners,\nthere wasn't an original hearing because the court\nissued -- sat as nisi prius court and considered\naffidavits of the prisoners and third parties and\ndetermined on the basis of the affidavits that they were\nprisoners of war.\nBut it is absolutely clear that the writ did\nextend to the question of \"I am not a combatant. I am\nnot a warrior, number one. And number two, it did go in\nnon-criminal detentions to the underlying facts of the\ndetention, and that goes to the point about the standard\nthat Justice Kennedy asked and the Chief Justice asked.\nWe agree that, if and when the D.C. Circuit\never addresses the merits of these cases, and not only\nis there no CSR -- complete record on return in any\ncase, but the government has suggested they proceed five\nat a time, and we're now two years running without a\nsingle one -- but there's no doubt that the argument\nwe're making in Roman numeral 2 of our brief, that the\nCSR, the Wolfowitz definition is not authorized\ndetention under the AUMF, which as this Court in Hamdi\nsaid, incorporates long-established law-of-war\nprinciples and American traditions.\nWe can raise that claim because they have to\nestablish that the procedures and standards were\nconsistent not only with the Constitution but also with\nthe laws of the United States. And the problem this is\nthis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is an argument\nthat, I gather, both sides agree is available to you\nunder the DTA before the D.C. Circuit.\nMR. WAXMAN: That is absolutely correct.\nBut what -- what habeas at its core was -- and we're\ntalking -- I'm happy to live in the world of 1789 now --\nis executive detention and not the more modern\ninnovations where, well, certain procedures weren't\nconstitutional or whatever, but you have no right to\nhold me. The facts won't allow you to hold me. The\nD.C. Circuit cannot --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What does that tell you\nabout the adequacy of the substitute?\nMR. WAXMAN: Because the D.C. Circuit --\nbecause the D.C. Circuit is reviewing a record that was\nadduced ex parte, in camera, with a presumption to boot\nthat it is -- that the evidence is both accurate and\ncomplete, and the D.C. Circuit is -- has already said it\nwill not hear any new evidence and it must apply that\nsame presumption that that evidence that was heard ex\nparte in camera with its own presumption is correct.\nAnd here's -- let me just give you an example of what\ndifference this makes. You have the unredacted version\nof Judge Green's district court opinion. I don't. She\ndiscusses -- she does address the adequacy of the\nsubstitute. And she addresses the case of two\nindividuals. One is Mr. Ait-Idir, who is my client, and\nyou have both in her opinion and our brief this truly\nKafka-esque colloquy at his hearing in which he is\naccused of associating with a known Al-Qaeda operative,\nwhich he denies, but he can't be told the name.\nMr. Kurnaz is the other Petitioner who is\ndiscussed in her brief. He was a Petitioner in this\nCourt, but he has since been released by the government\nbecause of the fact that he had what the CSRTs won't\ngive him, which is a lawyer. He was told, two years\nafter he was detained -- he's a German permanent\nresident -- he was told at his CSRT, as many of these\nindividuals were not, that he was being held because he\nassociated with a known terrorist. And he was told the\nname.\nHe was told that he associated with somebody\ncalled Selcook Bilgen who, the government contended, was\n(a) a terrorist, who was -- had blown himself up while\nMr. Kurnaz was in detention -- may I simply finish this\naccount -- while he was in detention and in a suicide\nbombing; and all that Mr. Kurnaz could say at his CSRT\nwhere he had no lawyer and had no access to information\nwas I never had any reason to suspect he was a\nterrorist.\nWell, when the government, in the habeas\nproceedings, filed its factual return in Judge Green's\ncourt, it filed as its factual return the CSRT record.\nHis counsel saw that accusation. Within 24 hours, his\ncounsel had affidavits not only from the German\nprosecutor but from the supposedly deceased Mr. Bilgen,\nwho is a resident of Dresden never involved in terrorism\nand fully getting on with his life.\nThat's what -- and that evidence would not\nhave been allowed in under DTA review. It wouldn't have\nbeen in the CSRT, and it won't come in under DTA review.\nAnd that's why it is inadequate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Waxman.\n"
