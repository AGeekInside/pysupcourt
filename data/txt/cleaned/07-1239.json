        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument\nfirst in Case 07-1239, Winter v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council. General Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Mr.\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe ability to locate and track an enemy\nsubmarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar\nis vitally important to the survival of our naval strike\ngroups deployed around the world and therefore critical\nto the nation's own security. In this case the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places\nserious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in\ntraining exercises that in the judgment of the President\nand his top naval officers are in the paramount\ninterests of the United States. That injunction is\nfundamentally flawed for three principal reasons.\nFirst, it is based on an erroneous\nassessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's\nNEPA claim. Second it is based on an erroneous\nconception of the showing of irreparable injury\nnecessary to secure what this Court has aptly called\n\"the extraordinary and dramatic remedy\" of a preliminary\ninjunction. And finally, it fails to take account the\nvital public interests in conducting the training\nexercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's\nrestrictions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, when you\naddress the injunction, do you mean the injunction as\noriginally ordered by the district court or are you\ntaking account of the modification made by the Ninth\nCircuit, and would you say that the three points you\njust made would apply as well to the injunction as\nmodified?\nGENERAL GARRE: Certainly we would,\nJustice Ginsburg. Obviously our position on the NEPA\nclaim is the same with respect to any aspect of the\ninjunction. So too with the risk of irreparable harm\nwhich we think Respondents haven't shown. The Ninth\nCircuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial\nstay. It's important to keep in mind that its\nmodifications were tied only to a stay. It didn't\nactually modify the injunction. So even if this Court\nthought those modifications were appropriate, it would\nhave to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again? I'm not sure\nI --\nGENERAL GARRE: The Ninth Circuit framed its\nmodifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision\naffirming the district court's preliminary injunction.\nThat stay and therefore those modifications remained in\neffect only until this Court issued its decision in this\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the temporary\nstay pending certiorari, right?\nGENERAL GARRE: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think what\nJustice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can\ncorrect me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from\nthe initial preliminary injunction and the modified\npreliminary injunction.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, yes, we are here\ncomplaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard\nshutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes\nwithin 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these\nstrike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as\nwell as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when\nsignificant surface ducting conditions are present\nregardless of the presence of marine mammals.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You mentioned the effect on\nnaval operations. On the other side, could you say what\nthe record shows about the number of marine mammals that\nare likely to be killed or receive actual physical\ninjury if the -- as opposed to some sort of behavioral\nmodification, if the injunction is allowed to continue?\nGENERAL GARRE: The record -- and here I'm\nreferring to the environmental assessment and the\nopinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the\npetition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates\nthat no marine mammal will be killed as a result of\nthese exercises. The environmental assessment predicted\nthere would be eight instances of injurious harm. These\neight instances would take place only with respect to a\ncommon species of dolphins of which there are hundreds\nof thousands in the Southern California Operating Area.\nNow, the environmental assessment also\npredicted that there would be a much greater number,\n170,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level\nB takes. These are temporary and by definition\nnon-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at\npages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the\nJA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances,\nthe vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the\nenvironmental assessment, are temporary and\nnon-injurious.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just as to dolphins?\nGENERAL GARRE: The vast majority of those\ndisturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to\ndolphins.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what percentage is\nthat of the total population in the area?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I think that the\nstatistics I have indicate that there are more than I\nthink 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there. As\nto -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in\nthe Southern California Operating Area. But this is --\nno one suggests that is in any way a threatened species.\nWith respect to the species that are\nendangered, threatened, or even strategic under the\nMarine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine\nFisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse\nharm on the population level or with respect to annual\nrecruitment rates with respect to those endangered or\nthreatened species in the biological opinion that the\ndistrict court sustained and that Respondents are not\nchallenging on appeal.\nThe focus of their claim of irreparable\ninjury -- and keep in mind that that environmental\nassessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year\nhistory of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern\nCalifornia Operating Area at the same frequency and, if\nanything, during more frequent training exercises than\nhave been conducted in recent years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the\n564 exposures that were typed Level A in the\nenvironmental assessment.\nGENERAL GARRE: With respect to beaked\nwhales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. Those\ndisturbances are temporary, non-injurious disturbances.\nThat's important. Let me give you the page cites to the\nrecord on that because it's an important point. JA 178\nto 180, JA 185 to 188, and JA 198 to 200 discuss each\nspecies of the beaked whales and explain that the harms\nthat are predicted in the environmental assessment are\nnon-injurious, temporary harms.\nNow as a policy matter --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In lay terms, what does that\nmean? Does it mean an alteration of their swimming\npattern, their migration pattern? What does it mean?\nGENERAL GARRE: In most cases it means that\nthere's an alerting response, they hear the sound and\nthey go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a\nnoise that disturbs them would ordinarily do. It can\nalso mean that they could have some temporary effect on\ntheir feeding or breeding patterns, but it's a temporary\neffect.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It doesn't necessarily mean\nthat there's a physical injury to them, does it?\nGENERAL GARRE: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It means that they may just\nswim in a different direction.\nGENERAL GARRE: That's right. By definition\nonly a Level A take involves an injurious harm, that is\na physical harm which results in permanent damage to\ntissue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the 564 number\nwas Level A, which I also thought meant exposure\nresulting in severe harm.\nGENERAL GARRE: It is confusing,\nJustice Ginsburg. The Navy as a policy matter described\nfor purposes of the environmental assessment the Level B\ntakes with respect to beaked whales as Level A takes\nbecause the Navy acknowledged that there is uncertainty\nabout the effects of sonar on beaked whales. But when\nyou look at what the environmental assessment says as to\nthe actual injuries that the National Marine Fish and\nWildlife Service and the Navy predicted based on the\nbest science available to them and to us today, they are\nnon-injurious, temporary exposures, and that is made\nclear at the portions of the JA that I mentioned.\nNow, the Navy -- there is nothing that\nprevents an agency from characterizing the particular\nharm one way or the other as a policy matter for\npurposes of an environmental assessment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,\nMr. Solicitor General. Is it understood, though, that\nthere is a duty to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes, there is, because we're\nnot here arguing that, at this point, that we had no\nduty to prepare an environmental impact statement\nbecause of the intervening event of the Council for\nEnvironmental Quality's emergency circumstances\nalternative arrangements determination. That's the\npertinent administrative event for purposes of\nRespondent's claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me follow that.\nYou concede that you have to prepare an EIS in light of\nthe CEQ's emergency circumstances?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes, it's one of the\nalternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is\nthat the environmental impact statement which has been\nunder way will be completed by January 2009 with respect\nto all activities in the Southern California Operating\nArea. Now, that's not to say that we concede that an\nenvironmental impact statement was not required -- was\nrequired at the outset. The Navy doesn't concede that.\nIt litigated this case up to the point of the Council\nfor Environmental Quality's determination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why didn't you -- I\nmean, you emphasize the level of detail and\ncomprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that\nthe Navy prepared. Why didn't you just make -- why\ndidn't you just go ahead and do an EIS from the outset\nif you were going to engage in such effort with respect\nto the environmental assessment?\nGENERAL GARRE: Because the Navy devoted its\nbest resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate\nbide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded\nthat there would not be a finding of significant\nenvironmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees\nan environmental impact statement is not required.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you have to do it.\nGiven all your work so far, how long would it take? You\nhad several months already, so how long? When could you\ndo it by?\nGENERAL GARRE: It's going to be completed\nby January 2009, Justice Breyer, under the alternative\narrangements that have been approved --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we're talking about two\nmonths.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, at this point we are.\nThe point that the Navy faced in January of 2008, where\nit had an injunction against its use of sonar in these\ntraining exercises and only an environmental impact\nstatement, it faced, as the Council of Environmental\nQuality found, emergency circumstances in terms of the\nneed to conduct these training exercises.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that you're are\nhere because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit,\nand I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the\ngovernment on an ongoing basis; and what are the\nprincipal reasons for that?\nGENERAL GARRE: Because of its impact on\nnational security, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what particular\nerrors? The standard for review -- pardon me. The\nstandard for the grant or denial of injunction? What\nare the principal areas you want to present to us?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think there are three\nfundamental flaws, as I indicated. One, we think the\nNinth Circuit just got the NEPA claim wrong. The Navy\nis complying with NEPA through the alternative\narrangements and the regulations, but the CEQ found --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where was the statutory\nauthority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS?\nYou mentioned a regulation. Where in the statute does\nit say that the Council on Environmental Quality can\ndispense with this requirement?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think we would point to a\ncouple of things. First, in terms of the statute, NEPA\nsays that the obligations of the statute should be\ncomplied with to the fullest extent. And it doesn't\nspecifically say what happens if they are not followed.\nThese are procedural requirements. Secondly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's not the\nquestion I am asking. I am not asking about the\nconsequences of not complying. I am asking what is the\nstatutory authority for the Council on Environmental\nQuality to dispense with the statutory obligation to\nprepare it?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what -- as I\nunderstand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as\nan intervening -- as of intervening legal significance.\nAnd I want to know what the statutory authority is for\nthat. I don't see it in NEPA.\nGENERAL GARRE: The statutory authority that\nwe find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for\nalternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged\nby this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority. The\nCourt acknowledged that in Department of Transportation\nv. Public Citizen. So we take that as a given.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. As a general\nproposition that's fine, but what's the statutory\nauthority for them to engage in rulemaking authority\nthat dispenses with the government's obligation to\ncomply with an EIS requirement?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, let me -- I'll answer\nthe question, but let me be clear: The government's\nposition is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by\ncomplying with the alternative arrangements provided by\nthe Council on Environmental Quality.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- I mean, the\nclaim is that you weren't complying with it at the time\nthe request for an injunction was brought, and\neverything else is consequent on that. So I want to go\nback to the point, in effect, at which the claim was\nmade that the government is not complying. One of your\nanswers to that is right now, as a result of subsequent\nCouncil on Environmental Quality action, we're not in\nthe same situation that we were in when the suit was\nbrought. And I want to know what the statutory\nauthority is for the Council on Environmental Quality to\ntake the action with the effect that you claim it has.\nGENERAL GARRE: And I would point, Your\nHonor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be\ncomplied with to the fullest extent possible --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That --\nGENERAL GARRE: -- and I would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- seems to cut against\nyou. I am not getting it.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, that language, coupled\nwith -- which seems to us to suggest that compliance to\nthe fullest extent possible would depend on the\ncircumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't\nimpose, doesn't say what the consequences of\nnoncompliance would be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --\nGENERAL GARRE: -- but other --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- I don't\nknow if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ?\nI mean, NEPA doesn't really give anybody any regulatory\nauthority -- EPA, CEQ. And it seems to me that CEQ is\nan odd entity to be doing this. They're more or less an\noffice in the White House, rather than a free-standing\nagency.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, this Court has\nacknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the\nPublic Citizen case a few years ago, that NEPA gives CEQ\nrulemaking authority, and that this Court gives\nsubstantial deference to the CEQ's rules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Rulemaking to do what?\nTo set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to\ncarry out their obligations under NEPA?\nGENERAL GARRE: To implement the statute,\nthat's right. And there are a number of important\nprocedural requirements that go far beyond what the\nstatute requires that the CEQ has laid out in its\nregulations. One of the regulations -- and this has\nbeen on the books since 1979 and has been implemented\nsome 40 times. So this isn't something that was made up\nin this case. It's an established regulatory practice\nunder NEPA that where there are emergency circumstances\nan agency can come up with alternative arrangements to\ncomply with its NEPA obligations. And here those\nalternative arrangements were: One, to complete an EIS\nthat is under way for all sonar activities and all other\nactivities by the Navy in the Southern California\noperating area by January 2009. The Navy is going to\nmeet that goal. Two, to adopt the mitigation measures\nspelled out in the alternative arrangements. Three, to\nprovide for public participation so that there could be\ncomment on any concerns to marine mammals in the area.\nAnd four, to provide for research into harms to marine\nmammals. These were significant arrangements that the\nNavy agreed to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what good is it if,\nas I understand it, the whole training program will be\nover in December, and then the environmental impact\nstatement, which was supposed to come first, is going to\ncome after the whole project is concluded?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, it has -- it's\nimportant because the environmental impact statement\nthat's going to be completed pertains not only to\nCOMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the\nSouthern California Operating Area in the future, but\nall activities. So that environmental impact statement\nis going to be very meaningful.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me switch\nback. Chief?\nLet me switch back in time for a second to\nthe beginning of these exercises. One of the -- I mean,\none of the arguments, and you have alluded to it, for I\nguess the appropriateness of the Council on\nEnvironmental Quality's action, if it has any power to\nact, is emergency circumstances. My understanding, and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong on the facts, is that the\nexercises began in February of 2007. My understanding\nis that it was in that same month of February 2007 that\nthe Navy produced the EA, the environmental assessment,\nso that in effect, as I understand it, the Navy\ndisclosed the fact that it would not provide an EIS at\njust about the same moment that it began the exercises.\nGENERAL GARRE: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I guess my question is,\nto the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the\nemergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any\ntimely action? I am assuming in my question that the\nNavy had decided before February 1st, 2007, that it was\ngoing to have these exercises. So it sounds to me as\nthough that, if there is an emergency, it's one that the\nNavy created simply by failing to start an EIS\npreparation in a timely way at which it tried in effect\nto sort of neutralize by keeping everybody in the dark\nuntil the last moment. So, why -- why shouldn't we say\nthat -- even assuming the Council on Environmental\nQuality can somehow dispense with the statute, why\nshouldn't we say that there was no emergency here except\none which was created by the Navy's apparently\ndeliberate inattention?\nGENERAL GARRE: For several reasons,\nJustice Souter. First, there was a gap between when the\nNavy issued its environmental assessment and when the\nfirst training exercises began.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was a gap of less\nthan month, right?\nGENERAL GARRE: I believe -- I believe\nthat's right, but there was a gap and there's no -- I\ndon't think there can be any --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And how long does it -- how\nlong does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, how long does it take to prepare an\nenvironmental impact statement? It takes more than --\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It takes more than a month,\ndoesn't it.\nGENERAL GARRE: Sure. Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nGENERAL GARRE: But I don't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the Navy knew more than\nthe 1st -- earlier than the 1st of February that it was\ngoing to engage in these exercises, didn't it?\nGENERAL GARRE: It did, and it also knew\nthat it was in the process of finalizing an\nenvironmental impact statement that it prepared in good\nfaith, a 293-page statement, which concluded that there\nwould be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: An environmental\nassessment.\nGENERAL GARRE: An environmental assessment,\nthat's right, with the finding of no significant\nenvironmental impact.\nThis Court presumes the regularity of\nadministrative actions. There's no reason for the Navy,\nparticularly on this record, to have assumed that that\nEA would not have been sustained. The emergency\ncircumstances arose in January 2008, when the district\ncourt enjoined the use of MFA sonar in these exercises\nwhen the Navy had several exercises.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but they wouldn't\nhave been in the situation in January of 2008 if they\nhadn't been in the situation I described in February of\n2007. And it sounds to me as though the Navy played its\ncards very close to its vest --\nGENERAL GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in 2007.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, with respect, I don't\nthink that a 293-page environmental assessment with the\nkind of detail and support that this assessment has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Look, the problem you face\n-- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are\neffectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is\nnecessary by the fact that you have agreed to these\nalternative arrangements. But you should not be\nestopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued\nthat was not a good faith completion of all the Navy's\nresponsibilities. And that's the argument that is being\nmade against you now. It assumes that the EA wasn't\nenough. And I'm not sure that we -- that that\nassumption is valid.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, that's right. And as\nI indicated earlier -- I want to be clear -- the Navy\nbelieves that its environmental assessment was not only\nprepared in good faith, but was appropriate and reached\nthe right conclusions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what\nJustice Kennedy started to ask. I mean, I said why\ndoesn't this thing go away after two months. I mean,\nyou've done it anyway, and Justice Kennedy said because\nyou want a holding from the Court that will help you in\nother cases because you think what the court below did\nhere was wrong. And you said \"three reasons,\" and you\ngot out the first one, and I would like to hear the\nother two.\nGENERAL GARRE: The other two are: One, the\ninjunction. Even if you agree with Respondents on the\nlikelihood of success of the NEPA claim, it's based on a\nshowing of irreparable injury that is fundamentally\nflawed. The Ninth Circuit and the district court looked\nto whether there was irreparable injury under a\npossibility standard.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't both the circuit and\nthe district court, although they mentioned that, in\nfact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was\n-- beyond question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Near -- \"near certainty.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Near certainty.\"\nGENERAL GARRE: They did, Justice Souter,\nand we think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There is no -- there is no\nharm. I mean, the standard may or may not be bright,\nbut there is no harm to the Navy in this case from --\nfrom the use of that standard, I take it.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't think that a\ncourt could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of\nreasons.\nFirst, when a lower court applies a\nfundamentally wrong standard to assess -- to make a\ndetermination, this Court usually corrects that legal\nstandard and gives the -- the lower court an opportunity\nto do it again.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we -- we may, but so\nfar as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently\ndo -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no\nharm in this case, the error was harmless.\nGENERAL GARRE: And, two, the finding, which\nis a sentence in the district court decision repeated by\nthe court of appeals, of \"near certainty of harm to\nmarine mammals\" is utterly belied by the environmental\nassessment in this case as well as the fact that -- and\nthe Ninth Circuit acknowledged this -- the Navy has been\nusing MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating\nArea for more than 40 years and no one can point to any\nharm to marine mammals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, could I ask you\na question?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If this were not a Navy\ncase with all of the implications of the Navy, but an\nordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS\nhad to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action\nto enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was\nfiled? Because the -- the very fact that you need an\nEIS is -- is because you don't know what environmental\nconsequences may ensue. That's the purpose of the EIS.\nSo isn't it the normal practice to enjoin government\naction until the EIS is filed when it is clear there is\na duty to file?\nGENERAL GARRE: I don't think it is,\nJustice Stevens. I think it is -- the normal practice\nis to require someone who seeks the extraordinary remedy\nof a preliminary injunction to show irreparable injury,\na likelihood of irreparable injury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the irreparable\ninjury have to -- and this just repeats\nJustice Stevens's question. It is the same concern I\nhave.\nLet's assume an EIS is required; let's\nassume it hasn't been prepared; let's assume the\ngovernment project is going to proceed. You still have\nto show irreparable harm before you can get the\ninjunction?\nGENERAL GARRE: You do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have authority for\nthat in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I don't have authority\nfor that precise proposition because I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes, you do, but it\nmay not be in the circuits. Our cases say that\nprocedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that\nconfers standing; that there has to be some concrete\nharm.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the only injury\nthat -- that follows from the mere failure to file an\nEIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire\npopulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then, let's -- let's\nassume standing. Let's assume standing. Let's -- let's\nassume people have standing.\nGENERAL GARRE: I -- I think that that's\nright, Judge Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I wouldn't -- look,\nyou have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself,\nonce it reads it, might decide to do something else.\nThat's the whole point of an EIS. So if the agency goes\nahead with the action before reading the EIS, it becomes\ncommitted to that course of action, and the chances that\nthe EIS will lead it to back up are the same as the\nchances that any big agency will back up once it's\ncommitted to a course, namely a lot lower. And that I\nalways thought was the whole harm that the EIS is there\nto stop.\nGENERAL GARRE: Clearly, the purpose of the\nrequirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency\nhas -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't\nthink there is any question that the Navy was after its\n293-page assessment.\nI am not aware of any --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- in effect, you\nare saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS.\nGENERAL GARRE: No, I'm not, Justice Souter.\nI am saying --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the difference\nbetween them? I -- I assume the difference is the EIS\nis a more comprehensive survey and -- and set of\nconclusions.\nGENERAL GARRE: That's right, but then --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that without the EIS,\nthe Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree\nof ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it\nhad done -- done the EIS.\nGENERAL GARRE: I -- the EIS --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that, I presume, is the\nharm that the -- that the statute is intended to\nprevent.\nGENERAL GARRE: But it is not a likely --\nthey have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The EA demonstrates in your\nview that the EIS would -- would very likely say that\nthis -- this action by the Navy is okay. And since that\nis the case, there is -- there is no probability of\nirreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the\nprobability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we agree with that.\nWe think it's important, though, to separate out the\nlikelihood of success on the NEPA claim with the\ndistinct question of whether there is irreparable injury\nand look to the record of whether there is irreparable\ninjury. And we think they have not come close to\nestablishing that. The one final --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any authorities\nin the circuits which would indicate that irreparable\ninjury is not required when there's standing, when an\nEIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and\nwhen the government is ready to proceed? There is\nalways irreparable injury before you can get an\ninjunction? That's what all the circuits say?\nGENERAL GARRE: Justice Kennedy, I haven't\ncompleted that -- that research with respect to all of\nthe circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not\naware of a decision in which a court has said that the\nirreparable injury requirement does not have to be met\nor is automatically met.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The whole theory of the --\nof the environmental impact statement is that we don't\nreally know what the harm will be. So how can you say\nthat in order to get an injunction against the\ngovernment action you have to prove irreparable harm?\nGENERAL GARRE: And it may be easier in some\ncases than others, Justice Stevens. But I think in this\ncase where you have the record that has been compiled,\nthey cannot -- they cannot --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're really arguing\nthat an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will\nalways be enough.\nGENERAL GARRE: We're not taking that\nposition, Justice Stevens. We're taking the position\nthat the record in this case does not show a likelihood\nof irreparable injury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In all -- in all of these\ncases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an\nEIS is either necessary -- is even necessary. So if the\nmere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an\nallegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a\npreliminary injunction in all cases?\nGENERAL GARRE: I think that's right. I\nthink that fundamentally --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you were\nnot suggesting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is a finding\nthat it is necessary, and here we have that finding as I\nunderstand it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are not\nsuggesting that -- that there is a probability of\nsuccess on the claim that you had to file an\nenvironmental impact statement.\nGENERAL GARRE: We -- we are contesting\nthat. And if I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nAnd one must -- I can explain, if you would like,\nJustice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I thought you\nconceded that point.\nGENERAL GARRE: If I misspoke, I apologize.\nMy point was that the administrative determination that\nis at issue now in evaluating the NEPA claim is the\nfinding of alternative arrangements. The Navy has never\nconceded that it was required to do an EIS at the\noutset. It simply has agreed to live with the\nalternative arrangements approved by the Council on\nEnvironmental Quality.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kendall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. KENDALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KENDALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe fundamental question in this case is a\nvery traditional question of equity jurisprudence. The\nfundamental question is whether the district court's\nfactual finding that the injunction will permit the Navy\nto train and certify its sailors is supported by the\nevidence. Because if it is supported by the evidence it\ncannot be clearly erroneous. And if it is not clearly\nerroneous, it cannot be reversed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there something\nincredibly odd about a single district judge making a\ndetermination on that defense question that is contrary\nto the determination that the Navy has made?\nMR. KENDALL: Justice Alito, I submit not,\nand here is why. This was an issue of fact. The\nquestion was whether, in light of the Navy's past\ntraining, which was abundantly shown in the record,\ntheir post-complaint, during the litigation, lawyer-\ncrafted declarations were sufficiently persuasive to\nundo all that evidence that showed that the Navy had\nrepeatedly used safety zones.\nNow, what happened here was that the judge\nwas extraordinarily deferential to the Navy. The judge\nrejected most of the measures that plaintiffs sought,\ncrediting where the evidence was not to the contrary the\ndeclarations of the Navy saying, for example, we need to\ntrain at night.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see evidence to\nthe contrary on two important points. The first was\nthat the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I\nread them. Maybe I just missed the contrary. But they\nsaid that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the\nsonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever,\nwhenever we had to run into a situation called layering\nof different temperature levels. And we tell you, as\nnaval officers, that that's just where submarines like\nto hide. And we also tell you that if we can't train\npeople to do that they will miss out on an important\npart of how to find these submarines.\nI saw no answer to that.\nThe second thing they said was that: We're\nwilling to turn off the sonar if there's any marine\nmammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter\nof a mile, about. But you insist that we turn off the\nsonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter.\nAnd that's quite a big distance more. A lot of animals\ncome in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all\nthose times, we are not going to be able to get much\ntraining done.\nNow, those two things seem to be quite\nimportant. And I just might have missed, which I might\nhave, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by\nequivalent experts to those points.\nMR. KENDALL: Justice Breyer, the response\nin the record appears in the after-action reports of the\neight prior exercises in Southern California. There\nwere four from the series that we challenge and four\nafter-action reports, prepared earlier ones. And you\nwill find those in the joint appendix at 326 to -45.\nWhat the court found was that the Navy had\ntrained and certified its troops during those eight\nSOCAL exercises despite the complete absence of surface\nducting conditions. And it was conceded --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you mean, despite\nthe complete absence?\nMR. KENDALL: Because surface ducting\nconditions are, as it happens, quite rare.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the whole point.\nThat's why I thought they didn't prove anything. Fine,\nthey went on some exercises and they didn't run into\nthese layered things. So obviously they couldn't have\ntraining.\nMR. KENDALL: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they are saying\nis, when you do run into that situation you've got to\ntrain people to deal with it. It doesn't prove much\nthat when you didn't run into it they didn't train\npeople to deal with it. How could they have?\nMR. KENDALL: Well, the question before the\ncourt was balancing the requirement that the Navy comply\nwith the law and the environmental harms against the\nNavy's interest. And our point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, with one\nimportant qualification. The question was the balance\nof those equities on a preliminary basis. In other\nwords, before we reach a final decision, we're going to\nprevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises\nthat they think are necessary. Not even after we have\ndecided they were wrong, just because we think there is\na likelihood that they might be wrong.\nMR. KENDALL: That's quite right. And of\ncourse, in this litigation that was the whole ball game,\nbecause by the time you had reached trial in this case\nall of the exercises --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that\nwould have been the whole ball game until I read your\nbrief. Your brief does not spend a page defending the\ndecision on the merits of the lower courts. Nothing\nabout emergency circumstances or CEQ. Instead, you\nraise other arguments on which the district court did\nnot rely in finding likelihood of success. So given\nthat, I would have thought we would have a lot more to\ntalk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on\nthe merits.\nMR. KENDALL: I respectfully disagree. We\ntook the position from the beginning --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes, yes. You\ncertainly raised those issues. I'm not saying that.\nWhat I am saying the district court didn't rely on those\nin finding likelihood of success.\nMR. KENDALL: Well, I also disagree on that\npoint. You will find at page 97a of the appendix that\nwas submitted with the petition for certiorari the\ncourt's declaration that there was no emergency. You\nwill find --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. KENDALL: But that's the question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the\ndistrict court relied on. Where in your brief do I see\na defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed\nto the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and\neverything else, issues the district court didn't reach?\nMR. KENDALL: The district court did reach\nthe question of whether the Navy could train. That\nnegated any emergency under any definition of the term.\nIt doesn't matter whether -- and there was debate about\nthis below -- an emergency can be foreseeable and\nexpected, as Justice Souter was -- his questions were\nprobing, or whether the emergency can be -- must be\nunexpected. There was debate about that below. But the\nposition that we took and the position that the district\ncourt took was there is no emergency.\nThe reason there is no emergency is because\nthe Navy -- the Navy is perfectly able to train under\nthese circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I can't --\nlook, I don't know anything about this. I'm not a naval\nofficer. But if I see an admiral come along with an\naffidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible --\nthat you've got to train people when there are these\nlayers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there\nwith all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that\nunder oath. And I see on the other side a district\njudge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look\nto see what the basis is, because I know that district\njudge doesn't know about it, either.\nSo, the basis so far I'm thinking on this\none is zero. That's -- because what you have told me is\nthey completed some exercise where they didn't find any\nlayering.\nMR. KENDALL: There was also prior exercise\nin Hawaii. You will recall from the brief that we had a\nprior litigation that resulted in the consent decree in\nHawaii. In that consent decree the Navy agreed to train\nwith a surface ducting powerdown. So, they had\npreviously told the same judge that they were capable of\ntraining in surface ducting conditions with that\npowerdown, else they would not have agreed to that\ndecree. There was evidence in the record.\nThe problem that the judge had is that the\nNavy cannot be judge of its own cause. Deference does\nhave its limits. And this judge was in a position of\nreviewing facts of prior exercises and what the Navy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Generalities. You see --\nof course, I agree with you as a generality. What I am\nmissing here is the specifics, because I am nervous\nabout it, as you can see. And what I am nervous about\nis that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on\nyour side.\nMR. KENDALL: If I may proceed then to the\nsafety zone specifics, because that's the other issue.\nRemember there were a number of injunctive measures that\nthe Navy objected to in the district court that they no\nlonger object to. They ceased to object to them in the\ncourt of appeals and they haven't brought them up here.\nSo the next issue is the 2200-yard safety\nzone. Now, first, why was the safety zone chosen? It\nwas chosen because that is the Navy's preferred method\nof mitigation. They have always mitigated using safety\nzones. They have preferred to mitigate using a safety\nzone that is 1,000 yards. We asked for one that was\n2,200 yards.\nThe question was, what is the difference in\ntraining capability in the two zones? So we looked at\nthat. And where did we look? We looked at the\nstatistics from the after-action reports.\nNow, in this case we had helpful information\nto use, because the after-action reports reveal that the\neffect of widening the safety zone would have been at\nmost one more shutdown or powerdown each exercise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would have\nincreased exponentially the area that the Navy had to\nscrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals\nthere.\nMR. KENDALL: Incorrect. Incorrect. It\nwould --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the\nincrease -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards. But\nit's 1,000 yards of circle. And if I remember high\nschool geometry right, that's a squared increase.\nMR. KENDALL: But think about how this is\nbeing done. The way it's being done is that you have\nsomebody on the deck with binoculars and they are\nlooking straight ahead and they can either look out\n1,000 yards or out 2,000 yards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there are people\nin airplanes?\nMR. KENDALL: Yes. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just straight\nahead.\nMR. KENDALL: There are people in airplanes\nand they are looking down and they can see as much as\nthey can see within that area. And if they see a marine\nmammal, there will be a shutdown or a powerdown; and if\nthey don't see it, there won't be one. You can only\nshut down or power down when you see one.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question\nwas, that increases the area exponentially that has to\nbe scrutinized. And I don't see why, as you said, that\nwas wrong.\nMR. KENDALL: Because they argued -- and\nperhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice, that you\nwere referring to their argument -- which is not that\nthe area was exponentially larger and that creates\ndifficulties of observation; they argued it would create\nan exponentially greater number of shutdowns. And that\nis mathematically proven false by the after-action\nreports, because it's one per exercise.\nAnd this judge, keep in mind, had been\nlistening to the Navy make factual assertions from the\nvery beginning. And the factual assertions that the\nNavy made at the start of this case about the nature of\nthe environmental harms were completely disproven by the\nEA and by the expert evidence that was brought to bear.\nAnd there are a number of statements that General Garre\nmay that I think I should address.\nOne of them in answer to questions from\nJustice Ginsburg had to do with the Level A takes on\nbeaked whales. The Navy tries to dismiss those by\nsaying we only graded the effects on beaked whales as\nLevel A because we did that as a matter of generous\npolicy.\nThey didn't do it for policy reasons. They\ndid it because that's what the science compels, because\nbeaked whales have stranded repeatedly around the world\ncorrelated -- caused by in the views of scientists, and\nthe evidence is overwhelming, by sonar. And the reason\nthat happens especially to beaked whales is because they\ndive for very long periods of time. And when they dive\nfor very long periods of time, and they are then\nbombarded with sonar, which by the way in sound\nintensity, in this courtroom if we had a jet engine and\nyou multiplied that noise by 2,000 times, correcting for\nwater, that's the sound's intensity that would be going\non in the water if you were a marine mammal near that\nsource. The beaked whales, the scientists believe,\nadjust their diving patterns; since they dive down for\nso long, if they come up too fast, they get the bends so\nthere is evidence of -- when they do the necropsies of\nthese beaked whales, they find hemorrhaging, the\nembolisms in various parts of the bloodstream and many,\nmany deaths. So there is enormous scientific evidence\nthat there is a greater harm to beaked whales that is\ncaused by sonar and that is precisely why the Navy was\ncompelled in the EA to recognize that evidence.\nNow, one thing that was said here which I\nfound --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where in the record -- this\nwas the question I asked General Garre. Where in the\nrecord is there evidence of -- that beaked whales would\nbe killed?\nMR. KENDALL: The evidence of the prediction\nof the Level A takes, in the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what does Level A take\n-- maybe can you put this in lay terms. Let's start\nwith kill. Where is the evidence that beaked whales\nwould be killed?\nMR. KENDALL: It is in the -- there is a\ntable on page 223 of volume 1 of the joint appendix.\nAnd then there are the discussions of beaked whale\ninjuries that General Garre referred to, and what they\nshow is that beaked whales will experience the effects I\ndescribed. But there is also expert evidence in the\nrecord in the form of a number of declarations by\nscientists who have studied beaked whales for -- for\nquite some time. The evidence you can find, and it's\nreferred to on page 4 of our brief. Joint appendix\n600-602, 673-89, 738-41, 760, the supplemental excerpt\nof record at 180; also joint appendix 601, 666-667,\n674-76, 680, 685. And there are a few other references\non page 4 of our brief.\nI also wanted to talk about the behavioral\nchanges, because it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is -- I want to give\nyou a chance to say what's so terrible about what\nthey're doing. I will express a little frustration.\nNot your fault. But why couldn't you work this thing\nout? I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot\nof conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have\nmore conditions. And you are asking us who know nothing\nabout whales and less about the military to start\nreading all these documents to try to figure out who's\nright in the case where the other side says the other\nside is totally unreasonable. And the issue at law\nseems to be something that is going to last for two\nmonths.\nSo -- so, why? What is so -- what is the\nimportant thing here?\nMR. KENDALL: The important thing here is\nthat the Navy is focused on having it its way or no way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's very\nunfair. There were six conditions imposed by the\ndistrict court. The Navy didn't even appeal four of\nthem. They gave up on four out of the six issues.\nThat's not insisting on having it their way.\nMR. KENDALL: No -- I agree, although the\nreason I believe that they conceded those is that the\nrecord was -- was so overwhelming on each of those\npoints, they hadn't even put in evidence to suggest that\nthose measures would cause them any problem. They\nsimply didn't have the declaration, and even the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The other ways it\nstruck me how the district court relied on the fact that\nthe Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in\nthe past to say well, there can't be any problem with\nadding more protection. No good deed goes unpunished.\nMR. KENDALL: Well, if I can -- if I can\nanswer that this way. We negotiated with the Navy for\nmonths and months and months, the Brinpack case, I\nsettled with them. We tried very hard to resolve this\ncase, but keep in mind that the Navy until the district\ncourt ruled refused to agree to any measures that we\nproposed -- any measures. So it was a binary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They had already\ntaken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals.\nNow you say that wasn't.\nMR. KENDALL: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they were taking\nsome actions.\nMR. KENDALL: That's right. And -- and so\nwe had a litigation that was focused on were there\nadditional actions that should be taken; and there is\nextensive evidence taken and extensive argument and then\nthe district court ruled. And the correct path, if the\nNavy was aggrieved by that decision, was a higher court.\nBut instead, in order to avoid the clearly erroneous\nstandard -- and remember, that the clearly erroneous\nstandard as this Court said in the Anderson v. Bessemer\nCity case, says when there are two permissible views of\nthe evidence, the factfinder's choice between them\ncannot be clearly erroneous.\nSo in order to evade that, and this is\ntypical of the tactics that we experienced and the\nuncompromising nature of their approach that we\nexperienced, they went to CEQ to try to trump the entire\ninjunctive process. Now that they did without any\nauthority in NEPA --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does the basic thing\nwork? Because to a layperson, when I think of the armed\nforces preparing an environmental impact statement, I\nthink, the whole point of the armed forces is to hurt\nthe environment. I mean --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't under -- I don't\nunderstand how it's supposed to work. Of course they\nare going to do something that is harmful.\nMR. KENDALL: You know, the whole point of\nthe armed forces, I think is to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see the point, I am\ntrying to give you a -- overstating it.\nMR. KENDALL: I think the point of the armed\nforces is to safeguard our freedoms causing the least\ndamage possible to our environment. And this Court has\nrecognized that repeatedly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go on a bombing\nmission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement first?\nMR. KENDALL: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. KENDALL: They don't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does it work?\nMR. KENDALL: We have never, ever contended\nthat any of our proposed restrictions should apply to\ncombat at all, and it doesn't.\nThis training was planned for a very long\ntime. Had -- there were questions earlier,\nJustice Scalia I think raised a question is the EA as\ngood as the EIS? There is a big, big difference. There\nare really two, between an EA and EIS. The substantive\ndifference is that an EA doesn't have the same\nalternatives analysis that an EIS has, and the\nprocedural difference, which in a country that values\ntransparency and ideas and exchange with the public, is\nthe notice and comment that EIS requires.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I didn't assert that\nthey are -- that they are the same thing substantively.\nMy -- my only question is whether your assertion of bad\nfaith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long\nas they were doing an EA. If -- you do an EA to see if\nan EIS is necessary. And you say if there's no -- if\nthere is no significant harm to the environment, you\ndon't even need an EIS.\nMR. KENDALL: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's how they\nstarted. That's step one, and many agencies do that.\nThey are authorized to do that. I don't know why you\nhave to attribute bad faith to the Navy simply because\nit began with an EA.\nMR. KENDALL: That focus is not an element\nof our case. I was simply responding to\nJustice Breyer's question as, I admit, a somewhat\nfrustrated lawyer who tried to work things out as to why\nit happened that they weren't worked out.\nI do want to speak a bit about some of the\ncomments that General Garre made in response to\nJustice Kennedy and Justice Scalia's questions about--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I\nderail you a little bit to get back to the balance of\nequities question? As I read the opinions most of the\nbalancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the\ndistrict court. I found the district court's balancing\nin only one sentence. The court after all of its\nprior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of\nhardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an\ninjunction. \" It goes on. But it's just one sentence.\nThe Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to\nthe district court but in fact it supplied all the\nbalance of the analysis for the balance.\nMR. KENDALL: Well, I -- with respect I\nthink the district court spoke in several different\nopinions. So you can -- you can find out what the\ndistrict court was thinking by looking not only at the\ninjunction, but also at the -- at the responsible\ndistrict court denying the motion to vacate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose it's still\nfair to say that on all of those it focused most of its\nattention on likelihood of success on the merits and\nirreparable harm rather than a balancing of the\nequities.\nMR. KENDALL: Well I would disagree in one\nrespect, which is the court was very focused on which\nmeasures to impose and which measures not to impose.\nThere were, you know, at least 10 pages of her\ninjunctive opinion going through that, and each -- and\nthe denial of the motion to vacate did the same thing,\nbecause -- after the Ninth Circuit ordered Judge Cooper\nto issue a tailored injunction, each side briefed very\nextensively, with a huge amount of supporting evidence,\nthe issue of which measures should be imposed. And\nJudge Cooper decided that certain measures would not be\nimposed and certain ones would, and she explained why.\nAnd she did that against the background of the harms\nthat were designed to be prevented. And so what I would\nsubmit is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's -- I\nthink that's quite right.\nMy question, though, is that at no point\nthat did the district judge undertake a balancing of the\nequities, putting on the one side the potential for harm\nto marine mammals that she found -- and that's your\npoint about the record -- and putting on the other side\nthe potential that a North Korean diesel electric\nsubmarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor\nundetected. Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance.\nAnd the district court never entered -- never went into\nthat analysis.\nMR. KENDALL: There's a good reason why she\ndidn't balance that. And that gets back to my opening\nremarks, which is that the premise of that question and\nwhy, Mr. Chief Justice, you would be concerned about\nthat is that there would be an exposure to that\nsubmarine, that North Korean submarine. But the judge\nhad made a factual finding, and the factual finding she\nmade was that training would not be affected. So, on\nthe one hand, you have a factual finding that there is\nno harm to the training at all, which means that in the\nbalance the harms to the environment are much heavier.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you -- how much\ndeference, if any, do you think the district court was\nobligated to give to the Navy on that military issue\nabout whether the training would be effective? Is judge\nCooper an expert on antisubmarine warfare?\nMR. KENDALL: No. Judge Cooper, like all\njudges, has to sift through the evidence of experts, and\nJudge Cooper gave great weight to the Navy on everything\nthat the Navy said. But there was a place where she had\nto stop because, after all, she's a judge, and where she\nhad to stop was where the evidence belied the\ndeclarations. And, you know, this Court has had in a\nnumber of decisions to confront the question of whether\nwartime exigencies forced the courts to suspend their\npowers of judgment. I submit that what happened here is\nthat this court didn't, and that's what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even the district --\neven the district court recognized, in the words of her\nopinion, that it would propose \"a substantial challenge\"\n-- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime\nthat she imposed in the injunction.\nMR. KENDALL: That's right, and it will in\nfact pose a challenge and the proof is then in the\npudding, which is that the Navy has now conducted 13 out\nof 14 exercises, the last 8 of which had been conducted\nunder this regime as modified by the circuit. And they\nhave not, as they were invited, had to come back and ask\nfor relief despite the fact that they had the\nopportunity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: By the time this case got\nback to the court -- the district court a second time,\nthe President had made a determination that this was in\nthe paramount interest of the United States. The\nDefense and Commerce Department jointly had made a\ndetermination that this is necessary for the national\ndefense. And it seems to me, even if those\ndeterminations don't resolve the EIS statement, they\ncertainly must be given great weight by the district\ncourt in determining whether to continue the injunction.\nIf you could comment on that, incorporate it also in\nwhat you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument\nwith reference to the standard.\nMR. KENDALL: Yes. First, responding to\nthat very point, it's common ground among the litigants\nand certainly with the court that the interests ascribed\nby the President and by every other government official\nwith respect to Naval training are of the highest\nimportance. The question was -- and this is the court's\nfactual finding, and the question is whether there was\nsufficient record evidence to support it, whether she\nwas right that there wouldn't be an adverse effect\nexcept for possibly some logistical changes, but no\nadverse effect in terms of an achievement of the\ntraining. If there's no adverse effect, then what the\nPresident is speaking to is speaking past what's\nconcerning the court.\nNow, with respect to irreparable harm, the\nargument that General Garre made I think mistakenly\ncollapses the normal equity issue in this following\nsense: Once a plaintiff satisfies Article III, very\nimportant, and under the Japan Whaling case, the Lujan\nv. National Wildlife case, there is no question that\nthese plaintiffs deserve to be in court, and it has\nnever been contested.\nThen you move to the traditional equity\nstandard for assessing irreparable harm, Hecht v.\nBowles, but in the environmental area we have a\ndecision, the Amoco v. Gambell decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. That\nirreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of\nthe injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the\nharm which is the basis for standing, is it not?\nMR. KENDALL: It always does, and the\nquestion is somewhat different. And I think,\nJustice Scalia, if you look at your opinion in the\nsecond Lujan case and you think about the imminence\nrequirement of standing there, what irreparable harm\nadds to that is the traditional need to show that the\nharm you suffer cannot be quantified in damages or it's\ndifficult to quantify, and that a remedy at law will not\nachieve the adjustment between the parties that's\nrequired. That's what equity does. Equity preserves\nthe positions of the parties.\nAnd as this Court said in Amoco,\nenvironmental injury, by it's very nature, can seldom be\nadequately remedied by money damages and is often\npermanent or at least of long-lasting duration, i.e.,\nirreparable; that is Amoco at page 545. If such injury\nis sufficiently likely, therefore, the Court said, the\nbalance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an\ninjunction.\nNow, there's one other point which was\nbriefly touched on here. Justice Kennedy was asking\nwhat the circuits have said. Now, the circuits have\nsaid different things about irreparable harm. The\nleading edge of discussion in the circuits began with\nthen-Judge Breyer on the First Circuit in the\nMassachusetts v. Watt and Sierra Club v. Marsh cases,\nwhere he pointed out that NEPA itself has, while it's a\nprocedural statute, a substantive purpose, the\nsubstantive purpose being informed decisionmaking. And\nif there is not informed decisionmaking before there is\nan agency committed to action, a harm has occurred.\nThat's the harm that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's unfortunately\ncontrary to what our opinions have said, which was quite\nclearly that procedural --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- procedural injury is not\nthe kind of injury that gives rise to Article III\nstanding.\nMR. KENDALL: Can I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The whole country can\ncomplain about the failure to issue an EIS. That is not\nthe kind of injury that gives standing.\nMR. KENDALL: I was only responding to\nJustice Kennedy's question as to what the circuits have\nsaid. That's the leading edge of what the circuits have\nsaid.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why you backed\ndown on this.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kendall, you\nwanted to respond to some comments by the Solicitor\nGeneral. I wanted to make sure that you've had an\nopportunity to do that. I -- you were derailed by\nquestioning, but I know you responded to some. Are you\n--\nMR. KENDALL: That's very kind. I think\nthere's just one other point perhaps I should make,\nwhich is there was some discussion of whether NEPA\nactually authorizes CEQ to conduct this kind of\nexamination of a district court's ruling. I submit that\nthere is nothing anywhere in NEPA and certainly not in\nthe \"fullest extent possible\" language which gives that\nauthority. This Court has already decided that point in\nthe Flint Ridge case, where it said that NEPA does not\ngive way unless there is an irreconcilable conflict\nbetween NEPA and another statute. They have pointed to\nno such thing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Garre, have you one minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE\nON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, the Court of Appeals did not\nadequately consider the balance of equities. It\ncompletely disregarded the President's determination of\nthe paramount interests in these exercises. It\ndisregarded the Chief Naval Officer's evidence on the\nharm of the 2200-yard shutdown, at Pet. App. 344-345A.\nIt disregard the harm as to surface ducting, Pet. App.\n33 A.\nJustice Alito, there is -- the EA says,\nquote, on page 200 of the JA, \"No serious injury or\nmortality of any marine mammal species is reasonably\nforeseeable because of these exercises.\" Page 170 makes\nclear that that applies to beaked whales as well.\nAnd finally I think I heard my colleague, my\nfriend, concede that you have to show Article III injury\nin order to show irreparable injury. They not only have\nto show irreparable injury to marine mammals, which they\nhaven't; they have to show irreparable injury to\nthemselves, and particularly as to beaked whales, which\nnone of the declarants and none of their members have\never asserted they have seen. They can't possibly\nestablish any irreparable injury from any conceivable\nharm to beaked whales, even though the record in this\ncase makes clear that all harms to the marine mammals\nthat we have been discussing today are temporary\nnon-injurious harms.\nWe would ask this Court to set aside the\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit, which seriously\ninterferes with critical training exercises that the\nPresident, his chief Naval officers have determined to\nbe in the paramount interests of the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- before you sit\ndown. I thought I recalled something in your briefing\ndealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point\nregarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very\nsubstantially showed that they were caused by sonar.\nYou had something in your briefs about beaching, but I\nwasn't sure whether it was beaked whales or only\ndolphins.\nGENERAL GARRE: It pertains to beaked whales\nas well. Page 256 of the petition appendix is the\nNational Marine Fisheries Service's determination that\nthe conditions which led to strandings with respect to\nbeaked whales in other parts of the world are not likely\nto lead to strandings in the Southern California\nOperating Area. Those conditions are taken into account\nin the national defense exemption mitigation measures at\npage 258 of the petition appendix. There have been\nbeachings of beaked whales in Southern California. None\nhave been tied to sonar operations, and that further\nunderscores the absence any injury to any marine mammal\nin Southern California despite 40 years of the Navy's\nuse of sonar operations in that area.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
