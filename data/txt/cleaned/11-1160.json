Phoebe Putney Health System.\nMr. Horwich?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe State Action Doctrine provides a defense\nto a Federal antitrust suit when a State has clearly\narticulated and affirmatively expressed an intent to\ndisplace competition with respect to the particular\nactivity at issue in the suit.\nNow, in practical terms, what that comes\ndown to is whether application of Federal competition\nlaw would somehow subvert a sovereign State policy\nchoice that's clearly evident in State law.\nNow, that policy might be expressed in\nmandatory or compulsory terms, but, short of that, it\nwould also be enough, if the -- the State had\nspecifically permitted conduct that is inherently\nanticompetitive.\nBut a grant of general power to act -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that the\ngrant of powers in this case would permit the hospital\nauthorities, the corporation, to set prices for their\nservices that are below the competitive prices in order\nto serve the needy?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that inherent in\nthe regulations?\nMR. HORWICH: I think it is, although for\nreasons that don't affect the analysis of the question\nabout an anticompetitive acquisition. And let me\nexplain why the analysis might be different with respect\nto prices.\nThere is specific authorization in the\nstatute for the hospital authorities, in conjunction\nwith the counties, to partly fund -- or, I guess,\nentirely, in principle -- fund their services through\ntax revenues. So they have another source of funding\nthat would allow them to price in ways that a\ncompetitive actor would not necessarily price its\nservices.\nSo if we're talking about particular pricing\ndecisions, say -- I guess it would be below cost pricing\nthat is alleged to somehow be anticompetitive -- then\nthere might very well be a State action defense to that\nbecause it -- because the State -- the power to price\nservices subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor\nwouldn't be able to do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have --\nMR. HORWICH: -- might very well displace\ncompetition in that regard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any cases in\nwhich we -- we slice it that fine --\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I do think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that you are a\nState actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not\nfor others?\nMR. HORWICH: Yeah, absolutely,\nJustice Scalia. I think -- I think the best -- the best\nexample comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. So,\nin that case, the -- the issue was a challenge to a\npractice of minimum fee schedules that were set by --\nnot by the State, but -- but agreed upon by a bar\norganization.\nNow, the State in that case, of course,\nregulated the practice of law. It regulated admission\ninto the practice of law. It regulated certain aspects\nof the conduct of the practice of law. And this Court\nheld, in Bates v. Arizona State Bar, that those sort of\nregulations do constitute State action.\nBut the Court did not accept the submission\nthat the State action defense covered the setting of\nminimum prices that was at issue in that case because\nthat was not something that there was State action over.\nAnd as a -- and, taking a step back, the\njustification for the State Action Doctrine is that the\nState is trying to pursue some policy that is part of\nits traditional sovereign prerogatives to regulate its\nown economy and that Federal law was not understood to\nintrude upon that.\nBut, if the State is not actually trying to\nadvance some other policy, with respect to the\nparticular conduct at issue, then it can't be said that\nthe State has done something that Federal law should\nstand aside for.\nThe -- the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Horwich, you said\nin -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital\nAuthorities Law specifically authorized local hospital\nauthorities to acquire any and all hospitals within\ntheir geographic area, then the clear articulation\nrequirement would be satisfied.\nBut the Authorities Law does authorize the\nacquisition of other hospitals. And it doesn't say one\nor two; it says other -- other facilities.\nSo why doesn't the hospital laws law do\nexactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear\narticulation requirement?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think the key\ndifference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the\nhypothetical we offered in the -- the reply brief and\nthe statute here is that the -- the additional words\n\"any and all\" make it clear that the State is\ncontemplating that there could -- the county might opt\nfor socializing its hospital services, putting all of\nthem under the control of the hospital authority.\nAnd, by contrast, what we have here is an\nordinary corporate power to acquire property. And, like\nall of the ordinary corporate powers that the authority\npossesses that are -- that resemble those that -- that\nan ordinary business corporation would have, the most\nnatural understanding of them is that the State expects\nthem to be exercised in conformity with the background\nprinciples that -- that bind everybody. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I understand\nyour answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there\nwould be a difference if the charter said the authority\nmay require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its\nmission and if it said the authority may acquire\nproperties to promote its mission?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think it's probably in\nour -- the hypothetical offered in our reply brief, it's\nprobably the \"all\" -- the \"any and all\" that -- that\nwould, I think, be what communicates the State's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a\ngeneral saying they may acquire properties doesn't\nimplicitly say they may acquire all properties?\nThat seems a pretty thin --\nMR. HORWICH: No, I don't think it does --\nwell -- but I think, in this area, it's -- it's\nimportant, for a couple reasons, that we actually\nhave -- have some substantial assurance of what the\nState is trying to do here.\nAnd a power to grant proper -- excuse me --\na power to acquire properties, generally speaking,\nunadorned with any particular expression from the State\nabout how -- how that power is to be used, is -- is\nsomething that can be used competitively or\nanticompetitively.\nAnd you can't infer from that that the State\nreally has an objective of, as I say, such as\nsocializing its hospital services because -- and -- and\nit's -- and that clarity of expression from the State is\nreally important here, for several reasons.\nFirst of all, this is an odd rule, to begin\nwith, in that it allows State law to displace Federal\nlaw. So we would want some clarity from --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume that\nthe normal corporate charter contains such a provision,\nthe authority to acquire property, right?\nMR. HORWICH: Yeah, it absolutely does.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- that --\nthat charter is issued by the State, right?\nMR. HORWICH: It is issued by the State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- we don't\nthink that that enables all corporations to ignore the\nSherman Act, do we?\nMR. HORWICH: No, we don't. And we don't\ngenerally think that those corporate powers express an\nintent to displace any other background --\nif I could give some examples, maybe we could look at\nsome --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, could I just --\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- before you give examples,\njust make sure I understand your basic position?\nSuppose the State had said, very clearly,\nthat these hospital authorities had the power to engage\nin acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor,\nwould violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically\nsaid the -- the hospital authorities had the discretion\nto do that or not.\nAnd the State didn't know the hospital\nauthority might do it, but it also might not do it.\nThat would be subject to the immunity; is that correct?\nMR. HORWICH: I -- I think the defense would\nbe available if -- if the beginning of your hypothetical\nwas kind of quoting the statute, yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. It's a clear grant of\nauthority --\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the authority is\ncompletely discretionary. So the State is basically\nsaying, we don't know, we're going to let the hospital\nauthority figure it out.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, it's certainly -- the\nhospital authority can figure it -- figure out, but what\nit's figuring out is whether to actually invoke a\ndisplacement of competition that the State has expressly\nput on the table. And that's what is different in this\ncase --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What -- but what I'm trying\nto get at is the State has put it on the table only as a\ncompletely discretionary action. The State has not\nexpressed a preference for it.\nThe State has only said that the hospital\nauthority can think about conditions on the ground in\nits particular locality and can decide whether such an\nanticompetitive acquisition is appropriate.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, that's fine. We don't\nhave any quarrel with -- with States setting up a clear\nset of tools, some of which, in your example, might\ninherently displace competition --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So all of this language --\nMR. HORWICH: -- and having it exercised,\nactually, at a local level. That's fine.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So all this language in your\nbrief about necessarily and inherently and compelled,\nall of those things really are not part of your -- your\ngoverning test?\nMR. HORWICH: No. I -- I disagree with\nthat. The reason they are part of our governing test is\nthis: Is that a State can certainly give a -- a menu of\nspecific options that sub-State entities can -- can\nselect from. And it might be that some of those are, in\nfact, not anticompetitive.\nLet me give you an example from -- from this\nCourt's cases. Southern Motor Carriers involved the\nsubmission of -- by motor carriers, of their rates to a\npublic service commission that was -- that would accept\nthem as filed rates.\nNow, the States -- some of the States there\nsaid, well, you can file them individually, or you can\nfile them jointly, and we don't necessarily have a\npreference, one way or the other, for it.\nBut the fact that the States had said you\ncan file them jointly, which is a horizontal agreement\namong competitors and sure looks anticompetitive, the\nfact that the State had said that and put that option on\nthe table qualified as a clear articulation from the\nState that it intended the displacement of competition\nto occur if that specific option was chosen.\nThe difference here is that, if you are\nwilling to say, in a case like what we have here with a\nstatute that -- that confers a -- a power that is\nentirely neutral as to how it would be -- how it could\nbe exercised, you have the problem of not really knowing\nwhat the State would intend. And so you can't say that\nthe State clearly intended that there be displacement\nof competition --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other?\nThe next line that they give is they give to the\nhospital authority the power to acquire and operate\nprojects and the power to form and operate one or more\nnetworks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare\nproviders.\nNow, as I read that, it certainly includes\nthe rather specific power of acquiring a hospital. And\nhaving read that -- not -- not just something you might\nsee in General Motors' charter.\nMR. HORWICH: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and those -- that's\nthe language of the -- of the grant of power.\nNow, I want to know what you want us to do\nbecause, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that\nprovides for regulation -- price regulation of\nhospitals. And you say -- and I have no doubt you\nthought of one way in which that could be -- I can think\nof 100 -- that you could have prices that are different\nfrom those set by a free market. So I have no doubt\nthat this sets -- I start there.\nNow, what is it -- I go back to\nJustice Scalia's original question: What is it you want\nus to say? Even though this -- this statute is immune,\ndoes grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and\nprice regulation, it is not immune in respect to\nmergers, okay?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I can, unfortunately, think\nof about 50 examples, where a merger might be\nanticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices.\nAnd the Department of Justice might attack it, but this\nstatute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to\nwant to further that kind of thing.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where I am,\nand I -- I'm not at all decided.\nMR. HORWICH: Sure. Well, I guess I\nwould -- I guess I would first point out that -- that\nprice competition is not the be-all and end-all of\nanticompetitive consequences, right?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I think I know that.\nMR. HORWICH: I mean, we have this\nconcern -- obviously, we have a concern here that\nwithout -- and this is detailed, very clearly, in the\ncomplaint, I mean, I think starting with paragraph --\nparagraph 8, that talks about some of the price -- some\nof the pricing constraints. But you get on to the later\nparagraphs of the complaint, you have all these\ndescriptions of loss of quality competition here.\nSo you have -- you have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are not understanding\nmy question, I guess. You have to take as a given that,\neven though what you say is true, I would find that this\nstatute clearly prohibits the application of the\nantitrust laws to pricing decisions. That's the job of\nthe authority.\nNow, if I start with that, then you will\nsay, okay, I have to decide against you. Or you might\nsay, even so, I win because mergers are different. Now,\nthat -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, and I guess that is what\nI'm -- I guess that is what I'm trying to say, is that\nmergers are different because the challenged\nanticompetitive act here is not a pricing decision by\nthe hospitals that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to ask you: Why are\nthey different?\nMR. HORWICH: They are different --\nJUSTICE BREYER: After all, we have, one,\nthe specific language I read; and, two, I can think of\nexamples where a merger would be anticompetitive under\nthe DOJ and your FTC rules --\nMR. HORWICH: Yeah.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and yet, probably would\nfurther the purposes of the statute by lowering the\ncost.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think that's the\nnull set? I -- I don't think that's --\nMR. HORWICH: No, I -- well, I don't -- I\ndon't know whether that is -- I don't know whether that\nis true or not, but I think -- I think we're relying on\na more -- I think you can't simply start with the idea\nthat, well -- well, you can't start with the premise\nthat this act exists to pursue an objective and to\npursue it at any cost, without regard to whether it\ndisplaces competition in the market for paid healthcare\nservices, without regard to whether it displaces\ncompetition for quality among these hospitals.\nI mean, on that logic -- and I -- I think it\nmight help to look at some of the other powers here. If\nwe -- if you go to the back of the government's brief,\non page 6A, the authority has the power to make and --\nand execute contracts. Well, I don't think that that\nimplies a privilege to enter price-fixing contracts.\nThat's part of the background principles of antitrust\nlaw.\nI also don't think it implies the power to\nenter contracts against public policy. A State,\npresumably, doesn't wish to abandon that background\nprinciple, simply because it wants the authority to\npursue its mission.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've already\ntold us that there can be State action for some purposes\nand not others.\nMR. HORWICH: Exactly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that you\nhave examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't\nmean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest\nthat you prevail with respect to another one of the\npowers that are granted.\nMR. HORWICH: No, I agree with that, that it\ndoesn't categorically, but it does -- it does seem to me\nthat -- that if we're looking through this list of\npowers that -- that the hospital authority has, there is\nnot anything meaningfully different about the power to\nacquire -- acquire property versus make contracts\nversus, as Justice Scalia said, any other powers that\nare -- that exist in a general corporation's business\ncharter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- this may be\ncompletely wrong. You can tell me. I would -- would\ndoubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size,\nyou are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and\nso that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and\nyet still it not have any significant merger\nconsequences on its face.\nIn other words, when this law was passed,\ngiving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it\nthe case that there would likely be only one other\nhospital or two, so that any acquisition of another\nhospital would have the merger consequences that this\none had?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, no, because I think\nthe -- the baseline when the statute was enacted was\nthat the hospital authorities didn't even exist. So\nthey didn't own any hospitals.\nAnd the first acquisition of a hospital\ncan't raise a competitive concern because it's not\nconcentrating the market in any way. It's simply\ntransferring ownership of the hospital from one actor to\nanother.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but to -- to follow\nthe Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that\nthere were many rural counties -- rural areas in\nGeorgia, very much like this one. Would that change\nthis case? I thought that was the purport of the -- the\nthrust of the question.\nMR. HORWICH: I think you'd have to imagine\na very stylized hypothetical, to see that the State had\nclearly intended to displace competition. You would\nwant to see, for example -- let me give you an\nexample -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I know Georgia has\n158 counties or something.\nMR. HORWICH: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So I think they probably\nhave many rural areas with one or two hospitals. That's\njust a guess.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, right, but I suppose\nthat -- that guesswork is not going to be a basis\nfor saying a State has clearly intended to displace\ncompetition.\nThe situation in which I think you might\nrecognize it is, if the hospital authorities were\nalready in existence, but they -- and they all each\nowned a hospital, but they had never had the power to\nacquire a hospital, and you knew that they were all --\nthat each of them had their neighboring competitor, and\nthen the legislature comes in and says -- you know,\nwe -- we would like you now to actually be able to\nacquire -- acquire additional hospitals.\nI mean, the power here is not the power to\nacquire additional hospitals. But, if the legislature\nhad said, we have the power to acquire additional\nhospitals and we know you already have one and we know\nthat the one you are going to acquire is going to be\nyour neighbor and we know there is not lots of hospitals\nout there, then you might say that, yes, the -- the\nclear implication of that is that that's going --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does the words mean,\n\"to form and operate one or more major networks of\nhospitals\"?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think the networks --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which follow -- which\nfollow the words \"to acquire and operate projects,\ndefined to include hospitals.\" So -- so what about\nthose words? Why aren't they good enough?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I guess I'm not sure\nwhere Your Honor is looking. They -- they aren't\nactually -- they don't follow themselves in the statute,\nbut --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking at\nSection 30 -- well, where are we? 31-7-75(3).\nMR. HORWICH: Right. And so I think what\nyou are referring to is number -- number 27 on the list.\nAnd -- and I think, in the healthcare\nindustry, the idea of forming a network is not the idea\nof socializing all of the available resources under\ngovernment control. A network is an integrated system\nwhere you can go to the hospital for your emergency\ncare, and they can refer you to an outpatient clinic\nthat they have somewhere else, and there is a physician\nwho has an arrangement with both of those who can track\nyour care, and you can go acquire your durable medical\nequipment from some -- from some store they operate.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tying.\nMR. HORWICH: That's what a network is.\nThat's not vertical integration.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A network is tying\nproducts, to tie products.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, that's exactly right.\nThat's a tying situation.\nThis is -- this is a merger within -- within\none relevant market. And -- and that's what's\ndifferent. So I don't think the 27 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And this falls within the\nwords \"to acquire and operate projects\"?\nMR. HORWICH: It does. But so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And --\nMR. HORWICH: It does, but there is nothing\nabout acquiring a project that is inherently -- that's\ninherently anticompetitive. Acquisitions are not always\nanticompetitive.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I guess that just\nadds on to the issues that we have a price-fixing\nmechanism, we have a tying mechanism that is expressed,\nso what's left after that? Just this? Mergers and\nacquisitions?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I -- well, no, I\nthink -- I think horizontal --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At -- at what point --\nMR. HORWICH: -- generally horizontal\nagreements, I think you -- so the contracting power\ndoesn't -- doesn't allow the hospital authority to go --\nI don't think the -- the hospital here could any more\nmerge with Palmyra than it could go enter into a\ncontract with Palmyra that says, hey, we are going to --\nyou know, fix the prices that we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And can't -- in other\nwords, the -- the two hospitals in the town, when they\nsay, the price here -- you shall see that the price is\nnot higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please\nget together and be certain that you have similar terms\nand you have similar agreements and similar prices\nthere, we don't want either of you to be higher, that --\nyou would then proceed against them for that?\nMR. HORWICH: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nThis -- this statute -- and take a step back --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And would you also do the\nsame if -- if the electricity regulator in any State or\ntelephone -- a local telephone regulator --\nMR. HORWICH: No, Your Honor. I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or gas pipeline\nregulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said,\nour prices are -- you're to file tariffs, and the\ntariffs are to be reached after you go meet in\ncommittee; and that -- that would also fall within the\nantitrust laws?\nMR. HORWICH: No, I think those would likely\nbe very different.\nI want to be clear about --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is that?\nMR. HORWICH: -- the point. The point of\nthis law is to grant counties the opportunity to\nparticipate in this market by providing care to\nindigents.\nThis is not a law about public utility\nregulation. If you think that this is a law about\npublic utility regulation, that all hospitals\nare supposed to be -- that the State intends counties to\nbe able to elect to put all hospitals under their\ncontrol and -- and manage them as such and manage them\nin the way that a -- that a public service commission\nwould regulate all of the utilities --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the language is\nawfully similar to what you find in public utility\nstatutes, to set reasonable rates, to be certain that\nnobody is higher than a reasonable rate.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, this -- the authority\ndoes not have the power to -- Justice Breyer, the\nauthority does not have the power to establish rates at\nprivate hospitals. And that -- that would be a signal\ndifference between the -- the authority's power in\nthis -- in this case and the power of a public service\nregulator over a -- over a utility.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what does it mean to\nestablish rates and charges for the services and use of\nthe facilities of the authority?\nMR. HORWICH: The facilities of the\nauthority, yes, but not other hospitals within the\njurisdiction. It's only -- it's only the hospitals that\nthe authority itself is -- is operating.\nAnd so -- so I guess we -- we also have\nhere -- I want -- I want to be clear that, in all of\nthis discussion, we are -- we are operating on the\npremise that it's actually the authority itself that is\noperating the hospital.\nOf course, that is not what this case is.\nThe -- the hospital --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you define\n\"necessity,\" as you use it? I am harkening back to\nJustice Kagan. We have plenty of cases that say you\ndon't need to find out whether the exemption is\nnecessary to make the program work.\nMR. HORWICH: Right. No, we don't think it\nmeans that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't make that\njudgment.\nMR. HORWICH: No, it's not a normative\njudgment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State makes that\njudgment. Exactly.\nMR. HORWICH: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, in your answer, you\nconceded that whether -- if -- if there is discretion,\nit's not necessary to make it work because the -- the\nauthority can say yes or no -- it's not --\nMR. HORWICH: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's your\ndefinition of \"necessity\"?\nMR. HORWICH: Our definition -- our\ndefinition -- well, I have to be honest with you, it's\nhard to define it because it's going to arise in a\nnumber of different contexts.\nBut what this -- but the times where this\nCourt has used it, it has -- it has used it to convey\nthe idea that the choice that the State is offering is\nno choice at all, if Federal law is going to come in;\nthat -- that Federal law would just negate the choice.\nSo to be concrete about this, in -- in\nHallie, for example, the choice that the State provided\nat the end of kind of a complicated line of -- of\nstatutory rules about how -- how cities do or don't have\nto provide their sewage treatments to -- to their\nneighbors, at the end of the day the city had a choice\nto say, fine, we will give you sewage treatment\nservices, but you have to be annexed to us and -- you\nknow, take the other things that come with annexation to\nthe city.\nNow, if that choice is -- is -- if that\nchoice is anticompetitive, it's going to be taken away\nby Federal law. And the choice that the State has tried\nto offer is no choice at all. It's going to be negated,\nand the only choice left for the -- the city in Hallie\nis going to be to -- to opt --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the State --\nMR. HORWICH: To just relent and get the\nsewage treatment service --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If a State legislature\narticulates clearly and expresses affirmatively that it\nwants municipalities to share the State's antitrust\nimmunity, is that sufficient? Or is there a degree of\nspecificity that's necessary as to the particular\nanticompetitive conduct that the State wants to cover?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think, in your\nhypothetical, we are imagining kind of a municipality\nenabling act that just has -- you know, a section in it\nthat says, municipalities shall enjoy the State's\nexemption from the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Georgia does seem to have such\na statute.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. So -- so that -- that's\nnot a clear articulation problem because it's plenty\nclear what the State's trying to do.\nThere might be what I would call an\naffirmative expression problem there because simply\nsaying that the State doesn't want the antitrust laws to\napply, that's not the basis in federalism for the -- for\nthe State Action Doctrine.\nThe basis in federalism is that the State\nhas made some affirmative choice that it wants to\naccomplish something else, and that it's offered some\nprinciple on which the sub-State actors can -- can act\nto serve the State's policy interests.\nAnd so I think you might have to hesitate in\na case like that to say, well, if the -- if the State is\njust passing out indulgences to -- to get out of Federal\ncompetition law, that may not be something that,\nsubstantively, Federal law will stand aside for.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to take\nup your rebuttal time, but I don't see how that's\nconsistent with your answer to Justice Kagan about a\ngrant of discretionary authority.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I -- I was assuming, in\nJustice Kagan's hypothetical, that we had some of the\nother things going on here that -- that manifested a\nparticular objective that the State was trying to\npursue.\nSo sort of the State trying to pursue\nmunicipal governance doesn't seem to me to be enough of\nan affirmative State policy to say that works. So I\nthink that would distinguish the two.\nAnd if I could reserve? Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the specific area of local hospital\nservices, the Georgia legislature has adopted a model of\nlocal public choice, including the choice to reduce or\neliminate competition.\nThere is no issue here, Justice Scalia, with\nrespect to your earlier question, of general corporate\npowers. The Hospital Authorities Law creates local\npublic authorities to, quote, \"exercise public and\nessential government functions to provide hospital care\nfor residents, especially residents who cannot pay. It\nempowers authorities to acquire projects\" -- plural --\n\"specifically including each authority the ability to\nacquire hospitals\" -- plural -- but with limitations.\nThey have to -- it has to be within a very\nconfined geographic and demographic jurisdiction. And\nfor authority hospitals, it replaces any pure market\nmodel with statutory mandates, a mandate to provide\nservices to all indigent in the community and to price\nall services on a not-for-profit basis and with a\nstatutory limitation on rate of return.\nThere are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't see how\nany of that pertains to whether they can create a\nhospital monopoly. You can do all of that, even though\nyou are not the only hospital in the area.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- I guess my point here is\nthat the -- that the legislature's -- the powers that\nthe -- the legislature has given hospital authorities\nare not, by any means, general corporate powers. They\nare broader than what a corporation may have in certain\nrespects and much narrower in other respects.\nAnd they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the only respect\nrelevant here is -- is -- the only respect relevant is\nthe ability to acquire other hospitals.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's right. And there is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right? And that's -- and\nthat's a general corporate power. Every corporation in\nGeorgia has the power to acquire, including acquire\nother businesses.\nMR. WAXMAN: There -- there -- these --\nthese are -- the supervening wish, mandate, of the\nlegislature -- and this is well-explained in Georgia\nSupreme Court cases, particularly DeJarnette, which was\ndecided right after Georgia amended its constitution,\nenacted the Hospital Authorities Law -- was the desire\nto -- the goal to provide adequate hospital services,\nparticularly for the indigent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Georgia wasn't so sure\nbecause didn't it come in originally on the side of the\nFTC in this case?\nMR. WAXMAN: It did. And Georgia's\ncomplaint and its theory in the district court, which it\ndid not pursue in the court of appeals or here, not --\nwas not that the authorities weren't exercising State\npower, but that the contention that the operation of the\nhospital by the -- the special purpose corporations that\nthe hospital authority created was not adequately\nsupervised.\nThat is what the State was arguing in the\ndistrict court. And when it lost that point, it\nwithdrew from the case and has remained absent ever\nsince.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, we do have a\nbrief from quite a number of States, and the brief\nbasically says, we do this all the time, we set up these\nlocal authorities, and then we give them powers because\nthey have to act in the world, and we give them normal\npowers, like the ability to make contracts and the\nability to buy property.\nAnd when we do that, we don't mean that they\ncan do anything they want, notwithstanding the antitrust\nlaws. And to construe these very normal powers that we\nwould give to a State entity, in order to allow it to\noperate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws,\nis not at all consistent with our own intentions.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I have no problem with the\namicus brief filed by the States supporting the FTC in\nthis case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the\noutset, on an understanding that what is involved here\nis simply a State authorization of creation of a local\nentity with general corporate powers and nothing more.\nThat could not be farther from this case.\nThese special purpose authorities do not simply have\ngeneral corporate powers. They have a mandate. There\nis a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided\nwith the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that\nderogated the State's duty to provide indigent care\nto its -- hospital care to its citizens.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it a fair\ncharacterization of your argument -- is it a fair\ncharacterization of your argument to say that the\npossibility that the hospital authority can use this\ngeneral power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent\nto the legislature intending that it be used that way?\nIs that your argument?\nMR. WAXMAN: No. We take seriously the\nstandard that this Court announced in self-consciously\nclarifying the level of explicitness that a legislature\nhas to use in Town of Hallie.\nThis Court said -- the Court asked whether,\nquote, \"suppression of competition was a foreseeable\nresult of what the State legislature authorized,\" and it\nderived that formulation expressly from its earlier\ndecision in City of Lafayette, which explained that a,\nquote, \"adequate State mandate exists when it can\nreasonably be inferred,\" quote, \"from the authority\ngiven a local entity to operate in a given area that the\nlegislature contemplated the kind of action complained\nof.\"\nIn other words, as I understand this Court's\ntest, whether what was done by the hospital authority or\nany sub-State entity was foreseeable by a reasonable\nlegislator, which in this case is that -- was it\nforeseeable that in -- in pursuing the State-imposed\nmandate to serve the indigent in a -- in a confined\njurisdiction, especially in rural counties which abound\nin Georgia, a hospital authority might require market\npower or even a public service monopoly because that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- is the natural way to acquit\nthe statutory mandate.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's -- there is a\nproblem here, which is, I understand the public mandate\nto serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take\nthis a step further. You're elevating that public\nmandate to a public command, that serving the indigent\nhas to override the needs of the majority, in terms of\nprice competition.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. I don't -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and that -- that\nstep -- that further step that the State intended to\nimmunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are\ntrying to find in this grant. And that's what I don't\nsee. I see the -- the compulsion to serve the needy.\nMR. WAXMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I hear that much of\nGeorgia is rural, but your adversary says, in most\ninstances, there is only one hospital, so the\nmunicipality's taking it over is not going to be a\nmerger issue. To the extent that they step in and take\nover one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue\nbecause it's only substituting one owner for another.\nThis situation, they claim, is a rarity,\nwhere there are only two or three providers and a\nhospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is\ngoing to then get monopoly power by an acquisition.\nMR. WAXMAN: So, Justice Sotomayor, as to\nyour first point, our position is not that the only\nmandate is to serve the indigent. The actual mandate in\nthe constitution and the Hospital Authorities Law is to\nprovide hospital services for all residents, with a\nparticular note to the obligation to serve indigent\nclients.\nSecond of all, we are not here to -- I mean,\nI don't know where the government is coming up with its\nspeculation that, out of Georgia's -- I think it's 154\ncounties, for a population of 10 million people, it is\nthe rare instance in which there will be anything other\nthan just one or -- you know, a multiplicity of\nhospitals. I mean, the Federal Trade Commission\nguidelines for market concentration is anything up to\nfour, four or fewer participants.\nThe notion that the legislature, in 1941,\nwas providing the express authority to acquire multiple\nhospitals in a single municipality or county was focused\nonly on huge metropolises, of which there was only one,\nor on counties that were so small that they couldn't\notherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital\nis just fanciful; it's made up.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could -- could I\nunderstand where you think this expressed approval is\ncoming from? Because you said general corporate powers\nis not enough. So the general ability to buy property,\nyou said, is insufficient.\nThen you have this idea they have a mission.\nBut the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways\nthat are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws,\nso that doesn't seem to get you all that far.\nSo what else have you got to show that the\nState actually thought about this issue and approved\nthis power for the hospital authorities?\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. I mean, for one -- one\nother thing is in Section 7 -- 7-77, as -- as was noted\nbefore, the authorities are subject to regulation of\nrate of return. Now, if that doesn't bespeak the\nforeseeable consequence of market power, I don't know\nwhat -- what does. That is the hallmark of a regulated\npublic service monopoly or at least the regulation of a\nreturn by a participant with market power.\nThe other thing that exists -- and the\ngovernment pooh-poohs this as somehow not part of the\nHospital Authorities Law -- is that the Georgia State\nlegislature has -- this is -- this law was enacted in\nthe backdrop of other laws in which Georgia has quite\ndeliberately displaced, quote, \"unfettered private\nmarket competition.\"\nThe certificate of need law is the\nparadigmatic example of the imposition of regulation at\nthe expense of free market competition and, in fact -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a lot of States have\nthat. You can't open a new hospital without getting a\ncertificate of need. Are you saying that, in all of\nthose, States the -- the result is that the antitrust\nlaws can be ignored?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Our argument is\nnot that the certificate -- that the existence of a\ncertificate of need law indicates an intent by the\nlegislature to fully displace the antitrust laws with\nrespect to anybody else.\nMy point is, in the context of other Georgia\nsystems that strictly limit entry into -- or expansion\ninto these local markets, combined with very severe rate\nrestrictions and obligations and mandates to serve --\nexcuse me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your point -- I don't mean\nto interrupt, but the point that he's making in response\nto my earlier questions along these lines, I think, was\nthe following: Where do they get their hospitals, these\nauthorities? The -- the law sets up a hospital\nauthority. All right. Where did they get their\nhospitals?\nMR. WAXMAN: They can -- I mean, the\nlegislature permits them to be built, bought --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you know what\nactually happened? Do you -- do you know, in fact,\nwhere these hospital authorities got their hospitals\nfrom?\nMR. WAXMAN: You mean all of the hospitals\nauthorities in Georgia?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, not all of them, but --\nI now am in a county, and suddenly, I'm the mayor, and I\nsee this law, and it says we can set up a hospital\nauthority. So Joe, I say, you are -- you are the boss,\nyou are the hospital authority guy. And he says -- you\nare to run the hospital. And he says, what hospital?\nWe don't have a hospital.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I want to know where did\nthey get their hospitals?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the answer,\nJustice Breyer, I think -- I mean, there is nothing in\nthe record to indicate where all the hospitals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't need to know all of\nthem. I just want some rough idea where do they come from.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, let's take -- let's take\nthe example --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You may not know.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Let's take the\nexample of this county, in terms of what was done and\nwhat is now being challenged. So when the hospital --\nthere was a public hospital, beginning in 1911, in\nDougherty County.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: When the State constitution was\namended to impose on counties the State's obligation to\nprovide adequate hospitalization care, it enacted the\nHospital Authority Law for counties that chose to make\nuse of that device, in order to acquit their public\nservice mandate.\nAnd Dougherty County did, soon thereafter --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- establish a -- an authority,\nand the assets -- all of the assets and all of the\noperations of the existing hospital, were transferred.\nThere then -- and there was a natural monopoly in that\ncounty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I've got it. I've\ngot it. Then --\nMR. WAXMAN: Then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then he says this: I --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. Then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He says, I have been\nthinking of it the wrong way. I have been thinking of\nit like the California State Public Utilities\nCommission. They regulate all the electricity\nproducers. That isn't this.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: These were a group of\npeople that ran some hospitals -- some municipal\nhospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just\ngeneral -- I agree with you, it isn't just general.\nThey have a lot of power there to acquire other\nhospitals from outside the system.\nBut, when they do that, there's no reason to\nthink that that gives them the power to acquire it,\nwhere it's anticompetitive.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, the fact that you can\nregulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one\ngroup, doesn't say that you have to bring in\nanticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in\nothers, where they're anticompetitive. That -- that, I\nthink, is his point.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't think of it as one\nthing; think of it as two separate systems.\nMR. WAXMAN: We're not arguing that the\nHospital Authority Law gives the hospital authorities\nthe right to regulate non-authority hospitals. We're\nnot arguing that. We're not arguing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know that. But\nonce you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see,\nthey don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals,\nthey don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that\nfor non-authority, even though they might have the power\nto bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring\nthem in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why\nread this as saying you can bring them in, where it's\nanticompetitive to do so?\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, this doesn't say, you\ncan bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so.\nThat's their any and all hypothetical. And this Court\nhas never required, for good reason, express authority.\nThat was the whole point of City of Hallie and City of\nLafayette -- Town of Hallie and City of Lafayette.\nThe point here is, okay, so they created a\nhospital authority, it ran a public hospital, it was a\nnatural monopoly. The county grew. A private hospital\ndeveloped. The public hospital, which is serving more\nthan ten times the number of indigent patients than the\nprivate hospital, which is very underused, the county\nhospital has been -- the hospital authority has been\nsaying, for years and years and years, we need more\ncapacity, we need more capacity.\nThere are -- in order to accomplish our\nmission, there are two ways to do it. We can only\noperate in this confine. We can build a new hospital,\nand here's what it would cost, and here's what we would\nget. And we would, by the way, have to satisfy the\nState authorities that we are entitled to a certificate\nof need in the context in which the private hospital is\nseverely underutilized.\nOr we can talk with the private hospital\nabout whether they would like to be acquired. And the\nrecord shows that they did that for many, many years,\neven before the Phoebe Putney entities were created.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I'm showing\nmy ignorance. Is this -- would this merger be subject\nto the rule of reason?\nMR. WAXMAN: You mean if it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it were -- if we were\nnot to find State immunity, would the merger be subject\nto the rule of reason?\nMR. WAXMAN: I am embarrassed to say I don't\nknow enough about Sherman Act laws --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was embarrassed to ask\nthe question, but I was taught to ask the question. If\nit is -- I'm going to assume that we'll both be -- we'll\nboth be corrected by our respective colleagues, soon\nenough.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but if it --\nMR. WAXMAN: Probably me sooner than you.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's likely.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but my question\nis really more fundamental, which is, yes, I understand\nthat you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of\nreason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its\ntruest sense, in its economic sense, in this situation.\nSo why should we undo our decades of\nwritings that say that we should construe immunity\nnarrowly and not broadly, when it comes to displacing\nour antitrust laws?\nMR. WAXMAN: Because the point of State\naction immunity, which is respect for the sovereign\nchoices of sovereign States, is -- exists not only to\nprovide a -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the\nmerits, it's to protect States and sub-State entities\nfrom the cost of litigating.\nI mean, the question, ultimately, in this\ncase -- and in all these cases -- is who gets to decide?\nWho gets to decide if this is reasonable or not?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if that -\nMR. WAXMAN: Is it the Federal Trade\nCommission that comes in and files a lawsuit for this\npoor hospital authority?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's\nright, it is about choices, but -- but the question is\nwhether the State has made a choice. And that's what\nall these cases are about --\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- is our trying to find\nwhether the State has made a choice as to this kind of\nconduct.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So now, we have your\ncorporate powers aren't enough, your general mission\nisn't enough.\nYou said a certificate of need, but a\ncertificate of need, it isn't even given out by this\nauthority. It's something that has nothing to do with\nthe powers of this authority.\nThen you said there -- there's some kind of\na price regulation that happens as to the -- the\nhospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect\nto other hospitals.\nSo I guess I'm still looking for the things\nthat show that the State has made a choice that it wants\nthese -- these hospital authorities to be able to make\nanticompetitive purchases. Where do I find that?\nMR. WAXMAN: I may not be able to convince\nyou, but let me take another run. I think it's the\ncombination because, as this Court has expressed\nrepeatedly, it's -- one has to look at the specific\npower granted, which here is the power to acquire\nhospitals within a very circumscribed jurisdiction, in\nthe context of the law as a whole.\nThe context of the law as a whole here --\nand I hope this works for the Court, but if it\ndoesn't -- you know, perhaps I am wrong; it certainly\nmakes this a stronger case than Hallie -- here, we have\na law that says counties have the obligation now, unlike\nthe State, to provide adequate hospitalization services.\nThey will exercise -- what they do is deemed\nto exercise public and essential government function\nwithin strictly limited areas. And they have the power\nto acquire hospitals in those areas, subject to very\nstrict rate of return regulations and very, very strict\nconditions on how they operate those hospitals,\nincluding the power to lease to an operator for -- in\norder to serve the public mission.\nAnd they do that against the backdrop of a\nseries of -- they have eminent domain power. They can\ntake another hospital, if it is essential to fulfill\ntheir mission.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --\nMR. WAXMAN: And they do this in a backdrop\nof a State that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of\nthe Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly\nstrengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate\nof need law that leads --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you are\nessentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets\nup the hospital authority. And you -- you're saying\nthis is how we read it. We start with the antitrust\nexemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the\nState has to give it to the subdivision, for the\nsubdivision to have it.\nCould the Federal court have said,\nwe -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature --\nwhat the Georgia authorities think this statute means?\nSo, could a question have been certified -- I don't know\nif Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the\nGeorgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this\nstatute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity\nto the locality -- to the local unit?\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't -- I mean, I -- I\nassume that the Georgia State courts could do that; but,\nJustice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize\nthat the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital\nauthority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact,\nagents or arms of the State --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is does\nthis -- does this legislature mean that the State is\ntransferring its immunity to this local unit?\nMR. WAXMAN: And I believe the FTC --\nMr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe\nthe FTC's position is, generally, yes, but not with\nrespect to the -- what is alleged to be a merger to\nmonopoly.\nAnd the question in this case is whether or\nnot the acts, under this law and applying the\nforeseeable result standard, whether the acts of the\nhospital authority in this case in approving and\nacquiring the second hospital are fairly attributable to\nthe State.\nAnd if I could just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, if you don't\nwant to be interrupted, you have to pause between\nsentences.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: I was taking a cue from Your\nHonor the last argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. That's\nright.\nYou've given a -- you know, an appealing\nexample of a small county that has one -- one hospital,\nand this operation purchases that one -- one hospital.\nSeems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice\nSotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be\npursuing a situation in which there is a natural\nmonopoly. It's a question of whether the monopoly would\nbe owned by the State or not.\nBut your argument, if we follow it, embraces\na quite different situation, a very large county which\nhas five hospitals that are competing vigorously in\nprice, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as\nsome hospitals do.\nAnd what you're saying is that this\noperation can take over all of those hospitals and\neliminate all of that competition. Isn't that so?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- for purposes of\nFederal antitrust law, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: But for purposes of State law,\nalmost certainly no. And the point here is -- and that\nis the point here. The point is that Georgia, either\nthrough both private suits and actions authorized by its\nattorney general, can take steps in order to restrain\nhospital authorities from doing what they -- and, in\nfact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have no -- we have no\nidea whether they are willing to do that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, yes, we do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we have a Federal\nantitrust law.\nMR. WAXMAN: We -- we absolutely do,\nJustice Scalia. There is a solid line of cases in which\nthe Georgia Supreme Court has -- has quite rigorously\nenforced the limitations of the Hospital Authority Law,\nin order to prevent hospital authorities from doing\nthings that it says the legislature didn't intend. The\nTift County case is the best example, but there are\nothers cited in our brief.\nThe last point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why didn't it intend\nthis? I don't understand. You -- you've told us that\nthey did intend this, that they did intend to displace\ncompetition.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And now, you say, but\nGeorgia will say, oh, no, they didn't intend to displace\ncompetition.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. My --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is it?\nMR. WAXMAN: My point is that, with respect\nto your hypothetical, whether the hospital authority of\nFulton County -- and I believe there is more than one\nhospital authority in Fulton County, and they are\nauthorized to merge, in any event -- but could they\nacquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the\nhospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so? And my\npoint is that for purposes of Federal antitrust law the\nanswer is you are out -- that's -- you are not the\nauthority to inquire.\nThe question is -- just as this Court -- you\nexplained for the Court in Omni, there may be very many\nthings that a local authority can do that would violate\nState law, and there are State law remedies. And my\npoint only was that the Georgia Supreme Court has been\nvery quick to enforce the limitations.\nBut as a matter of Federal antitrust law,\nthe only question is were they -- were they authorized\nto do things like this? And if I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they -- they say on\nthat, that it's a sham. Well, just say 30 seconds on\ntheir argument, that the FTC looked into it, these\npeople had never regulated anything, they'd never looked\nat any price anywhere, they've never done a single\nthing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it.\nWhat about that?\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. If I can just finish my\nanswer to Justice -- I have one other point to make\nfor -- to Justice Kagan, who has asked it twice.\nThe -- my last point I want to make -- and\nthen I will answer this -- is that this county -- this\nhospital authority, like many, facing a capacity\nconstraint and a -- and a nondiscretionary mandate to\nserve the public needs for hospitalization, had two\nchoices.\nIt could have tried to convince the State to\nspend three times as much money to get half the number\nof beds, notwithstanding the existence of excess\ncapacity; or it could buy the other hospital and get\nthat capacity in a consensual transaction by the\nauthority.\nAnd here's my point, Justice Scalia, this\ncase is on all fours with this Court's decision in Omni.\nThe notion that this may have long been desired by\nthis -- this special-purpose entity is totally\nirrelevant. This -- this acquisition was proposed to,\nconsidered by, and -- and approved by the hospital\nauthority.\nAnd not only that, when the FTC came and\ncomplained about it, they reconvened another public\nmeeting and discussed it again and came to the\nconclusion again that they wanted to acquire this\nhospital.\nAnd before they signed the lease, they\nissued a notice and comment period. There was three\nmonths for people to tell the authority whether this\nlease was or was not consistent with community\ninterests. They had a public meeting, and they approved\nit. And that is the act of the State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can the State --\ndoes the State have a procedure where it can give\nreal-time approval? In other words, this is going on,\nand the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending\nus these letters. State, could you do something to show\nthat you approve this transaction, whether it's a\nspecial law or there is some organization, I guess, in\nsome other case, setup, that could give its approval?\nIs there --\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, this is -- the Hospital\nAuthorities Law says, counties, this is your\nresponsibility, here are your powers. If anybody in the\nState or any competitor or the attorney general thinks\nthat you are abusing those statutory powers, the courts\nare open and quite receptive to those concerns. But\nthere's no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. But I\nguess my point is can the burden of going forward be\nswitched the other way? And can this hospital authority\nsay -- you know, to the State, we would like some\nblessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it?\nSo the choices aren't really build your own\nhospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but\nask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do?\nDo you want us to build a new hospital? Or is it okay\nif we acquire this one?\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't believe there is any\nsuch mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State --\nthe legislature didn't contemplate anything like that,\nbecause the mandate and the responsibility and the\nauthorization was devolved to the counties.\nNow, Mr. Chief Justice, what the -- what the\nhospital authority could do and did do, although it's\nnot in the record of this case, is evaluate the\nlikelihood of getting a certificate of need to build the\nadditional required facilities.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Thank you.\nI guess I -- I heard several members of the\nCourt asking Mr. Waxman, specifically, Where do you find\nthis? Where can you locate this intent to displace\ncompetition in the statute? And I would like to just\nrun through, if I could, each of his answers and why I\nthink they are insufficient.\nSo the first one, of course, we've talked a\nlot about the existence of general corporate powers, but\nthe most natural inference there is that the State\nexpects those to be exercised in conformity with the\nbackground principles that anybody else who has general\npowers has.\nNow, the idea that the authority has a\nmandate, a purpose it's supposed to serve, of course,\nthat's always true. States always have some purpose in\nmind when they set up some sub-State entity. The\nquestion isn't whether there is particular ends the\nState is trying to pursue.\nThe question here is whether the State\nintended to pursue those ends through the particular\nmeans of displacing competition, here, displacing\ncompetition in the market for paid healthcare services.\nAnd see Mr. Waxman also pointed to the rate of\nreturn provision in the statute. Now, as a sort of a\nthreshold matter, there's -- if past is prologue, there\nis not any reason to think that that will be not be\nrigorously enforced with respect to the privately\ncontrolled operations here. But -- and that's sort of\nthe second question presented, and we can set that aside\nfor the moment, I guess.\nBut it seems to me there are two far more\nnatural explanations for the presence of the rate of\nreturn provision in the statute than the one Mr. Waxman\nwould like you to -- to give to it.\nThe first explanation is this is a statute\nabout providing public care for indigents. Nobody\nshould be making a profit off of that, and the State\nwants to say that. And that seems to be a very natural\nexplanation that doesn't depend at all on the State\nintending to displace competition completely.\nThe -- the rate -- the price regulation\nprovision also can be naturally understood as a response\nto the recognition that there will be some de facto\nmonopolies in the situation where there is only one\nhospital in the county.\nBut it does not mean that the State wants\nthere to be more monopolies, so that it can bring in the\nunfortunate medicine of rate regulation to respond to\nthose. Presumably, the State intends, as is the\naccepted background principle of free market competition\nin this country, that there won't be monopolies, unless\nthey -- unless they arise of necessity.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I\ninterrupt --\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you, just a moment,\nto address a question raised by Justice Breyer, which is\nyour alternative argument?\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have lots of\nevidence that the authority does very little oversight\nof these hospitals when they move forward. But is that\nthe issue before us? Is the question of immunity as to\nwhat happens in the operation of the hospital or in\ntheir merger and acquisition, their actual formation?\nAnd -- so that to the extent that we were to\nconclude that the State has delegated immunity on the\nbasis of merger, why do we need to look any further at\nwhether there has or has not been an appropriate degree\nof supervision of that decision?\nMR. HORWICH: Right. Well, the -- the --\nI -- I don't think the two are entirely -- are entirely\nseparable, as a matter of competition law, because the\nreason the competition law is concerned with mergers is\nnot because of the transaction as such, but it's because\nof what it does going forward to the structure of the\nmarket and the competitive behavior of those in the\nmarket.\nAnd so the State Action Doctrine says that\nthe State -- if the State's going to go create monopoly,\nit needs to take ownership of that monopoly. And I'm\nusing ownership not in the literal sense, but at least\nownership in the sense of actively supervising the\nmonopoly, to be sure that it is pursuing the -- the\nobjectives that the State has in mind for creating it.\nSo that's -- that's why we are still concerned there.\nMr. Waxman referred to the Certificate of\nNeed Law. I think there is a very close analogy to be\ndrawn to Goldfarb here. That is the -- the question of\nminimum fee schedules agreed to by lawyers. The State\nof -- the State of Virginia regulated entry into the\nmarket for the practice of law, just as the certificate\nof need regulates entry into the hospital market.\nBut horizontal agreements among people\nalready in the market, such as here and such as the\nminimum fee schedule in Goldfarb, are not exempt just\nbecause of it.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
