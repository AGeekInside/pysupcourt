PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere is no more vexing set of issues in the\nemployment discrimination context than arise out of\nissues of retaliation under section 704 of title VII.\nAs the Solicitor General's brief and a couple of the\nother amici briefs point out, the number of -- the\nnumber of these claims has increased by more than 100\npercent over the course of the last decade, more than\n30 percent of the EEOC's docket is now made up of\nretaliation claims, and the cost of an average\ncontested retaliation claim exceeds $130,000 per case.\nPlainly, this is a fundamentally important question,\nand the standard to be applied under section 704 is\ncritically important to both employers and employees.\nAnd the Respondent has given you truly a\nchoice and not a shadow in this particular case because\nthe Respondent's analysis of section 704, based\nessentially on the language, any discrimination, is\nthat everything that is in any sense against an\nemployee, any act of retaliation, no matter how\ntrivial, is nevertheless a basis for a section 704\nlawsuit.\nThis is a position that's embraced by none of\nher supporting amici. It's a position that's been\nembraced by no court of appeals up until this point,\nand it is a position that is utterly untethered in the\nrelationship between section 704 and its language and\nsection 703, which is the heart and soul of the anti-\ndiscrimination norms in title VII.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has been endorsed\nby the EEOC, though.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Not -- not that broad -- no,\nnot even the EEOC in its most aggressive\ninterpretation, which obviously the United States has\nrejected in this case, ever went to the point of saying\nany. And I'll give you a good illustration of that\nbecause in the guidelines, the commission always said\nthat in a situation where there was absolutely no\nquestion of retaliation, charge filed against a\nsupervisor, supervisor disinvites an employee to lunch,\na lunch that's held with all the other employees -- it\nhas always been the position of the -- of the EEOC that\nin that circumstance, that would not be enough to raise\neven a fact issue to go to a jury on.\nUnder the Respondent's theory of this case,\nit is clear to me that being disinvited to a lunch\nwould, in fact, be a basis for a Federal lawsuit under\nsection 704.\nSo there is no one, neither governmental nor\nnongovernmental, that has embraced the extreme position\nthat the Respondent has put forward under section 704.\nAnd indeed, it's very difficult for me to\nunderstand why Congress would ever have adopted a rule\nthat was more protective of those against whom --\nagainst -- where retaliation takes place as opposed to\nthe core of who was protected by section 703, which is\nthe people who are in the protected class in the first\ninstance.\nTo adopt the rule, I think, of the Respondent\nin this case would not only increase the number of\nclaims another 100 percent, at least, in the future,\nbut it seems to me would render completely meaningless\nthe observation of this Court in Weber that management\nprerogatives are to be left undisturbed to the greatest\nextent possible. There are no management prerogatives\nonce an employee has filed a complaint under -- and,\ntherefore, is protected under section 704. At that\npoint, everything becomes essentially a straitjacket\nproblem.\nI don't think there's a rationale to support\nthat interpretation, and so therefore the question is,\nwhat is the right standard under section 704?\nAnd here, it seems to me the United States\nand Burlington Northern are on exactly the same page.\nWe believe that this Court announced the appropriate\nstandard under section 703 in dealing with harassment\ncases. That's the Ellerth standard, and we believe\nthat the Ellerth standard is the proper one for\ndefining a tangible employment action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But 703 has the language and\n704 doesn't. I mean, 703 has language limiting it to\n-- to employment, prerogatives of employment. 704\ndoesn't.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Scalia, this\nCourt has also said that that negative pregnant has\nnever been used as an overarching interpretive guide.\nYou have to evaluate 703 and 704 in tandem, and it\nseems much easier to interpret 704 as simply using\ndiscrimination against as a shorthand for the wide\nrange of discriminations that are outlined in section\n703. It seems quite cumbersome, at a minimum, and\nprobably worse if Congress were to actually sit down\nand try to rewrite every aspect of 703 in order simply\nto say in addition to the protected classes that 703\nprotects, there is certain conduct under 704 that we\nprotect in exactly the same way that we protect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It wouldn't have to do\n-- I mean, fairly -- you know, to be fair, it wouldn't\nhave had to say that. It would have said any -- any\nact that is discrimination under 703. Any act that is\ndiscrimination under 703. Seven words it could have\nsaid.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They could have said it that\nway, but it seems to me quite clear that Congress still\nintended for 703 and 704 to be interpreted in pari\nmateria. And -- and again, you -- you still run into\nthe same problem, Justice Scalia, as to why is it that\nCongress would want to protect more thoroughly 704\nplaintiffs than it would 703 plaintiffs. And it seems\nto me there's no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a curiosity. It is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the answer would be\nbecause Congress is worried that people won't complain.\nThat's why. And there are millions of ways of\nharassing people. They start issuing a complaint. You\ndo all kinds of things. You freeze them out. You --\nyou insult them. You -- I mean, it's easy to think of\nthings that don't rise to the level of the -- Ellerth.\nSo, I mean, if I -- maybe I'm right, maybe\nI'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say,\nthe D.C. Circuit standard? They -- they say that you\nhave to show that the employer's action would have been\nmaterial, which means the action might well have\ndissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting\na charge of discrimination. Now, how about that? That\nhas the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed,\net cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also\nallows the judge to focus on the particular case and\nsee if what the person is doing is reasonable. It\nholds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness,\nwhich is common in law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the issue would be, I\nassume, how much a reasonable person likes a free\nlunch.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That would be -- that would be\nthe question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, in fact, if it turns\nout to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the\nperson can't be at the power lunch because she's a\nwoman, for example, and therefore, her future career is\nlikely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that\ncount as a violation?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I will tell you, Justice\nBreyer, that the -- at least one of the problems with\nthat is that the EEOC's guidelines expressly state that\nthat is not a claim that's actionable under section\n704.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They say one lunch, but\nnot if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who\ngets left out is the person who filed a charge under\ntitle VII. That's -- a one-at-a-time curiosity the\nEEOC guidelines leave out, but if it's a routine lunch\nwith all the preferred employees and they leave out the\none who filed a title VII charge, that would fit\nwithin the EEOC's definition.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That would fit under the\nEEOC's definition, although I don't think it's an\nanswer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wouldn't fit under\nyour --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that was talking the big\npower lunch.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Under your definition,\nlunch is lunch, and so there would never be -- there\ncouldn't be --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, not under my -- no, that's\nnot necessarily the case, Justice Ginsburg. In my --\nyou know, there are two standards under -- under an\nadverse employment action. The first one is whether\nthere's a tangible action, and that's the Ellerth\nstandard. And then there's always the pervasive and\nsevere standard, so that if you have -- you know, being\nroutinely excluded rises to the level of pervasive or\nsevere, that would still be actionable under 704 in\nexactly the same way that that's actionable under 703.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, does it or doesn't\nit? The -- the facts are simply that the manager takes\nout all the employees, except this one that filed the\ntitle VII charge, once a week. Is that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And -- and does it on a\npervasive basis, sustained and pervasive basis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it once a week, and\nI'm not using any adjective to characterize it. It\njust happens once a week.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think you probably\nhave a jury question at some point, depending on how\nlong it went on for because it would become -- it would\nbecome a pervasive practice. And under those\ncircumstances, this Court has a rule that allows that\nto become a jury issue. But if it's only once or\ntwice, it strikes me that that's not a particular\nproblem.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how about excluding\nfrom the forklift forever or a year? You can't work\nthe forklift for a year.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the reason why\nthat's not a problem is that there is no economic\neffect that attaches to not working on the forklift for\na year or for 10 years. The -- the proof in this case\nis absolutely clear.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it has an effect on\nyour back.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that was not the -- but\nthe -- but she didn't get hired as a forklift operator.\nShe was hired as a track laborer, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you've got a jury\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but if that argument\nis sound --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you've got a jury\nfinding here. You've got a jury finding this was\ndiscriminatory.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's -- there's no\nquestion that there's a jury finding of retaliation.\nThe question is whether or not this is a tangible\nemployment action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if your -- if your\nargument is sound, Mr. Phillips, then -- then any\nemployer is well advised to define job categories by\nhaving one really nice job within the category and one\nreally rotten job within the category. And if anybody\nwho's got the nice job does something like make a title\nVII complaint, automatically gets, in effect,\nreassigned to the rotten job, and your answer will be,\nyou know, there's no economic effect. They're getting\nthe same amount of money each week. I mean, that would\nseem to me -- asks for an end run around the whole\nconcept of retaliation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, let me -- in\nthe first place, it's not a very practical hypothetical\nbecause, one, when you -- when you define your job\npositions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't there a\nbig difference between sitting on a seat and running a\nforklift and -- and picking up steel rails with your\nbare hands?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, one, she wasn't\ntypically picking up steel rails with her bare hands.\nAll of this stuff is done mechanically. She was\npulling nails out of rails periodically. So I'm not\nsure that that's precisely the way to characterize it.\nBut the -- but at the end of the day, it\nstill seems to me that what Ellerth tells you you\nshould look at is primarily whether there is a -- a\ndirect economic effect. And if there is no direct\neconomic effect, then what you ought to be looking for\nis whether or not the -- the conduct is severe or\npervasive, and -- and if it is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- then, it seems to me,\nthere's a separate action. But that's not the claim\nshe brought in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but do you -- do you\nagree that direct economic effect cannot be the only\ncriterion here?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think it can be\nthe only criterion. I think that you would have a\nsituation -- and a lot of times the -- the economic\neffect will be either immediate or potentially indirect\nin the sense of the hypothetical the commission uses in\nits guidelines where a butcher is shifted over to be a\ncashier. And in that situation, that's a fundamentally\ndifferent job with a fundamentally different career\npath. And it may not have any economic effects in the\nshort run, but in the long run, it will have. And that\nmay be an answer in part to your question, Justice\nSouter, about just one big job classification that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nhypothetical? Supposing people like to work the\nforklift, but nobody had a -- a right to do it, but\nthey traded every day or something like that, and the\ncompany put out a notice that said anybody who -- who\nfiles a claim will not be eligible to ride on the\nforklift ever again.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's a quid pro quo\nviolation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That would be a violation?\nMR. PHILLIPS: This Court held in -- in\nEllerth that those kinds of quid pro quos are -- are\nsubject to liability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So anytime there's an\nadvance notice that you will -- there will be some kind\nof action in response to a -- a claim, that would be\nretaliation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, because the employer --\nI mean, employers aren't going to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though it was not an\nadverse job action.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- adopt that kind of a\nstandard.\nI'm sorry, Justice Stevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though it did not\namount to -- did not have any economic effect on the\nemployee.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that -- you know, in\n-- under those circumstances, it seems to me that the\nstandard is slightly different for quid pro quo\nviolations than they are for simply tangible employment\nactions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So a quid pro quo violation\ndoes not have to be an adverse employment action.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It -- right, because the --\nthere are -- I mean, they are all adverse employment\nactions. There's a tangible employment action.\nThere's a quid pro quo action, and then there's the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that -- that\ninterpretation requires you to interpret 703 and 704\ndifferently.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I -- I don't believe so\nbecause I'm -- I'm -- what I'm trying to do at least is\nto apply the Ellerth standard under 703 for each of the\nthree elements in the same way that I'm trying to apply\nthem under 704.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but are you? I'm --\nI'm a little concerned that -- that you're trying to\npersuade us to interpret 704 the same as 703 at the\nexpense of watering down 703. I don't understand how\nyou can concede that -- that refusing to invite\nsomebody to lunch, if it's more than -- more than a\nsingle lunch, could be a violation of 703. How does\nthat come within the -- with respect to compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that if -- if\nyou could certainly envision a circumstance -- and\nagain, this goes to the pervasiveness of it. It's --\nit's a fundamental, sort of constructive adjustment of\nyour employment situation. Terms and conditions is a\nfairly capacious term, Justice Scalia, and I could well\nimagine that if you were being systematically treated\ndifferently and differently from every other employee\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not by the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- then at some point it\nbecomes severe or pervasive in a way that -- that, it\nwould seem to me, would raise a jury trial issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and going to lunch is\nthe conditions of employment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Going to lunch once, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Privilege.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Going to lunch twice, I'm sure\nnot. But, you know, if it is a continuous process, at\nsome point it strikes me that it would become somewhat\nproblematic. Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's get the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- and that is why it's\nimportant, and it goes back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, if I can go back to that for a second,\nbecause he asked about the D.C. Circuit's opinion,\nwhich, you know, of course, adopted the EEOC's now-\ndiscredited theory of this case and, again, untethers\n703 from 704. That's the problem with the D.C.\nCircuit's interpretation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? You see, I can\nthink of a million things. I can't think literally of\na million, but it does seem --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I suspect you could, actually.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to me there are many,\nmany possible ways of really discouraging a worker from\ncomplaining that are not quite as tangible as the list\nunder 703. So the D.C. Circuit -- and I think even the\nSG here, which seems like a variation of the D.C.\nCircuit -- much -- the standards seem much -- not as\ndifferent as you might -- as it seems to me you're\nsaying. But -- but they're -- they're trying to be a\nlittle vaguer and a bit broader than the specific\nEllerth language because they recognize there are many\npossible ways of seriously injuring a person with the\nintent or -- to stop them from complaining. That gives\neffect to the language differences.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It leaves it up to case-by-\ncase. It leaves it up to the administrative agency,\nall in areas where I frankly don't know one lunch from\nanother.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know one lunch from\nanother often, but the -- the EEOC might and -- and so\nmight a judge who hears evidence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's the virtue of\ntheir standard.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- I mean, you can ask Mr.\nGarre what his view is with respect to the waiting on\nthe position of the Solicitor General here.\nBut it still seems to me that there is a\nfundamental difference between the way the D.C. Circuit\nis analyzing this case and -- and the way this Court\nanalyzed it Ellerth. And the fundamental difference is\n-- I agree with you. There are other circumstances\nthat are not tangible employment actions that are,\nnevertheless, actionable under both 703 and 704, but\nthose are -- those are taken care of under the Meritor\nstandards. The -- the assumption is that they are both\nretaliatory in purpose and that they are severe or\npervasive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: When you reach that standard,\nthen you create a question of fact for the jury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what about the Seventh\nCircuit case that posed the question of same job, same\ncharacter of work, except that the employee had flex\ntime, which enabled her to take care of her disabled\nchild when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just\nchanged to -- same job except it's got to be 9:00 to\n5:00. Would that fit within your definition?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I doubt it actually, Justice\nGinsburg, because I think typically mere\ninconveniences, even -- even significant\ninconveniences, have traditionally been rejected as\nbases for taking an issue to the jury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the jury has\nmade a finding that the only reason that was done was\nin retaliation for her having filed a complaint.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, every one of\nthese cases is based on the assumption that the only\nreason it was done is because of retaliation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The lunch is in exactly the\nsame position.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say that's\noutside --\nMR. PHILLIPS: So that can't be the standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that would be outside\n704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for\nfiling a complaint. Just switch her from a work\nroutine that she could easily manage and still take\ncare of her family and to one that is impossible for\nher to manage.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, if you adopt\nthe other approach, what you say is that every change\nin assignments within the ordinary course of business\nis subject to claim by a plaintiff --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- in any situation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not every --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- where he or she thinks\nshe's been retaliated against.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not everyone, but only the\nones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person\nfrom filing a charge. And that would not be every\ntrivial --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And -- and again, the problem\nwith that legal standard, Justice Ginsburg, is it is\nnot the same one that applies under section 703, and it\nseems to me there's no reason to provide greater\nprotections under 704 to plaintiffs than you would have\nunder section 703.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't you say that\nJustice Ginsburg's hypothetical would be covered by the\nMeritor standard, if in fact this woman couldn't --\ncouldn't really do the job with this -- with this new\ntime assignment? Why wouldn't it qualify as being\nsufficiently severe or persuasive --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Pervasive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to alter the conditions\nof the victim's employment and create an abusive work\nenvironment?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, to be sure, that's a\npossibility -- that's a possible answer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- this is a\npeculiar effect on one person, but for most people --\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it could be severe enough.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- most people it wouldn't\nmatter. But --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the question is, is\nit severe, I think, to that person? I think that is\nthe Meritor standard, is, is it severe to the\nindividual plaintiff?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're changing your\nanswer. You originally told me that, no, that that\nwouldn't fit because it's the same job.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, that's because\nthat's the tangible employment aspect of it. Justice\nScalia says you're right about -- well, I don't know if\nhe said I'm right about the tangible -- tangible\nemployment aspect of it. But he says, you know, as you\nrecognize, there is a second category of claims, and\nthe second category of claims is the Meritor standard,\nwhich I've been arguing for.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't a change in the hours\nthat a person works a change in the terms and\nconditions? You change your -- somebody's shift from\nthe day shift to the -- to the night shift, isn't that\na change under 703?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It -- it probably depends on\nwhether or not it was the expectation of the -- of the\nemployee that -- that he or she would have a certain\nset of hours, because an awful lot of employees take a\njob with the expectation that they'll work any hours.\nNow, you may get into a particular pattern and -- and\neven set yourself up for that, but if -- if the\nexpectation is that you were going to work potentially\n24 hours and you shift from one set to another, that I\ndon't think is a change in terms and conditions of\nemployment within the meaning of 703.\nIf I could just shift slightly to the\nsuspension, pending investigation, part of the case.\nAnd there are two parts, and it's important to\nrecognize that if the Court sets aside either one of\nthose claims, then we're entitled to a new trial\nbecause the damages flow directly from both and there\nwas no specific -- there was no special verdict in this\ncase to identify what -- where the damages come from.\nAnd our argument with respect to the\nsuspension, pending investigation, is that there was\nsimply no final action taken by the employer in this\ncontext until 15 days later. She was suspended for\ninsubordination by her supervisor. Under the\ncollective bargaining agreement, all she had to do was\nsend in a letter. If she didn't want to send in a\nletter, the -- the decision would become final and\nthere would be final action that's clearly subject to a\nclaim under section 704.\nShe did send in a letter. There was an\ninformal investigation. The informal investigation\nconcluded that there was no basis for suspending her\nfor insubordination, and she was reinstated with\ncomplete back pay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So she was docked in her pay\nfor 2 weeks. I mean, for some people, this would be a\nreal hardship, no pay for 2 weeks. I mean, it's --\nit's final as far as she's concerned, for those 2\nweeks.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Except that it was all -- it\nwas -- it was reinstated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, they went back\nlater and -- and made up for their mistake. But -- but\nthe -- it seems to me the issue is whether a mistake\nwas made that -- that was final action that hurt her.\nI don't see why -- it's certainly official action. I\nmean, you can't say --\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is official action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's not official just --\njust because it was decreed by a -- you know, a track\nboss or something. It -- it was an action of the\ncompany because the company cut -- cut off her pay for\n2 weeks. Right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but then the question\nstill remains, Justice Scalia, for it to be a tangible\nemployment action, is it -- is it available to the\nemployer to cure, when the purpose of this entire\nstatutory scheme is to avoid litigation and to provide\ninformal mechanisms for protecting the rights of the\nemployee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if the employer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it didn't cure. I\nmean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not just 2 weeks. And she\nunderstandably experienced much stress in that time.\nShe worried about how she would be able to feed her\nchildren, could she get them Christmas presents. That\nwas -- there was nothing that she got, when it was\ndetermined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that\ncompensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the\nmedical expense that she incurred because she had that\nstress.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, there still\nremains the core question of whether this is a tangible\nemployment action. It's not a long-term action. It's\nnot an economic effect, and the fact of -- of anxiety\n-- that happens all the time in the work place. It's\nnot actionable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But when -- when somebody\nis suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it\ncan get. It gets registered officially. This person\nis suspended, and if she doesn't do something about it,\nshe's out.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But she did something about\nit, and it was corrected, Your Honor.\nI'd like to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- official action is --\nis different from -- the problem with Ellerth was that\nif there's nothing formally that had been done, the\nemployer -- this -- Ellerth was concerned with\nvicarious liability, nothing official. There had been\nnone -- the boss wouldn't know about it. But somebody\nwho is suspended, that is an official -- that's a\ntangible action.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. And the question\nis, can you cure it? And that's the fundamental issue\nwe ask you to decide.\nCan I reserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nBecause title VII prohibits an employer from\nsuspending an employee for 37 days without pay because\nof her sex or from reassigning her from one\nresponsibility that's material different -- materially\ndifferent than another responsibility because of her\nsex, it prohibits an employer from doing so because she\nfiled an EEOC charge complaining about discrimination.\nTitle VII's anti-retaliation provision\ncreates an additional basis for unlawful\ndiscrimination, but it does not create a different or\nmore expansive concept of discrimination in the\nstatute's core prohibitions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in -- in the\nabsence of any suggestion that the collective\nbargaining process is also infected with sex\ndiscrimination, why can't we rely on that process to\ngive some basis to the job descriptions? In other\nwords, forklift operator was not a separate job from\nrail yard employee, and if the union wanted to make\nthem separate jobs, they could negotiate that, but they\ndidn't. So why -- why do we regard that as a material\nchange when you're doing one part of a job as opposed\nto another part of a job?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think the problem that\nJustice Souter identified, I believe, where an employer\nor even a collective bargaining agreement could\nidentify categories that had so many different\nresponsibilities --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the\ndifference there is that's an employer unilaterally.\nWe don't have that here. The employer is dealing with\nthe union. If the jobs really were that different, the\nunion would categorize them differently and negotiate\nfor that.\nMR. GARRE: Here, what we know and what the\njury found -- and this is actually -- it's important to\nkeep in mind. This is a jury finding. The jury was\ninstructed properly on what would constitute a material\nadverse employment action. The instruction is at page\n63 and 64 of the joint appendix.\nOne of the conditions that a jury could find\nan adverse action based on was a materially significant\nchange in responsibilities. The jury heard evidence on\nthe different types of responsibilities that the\nRespondent performed, and it concluded that being\nchanged, being reassigned after 3 months of working the\nforklift, to manually repairing railroad track was a\nmaterially significant change in responsibilities.\nThat's the language that comes from this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't your approach\nrequire an employer to keep shuffling the employees\naround so they don't get a sort of adverse possession\nof particular types of job responsibilities?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think so. I think it\nwould be ultimately a jury question in this particular\ncategory of claims. As -- if -- if it were the case\nthat employees typically worked the forklift and then\nthe next day worked the -- worked the track, then the\nnext day did something else, then I don't think a jury\ncould find that there was a material -- materially\nsignificant change in responsibilities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's his point. I\nmean, that's his point, that -- that the one way to\navoid the problem is to keep shifting people around.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that -- that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would have been\nimpossible here because there was no one in that entire\nunit who could operate a forklift except this one\nemployee.\nMR. GARRE: That's right. And -- and if --\nif employees were shifted around for one reason or the\nother, then I still think it would be unlikely to be a\nmaterial change in their responsibilities when they\nwent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it -- was it\nin this category, this track category? Because it was\nsomething new for the employer. There hadn't been a\nforklift operator. I gather there had only been one\nbefore.\nMR. GARRE: There was testimony to that\neffect, Justice Ginsburg. Also, when -- when\nRespondent was hired, they had just lost their existing\nforklift operator, someone who had done that.\nIn any event, I don't think the evidence will\npermit a court, if it agrees that material adverse\nemployment action is the test, to overturn the jury's\nfinding that the change here was materially adverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to the\nsuspension, what -- what if she had been -- during the\nprocess of investigation, she had been allowed to stay\non the job with pay? In other words, the facts are the\nsame. It's just that the -- the sort of stay process\nworks the other way and she's not relieved until the\nend of the company's investigation. Is the initiation\nof that an materially adverse employment action?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think most courts have\nheld that where you have suspension with pay, then you\ndon't have material adverse employment action. Now, at\nsome level, if the suspension is so long, 6 months, a\nyear, then effectively you could have a different type\nof material adverse action, but where it's a 2-week\nsuspension to investigate, that would not be material\nadverse action. In fact, as -- as the AFL-CIO amicus\nbrief points out, I think, that's the favored practice\nin the industry.\nNow, we -- we do think that with respect to\nthe standard, that as this Court recognized in\nFaragher, it makes good sense to harmonize\ndiscrimination standards. And here, we think that\nCongress intended the courts to harmonize the standard\nfor section 704, the anti-retaliation provision, with\nthe standard for section 03, the act's core\nprohibitions.\nJustice Scalia, it does -- the section 704\ndoes omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment,\nbut as we've explained in our brief, we think it is\nreasonable to read the discriminate against as a\nshorthand for the unlawful employment practices\nidentified in section 703.\nIt's also important to keep in mind that\nCongress knows how to write a broader anti-retaliation\nstatute when it wants to. Look at the ADA, the Family\nMedical Leave Act. These are statutes which, by their\nterms, prohibit employers from any attempt to\nintimidate, coerce, threaten, or interfere with the\nexercise of rights. Look at the Family Medical Leave\nAct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know if that hurts\nyou or helps you. I mean, that -- that eliminates what\nseems to me is the strongest argument of the -- of your\nside, which is that it makes no sense to impose greater\nsanctions upon somebody who -- who files a complaint\nthan it does upon somebody who -- who violates\nsomebody's race, religion, or whatever by -- by\ndiscriminating.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're telling me it does\nmake sense, that we've done it in other areas.\nMR. GARRE: With respect, what I'm telling\nyou is that Congress has determined in that some areas\nit may be important to have a broader provision\nprotecting against intimidation and coercion. I mean,\nif the Court interprets discriminate against to include\nall that kind of conduct, then it renders those\nprovisions redundant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your test cover the\nperson who's a former employee who complained under\ntitle VII, wants a recommendation letter, and isn't\ngiven one for retaliation -- as retaliation for having\ncomplained under title VII?\nMR. GARRE: It does, Justice Ginsburg. As\nthe Government explained in its brief in the Robinson\ncase, post-employment references are reasonably viewed\nas a term, condition, or privilege of employment\nbecause it's routine for employees to request them and\nroutine for employers to provide them.\nNow, if I could address the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMR. GARRE: -- the reasonably likely to deter\ntest that you referred to, Justice Breyer.\nIf the Court disagrees with our submission\nthat the statute should be written in pari materia,\nthen as we said in our brief, we think that that is the\nnext best test to adopt. But -- but the Court should\n-- it should be clear to the Court how much broader\nthat test is than the material adverse action test.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not -- it's not -- the\n-- the words of the statute that I think are relevant\nis it -- is it -- you can't discriminate with respect\nto his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment. Now, the words I just cited are present\nin 703. So that's the substantive offense. Those\nwords, as Justice Scalia pointed out and others, are\nmissing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a\nbroader definition than those words I just cited as to\nwhat counts as harm flowing from a discrimination.\nThat's the statutory argument.\nAnd then you add, there could be good reason\nfor that. These people typically are at work and there\nare lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so\nsubtle.\nMR. GARRE: Well, again, we think Congress\nknows how to write that statute, and it does it\ndifferently. It has a different provision. For\nexample, in the Family Medical Leave Act, not only\nincluded the coercion and intimidation language, it\nalso said in any manner discriminate.\nWe also think, again, going to our\ninterpretation of discriminate against, it makes sense\nto read that for a -- as a shorthand for the -- the\nunlawful practices spelled out and detailed in section\n703.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'd be curious. In\nthe -- in the Seventh Circuit, they have a test, I\ngather, like the D.C. Circuit, which you've\ncharacterized as broader. Have there suddenly been a\nflow of these claims towards the Seventh Circuit? Is\nthere any empirical data that this concern that has\nbeen brought up is empirically present in the Seventh\nCircuit?\nMR. GARRE: Two -- two points with respect to\nthat.\nFirst, no, I don't know of empirical data in\nthe Seventh Circuit.\nSecond, we know that retaliation charges are\n-- are rising. They've more than doubled in the past\ndecade.\nAnd third, the Seventh Circuit test is\nessentially like the -- the test that this Court\napplies in the First Amendment context to determine\nwhen there's retaliation. This Court in the Rutan case\nobserved that something as trivial as failing to hold a\nbirthday party for an employee could satisfy that test.\nApplying this test in the lower courts, courts have\nheld that an officer not being able to see his police\ndog would be -- could go to a jury, that -- that a\nshunning conduct less than hostile work environment\ncould go to a jury, that failing to hold employee\nfeedback meetings could go to a jury --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if 704 doesn't\nincorporate 703 why would the -- the EEOC test be the\nnext best test? If Congress -- there's nothing in 704\nthat refers to the EEOC standard, is there?\nMR. GARRE: That's -- that's true. I mean,\nat that point, we think it would just be a policy\ndecision. Again, we think that Congress made the\npolicy decision that the tests should be harmonized.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Congress could have --\ncould have said -- could have thought not only do we\nnot want people who -- who file complaints not to\nsuffer those things that would deter a reasonable\nperson from filing a complaint, but we just don't want\nthem to suffer at all for having engaged in this\nprotected activity.\nMR. GARRE: That's possible. That would be\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: What -- what basis would\nthere be for deciding that Congress had one policy\nobjective as opposed to the other there?\nMR. GARRE: We think that the balance that\nCongress struck in title VII was from -- between\ndeterring all forms of discrimination and not -- not\nallowing every employee grievance to become a Federal\ncourt case. I think the Court has recognized\nrepeatedly not all work place conduct that's offensive\nor even harassing violates title VII, and we think that\nthat same compromise should inform the Court's\ninterpretation of section 704 of the statute.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMr. Donati.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. DONATI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DONATI: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nWhen Burlington Northern reassigned Ms. White\nfrom the forklift to the track and then removed her\nwithout pay for 37 days during Christmas, it, quote,\ndiscriminated against Ms. White under any reasonable\nstandard, the EEOC standard, the plain language\nstandard, or the standard that the unanimous en banc\ncourt of the Sixth Circuit adopted. Whatever standard\nthe Court applies, Ms. White should prevail, if it's a\nreasonable standard, other than that of the -- of the\nPetitioner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if she'd been\noperating the forklift for only a week and then she was\nreassigned? Would that still be discrimination under\nany standard?\nMR. DONATI: With respect to the motivation,\nif there -- if there was a motivation, a retaliatory\nmotivation, according to the proper reading of 704, it\nwould be because what that aims at is motivation.\nAnd the question was asked, and -- and a\nlegitimate question was asked. Why would Congress make\n704(a) more expansive than 703? Well, if you look at\nthe text of 704(a) at the beginning of the caption, it\nsays, discriminate in assisting, participating, or\ncooperating with enforcement.\nThis -- this provision, as the dissent said\nin the Jackson case last term, in referring to\nretaliation, the dissent made this -- made this point\nabout the relationship between retaliation and the\nprimary right. The dissent indicated that the primary\nright is being protected by the retaliation provision,\nthat without the retaliation provision, the primary\nright could be impeded, inhibited, and prevented from\nindividuals having access to the remedial mechanisms.\nIt doesn't take much to intimidate an\nindividual from filing a claim of discrimination if\nthey have an economic interest. It takes much, much\nless to intimidate a witness to come and testify when\nthey have no basis.\nWhat 704 was aimed at was allowing the law\nenforcement agency here, the EEOC, to have access to\ncomplaints about discrimination and witnesses, allowing\nthe courts to have access to complaints and witnesses\nbecause without that free access and without 704 acting\nas a guardian around the primary rights, the primary\nrights would be eviscerated.\nThis is a perfect example of -- of a case\nwhere that's the situation. You have a -- a woman here\nwho did exactly what this Court asked her to do in\nEllerth. She complained internally about sexual\nharassment. She was hired because of her forklift\nresponsibilities. She was immediately put on the\nforklift. She performed for 90 days competently as a\nforklift operator. No complaints about what she did.\nBecause she complained about sexual harassment, the\njury found, and correctly, she was removed from the\nforklift.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm a supervisor, and\nthe employee files a complaint against me as a\nsupervisor. Thereafter, I am not as friendly to that\nemployee as I used to be. I don't smile and say, good\nmorning, how are you, as I used to. All right?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you wouldn't expect me\nto. This person has, you know, hauled me onto the\nblock. Now, am -- am I discriminating against that\nperson?\nMR. DONATI: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not? I'm not treating\nher the way I did before.\nMR. DONATI: No. Until there is some use of\nofficial authority that affects that individual, you're\nnot discriminating. That's a -- that's a personal\nmatter between you and the individual.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sort of like taking her to\nlunch.\nMR. DONATI: If it's -- if it's a blue collar\nworker and it's -- it's not part of their\nresponsibility and they sometimes eat together in the\nlunchroom or not, that would not be. However, if it is\na --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you say it -- it has to\nbe part of my -- it doesn't have to relate to her terms\nand conditions of employment, you say --\nMR. DONATI: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it's not the same\nas 703. But somehow you say it -- it has to. Does it\nhave to or not have to?\nMR. DONATI: There are situations where it\nwould be broader than 703. 704 would be broader. An\nexample. If a CEO of a company came up to an African\nAmerican male and punched him because he's Black, that\nwould not rise to the level of a hostile work\nenvironment under your test. It wouldn't alter that\nindividual's terms and conditions of employment.\nHowever, if the CEO came up to an individual\nwho had filed a charge of discrimination -- of\ndiscrimination, and said, I don't like you filing\ncharges of discrimination, and pushed that individual,\nthat would have the effect of impeding individuals from\ncomplaining. And that's -- that's a situation that's\ndifferent because Congress anticipated that -- that\nretaliation is only as varied as the human imagination.\nCongress could have easily --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I worry about that, as\n-- as varied as the human imagination. Juries can have\nwonderful imaginations. I mean, that -- that is the\nproblem. Is it meant to be this -- this uncontrolled,\nthis uncabined?\nMR. DONATI: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is your\ncriterion that is going to stop every little thing from\n-- from being deemed a retaliatory measure, such as not\nsaying good morning to this employee?\nMR. DONATI: There are several things that\nare built into the statute. First is 701(b). It has\nto be an act of the employer, and those trivial matters\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that. But\nalmost any act of his subordinates will be deemed act\nof the -- of the employer where retaliation is\nconcerned, I'll bet you.\nWhat else besides that?\nMR. DONATI: Plus, you always have to show\ncausation, and many, many cases are dismissed on the\nbasis of summary judgment, even termination cases on\nthe basis of causation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll give you causation.\nBut I'm talking about the triviality -- the\ntriviality of the action in question. Is there no test\nthat eliminates a trivial action from the aggrieved\nemployee who -- who wants to litigate?\nMR. DONATI: Your Honor, both the EEOC test,\nas well as our test, is one based upon a reasonable\nperson under all of the circumstances. And -- and the\ntrial courts frequently say under this set of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A reasonable person would\nwhat -- would what?\nMR. DONATI: Under our standard, it would be\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A reasonable person would\nconsider it to be?\nMR. DONATI: Adverse.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Adverse.\nMR. DONATI: If it was -- if it was\nunfavorable to the plaintiff. On the EEOC standard, it\nwould be if it deterred an individual from filing a\ncharge.\nAnd, Justice Scalia, we have cited favorably\nthe EEOC standard. What we were asked to do here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the EEOC standard any\nmore based in the text of the statute than -- than the\nstandard proposed by your adversary here?\nMR. DONATI: That's why we proposed one\nthat's based with what the statute means. And -- and\nthe statute is very clear. The plain language is\nunambiguous. That's our first test, which is\nunfavorable to the employee based upon an objective\nstandard.\nBut if the Court felt it necessary to -- to\nback to a position that was not quite so expansive, the\nEEOC standard is -- is the one that's most rational\nbecause it's based in the purpose of 704(a).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You won on the basis of\nthe standard that the Sixth Circuit used, which was not\nyour standard and not the EEOC standard. Why should\nthis Court deal with anything other than that the\npetitioner's standard is unsatisfactory, that at least\nthe Sixth Circuit standard -- why should the Court deal\nwith the universe of cases when it has this case before\nit, two actions, and a unanimous Sixth Circuit judgment\nthat says these two actions fall within 704?\nMR. DONATI: Justice Ginsburg, you're exactly\ncorrect. You don't have to reach the issue about how\nexpansive 704 is here. You can affirm the Sixth\nCircuit's decision based upon the material adverse\nemployment action standard that they articulated, that\nwas litigated below, that the defendant did not object\nto, and which we won on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you said\nearlier that the act -- one of the protections against\ntrivial charges was that the act had to be the act of\nthe employer. If the employer sets up a review system\nin which the final act of the employer is the decision,\nwhy is a preliminary charge, initial suspension, review\n-- why are those also considered acts of the employer?\nMR. DONATI: Mr. Chief Justice, I want to\nanswer one question related to that. The collective\nbargaining agreement did not cover the forklift.\nThat's in the trial transcript on page 524. It was a\nnew position. It was not covered by the collective\nbargaining. So they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that mean,\nit was not covered by the collective bargaining\nagreement? Presumably you paid -- the person who did\nthat was paid wages pursuant to the collective\nbargaining agreement.\nMR. DONATI: It was not a defined job within\nthe collective bargaining agreement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. DONATI: And if you look at the -- the\njob title, which is part of the joint appendix, forklift\nis not mentioned, and it was not part of that.\nBut to answer your question specifically with\nrespect to these facts, the -- in this case here, she\nwas discharged. If you look at the joint appendix, on\nrule 91(b) -- and that's found at page 54 and 55 of --\nI'm sorry. 55 of the joint appendix. This is the rule\nunder which she requested the, quote, investigation.\nBy its very terms, it doesn't even apply until an\nemployee is, quote, disciplined or, quote, dismissed.\nShe was dismissed when she was removed from service.\nThen she asked for a hearing under subpart (b), and she\nwas given an investigation.\nThis Court, in its jurisprudence dealing with\nstatute of limitations, said in the Morgan case that an\nact of discrimination occurs when it happens. Well,\nwhen she was happened -- when this happened, she lost\npay, she lost benefits. She was terminated. Even --\neven their own witness, Roadmaster Brown, testified had\nshe not asked for an appeal, she was terminated. So it\nwas a discrete act at that time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position is that\nit would be an -- it would be a covered employment\naction even if none of that were true, she didn't lose\npay, she didn't lose benefits, so long as there was the\ninitiation of the disciplinary action. You regard that\nas sufficiently adverse under 704.\nMR. DONATI: Well, under these facts, it was\nsufficiently adverse because she lost pay. Now, in a\n-- in a theoretical sense, if she had not lost pay,\nthat still could be adverse under 704(a). It depends\nupon the effect and the motive. I don't think that\nanyone would quarrel under 703 if an African American\nwas suspended without pay because of race, that that\nwould be actionable. Why would it not be actionable in\nthis context?\nThere's a difference between damages and\nwhether or not there's actionability under this one\nlittle part of -- of the claim. Perhaps if she was --\nwas suspended for a retaliatory motive and 5 days later\nshe was returned, she may have no damages, and -- and\nthe claim might -- but in terms of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Other than\neligibility for punitive damages.\nMR. DONATI: Well, assuming that you could\nget through the hurdles. And I don't think punitive\ndamages would necessarily sound there. In the Kolstad\ncase, the Court indicated one factor to consider would\nbe how quickly the -- the defendant corrected the\nsituation. I mean, if you have a -- if there's a\nlegitimate process that's -- that's available and a\nsupervisor who has authority to suspend does that for a\nretaliatory motive and -- and that process corrects it,\nit may be a factor in punitives, but it's not a factor\nwhether a -- an act has been taken because the act is a\ndiscrete act. It caused her to lose compensation and\n-- and to lose benefits. So it could affect the\npunitive damages.\nNow, with respect to the -- the statutory\nconstruction -- well, let me address the -- the\nforklift issue just a -- a little bit further.\nIf you take the position that the -- the\npetitioner has here, Ms. White -- it's a jury finding.\nTheir witnesses testified -- went from the most easy\nor one of the most easy positions to the most difficult\nposition because she complained about sexual\nharassment. That's the finding of fact. They don't\ndispute the findings of fact. That's the finding of\nfact. So if -- if he's correct, tomorrow, if his --\nhis position is affirmed, they could tell everyone who\ncomplains about sexual harassment, that if you do that,\nwe're going to transfer you to the most difficult\nposition in the company.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose I\ndisagree with you as to the standard, that is, I think\n704 and 703 both require something related to the\nemployment. Would -- what would the outcome be? Would\n-- would the case have to go back to be submitted to\nthe jury under that standard? What standard did the\njury find --\nMR. DONATI: Your Honor, if -- if you look at\n-- if you look at the joint appendix at page 63, the\ntrial judge actually instructed the court -- instructed\nthe jury, listing six factors. Those six factors are\nlisted in a footnote in Ellerth, which you cite\nfavorably as what the standard is -- or what the\nstandard is for vicarious liability. So the court --\nthe jury was instructed on material adverse employment\naction standard. It was tried on the material adverse\nemployment action standard.\nI argued that the forklift position was\nmaterially adverse. The defendant, if you look at the\ntranscript of the closing at pages 48 and 49, didn't\neven challenge that it was adverse. Everybody that\nheard the proof, common sense told you that when you\nwent from a forklift running things around to pulling\nout railroad ties, it was adverse. So to answer your\nquestion, Justice Scalia, we traveled all the way up to\nthis Court on the material adverse employment action\nstandard, and we won.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does -- what does\nmaterial mean?\nMR. DONATI: That's a great question, and we\n--\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DONATI: -- and we -- we truly struggled\nwith that. We found nothing in the statute, the text\nof the statute to say material. Where it uses adverse,\nat -- at section 703(a)(2), it uses the term adverse,\nbut it doesn't use it with the term material. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do -- do you think it\ndoes anything more than just eliminate clearly de\nminimis action?\nMR. DONATI: I'm sorry. I didn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do you think the --\nthe materially modifier here does anything other than\neliminate obviously de minimis behavior on the part of\nthe employer?\nMR. DONATI: I don't think it does anything\nother than that.\nIt could also be interpreted as -- as this\nCourt said in the -- in the Wrigley case involving\ninterpretation of statutes, that there's a de minimis\nrule. It could -- it could also be applied that way,\nthat every -- every statute -- there's a -- that --\nthat construction applies some de minimis level view.\nBut in terms of this case, this was\ndefinitely material. I mean, it was substantial\ninjury, substantial action to -- to Ms. White.\nBut with respect to the forklift, their\nwitnesses testified -- and we cite at pages 2 and 3 of\nthe brief -- that they considered it easier. The\nsupervisor, Mr. Brown, testified that the men\nconsidered it easier. And it clearly was.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what if she\noperated the forklift usually 3 out of 5 days, and the\nother 2 days was pulling up the rail ties and -- and\nthe shift was now she does -- operates the forklift 2\nout of 5 days and 3 out of 5 days she's pulling up rail\nties? Is that materially adverse?\nMR. DONATI: That probably would not -- I\nprobably could not convince a jury that that was\nmaterially adverse. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that isn't the test, I\nmean, whether you can convince a jury.\nI think you -- you have to acknowledge that\n-- that before we -- we say that these trial\ninstructions were adequate to -- to give you your\nvictory, we -- we have to find that at least a\nreasonable jury could conclude under section 703 that\n-- that both of these -- both of these adverse actions\nqualified as discrimination under 703, if -- if we're\ngoing to use that test. Right? You acknowledge that.\nMR. DONATI: I acknowledge and the facts --\nand the Sixth Circuit unanimously affirmed that -- that\nthe facts were there. And I could -- I could go on for\n30 minutes about the facts, and they're -- they're\ncontained in the first --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but that -- that is at\nleast what -- what's before us here, that if -- if we\ngo the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude,\nin order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could\nfind. This jury did, but we'd have to find that that's\nreasonable. Right?\nMR. DONATI: Yes.\nYou know, I would like to address two things\nthat have been mixed. Apples and oranges have been\nmixed here about tangible employment action, and that's\nthe standard this Court has adopted.\nWhat the Court did in Ellerth was apply the\nrules of vicarious liability in a discrete set of -- of\ncases, harassment cases. Harassment cases arise out of\nthe word condition. As you indicated, sexual\nharassment has to alter the condition, and it has to be\nsevere or pervasive. And what the -- the petitioner is\n-- is saying is that because of your application of\ntangible employment action to vicarious liability, that\nyou really defined what constitutes discrimination.\nWell, that's not what the -- the ruling was.\nYou were strictly limited to whether instances of\nvicarious liability, when -- when employers will be\nfound liable. At the outset, that needs to be, I\nthink, clarified that it was not a finding of what\nconstitutes discrimination.\nAnd with respect to also the Ellerth\nsituation, any test that this Court adopts should not\nbe a per se test where some things are per se legal,\nbecause when you say that an act of retaliation is per\nse legal, it provides safe harbor for people to do\nthings to individuals. Most employers are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right in thinking -- I\njust want to clarify this -- that in the circuit court,\nthey applied a pretty tough standard, namely, a\nstandard that sounds a lot like Ellerth, the Kocsis, or\nwhatever it is? Tangible employment actions, a\nsignificant change in employment status, hiring,\nfiring, failing to promote, reassignment with\nsignificantly different responsibilities, or a decision\ncausing a significant change in benefits. And that's\nbasically what the jury was instructed.\nMR. DONATI: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you won under the\ntoughest standard.\nMR. DONATI: That's correct, a very tough\nstandard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in a sense, you have\nnowhere to go but up.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DONATI: Exactly right. And I find --\nand I find myself, Justice Breyer, here sort of arguing\nagainst the standard that I won under.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't care what standard\n--\nMR. DONATI: And I don't care what standard\nit is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for this case.\nMR. DONATI: I don't care what the standard\nis for this case.\nBut if you adopt a -- a standard that is --\nis broad -- or you have to adopt a national standard or\n-- and you don't have to here. You don't have to make\nthese -- make these findings.\nBut if you do and you adopt a material\nadverse employment action standard, there always needs\nto be a provision that prevents per se rules because --\nand in the Sixth Circuit, they talk about unique\ncircumstances. Some other circuits talk about unusual\nor exceptional circumstances because if you -- if you\nblack letter something, that this is legal retaliation,\nemployers who want to will engage in that process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and the other argument\nis that if you don't do it, there's no way to -- to get\na case dismissed before it goes to a jury. You're\nsaying every claim is going to be a jury trial. I\nmean, that -- you know, come on.\nMR. DONATI: Justice Scalia, every claim\nwould not be a jury trial because you're going to have\nto show the causation issues and damages issues. And\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the triviality issue\nwould be out of the case. No matter how trivial, it\ngoes to a jury. That's -- that's what you want us to\nsay.\nMR. DONATI: No, Your Honor, that's not what\nI want --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then we have to have\nsome per se rules.\nMR. DONATI: Well, the -- the rule that you\ncould apply that would not have per se rules and would\nferret out any kind of -- of trivial matters would be\nthe EEOC standard with a de minimis rule.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Don't you want us to\nexclude this ultimate employment decision? I think\nthat's one thing. In order to win, you have to say\nwhat counts is the suspension and not the ultimate\ndecision.\nMR. DONATI: Yes, Your Honor. Under the\nultimate employment action standard of the Fifth\nCircuit, the -- the suspension would be in question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So for you to win to\npreserve your Sixth Circuit victory, that would have to\nbe ruled out.\nMR. DONATI: The Court should find that\nthat's not applicable and it's not appropriate under\ntitle VII and -- and that would be necessary for us to\nprevail, even though the defendant did not argue\nultimate employment action standard at the trial level,\ndidn't ask for such an instruction, didn't raise that\nissue until subsequent to the -- this. But you're\ncorrect. We would need the Court to say that that does\nnot apply.\nAnd then one other issue about -- about\nbright line rules. I advise and many lawyers advise\nwomen every day that complain about sexual harassment.\nAnd Mr. Phillips is absolutely correct. There has\nbeen a rise in retaliation claims. And, of course,\nit's complex what the reasons are, but anecdotally I\ncan tell you a lot of it sits at the foot of Ellerth\nbecause employers establish policies, they publish\nthe policies, they educated women and men about those\npolicies. People use those policies, and women who\ncomplain about sexual harassment, such as Ms. White,\ninternally and then are retaliated against, when they\ngo to the EEOC, they file a retaliation claim. And\nthere's been an increase of those claims.\nBut if this Court applies a black line rule,\na per se rule, where you say something is legal, that\nyou can do what you did to Ms. White, then I'll have to\nadvise individuals to go to the EEOC. There might be\nsome retaliation and it's legal. And a woman placed in\na situation like that will not complain about sexual\nharassment. And the protection, the guardian that rule\n-- that 704(a) has around the primary right will be\neliminated, and the primary right will be adversely\naffected because women will no longer complain. So\nwhatever rule you apply, don't apply a black letter,\nper se rule because you're going to cause serious harm\nto the underlying primary rights.\nIf there are no more questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. DONATI: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, you\nhave 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me begin by focusing on the jury\ninstruction in this case. The jury was not instructed\nwith the Ellerth standard. There's a variant of the\nEllerth standard, and it was not upheld by the court of\nappeals on the Ellerth standard.\nWhat the court of appeals said was in the\nSixth Circuit there is a unique circumstances standard\nthat arises out of its particular way of analyzing\nthese issues, and under that standard, it could be\nupheld. And that was the same basis on which the\ndistrict court at Pet. App. 118a upheld this particular\nverdict.\nSo the question of the right standard to be\napplied and whether a reasonable jury could find it\nunder these circumstances, Justice Scalia, is clearly\npresented in this case, and it's an issue that this\nCourt still has to decide.\nSecond, with respect to the suspension, the\n-- the collective bargaining agreement specifically\nprovides for discipline and then 15 days. It's not a\nfinal decision. There's nothing in that collective\nbargaining agreement that says it's a decision of the\nemployer. To the contrary, the decision at the end of\nthe -- of the investigation is the decision of the\ncarrier. And we don't need a final employer action\nstandard in order to prevail on this. What we need is\nthe opportunity to cure and a reasonable way under --\nunder section 704, as the D.C. Circuit held\nspecifically in Taylor.\nAnd then finally, with respect to the\nobservation about, you know, don't make any per se\nrules, well, the truth is there aren't going to be any\nper se rules. There will be a lot of cases that get\ndismissed out under a tangible employment action theory\nbecause there aren't tangible employment actions. But\nthere will always be available the severe and -- and\npervasive standard, which is always going to constrain\nany employer from -- from adopting those kinds of\npolicies.\nAnd the point that counsel made is that he\nrecommends to every one of his employees -- he probably\nshould recommend two things. One, you show up. You\nought to file a complaint about discrimination in the\nwork place because under his approach, you will,\ntherefore, be super-protected under section 704 in a\nway you wouldn't have been by merely being protected\nunder 703. That cannot possibly be what Congress\nintended or what is helpful for the work place. The\nCourt should reject that approach, should reject the\nSixth Circuit's view, and remand.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\n"
