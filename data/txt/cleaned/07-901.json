WILLIAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe factfinding at issue in this case is\nsignificantly different than the factfinding at issue in\nthis Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases, in which the\nCourt struck down changes in sentencing practice that\nhad the effect of removing factfinding from the province\nof the jury. In those cases, the change in practice\nmeant that a defendant could be convicted by the jury\nfor one offense and then, based on nonjury factfinding,\nthe defendant could be sentenced for what appeared to be\nan aggravated, more serious offense without the jury\nhaving made all the factual determinations necessary for\nthat more serious offense.\nThat doesn't happen in this case. In this\ncase, the jury convicted Mr. Ice of six counts, and the\nsentence imposed on each of those six convictions\nsatisfies the Apprendi rule. There's no additional jury\nfactfinding that alters -- or nonjury factfinding,\nexcuse me, that alters a specific sentence for one of\nthe convictions. Instead, what the factfinding in this\ncase does is to significantly restrain the judge's\nability to decide how to administer those multiple\nsentences for the multiple convictions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it -- it, by\nreason of the unusual law at issue here -- -I think it's\nunusual, I don't -- I'm unaware of any other State that\nhas one -- the sentences -- the defendant has an\nentitlement to have the sentences run concurrently\nunless a certain additional fact exists and that\nadditional fact is to be found by the judge rather than\nby the jury. So that if you take seriously what -- what\nwe have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which\nhas the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the\ndefendant is entitled must be found by the jury -- if\nyou take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't\napply here.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, first on the\npoint in terms of how unique this statute is, there are\nother States that have similar requirements, that there\nis initial a presumption that multiple sentences will be\nconcurrent unless there is additional nonjury\nfactfinding that authorizes the judge to impose\nconsecutive sentences. So it's not entirely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many others? Do you\nknow?\nMS. WILLIAMS: It's difficult actually to\ncome up with an exact count, and the numbers vary when\nyou look at how other courts have sort of combined\ncases, but perhaps as many as 13, but as different\nStates have sort of changed their practice some of those\nhave fallen away. It's clear that there's at least a\nminority of States that have this kind of limitation on\nwhat is otherwise inherent or a discretionary authority\nof the judge to decide how to administer these multiple\nsentences.\nThe difference is that what this Court has\nbeen addressing in the Apprendi line of cases has always\nbeen a specific sentence imposed on a specific\nconviction. And what Oregon Supreme Court did was to\nexpand that to say that, in addition to the statutory\nmaximum that this Court described in Blakely, there is\nin effect a second statutory maximum that you must\nconsider when there are multiple sentences being imposed\nfor multiple convictions, and that's the total period of\nincarceration that the defendant will serve with and\nwithout the additional factfinding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, this fact can --\ncan turn out to be the most significant fact for the\ndefendant. I mean, it could lengthen his sentence\nenormously. It's more important than many of the other\nfacts that we leave to the jury.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, and in this\ncase, for example, the additional factfinding extends\nthe whole duration of the -- of Mr. Ice's period of\nincarceration from 90 months to 340 months. But what is\nsignificant is that, as this Court said in Blakely, the\nSixth Amendment is a reservation of jury power; it's not\na limitation on judicial power. And I would submit it's\nnot a limitation on legislative power, except to the\nextent that that exercise of power removed something\nfrom the province of the jury. Historically, it's\nundisputed that the judge made this decision about how\nmultiple sentences would be administered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same\nabout sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth\nAmendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power\nwhere at least there is an entitlement by law to a\ncertain lower sentence. And there we said you can't\nleave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that\ntrigger that law exist or not.\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think what's important is\nthe foundation for that holding and the foundation for\nthe Apprendi rule. It wasn't simply that factfinding in\ngeneral that exposes the defendant to a harsher\npunishment is something that should -- would be better\nserved by having it done by the jury. It was that,\nbecause of the changes in sentencing practices, because\nStates and Congress have been taking what traditionally\nhad been elements of an offense and relabeling them as\nsomething else, as sentencing factors, that the jury was\nno longer finding what traditionally it would have found\nfor each conviction. It was no longer finding what\nwould have been each element of an offense.\nSo what the rule does is it provides a\nbright-line way of testing what is the functional\nequivalent of an element for a specific offense that\nwould have been within the province of the jury and\ntherefore that can't be removed without violating the\nSixth Amendment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The rule --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The rule does bear on\nculpability, and culpability sounds like part of the\ndefinition of an offense or a more serious offense.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed\nthis case as in terms of -- that it may have simply been\nhappenstance that the Court was looking only at single\nconvictions and single sentences being imposed on those.\nBut I think that takes away the analysis that the court\nused in reaching the conclusions that it reached.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand why\nthis happenstance is required to do it under the\nstatute. I didn't quite understand that.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You said it's only\nhappenstance. He has to do it under the statute if he\nmakes the finding.\nMS. WILLIAMS: No, what I'm trying to say is\nthat I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed the fact\nthat so far in this Court's cases you had only been\ndealing with a single offense and a single sentence, as\n-- as not foreclosing the possibility that there would\nbe a different statutory maximum when you have multiple\nsentences being imposed for multiple convictions. And\nso the supreme court, I think, treated it -- what I was\nsaying was it simply is happenstance that that had been\nthe -- the nature of the cases that this Court has\ndecided, but then drew from this Court's decision and\nfrom discussion about punishment a broader meaning that\nsomehow the jury must be involved in any factual\ndetermination that relates to the overall quantum of\npunishment for multiple sentences being imposed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't we furnish the\npremise for that broader reasoning? Because we pointed\nout that the traditional role of the jury was standing\nin effect as the buffer between the power of the State\nand the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi\ncases was that the concept of elements was being\nmanipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood\nin that -- in effect, that buffer position.\nAnd I guess the question here would be, is\nthere -- is there room for -- in effect, for\nmanipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing\nscheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme,\nso that the jury in effect loses control over the\nlength, the ultimate length of time that an individual\nis going to serve? What is your response to that?\nMS. WILLIAMS: That the jury does not lose\nanything that the jury historically had within its --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the problem\nwith that argument the problem that Justice Scalia\nraised a moment ago, where you could have made the same\nargument with respect to a mandatory State guideline,\nbut nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear\non the new law an old concept. And this is a change in\nthe law, to be sure. I agree with you, historically.\nThe judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at\nall, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted\nto, subject to some kind of a rule of reason.\nBut we've got to apply the Apprendi concept\nand the concern of the jury trial right to this new\nsituation. So I don't think it's an answer to say,\nwell, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But there's something\ndifferent here in terms of looking back on history and\nwhat we have presently, compared to when you are looking\nat the offense-specific sentence associated with a\nspecific conviction, because the changes in practice\nthere had the effect of taking away the ability to find\nan element or something that was the equivalent of an\nelement, of removing that from the jury. And,\nhistorically, that is clearly what the jury's job was:\nTo stand in as a buffer between the defendant and the\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I gather from your\nargument that you would -- you would be taking the other\nside and you would be saying that it has to go to the\njury if, instead of being a statute that applies to\nconcurrent sentences from various crimes, there was\nadded to a particular crime, if this crime was committed\nwith the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not\nrun concurrently but shall run consecutively with any\nother sentence arising out of this same occurrence?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There it's attached to a\nparticular crime. Do you really think that we should\nhave a different result in that case from this one?\nMS. WILLIAMS: No, Your Honor, I don't,\nalthough I think that makes it a more difficult\nsituation to try to analyze, because there it is -- it\nis focused on a specific sentence for a specific\noffense. But what is different is it still goes to not\nadding to the penalty for that sentence, but adding to\nhow you are going to administer multiple sentences.\nAnd the history here is very different.\nBecause what we have is, even though there wasn't a\nstatute when the Framers would have looked at this\nissue, the issue did exist. Judges did make the\ndetermination about how multiple sentences would be\nadministered. And what they would have considered would\nhave been a wide array of facts and without really\nlimitation other than --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same\nthing about the length of the sentence, that it was up\nto them and they considered a wide array of facts. So\nwhat? We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by\nlaw and say they can't do more than this, once you do\nthat, that fact has to be found by the jury. And that's\nwhat's going on here.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But I think what's different\nis that the history at issue and underlying Apprendi\nactually wasn't that the judge could simply make nonjury\nfactfinding and expand the sentence beyond what the\nsentence was that was associated with the jury's\nverdict; that, in fact, that was the problem. Because\nonce there was additional factfinding that permitted the\njudge to add to the penalty, that that had changed by\ntaking something away from what the jury's role was.\nAnd so here we don't have that\nsame sort of situation. I think that -- that that was\nexactly the argument this Court has rejected in those\ncases of -- of -- where Faith and others have attempted\nto suggest that historically judges were able to do this\nand so it shouldn't matter now that we have changes.\nBut the Court rejected those arguments to say that, no,\nbecause the sentencing practices have taken something\naway from the jury, that is why we have the Sixth\nAmendment violation.\nSo if in this circumstance we\n-- we have constrained judicial power -- and clearly\nthat's what this statute does, is it tells the judge\nthat, instead of being able to make this determination\nbased on this wide array of factual considerations, the\njudge now is limited in what the judge must consider to\n-- to then exercise discretion in administering these\nsentences. But all of that is\nlegislative restraint of judicial power without touching\nin any way on the jury's historic role in -- in how to\ndeal with these multiple --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right in -- I just\nwant to get the facts right. Am I right, you did this\nhistorical research, and if you start with Apprendi we\ncan go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you\nhaven't found a single case ever where it was a jury\nrather than a judge that made this question of how you\nput together sentences for two separate crimes committed\non the same occasion? Is that right, or is it an\noverstatement?\nMS. WILLIAMS: It is an overstatement only\nin the sense that I did not go back as far as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say how far you\nwent back. I said as far as you went back.\nMS. WILLIAMS: As far as I went --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what\nNebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see\nwhat was true at the time of the writing of the\nConstitution.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And at the time of the\nwriting of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us\nfeel is relevant, in that instance they did have the\njudge, not the jury, decide how to create a total\nsentence where the person had committed two crimes on\nthe same occasion.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, exactly. And that\ndifference in terms of the history of showing that this\nwas a judicial determination, that -- and now that the\nfactfinding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same\nin Apprendi. It was a judicial determination how much\nof a sentence you were going to get from ten years to\nlife. It wasn't up to the jury. It was up to the\njudge.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And yet when you constrain\nthe judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than\n20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a\ngun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be\nleft to the judge. It's a matter of law, and the facts\nmust be found by the jury. And I don't see any\ndifference here. I mean in both cases it was\ntraditionally done by judges.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But what this Court focused\non with the Apprendi rule is that, although judges made\ndecisions about sentencing within a range of possible\nsentences, what judges could not do was to find\nadditional facts that were the functional equivalent of\nan element of a greater offense. And that's what was\nhappening with those new sentencing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we defined in effect\nwhat was the functional element of the greater offense\nin terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the\njudge to increase the sentence beyond the range that\nwould have been -- that would have established the\nmaximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. And aren't we\nin exactly the same position here? Because the\ndefendant here can correctly say: I cannot be sentenced\nto the more onerous -- under a more onerous scheme of\nconsecutive sentencing unless some fact is found which\nhas not been found by the jury in coming to verdicts of\nguilty in any of these crimes; a further fact must be\nfound to expose me to the heavier penalty.\nAnd that is exactly the same as the\nsituation in Apprendi with one possible exception; and\nthat is, do you accept, as I thought you did, the\nproposition that consecutive sentencing is the heavier\npenalty or is a more onerous sentencing alternative. If\nyou accept that, I don't see how you would escape the\nanalogy with Apprendi.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, I do not accept\nthat it is a -- an enhanced penalty for any of the\nspecific convictions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Everybody agrees.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And it would be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you had a choice between\ntwo concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences,\nyou know which one you are going to choose. So we -- we\nknow what is the heavier sentence or the heavier\nsentencing option.\nMS. WILLIAMS: It does have certainly a\nharsher effect on the defendant than serving each of the\nsentences beginning at the same time. But I think the\nsame could be said in terms of mandatory minimum\nsentences and the factfinding required for those.\nWe obviously have cases where a defendant\nfacing a mandatory minimum sentence is going to be\nconfronted with a harsher sentence than he would face\nwithout that additional factor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the mandatory minimum\nis at least within the range of sentencing possibilities\nthat the judge could impose anyway without any further\nfactfinding by the jury.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And depending on how you view\nthis in terms of if you are looking at it with an\noffense-specific frame, each sentence imposed for each\nof the six convictions is also within the range of what\nthe judge can impose. This additional piece of when\nthose sentences begin does not take away from the jury's\nrole. It does limit what the judge could otherwise have\ndone, and it does that limitation by requiring\nfactfinding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- what\nabout restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having\nhim tried as an adult? What about probation? What\nabout alternative drug programs? What about diversion?\nI mean, I can think of five or six where there might be\na factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation\nwhere the total amount of punishment is greater rather\nthan less.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, and we are\nnow litigating some of those very questions in light of\nthe Oregon Supreme Court decision about what is the\nscope when you look beyond the specific sentence imposed\nfor a specific conviction and look at this greater\nquantum of punishment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a lot easier to limit\nit to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a\nparticular conviction as opposed to sentence for the\nwhole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles\nthat Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome\nif -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to\nsentences.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Although, Your Honor, some of\nthese Douse-Greene decisions that are made again by\nnonjury factfinding do affect what the defendant's\nperiod of incarceration is going to be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And doesn't the sentencing\n-- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include\nrestitution, to include what is the equivalent of\nprobation? I mean, there is a broad definition of the\nword \"sentence\" in the law which includes some of the\nthings that I mentioned, though not all.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, and the same\nis true for Oregon, that the sentence imposed and if you\n-- the -- the judgments are set out in the joint\nappendix in this case, that set out each of the\nsentences imposed for each of the six convictions, and\nyou will see that there are a number of things in\naddition to the term of incarceration that are a part of\nthat sentence being imposed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question\nthat may seem totally irrelevant? Do you think our\ndecision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania was correctly\ndecided?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me under your\nreasoning in your case you might say that case was\nwrong. And I think it was wrong. I will be perfectly\ncandid and say so. I think it was a very important\ndecision.\nMS. WILLIAMS: No, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat it is necessary to say that that decision is wrong\nto be consistent with the position I am asserting here\nor the decision in Harris, because there the Court made\na distinction between what the jury traditionally would\nhave been -- been doing and determined that that jury\nrole was limited to deciding facts that increased only\nthe -- the maximum penalty that the defendants faced.\nAnd so factfinding tied to imposing a mandatory minimum\nsentence is different.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. But it\nseems to me it is -- in the old common law tradition,\nfollowing sort of the reasoning in the case you relied\non, McMillan really should have come out the other way,\nbecause the jury normally would be finding the facts\nthat would allow the minimum -- the maximum to go up or\nthe minimum. I forget which it was.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And -- and what I have done\nis to start with the proposition that we have in place\nthe Apprendi rule as it has been construed in McMillan\nand in Harris, but that this is a -- a very different\nextension of that rule beyond anything that this Court\nhas addressed in these cases.\nAnd it's an extension that doesn't have the\nsame historic support that the Apprendi rule has. So I\ndon't think that this Court needs to -- certainly this\nCourt doesn't need to consider what impact this would\nhave except for, I think, in accepting the Oregon\nSupreme Court holding. That to me does raise questions\nabout the ongoing validity of McMillan and Harris. And\n-- and again, there are ways that you could certainly\ndistinguish that and retain those. But what it does is\nto focus more on the jury as factfinder instead of\nfocusing on what the jury's historic role was and the\nSixth Amendment as a reservation of the power that the\njury has, not somehow giving the jury additional power\nbeyond what it has whenever factfinding is involved that\nis -- is related to a defendant's aggregate punishment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And, of course, it's part\nof your position that historically sentences were always\nconsecutive, if you go way back.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But, Your Honor, in the older\ncases we actually do find that they were -- there was\ndiscretion for the judge to have the sentences be served\nconcurrently. It was viewed as in some ways not giving\nfull effect to the jury's verdict of finding the\ndefendant guilty for multiple offenses, which\nconsecutive sentencing did give full effect to that\nverdict.\nAnd so it was in the nature really of a\nmitigation that the judge could do to lessen the\nseverity of the punishment based on certain facts that\nthe judge would consider and then in simply exercising\nthe judge's discretion.\nBut what is important here, I think, is that\nit was clearly something for the judge to decide. Once\nthere were the multiple convictions, the jury's role was\nat an end, and it was then up to the judge to make the\ndetermination about how to administer those multiple\nsentences. And so long as we are not changing the\njury's role in establishing that sentence for each of\nthe -- the six convictions in this case, then we have\nnot removed from the jury anything that would have been\nincorporated within the Sixth Amendment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What happens with\nsentences from multiple States? You commit the crime in\nState A; you flee. You are then tried and found guilty\nof a second crime in State B. I -- I -- let's assume\nthat the judge in State B has considerable discretion as\nto whether or not he intends to impose a sentence in B\nor send back to A, and that he knows that A is going to\nbe concurrent.\nUnder the theory of the case that's\nadvocated by the Respondents, do you think that a jury\ntrial or some sort of finding would be required?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think that if the -- the\nlaw required the sentences be concurrent unless\nadditional factfindings were made, then under the -- the\nrule announced by the Oregon Supreme Court and advocated\nby Respondent that question would have to then go to the\njury even if it arises in -- basically in separate\nproceedings.\nSo as you are sentencing in that separate,\nsecond proceeding, it would still be a jury question of\nwhether those facts were -- were there that would allow\nthe judge to impose a consecutive sentence.\nThe Oregon statute treats that a little bit\ndifferently. It appears to give the judge discretion\nwhen there is a previously imposed judgment. Other\nStates do it differently, though, and do require\nfactfinding even in those circumstances when there has\nbeen a judgment imposed in an entirely separate\nproceeding. And if I could reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Lannet.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST G. LANNET\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LANNET: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents yet another application\nof the bright-line rule from Apprendi. Oregon law\nentitles a criminal defendant to a concurrent sentence\nfor each offense unless certain facts are found. Here\nfor three offenses a judge found those facts and imposed\na greater penalty of a consecutive sentence. That\nviolated defendant's -- or the Sixth Amendment's jury-\ntrial guarantee that the judge's authority to impose\ncriminal punishment must be limited by the facts solely\nfound by the jury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lannet, there --\nthere is one significant difference, I think, between --\nthe-- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State\nlabels something a \"sentencing factor\" or an \"element.\"\nEvery one of those questions that goes into determining\nthe maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury\nunder Apprendi.\nBut when it comes to consecutive versus\nconcurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our\nmain rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are\ncertain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent. Or\nit leaves the total things to the discretion of the\njudge.\nAnd if we are looking at it from the point\nof view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not\ngoing to make it totally discretionary because we want\nto be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting\ncertain restraints on the judge. So it seems -- what\nseems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment\nis supposed to protect the defendant's right. And here\nthe State is saying, we want to give the defendant more\nof a right. And he can say, that's unconstitutional,\nbut if you give me less of a right, it would be\nperfectly constitutional.\nIt's that enigma that I think is very\ndisturbing about this case.\nMR. LANNET: Well, two points on that. One\nof them is that historically the jury trial -- the jury\nfound the verdict of guilt. That, in itself, authorized\nthe potential penalty of a very significant consecutive\nsentence.\nOregon has made a different policy choice\nhere. And, to understand the full backdrop of it,\nperhaps the context, that before this Oregon -- before\nit had this statutory system in place, it had very\nliberal rules regarding merger. This was part of a\nseries of enactments in which antimerger provisions were\nenacted so the defendant's criminal history would\nrepresent more accurately the number of convictions the\njury had found him guilty of.\nTherefore, the defendants under -- in Oregon\nlaw the defendant must receive a separate sentence for\neach offense. So the increased number of sentences gave\nrise to the possibility of longer sentences through\nconsecutive sentencing. Because in Oregon not only does\nan offense give rise to a discrete sentence, but whether\nthe -- the sentence is concurrent or consecutive is an\naspect of punishment for that offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In Oregon traditionally if\na burglar had broken into a house and while he was in\nthe house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that\nwould not be considered two crimes?\nMR. LANNET: At a certain point in time\nthere were judicial rules in place regarding merger that\nmay have resulted in the entry of one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you cite me an Oregon\ncase which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape\nis only guilty of one crime?\nMR. LANNET: I would be happy to submit some\nin a memorandum. I would need another day to do so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lannet, in -- in\nconnection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you\nthink that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute\nwhich, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime\ncommitted with a firearm, said that the penalty will be\n30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not\ncommit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will\nbe 15 years?\nDo you think if the -- if the statute were\nframed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we\nwould leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been\nused or not?\nMR. LANNET: I certainly it would raise an\nissue about whether -- a different statutory\ninterpretation, of course, that if the State was merely\nshifting a burden on a fact to the defendant to\ndisprove, I think that that would run into problems with\nthis Court's due process -- case law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, regardless of who\nproved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the\njudge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent\ndetermination that he did not use a firearm could be\nleft to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?\nMR. LANNET: I think it would be very likely\nif this Court looked at this State's interpretation of\nthe statute and found that the -- that the judge had no\nauthority to impose the greater sentence?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see a dime's worth\nof difference between that and Apprendi.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How are you to prove these?\nI am always curious as to the defense policy as to why.\nStricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time\nfiguring out why. If you have an actual case and you\nhave to go to trial, are you prepared to put on all the\nevidence that although you want to say that your client\ndid neither of these things, that if he did do them, in\nfact they were just one thing and weren't separate\nthings? I mean are you prepared to go into all that\ndetail in front of the jury?\nMR. LANNET: Well, again I think there would\nbe a question about whether that would be proper, if\nthat would be in fact shifting an element over to the\ndefendant to disprove. I think that that would\ncreate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, you are saying that the\nstandard they use here for a separate sentencing, that\nit has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to\nthe jury.\nMR. LANNET: Yes, sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So I wonder if you\nare prepared to put all those facts before the jury,\nsay, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my\ndefendant who did it.\nMR. LANNET: Well, actually, Your Honor, a\ndecision affirming the Oregon Supreme Court at this\npoint would have little impact in Oregon. In response\nto Blakely, the Oregon legislature enacted a statutory\nscheme that gave back that enhanced sentence -- gave a\nprocedure by which they go to the jury, and it's either\n-- and in a bifurcated proceeding that's ---\nJUSTICE BREYER: That way, you have to\nhave two --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Booker/Fanfan as well, as\nadopted, right? I mean that was what the dissenters in\nBooker/Fanfan would have --\nMR. LANNET: Yes. Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying it would\nhave to be a bifurcated proceeding?\nMR. LANNET: In many instances, just based\non --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there historic evidence\nthat bifurcated proceedings were required before\nApprendi?\nMR. LANNET: No, but I think that this is\njust a development of changing legislative choices in\nidentifying facts. I think Apprendi articulated the\nfunctional path to determine the scope of a jury\ntrial guarantee when the State attempts to relegate a\nfact to a judge rather than a jury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I get back to\nthe question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi. Is it\n-- is it your position that if the offense, based on all\nfacts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of\n30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could\ndetermine that if a firearm was not used in the offense,\nyou would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a\nproblem under Apprendi?\nMR. LANNET: In Apprendi I am not sure\nthat -- that -- I mean it's a question of whether all\nthe facts have been found by the -- by the jury\nauthorize the maximum punishment. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then it does. All\nthe facts authorize a punishment of 30 years. And if\nit's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge. But\nI would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't\ninterpose a jury between the defendant and the State\nwith respect to every element, but only those elements\nthat increase the punishment.\nMR. LANNET: Well, the potential penalty the\ndefendant faces -- and I think that if the penalty of\nwhether a gun is present or whether a gun is not\npresent, assuming that that would be enacted by a\nlegislature, I think that as long as -- I mean the core\nquestion in Apprendi has been is the judge imposing a\npenalty within the range authorized by the jury verdict.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The core question is is the\ndefendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a\ncertain penalty if a particular fact is found.\nMR. LANNET: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the answer would be,\nyes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't\nuse a gun to get a lesser penalty. And once you bring\nin the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it\nmeans that it has to be found by the jury.\nMR. LANNET: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in addition, it must be\ntrue too that the defendant is entitled not to pay\nrestitution if the facts show that there was no money\ntaken. And you needn't, by the way, convict the person.\nYou can convict him without finding that.\nSo the same would be true of restitution.\nWe would have another jury to decide restitution,\nanother thing that has never been done; is that right?\nMR. LANNET: Well, if only because the\nlegislative scheme in place doesn't give the court\nauthority to impose restitutions based solely on the\njury's verdict.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, couldn't impose\nrestitution without making a finding as to how much\nmoney was taken. So I don't -- I don't -- I can't\nimagine the legislature --\nMR. LANNET: The Oregon appellate court\ndoesn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. The Federal\ncourts have not and I guess the same rule would apply.\nOr what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug --\nagain, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with\nanother jury being impanelled to try the question of\nwhether there was a car; is that right?\nMR. LANNET: If -- if it was a fact that was\nnecessary for the punishment, I think that follows\nwithin the rule of Apprendi.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a punishment.\nMR. LANNET: Although in Apprendi there was\na concern about elements being shifted from --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe not. Maybe it would\njust be an in rem proceeding. What about the -- what\nabout the proceeding -- what about the determination\nthat a person who is going to trial goes to an adult\ncourt rather than a juvenile court, the difference being\nthe extent of the punishment? You are not entitled\nto -- a complete defense to the punishments that they\ncould impose. Do you see where I am going?\nMR. LANNET: I believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure which of these\nthings would actual follow from your rule and which\nwouldn't.\nMR. LANNET: I think legislatively that the\ngeneral statutes would set the maximum penalty as being\npunished as an adult and the juvenile system would be a\ndifferent type of system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they will say no one\ncan get this lower punishment for the juvenile system\nunless the person is indeed a juvenile. Who makes that\nfactual finding?\nMR. LANNET: Well, Your Honor, the bright-\nline rule of Apprendi as it applies in the sentencing in\nthis case is a question of what the judge can impose in\na proceeding that was initiated --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we are going to depart\nfrom what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind\nof case and we do accept Apprendi as something different\nfrom what they did apply, does that require us to depart\nas well in all these other cases which have the kinds of\ndifferences that you have listened to?\nMR. LANNET: I believe that this Court\nalready has. For instance, in Greene, under common\nlaw a defendant who committed a capital offense was\nsubject to the death penalty and it was only upon -- and\nthe trial court would get to exercise discretion whether\nto impose it. The Arizona legislature identified those\nfacts and said, we are not trying to shift elements to\nthe jury, these were never questions for the jury, but\nrather we are only merely trying to guide the court's\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a rather\nbroad question?\nMR. LANNET: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In Apprendi the opinions\nwere rather lengthy and discussed precedents at great\nlength. Justice Thomas's opinion was quite scholarly\nand I discussed a lot of old cases. If this case that\nwe have today had arisen before Apprendi was decided,\nwhat case would you have supporting your position?\nMR. LANNET: I believe I would have Jones v.\nthe United States and I think that it would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't hear that.\nMR. LANNET: Jones, where the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Jones --\nMR. LANNET: Jones v. the United States,\nwhere this Court interpreted this as a matter of\nconstitutional balance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if it had arisen\nbefore Jones?\nMR. LANNET: Then I think that it would --\nthat this Court, if it engaged in the historical\nanalysis it did and see that, yes --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then the historical\nanalysis was to prove citation to what cases?\nMR. LANNET: I believe the cases that were\ncited -- I don't think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All the cases in Apprendi\ndealt with elements of the crime and that sort of thing.\nMR. LANNET: Yes. But this Court looked at\nthat practice and decided that what was not at issue was\nthe legislative identified elements as being found by\nthe jury, rather the underlying concern, the core\nconcern, the position that this Court thought that the\nframers wanted to enshrine in the Sixth Amendment is\nthat the judge's authority to punish is both created and\nlimited by the factual findings of a jury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if under the\nlaw the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a\ndetermination of where the defendant should be sent,\nwhich facility, based on determination of which one has\nthe most room. Is that a determination that has to be\nmade by the jury?\nMR. LANNET: I believe that that -- that can\nbe distinguished, because it was would be a\ndetermination not based on punishment and not to impose\na punishment on defendant. However, if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if one was, you\nknow, the most horrendous prison in history and the\nother was one of -- a country club?\nMR. LANNET: No, I believe this Court has\nrepeatedly stated in -- in downstream like decisions\nafter convictions that whenever someone was convicted of\nan offense and sentenced to incarceration by executive\nagency, you are subject to the policies of that agency\nand there may be certain due process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but here in my\nhypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the\nsentence. It's just like you've got to, you know, make\nrestitution, you are not eligible for parole, you are\ngoing to this place rather than that place.\nMR. LANNET: Well, this Court has identified\na bright line rule that it's not the particular of the\nfact whether it would be something that would be\nhistorically found by the jury, but rather a fact that\nfunctions to increase punishment. I think I have\ntrouble with the hypothetical saying that the\ndifferent -- the different classification is sent to a\ndifferent institution is intended as a punishment and\nnot within the operations of the -- of the incarceration\ninstitution overall.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lannet, if we agree\nwith your position and let's say you are engaged by the\nOregon legislature and they say to you: We don't want\nto make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what\ncan we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying\nto achieve, that is to say encourage as the main\nrule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the\njudge's discretion but we want to rein in that\ndiscretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences\ngoing from one judge to another?\nThey want -- they want to say, yeah, we\nwanted this to be discretionary with the judge, but we\nwant to install certain controls so that the trial\njudges will be operating more or less uniformly. How\ncould they do that constitutionally?\nMR. LANNET: I think they could do as they\nare doing in what this Court has decided is juries are\nfinding those facts, and that a trial court does not\nhave to impose a consecutive sentence. Rather --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The juries are find --\nthat's what is going on now, the juries are part of this\ntrial of guilt?\nMR. LANNET: If ordering the bifurcated\nproceeding much the way the aggravating factors under\nOregon's guidelines assumes everything handles in the\nwake of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is it? Do they do\nit in the guilt trial or leave that up to the judge?\nMR. LANNET: It falls into the condition of\nwhat is defined as offense-related or offender-related\nfactors. I think that these would come in as offense\nrelated and probably be in the main trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where a defense\nattorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.\nMR. LANNET: Well, this Court has observed\nrepeatedly that -- that the right to a jury trial is one\nthat can be waived, and so the defendants have the\nopportunity to not exercise those rights. This is just\nthat -- it's a right for the defendant but it's a\nconstitutional role that this Court has identified as\nbeing the jury role in our system. It -- it both\nauthorizes, gives the arbiter authority to impose\npunishment and also sets the maximum.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the -- what\nif the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent\nunless the defendant has been convicted of a prior\nfederal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive\nto the federal sentence?\nMR. LANNET: Well, if that was -- if the\nAlmendarez-Torres prior conviction exception is a Sixth\nAmendment issue, which the Court has stated that it is,\nthen I believe that there would not be required a jury\nfinding, much like if the legislature identified facts\nthat would be reflected in the jury's verdict, or\nreverted back to the common law rule which gave the\ntrial court authority to impose consecutive sentences\nmerely on the basis of if there was a conviction. I\nthink that the facts identified by the Oregon\nlegislature here are quite different than what would\nqualify as the Almendarez-Torres exception. That\nexception -- the basis that it has if we rationalize\nconsistence with the rule is that a fact of a prior\nconviction has already been established in accordance\nwith the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. These are\nfacts about the offense for which a consecutive sentence\nis contemplated. So, these are facts about the event\nthat is being litigated at that moment. And the Oregon\nlegislature has predicated the greater penalty of a\nconsecutive sentence on those facts, and precedence\ninstructs that when the legislature does so, the\ndefendant has a right to have a jury find that fact\nbeyond a unreasonable doubt before the State can rely it\non and impose that greater penalty.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Lannet, one of the --\nor perhaps the driving force behind Apprendi was the\nfear of abuse by a combination of the charging power and\nthe sentencing power. What abuse do you see if -- if\nyou lose this case? What potential abuse?\nMR. LANNET: Well, I think that it would\nsend a message to legislatures that they can enact\nstatutory schemes that have -- that allow for many\ninstances where consecutive sentences are authorized\nbased on the facts and that those facts do not implicate\na Apprendi role, and therefore is a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That it would --\nMR. LANNET: Yes. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I didn't mean to\ninterrupt.\nMR. LANNET: To set maximum punishment based\non consecutiveness rather than, as they were doing under\nthe guideline system, by allowing a range and requiring\nfacts to exceed that range.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They -- they would do by\nconsecutive sentencing the same sort of thing that they\nwere trying to do or some legislatures, Congress was\ntrying to do by the sentencing factors?\nMR. LANNET: I believe there's at least a\ngreat possibility of that, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any room for\nharmless error here? I mean, it seems to me patently\nobvious that both of the statutory conditions were fully\nsatisfied. It was within -- put it within the\ndiscretion of the judge.\nMR. LANNET: Well, I think this Court should\nnot find those errors harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\nfor several reasons: First, the State has the burden of\nproof that it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and\nhas not attempted to do before the Oregon courts, the\nappellate courts; it has not done so before this Court.\nI think the Oregon Supreme Court necessarily concluded\nthat this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, is there any doubt\nthat he wanted to commit an offense twice?\nMR. LANNET: I think that praises an issue\nof statutory interpretation. I think that that is one\nof the issues --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But statutory\ninterpretation questions aren't for the jury.\nMR. LANNET: You are right, Your Honor, but\nthey are the ones for the Oregon Supreme Court in this\ninstance, and the Oregon Supreme Court narrowly\nconcluded that the findings of the jury found -- did not\nestablish the factual predicate to impose consecutive\nsentences; however, they did not go into a comprehensive\nanalysis of what precisely those facts are, and in fact\nthe State -- the Petitioner here is actively litigating\nthe meaning of the statutory provisions at this point.\nSo it really is unclear what precisely are the facts\nmeant by this -- by the statutory terms.\nI think it would put this Court in a\nposition to interpret the State statute in the first\ninstance, and disagree with the Oregon Supreme Court's\nimplicit conclusion, because it's under a State\nconstitutional requirement and also this Court's\nrequirement that it cannot reverse a lower court unless\nit concludes that an error is harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It held as far as the\nState constitution went, this is fine. It's only the\nFederal Constitution that stops the legislature from\ndoing this.\nMR. LANNET: Yes, I would acknowledge that\nthere is no analysis in the written decision, and that\nis part of the problem because it didn't identify the\nparticular facts and conduct a harmless error analysis\nfor the benefit of this Court.\nHowever, the court heard this case with a --\nin a consolidated argument with State v. Gray, in which\nit did address the State's harmless error argument and\nrecognized that, in Washington v. Recuenco, this Court\nhad said that a -- is subject to harmless error\nanalysis.\nSo, I think necessary in the Oregon Supreme\nCourt reversing the lower court's decision is that\nconclusion that this error was not harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. And subsequent to this case, the\nOregon Supreme Court decided State versus Hagburn -- and\nI have a citation for that, if you like. It's -- and\nthat is identified -- it addresses the State's harmless\nerror question. The citation is 345 Or. 161, and that's\nregional reporter 190 P.3d 1209. And in that case we\nhad sexual offenses arising out of the same general\nfactual scenario, where a young victim testified that\nshe was abused in two different rooms on two different\ndays, and the Oregon Supreme Court said there is no\nfactual default in our consecutive sentencing system\nthat let -- the jury was not decided that this occurred\nduring the same criminal episode or during a separate\ncriminal episode. And in light of the vague testimony\nby the victim, they could not conclude that a jury would\nhave found that.\nSo I believe that the -- that to the extent\nthat the Oregon court has analyzed the statute, that I\nthink that it would -- it backs up the conclusion that\nit found this not to be harmless beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One way of -- if you are\nright about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon\nlegislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to\nthe judge's discretion. However, before the judge makes\na sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of\nthe following factors. That would be okay?\nMR. LANNET: I believe so, if that kind of\nstatutory provision was interpreted like you are\nsuggesting, that the court has authority based solely on\nthe jury's verdict and is merely exercising its\ndiscretion and there is no requisite factfinding or the\n-- even the requirement to find a fact to impose a\nconsecutive sentence, then I think it wouldn't praise an\nApprendi issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No entitlement to a lesser\nsentence?\nMR. LANNET: No entitlement to a lesser\nsentence, Your Honor. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if it's subject\nto judicial review for judicial review for abuse of\ndiscretion?\nMR. LANNET: I believe so. I think that\nthis Court has --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't give\nyou an entitlement to that, to the exercise of\ndiscretion that isn't abused?\nMR. LANNET: Not an entitlement that is\nbased solely on the facts found by the jury's verdict.\nI don't believe it would.\nUltimately, this case was just an\napplication of the Apprendi rule. The State asked this\nCourt to replace that bright-line functional rule with\nsome yet unidentified criteria for identifying\nconstitutionally protected elements. It hasn't really\noffered this Court with any suggestion of what those\nconstitutionally protected elements are except to say\nthat that fact at issue in this statute are not those.\nAt a minimum the State asks for an exception to the\nApprendi rule based on historical reasoning about an\nallegation that this was only meant to control the\ndiscretion of the sentencing court and it didn't shift\nany elements. And that kind of argument was explicitly\nrejected in Blakely, Booker, and Cunningham. The Oregon\nLegislature authorized consecutive sentence as greater\npenalty only for offenses committed under certain\nfactual circumstances. Those facts, not the jury -- not\nfound by the jury -- increase the defendant's penalty\nfrom 7-1/2 years to over 28 years.\nAffirming the decision below would adhere\nthe bright-line rule in Apprendi and it would preserve\nthe jury's role in finding each fact that authorizes the\nmaximum punishment. Thank you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Counsel, don't -- well, the\ncase that I mentioned on my account. I'm thinking about\nit -- it's not going to make any difference.\nMR. LANNET: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Williams. You\nhave four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. WILLIAMS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWhat the State is advocating for here is not\nan abandonment or a modification of the Apprendi rule,\nbut a limitation of the Apprendi rule to the cases in\nwhich this -- the circumstances in which this Court has\napplied it so far. The Apprendi rule has been applied\nas a bright-line test for deciding when a sentence for a\nspecific condition has satisfied the Sixth Amendment.\nAnd the way it operates is the rule itself tells us what\nare the necessary facts that the jury must find, and so\nthere doesn't need to be a new rule to determine what\nare those constitutionally protected facts. The\nApprendi rule does that for us by saying that any fact\nthat exposes a defendant in a particular conviction and\nsentence to a greater penalty based on -- that -- based\non a fact that the jury has not found, is the functional\nequivalent of an element if we had looked historically\nat what the jury's role was. And so, therefore, that\nadditional factfinding, if it exposes the defendant to a\n-- a longer penalty, a greater penalty for a specific\nconviction, it must be found by the jury. And that is\nhow the Court has applied the rule to this point.\nSo all we are asking is that the Court\nclarify that that is the full scope of the Apprendi\nrule. And the reason for that is again, going back to\nwhat this Court said in Blakely, that the Sixth\nAmendment is only a reservation of jury power. And here\nwhat we have here is something that is entirely a\njudicial determination -- that historically has always\nbeen a judicial determination -- and the only overlay we\nnow have is a legislative effort to regulate that\njudicial authority through the mechanism of requiring\nfactfinding.\nIt's something that the legislature often\ndoes, is to try to regulate judicial discretion by\nrequiring factfinding and by limiting the kinds of facts\nthe judge may consider. And that's what is being done\nin this case without removing anything from the purview\nof the jury. And so we would ask that this Court\nreverse the Oregon Supreme Court. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
